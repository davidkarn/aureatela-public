Since he indeed died in the spirit through ungodliness, but certainly did not die in the flesh: yet both persuaded us to ungodliness, and thereby brought it to pass that we deserved to come into the death of the flesh. We desired therefore the one through wicked persuasion, the other followed us by a just condemnation; and therefore it is written, \"God made not death,\"[fn-9-P915_349358:71-nf] since He was not Himself the cause of death; but yet death was inflicted on the sinner, through His most just retribution. Just as the judge inflicts punishment on the guilty; yet it is not the justice of the judge, but the desert of the crime, which is the cause of the punishment.Whither, then, the mediator of death caused us to pass, yet did not come himself, that is, to the death of the flesh, there our Lord God introduced for us the medicine of correction, which He deserved not, by a hidden and exceeding mysterious decree of divine and profound justice. In order, therefore, that as by one man came death, so by one man might come also the resurrection of the dead;[fn-9-P916_350052:72-nf] because men strove more to shun that which they could not shun, viz. the death of the flesh, than the death of the spirit, i.e. punishment more than the desert of punishment (for not to sin is a thing about which either men are not solicitous or are too little solicitous; but not to die, although it be not within reach of attainment, is yet eagerly sought after); the Mediator of life, making it plain that death is not to be feared, which by the condition of humanity cannot now be escaped, but rather ungodliness, which can be guarded against through faith, meets us at the end to which we have come, but not by the way by which we came. For we, indeed, came to death through sin;He through righteousness: and, therefore, as our death is the punishment of sin, so His death was made a sacrifice for sin.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"29. As, therefore, the Father begat, the Son is begotten; so the Father sent, the Son was sent. But in like manner as He who begat and He who was begotten, so both He who sent and He who was sent, are one, since the Father and the Son are one.[fn-9-P985_386032:111-nf] So also the Holy Spirit is one with them, since these three are one. For as to be born, in respect to the Son, means to be from the Father; so to be sent, in respect to the Son, means to be known to be from the Father. And as to be the gift of God in respect to the Holy Spirit, means to proceed from the Father; so to be sent, is to be known to proceed from the Father. Neither can we say that the Holy Spirit does not also proceed from the Son, for the same Spirit is not without reason said to be the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son.[fn-9-P986_386597:112-nf] Nor do I see what else He intended to signify, when He breathed on the face of the disciples, and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P987_386852:113-nf] For that bodily breathing, proceeding from the body with the feeling of bodily touching, was not the substance of the Holy Spirit, but a declaration by a fitting sign, that the Holy Spirit proceeds not only from the Father, but also from the Son. For the veriest of madmen would not say, that it was one Spirit which He gave when He breathed on them, and another which He sent after His ascension.[fn-9-P988_387270:114-nf] For the Spirit of God is one, the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, the Holy Spirit, who worketh all in all.[fn-9-P989_387403:115-nf] But that He was given twice was certainly a significant economy, which we will discuss in its place, as far as the Lord may grant. That then which the Lord says,-\"Whom I will send unto you from the Father,\"[fn-9-P990_387633:116-nf] -shows the Spirit to be both of the Father and of the Son; because, also, when He had said, \"Whom the Father will send,\" He added also, \"in my name.\"[fn-9-P991_387803:117-nf] Yet He did not say, Whom the Father will send from me, as He said, \"Whom Iwill send unto you from the Father,\"-showing, namely, that the Father is the beginning (principium) of the whole divinity, or if it is better so expressed, deity.[fn-9-P992_388061:118-nf] He, therefore, who proceeds from the Father and from the Son, is referred back to Him from whom the Son was born (natus). And that which the evangelist says, \"For the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified;\"[fn-9-P993_389484:119-nf] how is this to be understood, unless because the special giving or sending of the Holy Spirit after the glorification of Christ was to be such as it had never been before? For it was not previously none at all, but it had not been such as this. For if the Holy Spirit was not given before, wherewith were the prophets who spoke filled? Whereas the Scripture plainly says, and shows in many places, that they spake by the Holy Spirit. Whereas, also, it is said of John the Baptist, \"And he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.\" And his father Zacharias is found to have been filled with the Holy Ghost, so as to say such things of him. And Mary, too, was filled with the Holy Ghost, so as to foretell such things of the Lord, whom she was bearing in her womb.[fn-9-P994_390293:120-nf] And Simeon and Anna were filled with the Holy Spirit, so as to acknowledge the greatness of the little child Christ.[fn-9-P995_390437:121-nf] How, then, was \"the Spirit not yet given, since Jesus was not yet glorified,\" unless because that giving, or granting, or mission of the Holy Spirit was to have a certain speciality of its own in its very advent, such as never was before? For we read nowhere that men spoke in tongues which they did not know, through the Holy Spirit coming upon them; as happened then, when it was needful that His coming should be made plain by visible signs, in order to show that the whole world, and all nations constituted with different tongues, should believe in Christ through the gift of the Holy Spirit, to fulfill that which is sung in the Psalm, \"There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard; their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"[fn-9-P996_391256:122-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"1 Thus, under the influence of heavenly power, and with the divine co-operation, the doctrine of the Saviour, like the rays of the sun, quickly illumined the whole world;[fn-10-P1018_493550:51-nf] and straightway, in accordance with the divine Scriptures,[fn-10-P1019_494082:52-nf] the voice of the inspired evangelists and apostles went forth through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.","title":"Book II.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":19,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"11 But Vespasian did not rule the whole world, but only that part of it which was subject to the Romans.

For this writing in the heart is effected by renovation, although it had not been completely blotted out by the old nature. For just as that image of God is renewed in the mind of believers by the new testament, which impiety had not quite abolished (for there had remained undoubtedly that which the soul of man cannot be except it be rational), so also the law of God, which had not been wholly blotted out there by unrighteousness, is certainly written thereon, renewed by grace. Now in the Jews the law which was written on tables could not effect this new inscription, which is justification, but only transgression. For they too were men, and there was inherent in them that power of nature, which enables the rational soul both to perceive and do what is lawful; but the godliness which transfers to another life happy and immortal has \"a spotless law, converting souls,\"[fn-16-P1647_751890:244-nf] so that by the light thereof they may be renewed, and that be accomplished in them which is written, \"There has been manifested over us, O Lord, the light of Thy countenance.\"[fn-16-P1648_752085:245-nf] Turned away from which, they have deserved to grow old, whilst they are incapable of renovation except by the grace of Christ,-in other words, without the intercession of the Mediator; there being \"one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all.\"[fn-16-P1649_752406:246-nf] Should those be strangers to His grace of whom we are treating, and who (after the manner of which we have spoken with sufficient fulness already) \"do by nature the things contained in the law,\"[fn-16-P1650_752625:247-nf] of what use will be their \"excusing thoughts\" to them \"in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men,\"[fn-16-P1651_752753:248-nf] unless it be perhaps to procure for them a milder punishment? For as, on the one hand, there are certain venial sins which do not hinder the righteous man from the attainment of eternal life, and which are unavoidable in this life, so, on the other hand, there are some good works which are of no avail to an ungodly man towards the attainment of everlasting life, although it would be very difficult to find the life of any very bad man whatever entirely without them. But inasmuch as in the kingdom of God the saints differ in glory as one star does from another,[fn-16-P1652_753343:249-nf] so likewise, in the condemnation of everlasting punishment, it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that other city;[fn-16-P1653_753487:250-nf] whilst some men will be twofold more the children of hell than others.[fn-16-P1654_753577:251-nf] Thus in the judgment of God not even this fact will be without its influence,-that one man will have sinned more, or less, than another, even when both are involved in the ungodliness that is worthy of damnation.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_16_book_viii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"13.

For the elder, Cain, offered gifts to God from the fruit of the earth; but the younger son, Abel, from the fruit of his ewes. \"God had respect unto Abel, and unto his gifts; but unto Cain and unto his gifts He had not respect. And God said unto Cain, Why is thy countenance fallen? hast thou not-if thou offerest indeed aright, but dost not divide aright-sinned? Hold thy peace. For unto thee shall thy conversion be and he shall lord it over thee. And then Cain said unto Abel his brother, Let us go into the field: and he went away with him thither, and he slew him. And then God said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper? To whom God said, The voice of the blood of thy brother crieth forth unto me from the earth. Wherefore cursed is the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother. Groaning and trembling shalt thou be upon the earth, and every one who shall have found thee shall slay thee.\"[fn-21-P2116_719963:73-nf] From this proceeding we gather that the twofold sacrifices of \"the peoples\" were even from the very beginning foreshown. In short, when the sacerdotal law was being drawn up, through Moses, in Leviticus, we find it prescribed to the people of Israel that sacrifices should in no other place be offered to God than in the land of promise; which the Lord God was about to give to \"the people\" Israel and to their brethren, in order that, on Israel's introduction thither, there should there be celebrated sacrifices and holocausts, as well for sins as for souls; and nowhere else but in the holy land.[fn-21-P2117_720711:74-nf] Why, accordingly, does the Spirit afterwards predict, through the prophets, that it should come to pass that in every place and in every land there should be offered sacrifices to God? as He says through the angel Malachi, one of the twelve prophets: \"I will not receive sacrifice from your hands; for from the rising sun unto the setting my Name hath been made famous among all the nations, saith the Lord Almighty: and in every place they offer clean sacrifices to my Name.\"[fn-21-P2118_721230:75-nf] Again, in the Pslams, David says: \"Bring to God, ye countries of the nations\"-undoubtedly because \"unto every land\" the preaching of the apostles had to \"go out\"[fn-21-P2119_721425:76-nf] -\"bring to God fame and honour; bring to God the sacrifices of His name: take up[fn-21-P2120_721639:77-nf] victims and enter into His courts.\"[fn-21-P2121_721724:78-nf] For that it is not by earthly sacrifices, but by spiritual, that offering is to be made to God, we thus read, as it is written, An heart contribulate and humbled is a victim for God; \"[fn-21-P2122_721987:79-nf] and elsewhere, \"Sacrifice to God a sacrifice of praise, and render to the Highest thy vows.\"[fn-21-P2123_722117:80-nf] Thus, accordingly, the spiritual \"sacrifices of praise\" are pointed to, and \"an heart contribulate\" is demonstrated an acceptable sacrifice to God. And thus, as carnal sacrifices are understood to be reprobated-of which Isaiah withal speaks, saying, \"To what end is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the Lord\"[fn-21-P2124_722471:81-nf] -so spiritual sacrifices are predicted[fn-21-P2125_722527:82-nf] as accepted, as the prophets announce. For, \"even if ye shall have brought me,\" He says, \"the finest wheat flour, it is a vain supplicatory gift: a thing execrable to me; \"and again He says, \"Your holocausts and sacrifices, and the fat of goats, and blood of bulls, I will not, not even if ye come to be seen by me: for who hath required these things from your hands? \"[fn-21-P2126_722918:83-nf] for \"from the rising sun unto the setting, my Name hath been made famous among all the nations, saith the Lord.\"[fn-21-P2127_723081:84-nf] But of the spiritual sacrifices He adds, saying, \"And in every place they offer dean sacrifices to my Name, saith the Lord.\"[fn-21-P2128_723233:85-nf] ","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Therefore upon this issue plant we foot to foot, whether the Christ who was constantly announced as to come be already come, or whether His coming be yet a subject of hope. For proof of which question itself, the times likewise must be examined by us when the prophets announced that the Christ would come; that, if we succeed in recognising that He has come within the limits of those times, we may without doubt believe Him to be the very one whose future coming was ever the theme of prophetic song, upon whom we-the nations, to wit-were ever announced as destined to believe; and that, when it shall have been agreed that He is come, we may undoubtedly likewise believe that the new law has by Him been given, and not disavow the new testament in Him and through Him drawn up for us. For that Christ was to come we know that even the Jews do not attempt to disprove, inasmuch as it is to His advent that they are directing their hope. Nor need we inquire at more length concerning that matter, since in days bygone all the prophets have prophesied of it; as Isaiah: \"Thus saith the Lord God to my Christ (the) Lord,[fn-21-P2143_727145:93-nf] whose right hand I have holden, that the nations may hear Him: the powers of kings will I burst asunder; I will open before Him the gates, and the cities shall not be closed to Him.\" Which very thing we see fulfilled. For whose right hand does God the Father hold but Christ's, His Son?-whom all nations have heard, that is, whom all nations have believed,-whose preachers, withal, the apostles, are pointed to in the Psalms of David: \"Into the universal earth,\" says he, \"is gone out their sound, and unto the ends of the earth their words.\"[fn-21-P2144_727961:94-nf] For upon whom else have the universal nations believed, but upon the Christ who is already come? For whom have the nations believed,-Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and they who inhabit Mesopotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, Cappadocia, and they who dwell in Pontus, and Asia, and Pamphylia, tarriers in Egypt, and inhabiters of the region of Africa which is beyond Cyrene, Romans and sojourners, yes, and in Jerusalem Jews,[fn-21-P2145_728427:95-nf] and all other nations; as, for instance, by this time, the varied races of the Gµtulians, and manifold confines of the Moors, all the limits of the Spains, and the diverse nations of the Gauls, and the haunts of the Britons-inaccessible to the Romans, but subjugated to Christ, and of the Sarmatians, and Dacians, and Germans, and Scythians, and of many remote nations, and of provinces and islands many, to us unknown, and which we can scarce enumerate? In all which places the name of the Christ who is already come reigns, as of Him before whom the gates of all cities have been opened, and to whom none are closed, before whom iron bars have been crumbled, and brazen gates[fn-21-P2146_729148:96-nf] opened. Although there be withal a spiritual sense to be affixed to these expressions,-that the hearts of individuals, blockaded in various ways by the devil, are unbarred by the faith of Christ,-still they have been evidently fulfilled, inasmuch as in all these places dwells the \"people\" of the Name of Christ. For who could have reigned over all nations but Christ, God's Son, who was ever announced as destined to reign over all to eternity? For if Solomon \"reigned,\" why, it was within the confines of Judea merely: \"from Beersheba unto Dan\" the boundaries of his kingdom are marked.[fn-21-P2147_729806:97-nf] If, moreover, Darius \"reigned\" over the Babylonians and Parthians, he had not power over all nations; if Pharaoh, or whoever succeeded him in his hereditary kingdom, over the Egyptians, in that country merely did he possess his kingdom's dominion; if Nebuchadnezzar with his petty kings, \"from India unto Ethiopia\" he had his kingdom's boundaries;[fn-21-P2148_730567:98-nf] if Alexander the Macedonian he did not hold more than universal Asia, and other regions, after he had quite conquered them; if the Germans, to this day they are not suffered to cross their own limits; the Britons are shut within the circuit of their own ocean; the nations of the Moors, and the barbarism of the Gµtulians, are blockaded by the Romans, lest they exceed the confines of their own regions. What shall I say of the Romans themselves,[fn-21-P2149_731044:99-nf] who fortify their own empire with garrisons of their own legions, nor can extend the might of their kingdom beyond these nations? But Christ's Name is extending everywhere, believed everywhere, worshipped by all the above-enumerated nations, reigning everywhere, adored everywhere, conferred equally everywhere upon all. No king, with Him, finds greater favour, no barbarian lesser joy; no dignities or pedigrees enjoy distinctions of merit; to all He is equal, to all King, to all Judge, to all \"God and Lord.\"[fn-21-P2150_731696:100-nf] Nor would you hesitate to believe what we asseverate, since you see it taking place.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_17_book_ix_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"8.

It is the \"yokes\" of \"works\" that have been rejected, not those of disciplines.[fn-13-P1355_375168:56-nf] \"Liberty in Christ\"[fn-13-P1356_375210:57-nf] has done no injury to innocence. The law of piety, sanctity, humanity, truth, chastity, justice, mercy, benevolence, modesty, remains in its entirety; in which law \"blessed (is) the man who shall meditate by day and by night.\"[fn-13-P1357_375468:58-nf] About that (law) the same David (says) again: \"The law of the Lord (is) unblameable[fn-13-P1358_375576:59-nf] converting souls; the statutes of the Lord (are) direct, delighting hearts; the precept of the Lord far-shining, enlightening eyes.\" Thus, too, the apostle: \"And so the law indeed is holy, and the precept holy and most good\"[fn-13-P1359_375863:60-nf] -\"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" of course. But he had withal said above: \"Are we, then, making void the law through faith? Far be it; but we are establishing the law \"[fn-13-P1360_376068:61-nf] -forsooth in those (points) which, being even now interdicted by the New Testament, are prohibited by an even more emphatic precept: instead of, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" \"Whoever shall have seen with a view to concupiscence, hath already committed adultery in his own heart; \"[fn-13-P1361_376373:62-nf] and instead of, \"Thou shalt not kill,\" \"Whoever shall have said to his brother, Racha, shall be in danger of hell.\"[fn-13-P1362_376511:63-nf] Ask (yourself) whether the law of not committing adultery be still in force, to which has been added that of not indulging concupiscence. Besides, if any precedents (taken from the Old Dispensation) shall favour you in (the secrecy of) your bosom, they shall not be set in opposition to this discipline which we are maintaining. For it is in vain that an additional law has been reared, condemning the origin even of sins-that is, concupiscences and wills-no less than the actual deeds; if the fact that pardon was of old in some cases conceded to adultery is to be a reason why it shall be conceded at the present day. \"What will be the reward attaching to the restrictions imposed upon the more fully developed discipline of the present day, except that the eider (discipline) may be made the agent for granting indulgence to your prostitution? \"In that case, you will grant pardon to the idolater too, and to every apostate, because we find the People itself, so often guilty of these crimes, as often reinstated in their former privileges.

We, too, indeed have precedents in the self-same antiquity on the side of our opinion,-(precedents) of judgment not merely not waived, but even summarily executed upon fornication. And of course it is a sufficient one, that so vast a number-(the number) of 24, 000-of the People, when they committed fornication with the daughters of Madian, fell in one plague.[fn-13-P1368_378811:69-nf] But, with an eye to the glory of Christ, I prefer to derive (my) discipline from Christ. Grant that the pristine days may have had-if the Psychics please-even a right of (indulging) every immodesty; grant that, before Christ, the flesh may have disported itself, nay, may have perished before its Lord went to seek and bring it back: not yet was it worthy of the gift of salvation; not yet apt for the office of sanctity. It was still, up to that time, accounted as being in Adam, with its own vicious nature, easily indulging concupiscence after whatever it had seen to be \"attractive to the sight,\"[fn-13-P1369_379449:70-nf] and looking back at the lower things, and checking its itching with fig-leaves.[fn-13-P1370_379576:71-nf] Universally inherent was the virus of lust-the dregs which are formed out of milk contain it-(dregs) fitted (for so doing), in that even the waters themselves had not yet been bathed.

If without, then it was not their doing. If with, was the will good or bad? If bad, how could a bad will give birth to a good one? If good, then already they had a good will. And who made this will, which already they had, but He who created them with a good will, or with that chaste love by which they cleaved to Him, in one and the same act creating their nature, and endowing it with grace? And thus we are driven to believe that the holy angels never existed without a good will or the love of God. But the angels who, though created good, are yet evil now, became so by their own will. And this will was not made evil by their good nature, unless by its voluntary defection from good; for good is not the cause of evil, but a defection from good is. These angels, therefore, either received less of the grace of the divine love than those who persevered in the same; or if both were created equally good, then, while the one fell by their evil will, the others were more abundantly assisted, and attained to that pitch of blessedness at which they became certain they should never fall from it,-as we have already shown in the preceding book.[fn-20-P2013_1153135:8-nf] We must therefore acknowledge, with the praise due to the Creator, that not only of holy men, but also of the holy angels, it can be said that \"the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto them.\"[fn-20-P2014_1153389:9-nf] And that not only of men, but primarily and principally of angels it is true, as it is written, \"It is good to draw near to God.\"[fn-20-P2015_1153531:10-nf] And those who have this good in common, have, both with Him to whom they draw near, and with one another, a holy fellowship, and form one city of God-His living sacrifice, and His living temple.

For from one man, whom God created as the first, the whole human race descended, according to the faith of Holy Scripture, which deservedly is of wonderful authority among all nations throughout the world; since, among its other true statements, it predicted, by its divine foresight, that all nations would give credit to it.","title":"Book XII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"This,\" says he, \"is another text of theirs: `Who will boast that he has a pure heart?'\"[fn-26-P2653_1046861:157-nf] And then he answered this with several passages, wishing to show that there can be in man a pure heart.

For under the name of \"clean fear\" David signifies that will by which we shall necessarily shrink from sin, and guard against it, not with the anxiety of weakness, which fears that we may strongly sin, but with the tranquillity of perfect love. Or if no kind of fear at all shall exist in that most imperturbable security of perpetual and blissful delights, then the expression, \"The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever,\" must be taken in the same sense as that other, \"The patience of the poor shall not perish for ever\"[fn-24-P2413_1342998:83-nf] For patience, which is necessary only where ills are to be borne, shall not be eternal, but that which patience leads us to will be eternal.

Nay, says some one, he fulfilled the command, when he fled from city to city. For so a certain individual, but a fugitive likewise has chosen to maintain, and others have done the same who are unwilling to understand the meaning of that declaration of the Lord, that they may use it as a cloak for their cowardice, although it has had its persons as well as its times and reasons to which it specially applies. \"When they begin,\" He says, \"to persecute you, flee from city to city,\"[fn-19-P1953_584694:17-nf] We maintain that this belongs specially to the persons of the apostles, and to their times and circumstances, as the following sentences will show, which are suitable only to the apostles: \"Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and into a city of the Samaritans do not enter: but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-19-P1954_585047:18-nf] But to us the way of the Gentiles is also open, as in it we in fact were found, and to the very last we walk; and no city has been excepted. So we preach throughout all the world; nay, no special care even for Israel has been laid upon us, save as also we are bound to preach to all nations, Yes, and if we are apprehended, we shall not be brought into Jewish councils, nor scourged in Jewish synagogues, but we shall certainly be cited before Roman magistrates and judgment-seats.[fn-19-P1955_585546:19-nf] So, then, the circumstances of the apostles even required the injunction to flee, their mission being to preach first to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. That, therefore, this preaching might be fully accomplished in the case of those among whom this behoved first of all to be carried out-that the sons might receive bread before the dogs, for that reason He commanded them to flee then for a time-not with the object of eluding danger, under the plea strictly speaking which persecution urges (rather He was in the habit of proclaiming that they would suffer persecutions, and of teaching that these must be endured); but in order to further the proclamation of the Gospel message, lest by their being at once put down, the diffusion of the Gospel too might be prevented. Neither were they to flee to any city as if by stealth, but as if everywhere about to proclaim their message; and for this, everywhere about to undergo persecutions, until they should fulfil their teaching. Accordingly the Saviour says, \"Ye will not go over all the cities of Israel.\"[fn-19-P1956_586629:20-nf] So the command to flee was restricted to the limits of Judea. But no command that shows Judea to be specially the sphere for preaching applies to us, now that the Holy Spirit has been poured out upon all flesh. Therefore Paul and the apostles themselves, mindful of the precept of the Lord, bear this solemn testimony before Israel, which they had now filled with their doctrine-saying, \"It was necessary that the word of God should have been first delivered to you; but seeing ye have rejected it, and have not thought yourselves worthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.\"[fn-19-P1957_587233:21-nf] And from that time they turned their steps away, as those who went before them had laid it down, and departed into the way of the Gentiles, and entered into the cities of the Samaritans; so that, in very deed, their sound went forth into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.[fn-19-P1958_587547:22-nf] If, therefore, the prohibition against setting foot in the way of the Gentiles, and entering into the cities of the Samaritans, has come to an end, why should not the command to flee, which was issued at the same time, have come also to an end? Accordingly, from the time when, Israel having had its full measure, the apostles went over to the Gentiles, they neither fled from city to city, nor hesitated to suffer. Nay, Paul too, who had submitted to deliverance from persecution by being let down from the wall, as to do so was at this time a matter of command, refused in like manner now at the close of his ministry, and after the injunction had come to an end, to give in to the anxieties of the disciples, eagerly entreating him that he would not risk himself at Jerusalem, because of the sufferings in store for him which Agabus had foretold; but doing the very opposite, it is thus he speaks, \"What do ye, weeping and disquieting my heart? For I could wish not only to suffer bonds, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of my Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-19-P1959_588624:23-nf] And so they all said, \"Let the will of the Lord be done.\" What was the will of the Lord? Certainly no longer to flee from persecution. Otherwise they who had wished him rather to avoid persecution, might also have adduced that prior will of the Lord, in which He had commanded flight. Therefore, seeing even in the days of the apostles themselves, the command to flee was temporary, as were those also relating to the other things at the same time enjoined, that [command] cannot continue with us which ceased with our teachers, even although it had not been issued specially for them; or if the Lord wished it to continue, the apostles did wrong who were not careful to keep fleeing to the last.","title":"IX.

Now, if they were easy, they ought to have been kept by all. But if, to concede you a point, at rare intervals some one may be found able to keep them, it is clear that what is rare is difficult. And by way of supplementing this and displaying the greatness of your own virtues (we are to believe, forsooth, that you bring forth the sentiment out of the treasure of a good conscience), you have a heading to the effect that: \"We ought not to commit even light offences.\" And for fear some one might think you had not explained in the work the meaning of light, you add that, \"We must not even think an evil thought,\" forgetting the words,[fn-74-P7451_2475839:105-nf] \"Who understands his offences?

Cyprian, in the fifty-fourth heading of the third book, lays it down that no one is free from stain and without sin, and he immediately gives proofs, among them the passage in Job,[fn-74-P7448_2474586:102-nf] \"Who is cleansed from uncleanness? Not he who has lived but one day upon the earth.\"[fn-74-P7449_2474690:103-nf] And in the fifty-first Psalm, \"Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" And in the Epistle of John,[fn-74-P7450_2474839:104-nf] \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\" You, on the other hand, maintain that \"A man can be without sin,\" and that you may give your words the semblance of truth, you immediately add, \"And easily keep the commandments of God, if he chooses,\" and yet they have been seldom or never kept by any one. Now, if they were easy, they ought to have been kept by all. But if, to concede you a point, at rare intervals some one may be found able to keep them, it is clear that what is rare is difficult. And by way of supplementing this and displaying the greatness of your own virtues (we are to believe, forsooth, that you bring forth the sentiment out of the treasure of a good conscience), you have a heading to the effect that: \"We ought not to commit even light offences.\" And for fear some one might think you had not explained in the work the meaning of light, you add that, \"We must not even think an evil thought,\" forgetting the words,[fn-74-P7451_2475839:105-nf] \"Who understands his offences?

Some there were who said, \"I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me;\"[fn-36-P3643_1397870:42-nf] and, \"There is no rest in my bones, by reason of my sins;\"[fn-36-P3644_1397945:43-nf] and, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts;\"[fn-36-P3645_1398053:44-nf] and, \"Stablish me with Thy directing Spirit;\"[fn-36-P3646_1398116:45-nf] and, \"Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.\"[fn-36-P3647_1398174:46-nf] There were some, again, who said: \"I believed, therefore have I spoken.\"[fn-36-P3648_1398264:47-nf] For they too were cleansed with the self-same faith with which we ourselves are. Whence the apostle also says: \"We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believe, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-36-P3649_1398538:48-nf] Out of very faith was it said, \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel,\"[fn-36-P3650_1398678:49-nf] \"which is, being interpreted, God with us.\"[fn-36-P3651_1398741:50-nf] Out of very faith too was it said concerning Him: \"As a bridegroom He cometh out of His chamber; as a giant did He exult to run His course. His going forth is from the extremity of heaven, and His circuit runs to the other end of heaven; and no one is hidden from His heat.\"[fn-36-P3652_1399034:51-nf] Out of very faith, again, was it said to Him: \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.\"[fn-36-P3653_1399339:52-nf] By the self-same Spirit of faith were all these things foreseen by them as to happen, whereby they are believed by us as having happened. They, indeed, who were able in faithful love to foretell these things to us were not themselves partakers of them. The Apostle Peter says, \"Why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.\"[fn-36-P3654_1399849:53-nf] Now on what principle does he make this statement, if it be not because even they were saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and not the law of Moses, from which comes not the cure, but only the knowledge of sin?[fn-36-P3655_1400097:54-nf] Now, however, the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.[fn-36-P3656_1400231:55-nf] If, therefore, it is now manifested, it even then existed, but it was hidden. This concealment was symbolized by the veil of the temple. When Christ was dying, this veil was rent asunder,[fn-36-P3657_1400438:56-nf] to signify the full revelation of Him. Even of old, therefore there existed amongst the people of God this grace of the one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; but like the rain in the fleece which God sets apart for His inheritance,[fn-36-P3658_1400710:57-nf] not of debt, but of His own will, it was latently present, but is now patently visible amongst all nations as its \"floor,\" the fleece being dry,-in other Words, the Jewish people having become reprobate.[fn-36-P3659_1400934:58-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_26_the_first_epistle_of_clement_to_the_corinthians","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"121","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Having then this hope, let our souls be bound to Him who is faithful in His promises, and just in His judgments.

In response to which is the psalm, \"Their sound is gone through all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world; \"[fn-51-P5142_1615415:310-nf] that is, the words of them who carry round about the law that proceeded from Sion and the Lord's word from Jerusalem, in order that that might come to pass which was written: \"They who were far from my righteousness, have come near to my righteousness and truth.\"[fn-51-P5143_1615698:311-nf] When the apostles girded their loins for this business, they renounced the elders and rulers and priests of the Jews. Well, says he, but was it not above all things that they might preach the other god? Rather[fn-51-P5144_1616043:312-nf] (that they might preach) that very self-same God, whose scripture they were with all their might fulfilling! \"Depart ye, depart ye,\" exclaims Isaiah; \"go ye out from thence, and touch not the unclean thing,\" that is blasphemy against Christ; \"Go ye out of the midst of her,\" even of the synagogue\" Be ye separate who bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-51-P5145_1616406:313-nf] For already had the Lord, according to the preceding words (of the prophet), revealed His Holy One with His arm, that is to say, Christ by His mighty power, in the eyes of the nations, so that all the[fn-51-P5146_1616628:314-nf] nations and the utmost parts of the earth have seen the salvation, which was from God. By thus departing from Judaism itself, when they exchanged the obligations and burdens of the law for the liberty of the gospel, they were fulfilling the psalm, \"Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast away their yoke from us; \"and this indeed (they did) after that \"the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain devices; \"after that \"the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers took their counsel together against the Lord, and against His Christ.\"[fn-51-P5147_1617197:315-nf] What did the apostles thereupon suffer? You answer: Every sort of iniquitous persecutions, from men that belonged indeed to that Creator who was the adversary of Him whom they were preaching. Then why does the Creator, if an adversary of Christ, not only predict that the apostles should incur this suffering, but even express His displeasure[fn-51-P5148_1617587:316-nf] thereat? For He ought neither to predict the course of the other god, whom, as you contend, He knew not, nor to have expressed displeasure at that which He had taken care to bring about. \"See how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and how merciful men are taken away, and no man considereth. For the righteous man has been removed from the evil person.\"[fn-51-P5149_1617980:317-nf] Who is this but Christ? \"Come, say they, let us take away the righteous, because He is not for our turn, (and He is clean contrary to our doings).\"[fn-51-P5150_1618149:318-nf] Premising, therefore, and likewise subjoining the fact that Christ suffered, He foretold that His just ones should suffer equally with Him-both the apostles and all the faithful in succession; and He signed them with that very seal of which Ezekiel spake: \"The Lord said unto me, Go through the gate, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set the mark <i>tau upon the foreheads of the men.\"[fn-51-P5151_1618567:319-nf] Now the Greek letter <i>tau and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which He predicted would be the sign on our foreheads in the true Catholic Jerusalem,[fn-51-P5152_1619095:320-nf] in which, according to the twenty-first Psalm, the brethren of Christ or children of God would ascribe glory to God the Father, in the person of Christ Himself addressing His Father; \"I will declare Thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I sing praise unto Thee.\" For that which had to come to pass in our day in His name, and by His Spirit, He rightly foretold would be of Him. And a little afterwards He says: \"My praise shall be of Thee in the great congregation.\"[fn-51-P5153_1619694:321-nf] In the sixty-seventh Psalm He says again: \"In the congregations bless ye the Lord God.\"[fn-51-P5154_1619807:322-nf] So that with this agrees also the prophecy of Malachi: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord; neither will I accept your offerings: for from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place sacrifice shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering\"[fn-51-P5155_1620161:323-nf] -such as the ascription of glory, and blessing, and praise, and hymns.

In short, says he, \"He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; \"[fn-52-P5247_1640289:13-nf] meaning not those of the Jewish people only, but of the nations which are judged by the new law of the gospel and the new word of the apostles, and are amongst themselves rebuked of their old error as soon as they have believed. And as the result of this, \"they beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears (which are a kind of hunting instruments) into pruning-hooks; \"[fn-52-P5248_1640686:14-nf] that is to say, minds, which once were fierce and cruel, are changed by them into good dispositions productive of good fruit. And again: \"Hearken unto me, hearken unto me, my people, and ye kings, give ear unto me; for a law shall proceed from me, and my judgment for a light to the nations; \"[fn-52-P5249_1640997:15-nf] wherefore He had determined and decreed that the nations also were to be enlightened by the law and the word of the gospel. This will be that law which (according to David also) is unblameable, because \"perfect, converting the soul\"[fn-52-P5250_1641270:16-nf] from idols unto God. This likewise will be the word concerning which the same Isaiah says, \"For the Lord will make a decisive word in the land.\"[fn-52-P5251_1641432:17-nf] Because the New Testament is compendiously short,[fn-52-P5252_1641554:18-nf] and freed from the minute and perplexing[fn-52-P5253_1641614:19-nf] burdens of the law. But why enlarge, when the Creator by the same prophet foretells the renovation more manifestly and clearly than the light itself? \"Remember not the former things, neither consider the things of old\" (the old things have passed away, and new things are arising). \"Behold, I will do new things, which shall now spring forth.\"[fn-52-P5254_1641975:20-nf] So by Jeremiah: \"Break up for yourselves new pastures,[fn-52-P5255_1642055:21-nf] and sow not among thorns, and circumcise yourselves in the foreskin of your heart.\"[fn-52-P5256_1642186:22-nf] And in another passage: \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Jacob, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I arrested their dispensation, in order to bring them out of the land of Egypt.\"[fn-52-P5257_1642532:23-nf] He thus shows that the ancient covenant is temporary only, when He indicates its change; also when He promises that it shall be followed by an eternal one. For by Isaiah He says: \"Hear me, and ye shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,\" adding \"the sure mercies of David,\"[fn-52-P5258_1642871:24-nf] in order that He might show that that covenant was to run its course in Christ. That He was of the family of David, according to the genealogy of Mary,[fn-52-P5259_1643040:25-nf] He declared in a figurative way even by the rod which was to proceed out of the stem of Jesse.[fn-52-P5260_1643581:26-nf] Forasmuch then as he said, that from the Creator there would come other laws, and other words, and new dispensations of covenants, indicating also that the very sacrifices were to receive higher offices, and that amongst all nations, by Malachi when he says: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, neither will I accept your sacrifices at your hands. For from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place a sacrifice is offered unto my name, even a pure offering\"[fn-52-P5261_1644145:27-nf] -meaning simple prayer from a pure conscience,-it is of necessity that every change which comes as the result of innovation, introduces a diversity in those things of which the change is made, from which diversity arises also a contrariety. For as there is nothing, after it has undergone a change, which does not become different, so there is nothing different which is not contrary.[fn-52-P5262_1644551:28-nf] Of that very thing, therefore, there will be predicated a contrariety in consequence of its diversity, to which there accrued a change of condition after an innovation. He who brought about the change, the same instituted the diversity also; He who foretold the innovation, the same announced beforehand the contrariety likewise. Why, in your interpretation, do you impute a difference in the state of things to a difference of powers? Why do you wrest to the Creator's prejudice those examples from which you draw your antitheses, when you may recognise them all in His sensations and affections? \"I will wound,\" He says, \"and I will heal; \"\"I will kill,\" He says again, \"and I will make alive\"[fn-52-P5263_1645272:29-nf] -even the same \"who createth evil and maketh peace; \"[fn-52-P5264_1645349:30-nf] from which you are used even to censure Him with the imputation of fickleness and inconstancy, as if He forbade what He commanded, and commanded what He forbade. Why, then, have you not reckoned up the Antitheses also which occur in the natural works of the Creator, who is for ever contrary to Himself? You have not been able, unless I am misinformed, to recognise the fact,[fn-52-P5265_1645743:31-nf] that the world, at all events,[fn-52-P5266_1645791:32-nf] even amongst your people of Pontus, is made up of a diversity of elements which are hostile to one another.[fn-52-P5267_1645912:33-nf] It was therefore your bounden duty first to have determined that the god of the light was one being, and the god of darkness was another, in such wise that you might have been able to have distinctly asserted one of them to be the god of the law and the other the god of the gospel. It is, however, the settled conviction already[fn-52-P5268_1646266:34-nf] of my mind from manifest proofs, that, as His works and plans[fn-52-P5269_1646352:35-nf] exist in the way of Antitheses, so also by the same rule exist the mysteries of His religion.[fn-52-P5270_1646474:36-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The publican who was chosen by the Lord,[fn-55-P5598_1715134:331-nf] he adduces for a proof that he was chosen as a stranger to the law and uninitiated in[fn-55-P5599_1715276:332-nf] Judaism, by one who was an adversary to the law. The case of Peter escaped his memory, who, although he was a man of the law, was not only chosen by the Lord, but also obtained the testimony of possessing knowledge which was given to him by the Father.[fn-56-P5600_1715546:333-nf] He had nowhere read of Christ's being foretold as the light, and hope, and expectation of the Gentiles! He, however, rather spoke of the Jews in a favourable light, when he said, \"The whole needed not a physician, but they that are sick.\"[fn-56-P5601_1715807:334-nf] For since by \"those that are sick\" he meant that the heathens and publicans should be understood, whom he was choosing, he affirmed of the Jews that they were \"whole\" for whom he said that a physician was not necessary. This being the case, he makes a mistake in coming down[fn-56-P5602_1716101:335-nf] to destroy the law, as if for the remedy of a diseased condition. because they who were living under it were \"whole,\" and \"not in want of a physician.\" How, moreover, does it happen that he proposed the similitude of a physician, if he did not verify it? For, just as nobody uses a physician for healthy persons, so will no one do so for strangers, in so far as he is one of Marcion's god-made men,[fn-56-P5603_1716523:336-nf] having to himself both a creator and preserver, and a specially good physician, in his Christ. This much the comparison predetermines, that a physician is more usually furnished by him to whom the sick people belong. Whence, too, does John come upon the scene? Christ, suddenly; and just as suddenly, John![fn-56-P5604_1716859:337-nf] After this fashion occur all things in Marcion's system. They have their own special and plenary course[fn-56-P5605_1717027:338-nf] in the Creator's dispensation. Of John, however, what else I have to say will be found in another passage.[fn-56-P5606_1717157:339-nf] To the several points which now come before us an answer must be given. This, then, I will take care to do[fn-56-P5607_1717295:340-nf] -demonstrate that, reciprocally, John is suitable to Christ, and Christ to Joan, the latter, of course, as a prophet of the Creator, just as the former is the Creator's Christ; and so the heretic may blush at frustrating, to his own frustration, the mission of John the Baptist. For if there had been no ministry of John at all-\"the voice,\" as Isaiah calls him, \"of one crying in the wilderness,\" and the preparer of the ways of the Lord by denunciation and recommendation of repentance; if, too, he had not baptized (Christ) Himself[fn-56-P5608_1717844:341-nf] along with others, nobody could have challenged the disciples of Christ, as they ate and drank, to a comparison with the disciples of John, who were constantly fasting and praying; because, if there existed any diversity[fn-56-P5609_1718079:342-nf] between Christ and John, and their followers respectively, no exact comparison would be possible, nor would there be a single point where it could be challenged. For nobody would feel surprise, and nobody would be perplexed, although there should arise rival predictions of a diverse deity, which should also mutually differ about modes of conduct,[fn-56-P5610_1718582:343-nf] having a prior difference about the authorities[fn-56-P5611_1718680:344-nf] upon which they were based. Therefore Christ belonged to John, and John to Christ; while both belonged to the Creator, and both were of the law and the prophets, preachers and masters. Else Christ would have rejected the discipline of John, as of the rival god, and would also have defended the disciples, as very properly pursuing a different walk, because consecrated to the service of another and contrary deity. But as it is, while modestly[fn-56-P5612_1719184:345-nf] giving a reason why \"the children of the bridegroom are unable to fast during the time the bridegroom is with them,\" but promising that \"they should afterwards fast, when the bridegroom was taken away from them,\"[fn-56-P5613_1719416:346-nf] He neither defended the disciples, (but rather excused them, as if they had not been blamed without some reason), nor rejected the discipline of John, but rather allowed[fn-56-P5614_1719609:347-nf] it, referring it to the time of John, although destining it for His own time. Otherwise His purpose would have been to reject it,[fn-56-P5615_1719757:348-nf] and to defend its opponents, if He had not Himself already belonged to it as then in force. I hold also that it is my Christ who is meant by the bridegroom, of whom the psalm says: \"He is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and His return is back to the end of it again.\"[fn-56-P5616_1720111:349-nf] By the mouth of Isaiah He also says exultingly of the Father: \"Let my soul rejoice in the Lord; for He hath clothed me with the garment of salvation and with the tunic of joy, as a bridegroom. He hath put a mitre round about my head, as a bride.\"[fn-56-P5617_1720380:350-nf] To Himself likewise He appropriates[fn-56-P5618_1720437:351-nf] the church, concerning which the same[fn-56-P5619_1720491:352-nf] Spirit says to Him: \"Thou shall clothe Thee with them all, as with a bridal ornament.\"[fn-56-P5620_1720624:353-nf] This spouse Christ invites home to Himself also by Solomon from the call of the Gentiles, because you read: \"Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse.\"[fn-56-P5621_1720794:354-nf] He elegantly makes mention of Lebanon (the mountain, of course) because it stands for the name of frankincense with the Greeks;[fn-56-P5622_1720949:355-nf] for it was from idolatry that He betrothed Himself the church. Deny now, Marcion, your utter madness, (if you can)! Behold, you impugn even the law of your god. He unites not in the nuptial bond, nor, when contracted, does he allow it; no one does he baptize but a cµlebs or a eunuch; until death or divorce does he reserve baptism.[fn-56-P5623_1721531:356-nf] Wherefore, then, do you make his Christ a bridegroom? This is the designation of Him who united man and woman, not of him who separated them. You have erred also in that declaration of Christ, wherein He seems to make a difference between things new and old. You are inflated about the old bottles, and brain-muddled with the new wine; and therefore to the old (that is to say, to the prior) gospel you have sewed on the patch of your new-fangled heresy. I should like to know in what respect the Creator is inconsistent with Himself.[fn-56-P5624_1722155:357-nf] When by Jeremiah He gave this precept, \"Break up for yourselves new pastures,\"[fn-56-P5625_1722248:358-nf] does He not turn away from the old state of things? And when by Isaiah He proclaims how \"old things were passed away; and, behold, all things, which I am making, are new,\"[fn-56-P5626_1722439:359-nf] does He not advert to a new state of things? We have generally been of opinion[fn-56-P5627_1722587:360-nf] that the destination of the former state of things was rather promised by the Creator, and exhibited in reality by Christ, only under the authority of one and the same God, to whom appertain both the old things and the new. For new wine is not put into old bottles, except by one who has the old bottles; nor does anybody put a new piece to an old garment, unless the old garment be forthcoming to him. That person only[fn-56-P5628_1723030:361-nf] does not do a thing when it is not to be done, who has the materials wherewithal to do it if it were to be done. And therefore, since His object in making the comparison was to show that He was separating the new condition[fn-56-P5629_1723266:362-nf] of the gospel from the old state[fn-56-P5630_1723315:363-nf] of the law, He proved that that[fn-56-P5631_1723364:364-nf] from which He was separating His own ought not to have been branded[fn-56-P5632_1723474:365-nf] as a separation[fn-56-P5633_1723507:366-nf] of things which were alien to each other; for nobody ever unites his own things with things that are alien to them,[fn-56-P5634_1723685:367-nf] in order that he may afterwards be able to separate them from the alien things. A separation is possible by help of the conjunction through which it is made. Accordingly, the things which He separated He also proved to have been once one; as they would have remained, were it not for His separation. But still we make this concession, that there is a separation, by reformation, by amplification,[fn-56-P5635_1724126:368-nf] by progress; just as the fruit is separated from the seed, although the fruit comes from the seed. So likewise the gospel is separated from the law, whilst it advances[fn-56-P5636_1724315:369-nf] from the law-a different thing[fn-56-P5637_1724381:370-nf] from it, but not an alien one; diverse, but not contrary. Nor in Christ do we even find any novel form of discourse. Whether He proposes similitudes or refute questions, it comes from the seventy-seventh Psalm. \"I will open,\" says He, \"my mouth in a parable\" (that is, in a similitude); \"I will utter dark problems\" (that is, I will set forth questions).[fn-56-P5638_1724751:371-nf] If you should wish to prove that a man belonged to another race, no doubt you would fetch your proof from the idiom of his language.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"ANF-03","text":"And now, on the subject of a loan, when He asks, \"And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? \"[fn-58-P5897_1781657:611-nf] compare with this the following words of Ezekiel, in which He says of the before-mentioned just man, \"He hath not given his money upon usury, nor will he take any increase\"[fn-58-P5898_1781892:612-nf] -meaning the redundance of interest,[fn-58-P5899_1782001:613-nf] which is usury. The first step was to eradicate the fruit of the money lent,[fn-59-P5900_1782123:614-nf] the more easily to accustom a man to the loss, should it happen, of the money itself, the interest of which he had learnt to lose. Now this, we affirm, was the function of the law as preparatory to the gospel. It was engaged in forming the faith of such as would learn,[fn-59-P5901_1782432:615-nf] by gradual stages, for the perfect light of the Christian discipline, through the best precepts of which it was capable,[fn-59-P5902_1782582:616-nf] inculcating a benevolence which as yet expressed itself but falteringly.[fn-59-P5903_1782691:617-nf] For in the passage of Ezekiel quoted above He says, \"And thou shalt restore the pledge of the loan \"[fn-59-P5904_1782850:618-nf] -to him, certainly, who is incapable of repayment, because, as a matter of course, He would not anyhow prescribe the restoration of a pledge to one who was solvent. Much more clearly is it enjoined in Deuteronomy: \"Thou shalt not sleep upon his pledge; thou shalt be sure to return to him his garment about sunset, and he shall sleep in his own garment.\"[fn-59-P5905_1783294:619-nf] Clearer still is a former passage: \"Thou shalt remit every debt which thy neighbour oweth thee; and of thy brother thou shalt not require it, because it is called the release of the Lord thy God.\"[fn-59-P5906_1783518:620-nf] Now, when He commands that a debt be remitted to a man who shall be unable to pay it (for it is a still stronger argument when He forbids its being asked for from a man who is even able to repay it), what else does He teach than that we should lend to those of whom we cannot receive again, inasmuch as He has imposed so great a loss on lending? \"And ye shall be the children of God.\"[fn-59-P5907_1783923:621-nf] What can be more shameless, than for him to be making us his children, who has not permitted us to make children for ourselves by forbidding marriage?[fn-59-P5908_1784148:622-nf] How does he propose to invest his followers with a name which he has already erased? I cannot be the son of a eunuch Especially when I have for my Father the same great Being whom the universe claims for its! For is not the Founder of the universe as much a Father, even of all men, as (Marcion's) castrated deity,[fn-59-P5909_1784546:623-nf] who is the maker of no existing thing? Even if the Creator had not united male and female, and if He had not allowed any living creature whatever to have children, I yet had this relation to Him[fn-59-P5910_1784760:624-nf] before Paradise, before the fall, before the expulsion, before the two became one.[fn-59-P5911_1784865:625-nf] I became His son a second time,[fn-59-P5912_1785018:626-nf] as soon as He fashioned me[fn-59-P5913_1785059:627-nf] with His hands, and gave me motion with His inbreathing. Now again He names me His son, not begetting me into natural life, but into spiritual life.[fn-59-P5914_1785230:628-nf] \"Because,\" says He, \"He is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.\"[fn-59-P5915_1785338:629-nf] Well done,[fn-59-P5916_1785369:630-nf] Marcion! how cleverly have you withdrawn from Him the showers and the sunshine, that He might not seem to be a Creator! But who is this kind being[fn-59-P5917_1785529:631-nf] which hitherto has not been even known? How can he be kind who had previously shown no evidences of such a kindness as this, which consists of the loan to us of sunshine and rain?-who is not destined to receive from the human race (the homage due to that) Creator,-who, up to this very moment, in return for His vast liberality in the gift of the elements, bears with men while they offer to idols, more readily than Himself, the due returns of His graciousness. But God is truly kind even in spiritual blessings. \"The utterances[fn-59-P5918_1786074:632-nf] of the Lord are sweeter than honey and honeycombs.\"[fn-59-P5919_1786142:633-nf] He then has taunted[fn-59-P5920_1786182:634-nf] men as ungrateful who deserved to have their gratitude-even He, whose sunshine and rain even you, O Marcion, have enjoyed, but without gratitude! Your god, however, had no right to complain of man's ingratitude, because he had used no means to make them grateful. Compassion also does He teach: \"Be ye merciful,\" says He, \"as your Father also that had mercy upon you.\"[fn-59-P5921_1786571:635-nf] This injunction will be of a piece with, \"Deal thy bread to the hungry; and if he be houseless, bring him into thine house; and if thou seest the naked, cover him; \"[fn-59-P5922_1786768:636-nf] also with, \"Judge the fatherless, plead with the widow.\"[fn-59-P5923_1786847:637-nf] I recognise here that ancient doctrine of Him who \"prefers mercy to sacrifice.\"[fn-59-P5924_1786946:638-nf] If, however, it be now some other being which teaches mercy, on the ground of his own mercifulness, how happens it that he has been wanting in mercy to me for so vast an age? \"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto you: good measure, pressed down, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye measure withal, it shall be measured to you again.\"[fn-59-P5925_1787462:639-nf] As it seems to me, this passage announces a retribution proportioned to the merits. But from whom shall come the retribution? If only from men, in that case he teaches a merely human discipline and recompense; and in everything we shall have to obey man: if from the Creator, as the Judge and the Recompenser of merits, then He compels our submission to Him, in whose hands[fn-59-P5926_1787860:640-nf] He has placed a retribution which will be acceptable or terrible according as every man shall have judged or condemned, acquitted or dealt with,[fn-59-P5927_1788023:641-nf] his neighbour; if from (Marcion's god) himself, he will then exercise a judicial function which Marcion denies. Let the Marcionites therefore make their choice: Will it not be just the same inconsistency to desert the prescription of their master, as to have Christ teaching in the interest of men or of the Creator? But \"a blind man will lead a blind man into the ditch.\"[fn-59-P5928_1788418:642-nf] Some persons believe Marcion. But \"the disciple is not above his master.\"[fn-59-P5929_1788512:643-nf] Apelles ought to have remembered this-a corrector of Marcion, although his disciple.[fn-59-P5930_1788617:644-nf] The heretic ought to take the beam out of his own eye, and then he may convict[fn-59-P5931_1788717:645-nf] the Christian, should he suspect a mote to be in his eye. Just as a good tree cannot produce evil fruit, so neither can truth generate heresy; and as a corrupt tree cannot yield good fruit, so heresy will not produce truth. Thus, Marcion brought nothing good out of Cerdon's evil treasure; nor Apelles out of Marcion's.[fn-59-P5932_1789054:646-nf] For in applying to these heretics the figurative words which Christ used of men in general, we shall make a much more suitable interpretation of them than if we were to deduce out of them two gods, according to Marcion's grievous exposition.[fn-59-P5933_1789399:647-nf] I think that I have the best reason possible for insisting still upon the position which I have all along occupied, that in no passage to be anywhere found has another God been revealed by Christ. I wonder that in this place alone Marcion's hands should have felt benumbed in their adulterating labour.[fn-59-P5934_1789833:648-nf] But even robbers have their qualms now and then. There is no wrong-doing without fear, because there is none without a guilty conscience. So long, then, were the Jews cognisant of no other god but Him, beside whom they knew none else; nor did they call upon any other than Him whom alone they knew. This being the case, who will He clearly be[fn-59-P5935_1790364:649-nf] that said, \"Why callest thou me Lord, Lord? \"[fn-59-P5936_1790428:650-nf] Will it be he who had as yet never been called on, because never yet revealed;[fn-59-P5937_1790527:651-nf] or He who was ever regarded as the Lord, because known from the beginning-even the God of the Jews? Who, again, could possibly have added, \"and do not the things which I say? \"Could it have been he who was only then doing his best[fn-59-P5938_1790773:652-nf] to teach them? Or He who from the beginning had addressed to them His messages[fn-59-P5939_1790906:653-nf] both by the law and the prophets? He could then upbraid them with disobedience, even if He had no ground at any time else for His reproof.

For that it was impossible that God could make generated things out of things that are not. And that God is always Lord, and always Creator, and matter always a subservient (substance), and that which is assuming phases of being-not, however, the whole of it. For when it was being continually moved in a rude and disorderly manner, He reduced (matter) into order by the following expedient. As He gazed (upon matter) in a seething condition, like (the contents of) a pot when a fire is burning underneath, He effected a partial separation. And taking one portion from the whole, He subdued it, but another He allowed to be whirled in a disorderly manner. And he asserts that what was (thus) subdued is the world, but that another portion remains wild, and is denominated chaotic[fn-21-P2104_657434:37-nf] matter. He asserts that this constitutes the substance of all things, as if introducing a novel tenet for his disciples. He does not, however, reflect that this happens to be the Socratic discourse, which (indeed) is worked out more elaborately by Plato than by Hermogenes. He acknowledges, however, that Christ is the Son of the God who created all things; and along with (this admission), he confesses that he was born of a virgin and of (the) Spirit, according to the voice of the Gospels. And (Hermogenes maintains that Christ), after His passion, was raised up in a body, and that He appeared to His disciples, and that as He went up into heaven He left His body in the sun, but that He Himself proceeded on to the Father. Now (Hermogenes) resorts to testimony, thinking to support himself by what is spoken, (viz.) what the Psalmist David says: \"In the sun he hath placed his tabernacle, and himself (is) as a bridegroom coming forth from his nuptial chamber, (and) he will rejoice as a giant to run his course.\"[fn-21-P2105_658482:38-nf] These, then, are the opinions which also Hermogenes attempted to establish.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":19,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_28_homily_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Wherefore then did He make them so beautiful?

This shall now be proved even by the apostle, when he says: \"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; which is come unto you, as it is unto all the world.\"[fn-80-P8067_2292629:866-nf] For if, even at that time, the tradition of the gospel had spread everywhere, how much more now!

But should Marcion's gospel succeed in filling the whole world, it would not even in that case be entitled to the character of apostolic. For this quality, it will be evident, can only belong to that gospel which was the first to fill the world; in other words, to the gospel of that God who of old declared this of its promulgation: \"Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"[fn-80-P8069_2293434:868-nf] He calls Christ \"the image of the invisible God.\"[fn-80-P8070_2293503:869-nf] We in like manner say that the Father of Christ is invisible, for we know that it was the Son who was seen in ancient times (whenever any appearance was vouchsafed to men in the name of God) as the image of (the Father) Himself. He must not be regarded, however, as making any difference between a visible and an invisible God; because long before he wrote this we find a description of our God to this effect: \"No man can see the Lord, and live.\"[fn-80-P8071_2293970:870-nf] If Christ is not \"the first-begotten before every creature,\"[fn-80-P8072_2294054:871-nf] as that \"Word of God by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made; \"[fn-80-P8073_2294295:872-nf] if \"all things were\" not \"in Him created, whether in heaven or on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities, or powers; \"if \"all things were\" not \"created by Him and for Him\" (for these truths Marcion ought not to allow concerning Him), then the apostle could not have so positively laid it down, that \"He is before all.\"[fn-80-P8074_2294679:873-nf] For how is He before all, if He is not before all things?[fn-80-P8075_2294756:874-nf] How, again, is He before all things, if He is not \"the first-born of every creature\"-if He is not the Word of the Creator?[fn-80-P8076_2294898:875-nf] Now how will he be proved to have been before all things, who appeared after all things? Who can tell whether he had a prior existence, when he has found no proof that he had any existence at all? In what way also could it have \"pleased (the Father) that in Him should all fulness dwell? \"[fn-80-P8077_2295227:876-nf] For, to begin with, what fulness is that which is not comprised of the constituents which Marcion has removed from it,-even those that were \"created in Christ, whether in heaven or on earth,\" whether angels or men? which is not made of the things that are visible and invisible? which consists not of thrones and dominions and principalities and powers? If, on the other hand,[fn-80-P8078_2295623:877-nf] our false apostles and Judaizing gospellers[fn-80-P8079_2295682:878-nf] have introduced all these things out of their own stores, and Martian has applied them to constitute the fulness of his own god, (this hypothesis, absurd though it be, alone would justify him; ) for how, on any other supposition,[fn-80-P8080_2295937:879-nf] could the rival and the destroyer of the Creator have been willing that His fulness should dwell in his Christ? To whom, again, does He \"reconcile all things by Himself, making peace by the blood of His cross,\"[fn-80-P8081_2296170:880-nf] but to Him whom those very things had altogether[fn-80-P8082_2296238:881-nf] offended, against whom they had rebelled by transgression, (but) to whom they had at last returned?[fn-80-P8083_2296397:882-nf] Conciliated they might have been to a strange god; but reconciled they could not possibly have been to any other than their own God. Accordingly, ourselves \"who were sometime alienated and enemies in our mind by wicked works\"[fn-80-P8084_2296655:883-nf] does He reconcile to the Creator, against whom we had committed offence-worshipping the creature to the prejudice of the Creator. As, however, he says elsewhere,[fn-80-P8085_2296836:884-nf] that the Church is the body of Christ, so here also (the apostle) declares that he \"fills up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in his flesh for His body's sake, which is the Church.\"[fn-80-P8086_2297054:885-nf] But you must not on this account suppose that on every mention of His body the term is only a metaphor, instead of meaning real flesh. For he says above that we are \"reconciled in His body through death; \"[fn-80-P8087_2297279:886-nf] meaning, of course, that He died in that body wherein death was possible through the flesh: (therefore he adds, ) not through the Church[fn-80-P8088_2297435:887-nf] (per ecclesiam), but expressly for the sake of the Church (proper ecclesiam), exchanging body for body-one of flesh for a spiritual one. When, again, he warns them to \"beware of subtle words and philosophy,\" as being \"a vain deceit,\" such as is \"after the rudiments of the world\" (not understanding thereby the mundane fabric of sky and earth, but worldly learning, and \"the tradition of men,\" subtle in their speech and their philosophy),[fn-80-P8089_2297958:888-nf] it would be tedious, and the proper subject of a separate work, to show how in this sentence (of the apostle's) all heresies are condemned, on the ground of their consisting of the resources of subtle speech and the rules of philosophy. But (once for all) let Marcion know that the principle term of his creed comes from the school of Epicurus, implying that the Lord is stupid and indifferent;[fn-80-P8090_2298372:889-nf] wherefore he refuses to say that He is an object to be feared. Moreover, from the porch of the Stoics he brings out matter, and places it on a par with the Divine Creator.[fn-80-P8091_2299157:890-nf] He also denies the resurrection of the flesh,-a truth which none of the schools of philosophy agreed together to hold.[fn-80-P8092_2299442:891-nf] But how remote is our (Catholic) verity from the artifices of this heretic, when it dreads to arouse the anger of God, and firmly believes that He produced all things out of nothing, and promises to us a restoration from the grave of the same flesh (that died) and holds without a blush that Christ was born of the virgin's womb! At this, philosophers, and heretics, and the very heathen, laugh and jeer. For \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise\"[fn-80-P8093_2300031:892-nf] -that God, no doubt, who in reference to this very dispensation of His threatened long before that He would \"destroy the wisdom of the wise.\"[fn-80-P8094_2300194:893-nf] Thanks to this simplicity of truth, so opposed to the subtlety and vain deceit of philosophy, we cannot possibly have any relish for such perverse opinions. Then, if God \"quickens us together with Christ, forgiving us our trespasses,\"[fn-80-P8095_2300510:894-nf] we cannot suppose that sins are forgiven by Him against whom, as having been all along unknown, they could not have been committed. Now tell me, Marcion, what is your opinion of the apostle's language, when he says, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath, which is a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ? \"[fn-80-P8096_2300924:895-nf] We do not now treat of the law, further than (to remark) that the apostle here teaches clearly how it has been abolished, even by passing from shadow to substance-that is, from figurative types to the reality, which is Christ. The shadow, therefore, is His to whom belongs the body also; in other words, the law is His, and so is Christ. If you separate the law and Christ, assigning one to one god and the other to another, it is the same as if you were to attempt to separate the shadow from the body of which it is the shadow. Manifestly Christ has relation to the law, if the body has to its shadow. But when he blames those who alleged visions of angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats-\"you must not touch, you must not taste\"-in a voluntary humility, (at the same time) \"vainly puffed up in the fleshly mind, and not holding the Head,\"[fn-80-P8097_2301822:896-nf] (the apostle) does not in these terms attack the law or Moses, as if it was at the suggestion of superstitious angels that he had enacted his prohibition of sundry aliments. For Moses had evidently received the law from God. When, therefore, he speaks of their \"following the commandments and doctrines of men,\"[fn-80-P8098_2302162:897-nf] he refers to the conduct of those persons who \"held not the Head,\" even Him in whom all things are gathered together;[fn-80-P8099_2302300:898-nf] for they are all recalled to Christ, and concentrated in Him as their initiating principle[fn-81-P8100_2302423:899-nf] -even the meats and drinks which were indifferent in their nature. All the rest of his precepts,[fn-81-P8101_2302536:900-nf] as we have shown sufficiently, when treating of them as they occurred in another epistle,[fn-81-P8102_2302664:901-nf] emanated from the Creator, who, while predicting that \"old things were to pass away,\" and that He would \"make all things new,\"[fn-81-P8103_2302902:902-nf] commanded men \"to break up fresh ground for themselves,\"[fn-81-P8104_2303013:903-nf] and thereby taught them even then to put off the old man and put on the new.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"157","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Joel: \"Blow with the trumpet in Sion; sanctify a fast, and call a healing; assemble the people, sanctify the Church, gather the elders, collect the little ones that suck the breast; let the Bridegroom go forth of His chamber, and the bride out of her closet.\"[fn-83-P8301_2742502:241-nf] Also in Jeremiah: \"And I will take away from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of the joyous, and the voice of the glad; the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.\"[fn-83-P8302_2742737:242-nf] Also in the eighteenth Psalm: \"And he is as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber; he exulted as a giant to run his course.

For it was in the law, that whoever should refuse marriage should put off his shoe, but that he should be shod who was to be the bridegroom: \"And it happened, when Jesus was in Jericho, he looked around with his eyes, and saw a man standing before his face, and holding a javelin[fn-83-P8306_2744119:246-nf] in his hand, and said, Art thou for us or for our enemies?

And Moses said, I will pass over and see this great sight, why the bush is not consumed. But when He saw that he drew near to see, the Lord God called him from the bush, saying, Moses, Moses. And he said, What is it? And He said, Draw not nigh hither, unless thou hast loosed thy shoe from off thy feet; for the place on which thou standest is holy ground.

And now we follow with our whole heart, and we fear and seek Thy face. Give us not over unto reproach, but do with us according to Thy tranquillity, and according to the multitude of Thy mercy deliver us.\"[fn-87-P8774_2829555:523-nf] Also in the same place: \"And the king exceedingly rejoiced, and commanded Daniel to be taken up out of the den of lions; and the lions had done him no hurt, because he trusted and had believed in his God. And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel; and they cast them in the den of lions, and their wives and their children. And before they had reached the pavement of the den they were seized by the lions, and they brake all their bones in pieces. Then Darius the king wrote, To all peoples, tribes, and languages which are in my kingdom, peace be unto you from my face. I decree and ordain that all those who are in my kingdom shall fear and tremble before the most high God whom Daniel serves, because He is the God who liveth and abideth for ever, and His kingdom shall not pass away, and His dominion goeth on for ever; and He alone doeth signs, and prodigies, and marvellous things in the heaven and the earth, who snatched Daniel from the den of lions.\"[fn-87-P8775_2830591:524-nf] Also in Micah: \"Wherewith shall I approach the Lord, and lay hold upon Him? in sacrifices, in burnt-offerings, in calves of a year old? Does the Lord favour and receive me with thousands of fat goats? or shall I give my first-fruits of unrighteousness, the fruit of my belly, the sin of my soul? It is told thee, O man, what is good; or what else the Lord doth require, save that thou shouldst do judgment and justice, and love mercy, and be ready to go with the Lord thy God.

It is good for thee, O virgin soul, that thus, as thou art a virgin, thus altogether keeping in thy heart that thou hast been born again, keeping in thy flesh that thou hast been born, thou yet conceive of the fear of the Lord, and give birth to the spirit of salvation.[fn-40-P4029_1911425:118-nf] \"Fear,\" indeed, \"there is not in charity, but perfect charity,\" as it is written, \"casteth out fear:\"[fn-40-P4030_1911558:119-nf] but fear of men, not of God: fear of temporal evils, not of the Divine Judgment at the last. \"Be not thou high-minded, but fear.\"[fn-40-P4031_1911723:120-nf] , Love thou the goodness of God; fear thou His severity: neither suffers thee to beproud. For by loving you fear, lest you grievously offend One Who is loved and loves. For what more grievous offense, than that by pride thou displease Him, Who for thy sake hath been displeasing to the proud? And where ought there to be more that \"chaste fear abiding for ever and ever,[fn-40-P4032_1912113:121-nf] than in thee, who hast no thought of the things of this world, how to please a wedded partner; but of the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord?[fn-40-P4033_1912282:122-nf] That other fear is not in charity, but this chaste fear quitteth not charity. If you love not, fear lest you perish; if you love, fear lest you displease. That fear charity casteth out, with this it runneth within. The Apostle Paul also says, \"For we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but we have received the spirit of adoption of sons, wherein we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-40-P4034_1912695:123-nf] I believe that he speaks of that fear, which had been given in the Old Testament, test the temporal goods should be lost, which God had promised unto those not yet sons under grace, but as yet slaves under the law. There is also the fear of eternal fire, to serve God in order to avoid which is assuredly not yet of perfect charity. For the desire of the reward is one thing, the fear of punishment another. They are different sayings, \"Whither shall I go away from Thy Spirit, and from Thy face whither shall I flee?\"[fn-40-P4035_1913235:124-nf] and, \"One thing I have sought of the Lord, this I will seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord through all the days of my life, that I may consider the delight of the Lord, that I be protected in His temple:\"[fn-40-P4036_1913480:125-nf] and, \"Turn not away Thy face from me:\"[fn-40-P4037_1913540:126-nf] and, \"My soul longeth and fainteth unto the courts of the Lord.[fn-40-P4038_1913625:127-nf] Those sayings let him have had, who dared not to lift up his eyes to heaven; and she who was watering with tears His feet, in order to obtain pardon for her grievous sins; but these do thou have, who art careful about the things of the Lord, to be holy both in body and spirit.

Read a compendious interpretation of some apostolic words from the same discourse. Let us see, then, what it is that we have endeavoured to say respecting the apostle. For this saying of his, \"I was alive without the law once,\"[fn-58-P5856_1773244:60-nf] refers to the life which was lived in paradise before the law, not without a body, but with a body, by our first parents, as we have shown above; for we lived without concupiscence, being altogether ignorant of its assaults. For not to have a law according to which we ought to live, nor a power of establishing what manner of life we ought to adopt, so that we might justly be approved or blamed, is considered to exempt a person from accusation. Because one cannot lust after those things from which he is not restrained, and even if he lusted after them, he would not be blamed. For lust is not directed to things which are before us, and subject to our power, but to those which are before us, and not in our power. For how should one care for a thing which is neither forbidden nor necessary to him? And for this reason it is said, \"I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.\"[fn-58-P5857_1774171:61-nf] For when (our first parents) heard, \"Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shall not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die,\"[fn-58-P5858_1774358:62-nf] then they conceived lust, and gathered it. Therefore was it said, I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet; \"nor would they have desired to eat, except it had been said, \"Thou shalt not eat of it.\" For it was thence that sin took occasion to deceive me. For when the law was given, the devil had it in his power to work lust in me; \"for without the law, sin was dead; \"[fn-58-P5859_1774773:63-nf] which means \"when the law was not given, sin could not be committed.\" But I was alive and blameless before the law, having no commandment in accordance with which it was necessary to live; \"but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.\"[fn-58-P5860_1775113:64-nf] For after God had given the law, and had commanded me what I ought to do, and what I ought not to do, the devil wrought lust in me. For the promise of God which was given to me, this was for life and incorruption, so that obeying it I might have ever-blooming life and joy unto incorruption; but to him who disobeyed it, it would issue in death. But the devil, whom he calls sin, because he is the author of sin, taking occasion by the commandment to deceive me to disobedience, deceived and slew me, thus rendering me subject to the condemnation, \"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die.\"[fn-58-P5861_1775744:65-nf] \"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just and good; \"[fn-58-P5862_1775837:66-nf] because it was given, not for injury, but for safety; for let us not suppose that God makes anything useless or hurtful. What thou? \"Was then that which is good made death unto me? \"[fn-58-P5863_1776039:67-nf] namely, that which was given as a law, that it might be the cause of the greatest good? \"God forbid.\" For it was not the law of God that became the cause of my being brought into subjection to corruption, but the devil; that he might be made manifested who, through that which is good, wrought evil; that the inventor of evil might become and be proved the greatest of all sinners. \"For we know that the law is spiritual; \"[fn-58-P5864_1776482:68-nf] and therefore it can in no respect be injurious to any one; for spiritual things are far removed from irrational lust and sin. \"But I am carnal, sold under sin; \"[fn-58-P5865_1776664:69-nf] which means: But I being carnal, and being placed between good and evil as a voluntary agent, am so that I may have it in my power to choose what I will. For \"behold I set before thee life and death; \"[fn-58-P5866_1776885:70-nf] meaning that death would result from disobedience of the spiritual law, that is of the commandment; and from obedience to the carnal law, that is the counsel of the serpent; for by such a choice \"I am sold\" to the devil, fallen under sin. Hence evil, as though besieging me, cleaves to me and dwells in me, justice giving me up to be sold to the Evil One, in consequence of having violated the law. Therefore also the expressions: \"That which I do, I allow not,\" and \"what I hate, that do I,\"[fn-58-P5867_1777426:71-nf] are not to be understood of doing evil, but of only thinking it. For it is not in our power to think or not to think of improper things, but to act or not to act upon our thoughts. For we cannot hinder thoughts from coming into our minds, since we receive them when they are inspired into us from without; but we are able to abstain from obeying them and acting upon them. Therefore it is in our power to will not to think these things; but not to bring it about that they shall pass away, so as not to come into the mind again; for this does not lie in our power, as I said; which is the meaning of that statement, \"The good that I would, I do not; \"[fn-58-P5868_1778097:72-nf] for i do not will to think the things which injure me; for this good is altogether innocent. But \"the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do; \"not willing to think, and yet thinking what I do not will. And consider whether it was not for these very things that David entreated God, grieving that he thought of those things which he did not will: \"O cleanse Thou me from my secret faults. Keep Thy servant also from presumptuous sins. lest they get the dominion over me; so shall I be undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.\"[fn-58-P5869_1778681:73-nf] And the apostle too, in another place: \"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.\"[fn-58-P5870_1778913:74-nf] ","title":"From the Discourse on the Resurrection.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":19,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_122_from_the_discourse_on_the_resurrection_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"ANF-06","text":"III. For the apostle here sets forth clearly, as I think, three laws: One in accordance with the good which is implanted in us, which clearly he calls the law of the mind. One the law which arises from the assault of evil, and which often draws on the soul to lustful fancies, which, he says,\" wars against the law of the mind.\"[fn-58-P5879_1783175:81-nf] And the third, which is in accordance with sin, settled in the flesh from lust, which he calls the \"law of sin which dwells in our members; \"[fn-58-P5880_1783336:82-nf] which the Evil One, urging on, often stirs up against us, driving us to unrighteousness and evil deeds. For there seems to be in ourselves one thing which is better and another which is worse. And when that which is in its nature better is about to become more powerful than that which is worse, the whole mind is carried on to that which is good; but when that which is worse increases and overbalances, man is on the contrary urged on to evil imaginations. On account of which the apostle prays to be delivered from it, regarding it as death and destruction; as also does the prophet when he says, \"Cleanse Thou me from my secret faults.\"[fn-58-P5881_1783996:83-nf] And the same is denoted by the words, \"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man; but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? \"[fn-58-P5882_1784331:84-nf] By which he does not mean that the body is death, but the law of sin which is in his members, lying hidden in us through the transgression, and ever deluding the soul to the death of unrighteousness. And he immediately adds, clearly showing from what kind of death he desired to be delivered, and who he was who delivered him, \"I thank God, through Jesus Christ.\"[fn-58-P5883_1784718:85-nf] And it should be considered, if he said that this body was death, O Aglaophon, as you supposed, he would not afterwards mention Christ as delivering him froth so great an evil. For in that case what a strange thing should we have had from the advent of Christ? And how could the apostle have said this, as being able to be delivered from death by the advent of Christ; when it was the lot of all to die before Christ's coming into the world? And, therefore, O Aglaophon, he says not that this body was death, but the sin which dwells in the body through lust, from which God has delivered him by the coming of Christ. \"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death; \"so that \"He that raised up Jesus from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in you; \"having \"condemned sin\" which is in the body to its destruction; \"that the righteousness of the law\"[fn-58-P5884_1785678:86-nf] of nature which draws us to good, and is in accordance with the commandment, might be kindled and manifested. For the good which \"the law\" of nature \"could not do, in that it was weak,\" being overcome by the lust which lies in the body, God gave strength to accomplish, \"sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh; \"so that sin being condemned, to its destruction, so that it should never bear fruit in the flesh, the righteousness of the law of nature might be fulfilled, abounding in the obedience of those who walk not according to the lust of the flesh, but according to the lust and guidance of the Spirit; \"for the law of the Spirit of life,\" which is the Gospel, being different from earlier laws, leading by its preaching to obedience and the remission of sins, delivered us from the law of sin and death, having conquered entirely sin which reigned over our flesh.","title":"From the Discourse on the Resurrection.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":19,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_35_book_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"95","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"93. It requires closer examination to see the meaning of the first action of Moses in burning the calf in fire, and grinding it to powder, and sprinkling it in the water for the people to drink. The tables given to him, written with the finger of God, that is, by the agency of the Holy Spirit, he may have broken, because he judged the people unworthy of having them read to them; and he may have burned the calf, and ground it, and scattered it so as to be carried away by the water, in order to let nothing of it remain among the people. But why should he have made them drink it? Every one must feel anxious to discover the typical significance of this action. Pursuing the inquiry, we may find that in the calf there was an embodiment of the devil, as there is in men of all nations who have the devil as their head or leader in their impious rites. The calf is gold, because there is a semblance of wisdom in the institution of idolatrous worship. Of this the apostle says, \"Knowing God, they glorified Him not as God, nor were thankful; but they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise they became foolish, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of corruptible man, and of birds, and of four-footed beasts, and of creeping things.\"[fn-22-P2297_1383546:186-nf] From this so-called wisdom came the golden calf, which was one of the forms of idolatry among the chief men and professed sages of Egypt. The calf, then, represents every body or society of Gentile idolaters. This impious society the Lord Christ burns with that fire of which He says in the Gospel, \"I am come to send fire on the earth;\"[fn-22-P2298_1383906:187-nf] for, as there is nothing hid from His heat,[fn-22-P2299_1383971:188-nf] when the Gentiles believe in Him they lose the form of the devil in the fire of divine influence. Then all the body is ground, that is, after the dissolution of the combination in the membership of iniquity comes humiliation under the word of truth. Then the dust is sprinkled in the water, that the Israelites, that is, the preachers of the gospel, may in baptism admit those formerly idolaters into their own body, that is, the body of Christ. To Peter, who was one of those Israelites, it was said of the Gentiles, \"Kill, and eat.\"[fn-23-P2300_1384525:189-nf] To kill and eat is much the same as to grind and drink. So this calf, by the fire of zeal, and the keen penetration of the word, and the water of baptism, was swallowed up by the people, instead of their being swallowed up by it.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_20_sermon_iii_liii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"14. See, thou hast drawn the figure and lineaments of the members of God from a human body. And perhaps it has occurred to thee to think, that it is according to the body that we were made after the Image of God. I will admit this idea for a time to be considered, and canvassed, and examined, and by disputation to be thoroughly sifted. Now then, if it please thee, hear me; for I heard thee in what thou wast pleased to say. God sitteth in heaven, and meteth out the heaven with His palm. What! doth the same heaven become broad when it is God's seat, and narrow, when He meteth it out? Or is[fn-32-P3212_1411488:40-nf] God when sitting, limited to the measure of His palm? If this be so, God did not make us after His likeness, for the palm of our hand is much narrower than that part of the body whereon we sit. But if He be as broad in His palm as in His sitting, He hath made our members quite unlike His. There is no resemblance here. Let the Christian then blush to set up such an idol in his heart as this.

For they will boast that they worship and serve, not mere stocks and stones and forms of men and irrational birds and creeping things and beasts, but the sun and moon and all the heavenly universe, and the earth again, and the entire realm of water: and they will say that none can shew that these at any rate are not of divine nature, since it is evident to all, that they lack neither life nor reason, but transcend even the nature of mankind, inasmuch as the one inhabit the heavens, the other the earth. 3. It is worth while then to look into and examine these points also; for here, too, our argument will find that its proof against them holds true. But before we look, or begin our demonstration, it suffices that Creation almost raises its voice against them, and points to God as its Maker and Artificer, Who reigns over Creation and over all things, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; Whom the would-be philosophers turn from to worship and deify the Creation which proceeded from Him, which yet itself worships and confesses the Lord Whom they deny on its account. 4. For if men are thus awestruck at the parts of Creation and think that they are gods, they might well be rebuked by the mutual dependence of those parts; which moreover makes known, and witnesses to, the Father of the Word, Who is the Lord and Maker of these parts also, by the unbroken law of their obedience to Him, as the divine law also says: \"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth His handiwork[fn-16-P1694_603211:43-nf] .\" 5. But the proof of all this is not obscure, but is clear enough in all conscience to those the eyes of whose understanding are not wholly disabled. For if a man take the parts of Creation separately, and consider each by itself,-as for example the sun by itself alone, and the moon apart, and again earth and air, and heat and cold, and the essence of wet and of dry, separating them from their mutual conjunction,-he will certainly find that not one is sufficient for itself but all are in need of one another's assistance, and subsist by their mutual help. For the Sun is carried round along with, and is contained in, the whole heaven, and can never go beyond his own orbit, while the moon and other stars testify to the assistance given them by the Sun: while the earth again evidently does not yield her crops without rains, which in their turn would not descend to earth without the assistance of the clouds; but not even would the clouds ever appear of themselves and subsist, without the air. And the air is warmed by the upper air, but illuminated and made bright by the sun, not by itself. 6. And wells, again, and rivers will never exist without the earth; but the earth is not supported upon itself, but is set upon the realm of the waters, while this again is kept in its place, being bound fast at the centre of the universe. And the sea, and the great ocean that flows outside round the whole earth, is moved and borne by winds wherever the force of the winds dashes it. And the winds in their turn originate, not in themselves, but according to those who have written on the subject, in the air, from the burning heat and high temperature of the upper as compared with the lower air, and blow everywhere through the latter. 7. For as to the four elements of which the nature of bodies is composed, heat, that is, and cold, wet and dry, who is so perverted in his understanding as not to know that these things exist indeed in combination, but if separated and taken alone they tend to destroy even one another according to the prevailing power of the more abundant element? For heat is destroyed by cold if it be present in greater quantity, and cold again is put away by the power of heat, and what is dry, again, is moistened by wet, and the latter dried by the former.","title":"Part I.","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":19,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_32_on_infants_early_deaths","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Having, then, all these considerations in our view, we hold that the soul of him who has reached every virtue in his course, and the soul of him whose portion of life has been simply nothing, are equally out of the reach of those sufferings which flow from wickedness. Nevertheless we do not conceive of the employment of their lives as on the same level at all. The one has heard those heavenly announcements, by which, in the words of the Prophet, \"the glory of God is declared[fn-29-P2944_1987122:27-nf] ,\" and, travelling through creation, has been led to the apprehension of a Master of the creation; he has taken the true Wisdom for his teacher, that Wisdom which the spectacle of the Universe suggests; and when he observed the beauty of this material sunlight he had grasped by analogy the beauty of the real sunlight[fn-29-P2945_1987458:28-nf] ; he saw in the solid firm- ness of this earth the unchangeableness of its Creator; when he perceived the immensity of the heavens he was led on the road towards the vast Infinity of that Power which encompasses the Universe; when he saw the rays of the sun reaching from such sublimities even to ourselves he began to believe, by the means of such phenomena, that the activities of the Divine Intelligence did not fail to descend from the heights of Deity even to each one of us; for if a single luminary can occupy everything alike that lies beneath it with the force of light, and, more than that, can, while lending itself to all who can use it, still remain self-centred and undissipated, how much more shall the Creator of that luminary become \"all in all,\" as the Apostle speaks, and come into each with such a measure of Himself as each subject of His influence can receive! Nay, look only at an ear of corn, at the germinating of some plant, at a ripe bunch of grapes, at the beauty of early autumn, whether in fruit or flower, at the grass springing unbidden, at the mountain reaching up with its summit to the height of the ether, at the springs on its slopes bursting from those swelling breasts, and running in rivers through the glens, at the sea receiving those streams from every direction and yet remaining within its limits, with waves edged by the stretches of beach and never stepping beyond those fixed boundaries of continent: look at these and such-like sights, and how can the eye of reason fail to find in them all that our education for Realities requires? Has a man who looks at such spectacles procured for himself only a slight power for the enjoyment of those delights beyond? Not to speak of the studies which sharpen the mind towards moral excellence geometry, I mean, and astronomy, and the knowledge of the truth that the science of numbers gives, and every method that furnishes a proof of the unknown and a conviction of the known, and, before all these, the philosophy contained in the inspired Writings, which affords a complete purification to those who educate themselves thereby in the mysteries of God. But the man who has acquired the knowledge of none of these things and has not even been conducted by the material cosmos to the perception of the beauties above it, and passes through life with his mind in a kind of tender, unformed, and untrained state, he is not the man that is likely to be placed amongst the same surroundings as our argument has indicated that other man, before spoken of, to be placed; so that, in this view, it can no longer be maintained that, in the two supposed and completely opposite cases, the one who has taken no part in life is more blessed than the one who has taken a noble part in it. Certainly, in comparison with one who has lived all his life in sin, not only the innocent babe but even one who has never come into the world at all will be blessed. We learn as much too in the case of Judas, from the sentence pronounced upon him in the Gospels[fn-29-P2946_1992401:29-nf] ; namely, that when we think of such men, that which never existed is to be preferred to that which has existed in such sin. For, as to the latter, on account of the depth of the ingrained evil, the chastisement in the way of purgation will be extended into infinity[fn-29-P2947_1992692:30-nf] ; but as for what has never existed, how can any torment touch it?-However, notwithstanding that, the man who institutes a comparison between the infantine immature life and that of perfect virtue, must himself be pronounced immature for so judging of realities. Do you, then, in consequence of this, ask the reason why so and so, quite tender in age, is quietly taken away from amongst the living? Do you ask what the Divine wisdom contemplates in this? Well, if you are thinking of all those infants who are proofs of illicit connections, and so are made away with by their parents, you are not justified in calling to account, for such wickedness, that God Who will surely bring to judgment the unholy deeds done in this way. In the case, on the other hand, of any infant who, though his parents have nurtured him, and have with nursing and supplication spent earnest care upon him, nevertheless does not continue in this world, but succumbs to a sickness even unto death, which is unmistakably the sole cause of it, we venture upon the following considerations. It is a sign of the perfection of God's providence, that He not only heals maladies[fn-29-P2948_1994079:31-nf] that have come into existence, but also provides that some should be never mixed up at all in the things which He has forbidden; it is reasonable, that is, to expect that He Who knows the future equally with the past should check the advance of an infant to complete maturity, in order that the evil may not be developed which His foreknowledge has detected in his future life, and in order that a lifetime granted to one whose evil dispositions will be lifelong may not become the actual material for his vice. We shall better explain what we are thinking of by an illustration.

The poisons are as many as are the kinds of it, the disasters as many as are also the species of it, the pains as many as are also the colours of it. Nicander writes on the subject of scorpions, and depicts them. And yet to smite with the tail-which tail will be whatever is prolonged from the hindmost part of the body, and scourges-is the one movement which they all use when making an assault. Wherefore that succession of knots in the scorpion, which in the inside is a thin poisoned veinlet, rising up with a bow-like bound, draws tight a barbed sting at the end, after the manner of an engine for shooting missiles. From which circumstance they also call after the scorpion, the warlike implement which, by its being drawn back, gives an impetus to the arrows. The point in their case is also a duct of extreme minuteness, to inflict the wound; and where it penetrates, it pours out poison. The usual time of danger is the summer season: fierceness hoists the sail when the wind is from the south and the south-west. Among cures, certain substances supplied by nature have very great efficacy; magic also puts on some bandage; the art of healing counteracts with lancet and cup. For some, making haste, take also beforehand a protecting draught; but sexual intercourse drains it off, and they are dry again. We have faith for a defence, if we are not smitten with distrust itself also, in immediately making the sign[fn-109-P10964_3080850:2-nf] and adjuring,[fn-109-P10965_3081068:3-nf] and besmearing the heel with the beast. Finally, we often aid in this way even the heathen, seeing we have been endowed by God with that power which the apostle first used when he despised the viper's bite.[fn-109-P10966_3081603:4-nf] What, then, does this pen of yours offer, if faith is safe by what it has of its own? That it may be safe by what it has of its own also at other times, when it is subjected to scorpions of its own. These, too, have a troublesome littleness, and are of different sorts, and are armed in one manner, and are stirred up at a definite time, and that not another than one of burning heat. This among Christians is a season of persecution. When, therefore, faith is greatly agitated, and the Church burning, as represented by the bush,[fn-109-P10967_3082153:5-nf] then the Gnostics break out, then the Valentinians creep forth, then all the opponents of martyrdom bubble up, being themselves also hot to strike, penetrate, kill. For, because they know that many are artless and also inexperienced, and weak moreover, that a very great number in truth are Christians who veer about with the wind and conform to its moods, they perceive that they are never to be approached more than when fear has opened the entrances to the soul, especially when some display of ferocity has already arrayed with a crown the faith of martyrs. Therefore, drawing along the tail hitherto, they first of all apply it to the feelings, or whip with it as if on empty space. Innocent persons undergo such suffering. So that you may suppose the speaker to be a brother or a heathen of the better sort. A sect troublesome to nobody so dealt with! Then they pierce. Men are perishing without a reason. For that they are perishing, and without a reason, is the first insertion. Then they now strike mortally. But the unsophisticated souls[fn-109-P10968_3083217:6-nf] know not what is written, and what meaning it bears, where and when and before whom we must confess, or ought, save that this, to die for God, is, since He preserves me, not even artlessness, but folly, nay madness. If He kills me, how will it be His duty to preserve me? Once for all Christ died for us, once for all He was slain that we might not be slain. If He demands the like from me in return, does He also look for salvation from my death by violence? Or does God importune for the blood of men, especially if He refuses that of bulls and he-goats?[fn-109-P10969_3083820:7-nf] Assuredly He had rather have the repentance than the death of the sinner.[fn-109-P10970_3083908:8-nf] And how is He eager for the death of those who are not sinners? Whom will not these, and perhaps other subtle devices containing heretical poisons, pierce either for doubt if not for destruction, or for irritation if not for death? As for you, therefore, do you, if faith is on the alert, smite on the spot the scorpion with a curse, so far as you can, with your sandal, and leave it dying in its own stupefaction? But if it gluts the wound, it drives the poison inwards, and makes it hasten into the bowels; forthwith all the former senses become dull, the blood of the mind freezes, the flesh of the spirit pines away, loathing for the Christian name is accompanied by a sense of sourness. Already the understanding also seeks for itself a place where it may throw up; and thus, once for all, the weakness with which it has been smitten breathes out wounded faith either in heresy or in heathenism. And now the present state of matters is such, that we are in the midst of an intense heat, the very dog-star of persecution,-a state originating doubtless with the dog-headed one himself.[fn-109-P10971_3085018:9-nf] Of some Christians the fire, of others the sword, of others the beasts, have made trial; others are hungering in prison for the martyrdoms of which they have had a taste in the meantime by being subjected to clubs and claws[fn-109-P10972_3085266:10-nf] besides. We ourselves, having been appointed for pursuit, are like hares being hemmed in from a distance; and heretics go about according to their wont. Therefore the state of the times has prompted me to prepare by my pen, in opposition to the little beasts which trouble our sect, our antidote against poison, that I may thereby effect cures. You who read will at the same time drink. Nor is the draught bitter. If the utterances of the Lord are sweeter than honey and the honeycombs,[fn-109-P10973_3085799:11-nf] the juices are from that source. If the promise of God flows with milk and honey,[fn-109-P10974_3085899:12-nf] the ingredients which go to make that draught have the smack of this. \"But woe to them who turn sweet into bitter, and light into darkness.\"[fn-109-P10975_3086058:13-nf] For, in like manner, they also who oppose martyrdoms, representing salvation to be destruction, transmute sweet into bitter, as well as light into darkness; and thus, by preferring this very wretched life to that most blessed one, they put bitter for sweet, as well as darkness for light.","title":"Scorpiace.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":19,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_46_the_first_apology_of_justin","source_chapter":56,"source_paragraph":"182","folder":"ANF-01","text":"But those who hand down the myths which the poets have made, adduce no proof to the youths who learn them; and we proceed to demonstrate that they have been uttered by the influence of the wicked demons, to deceive and lead astray the human race. For having heard it proclaimed through the prophets that the Christ was to come, and that the ungodly among men were to be punished by fire, they put forward many to be called sons of Jupiter, under the impression that they would be able to produce in men the idea that the things which were said with regard to Christ were mere marvellous tales, like the things which were said by the poets. And these things were said both among the Greeks and among all nations where they [the demons] heard the prophets foretelling that Christ would specially be believed in; but that in hearing what was said by the prophets they did not accurately understand it, but imitated what was said of our Christ, like men who are in error, we will make plain. The prophet Moses, then, was, as we have already said, older than all writers; and by him, as we have also said before, it was thus predicted: \"There shall not fail a prince from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until He come for whom it is reserved; and He shall be the desire of the Gentiles, binding His foal to the vine, washing His robe in the blood of the grape.\"[fn-38-P3872_722615:115-nf] The devils, accordingly, when they heard these prophetic words, said that Bacchus was the son of Jupiter, and gave out that he was the discoverer of the vine, and they number wine[fn-38-P3873_722817:116-nf] [or, the ass] among his mysteries; and they taught that, having been torn in pieces, he ascended into heaven. And because in the prophecy of Moses it had not been expressly intimated whether He who was to come was the Son of God, and whether He would, riding on the foal, remain on earth or ascend into heaven, and because the name of \"foal\" could mean either the foal of an ass or the foal of a horse, they, not knowing whether He who was foretold would bring the foal of an ass or of a horse as the sign of His coming, nor whether He was the Son of God, as we said above, or of man, gave out that Bellerophon, a man born of man, himself ascended to heaven on his horse Pegasus. And when they heard it said by the other prophet Isaiah, that He should be born of a virgin, and by His own means ascend into heaven, they pretended that Perseus was spoken of. And when they knew what was said, as has been cited above, in the prophecies written aforetime, \"Strong as a giant to run his course,\"[fn-38-P3874_724127:117-nf] they said that Hercules was strong, and had journeyed over the whole earth.

It is because of an indubitable mystery that He appears not to acknowledge His mother. from whom as the Bridegroom He came forth, when He says to her, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.\" What is this? Did He come to the marriage for the purpose of teaching men to treat their mothers with contempt? Surely he to whose marriage He had come was taking a wife with the view of having children, and surely he wished to be honored by those children he would beget: had Jesus then come to the marriage in order to dishonor His mother, when marriages are celebrated and wives married with the view of having children, whom God commands to honor their parents? Beyond all doubt, brethren, there is some mystery lurking here. It is really a matter of such importance that some,-of whom the apostle, as we have mentioned before, has forewarned us to be on our guard, saying, \"I fear, lest, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his subtilty, so also your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and chastity which is in Christ,\"-taking away from the credibility of the gospel, and asserting that Jesus was not born of the Virgin Mary, used to endeavor to draw from this place an argument in support of their error, so far as to say, How could she be His mother, to whom He said, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee?\" Wherefore we must answer them, and show them why the Lord said this, test in their insanity they appear to themselves to have discovered something contrary to wholesome belief, whereby the chastity of the virgin bride may be corrupted, that is, whereby the faith of the Church may be injured. For in very deed, brethren, their faith is corrupted who prefer a lie to the truth. For these men, who appear to honor Christ in such wise as to deny that He had flesh, do nothing short of proclaiming Him a liar. Now they who build up a lie in men, what do they but drive the truth out of them? They let in the devil, they drive Christ out; they let in an adulterer, shut out the bridegroom, being evidently paranymphs, or rather, the panderers of the serpent. For it is for this object they speak, that the serpent may possess, and Christ be shut out. How doth the serpent possess? When a lie possesses. When falsehood possesses, then the serpent possesses; when truth possesses, then Christ possesses. For Himself has said, \"I am the truth;\"[fn-5-P573_261580:5-nf] but of that other He said, \"He stood not in the truth, because the truth is not him.\"[fn-5-P574_261682:6-nf] And Christ is the truth in such wise that thou shouldst receive the whole to be true in Him. The true Word, God equal with the Father, true soul, true flesh, true man, true God, true nativity, true passion, true death, true resurrection. If thou say that any of these is false, rottenness enters, the worms of falsehood are bred of the poison of the serpent, and nothing sound will remain.","title":"Tractate VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":44,"source_paragraph":"319","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"Moreover, the prescription that twelve bells[fn-43-P4370_900993:115-nf] be attached to the [robe] of the high priest, which hung down to the feet, was a symbol of the twelve apostles, who depend on the power of Christ, the eternal Priest; and through their voice it is that all the earth has been filled with the glory and grace of God and of His Christ.

Therefore, although you act wrongfully, I shall continue to reply to any proposition you shall bring forward, and to any contradiction which you make; and, in fact, I do the very same to all men of every nation, who wish to examine along with me, or make inquiry at me, regarding this subject. Accordingly, if you had bestowed attention on the Scriptures previously quoted by me, you would already have understood, that those who are saved of your own nation are saved through this[fn-46-P4617_977300:242-nf] [man], and partake of His lot; and you would not certainly have asked me about this matter. I shall again repeat the words of David previously quoted by me, and beg of you to comprehend them, and not to act wrongfully, and stir each other up to give merely some contradiction. The words which David speaks, then, are these: `The Lord has reigned; let the nations be angry: [it is] He who sits upon the cherubim; let the earth be shaken. The Lord is great in Zion; and He is high above all the nations. Let them confess Thy great name, for it is fearful and holy; and the honour of the king loves judgment. Thou hast prepared equity; judgment and righteousness hast Thou performed in Jacob. Exalt the Lord our God, and worship the footstool of His feet; for He is holy. Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name; they called on the Lord, and He heard them. In the pillar of the cloud He spake to them; for they kept His testimonies and His commandments which He gave them.'[fn-46-P4618_978337:243-nf] And from the other words of David, also previously quoted, which you foolishly affirm refer to Solomon, [because] inscribed for Solomon, it can be proved that they do not refer to Solomon, and that this [Christ] existed before the sun, and that those of your nation who are saved shall be saved through Him. [The words] are these: `O God, give Thy judgment to the king, and Thy righteousness unto the king's son. He shall judge[fn-46-P4619_978788:244-nf] Thy people with righteousness, and Thy poor with judgment. The mountains shall take up peace to the people, and the little hills righteousness. He shall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the children of the needy, and shall abase the slanderer: and He shall co-endure with the sun, and before the moon unto all generation'; and so on until, `His name endureth before the sun, and all tribes of the earth shall be blessed in Him. All nations shall call Him blessed. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things: and blessed be His glorious name for ever and ever: and the whole earth shall be filled with His glory. Amen, Amen.'[fn-46-P4620_979495:245-nf] And you remember from other words also spoken by David, and which I have mentioned before, how it is declared that He would come forth from the highest heavens, and again return to the same places, in order that you may recognise Him as God coming forth from above, and man living among men; and [how it is declared] that He will again appear, and they who pierced Him shall see Him, and shall bewail Him. [The words] are these: `The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge: They are not speeches or words whose voices are heard. Their sound has gone out through all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.

For when they tell that Bacchus, son of Jupiter, was begotten by [Jupiter's] intercourse with Semele, and that he was the discoverer of the vine; and when they relate, that being torn in pieces, and having died, he rose again, and ascended to heaven; and when they introduce wine[fn-46-P4680_996019:260-nf] into his mysteries, do I not perceive that [the devil] has imitated the prophecy announced by the patriarch Jacob, and recorded by Moses?

And having raised the dead, and causing them to live, by His deeds He compelled the men who lived at that time to recognise Him. But though they saw such works, they asserted it was magical art. For they dared to call Him a magician, and a deceiver of the people. Yet He wrought such works, and persuaded those who were [destined to] believe on Him; for even if any one be labouring under a defect of body, yet be an observer of the doctrines delivered by Him, He shall raise him up at His second advent perfectly sound, after He has made him immortal, and incorruptible, and free from grief.","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":19,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_41_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"\"Hence Paul himself, who was one of the perfect, says in another Epistle \"We speak wisdom among them that are perfect.\"[fn-88-P8862_2272223:4-nf] This then is what is commanded, that those mystic and secret things, which are full of divine truth, should be spoken by each man to his neighhour, so that day unto day may utter speech and night to night shew knowledge,[fn-88-P8863_2272461:5-nf] that is, that a man should show all those clear and lucid truths which he knows to those to whom the words can be worthily addressed: \"Ye are the light of the world.\"[fn-88-P8864_2272643:6-nf] On the other hand, he should exhibit everything involved in darkness and wrapped up in the mist of symbols to others who are themselves nothing but mist and darkness, those of whom it is said \"And there was darkness under his feet,\"[fn-88-P8865_2272892:7-nf] that is, of course, under the feet of God.

David also draws the distinction in a few words between the faults due to his own will and the incentives of vice when he says[fn-92-P9262_2491981:14-nf] \"Cleanse thou me from my secret faults, and keep back thy servant from alien sins.\" We read also in Ecclesiastes[fn-92-P9263_2492131:15-nf] \"If the spirit of a ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place;\" from which we may clearly see that we commit sin if we give opportunity to the power which rises up, and if we fail to hurl down headlong the enemy who is scaling our walls. As to your threatening your brothers, that is, those who accuse you, with eternal fire in company with the devil, it seems to me that you do not so much drag your brethren down as raise the devil up, since he, according to you, is to be punished only with the same fires as Christian men. But you well know, I think, what eternal fires mean according to the ideas of Origen, namely, the sinners' conscience, and the remorse which galls their hearts within. These ideas he thinks are intended in the words of Isaiah:[fn-92-P9264_2492908:16-nf] \"Their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched.\" And in the words addressed to Babylon:[fn-92-P9265_2493031:17-nf] \"Thou hast coals of fire, thou shalt sit upon them, these shall be thy help.\" So also in the Psalm it is said to the penitent;[fn-92-P9266_2493420:18-nf] \"What shall be given to thee, or what shall be done more for thee against thee false tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with desolating coals;\" which means (according to him) that the arrows of God's precepts (concerning which the Prophet says in another place,[fn-92-P9267_2493718:19-nf] \"I lived in misery while a thorn pierces me\") should wound and strike through the crafty tongue, and make an end of sins in it. He also interprets the place where the Lord testifies saying:[fn-92-P9268_2493970:20-nf] \"I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish that it may burn\" as meaning \"I wish that all may repent, and burn out through the Holy spirit their vices and their sins; for I am he of whom it is written,[fn-92-P9269_2494197:21-nf] \"Our God is a consuming fire;\" it is no great thing then to say this of the devil, since it is prepared also for men.\" You ought rather to have said, if you wished to avoid the suspicion of believing in the salvation of the devil;[fn-92-P9270_2494461:22-nf] \"Thou hast become perdition and shalt not be for ever;\" and as the Lord speaks to Job concerning the devil,[fn-92-P9271_2494600:23-nf] \"Behold his hope shall fail him and in the sight of all shall he be cast down. I will not arouse him as one that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance? Who has first given to me that I may return it to him? for all things beneath the heaven are mine. I will not spare him and his words that are powerful and fashioned to turn away wrath.\" Hence, these things may pass as the work of a plain man. Their bearing is evident enough to those who understand these matters; but to the unlearned they may wear the appearance of innocence.","title":"Book II.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":19,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_133_homily_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3.

But they hate, forsooth, the city in which their Lord was slain ious men, and merciful! they much grieve that Christ was slain, and in men they slay Christ! But He loved that city, and pitied it: from it He bade the preaching of Him begin, \"beginning at Jerusalem.\" He made there the beginning of the preaching of His name: and thou shrinkest back with horror from having communion with that city![fn-40-P4066_2233409:10-nf] No marvel that being cut off thou hatest the root.

Where had the Church its commencement, but where the Holy Ghost came from heaven, and filled the hundred and twenty sitting in one place? That number twelve was made tenfold. They sat, an hundred and twenty persons, and the Holy Ghost came, \"and filled the whole place, and there came a sound, as it were the rushing of a mighty wind, and there were cloven tongues like as of fire.\" Ye have heard the Acts of the Apostles: this was the lesson read today:[fn-40-P4069_2234795:13-nf] \"They began to speak with tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.\" And all who were on the spot, Jews who were come from divers nations, recognised each his own tongue, and marvelled that those unlearned and ignorant men had on the sudden learned not one or two tongues, but the tongues of all nations whatsoever. There, then, where all tongues sounded, there was it betokened that all tongues should believe. But these men, who much love Christ, and therefore refuse to communicate with the city which i killed Christ, so honor Christ as to affirm that He is left to two tongues, the Latin and the Punic, i.e. African. Christ possess only two tongues! For there are but these two tongues on the side of Donatus, more they have not. Let us awake, my brethren, let us rather see the gift of the Spirit of God, and let us believe the things spoken before concerning Him, and let us see fulfilled the things spoken before in the Psalm: \"There are neither speeches nor discourses,[fn-40-P4070_2235892:14-nf] but their voices are heard among them.[fn-40-P4071_2235959:15-nf] And lest haply the case be so that the tongues themselves came to one place, and not rather that the gift of Christ came to all tongues, hear what follows: \"Into all the earth is their sound gone out, and unto the ends of the world their words.\" Wherefore this? Because \"in the sun hath He set His tabernacle,\" i.e., in the open light. His tabernacle, His flesh: His tabernacle, His Church: \"in the sun\" it is set; not in the night, but in the day. But why do those not acknowledge it? Return to the lesson at the place where it ended yesterday, and see why they do not acknowledge it: \"He that hateth his brother, walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.\" For us then, let us see what follows, and not be in darkness. How shall we not be in darkness? If we love the brethren. How is it proved that we love the brotherhood?

For He it is who \"as a bride-groom goeth forth from his bride-chamber; He exulted as a giant to run his way. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and His return unto the ends of it.\"[fn-102-P10217_3185294:88-nf] Because, even to the highest, \"not any one hath ascended into heaven save He who came down from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-102-P10218_3185452:89-nf] Repeating this same thing, He says: \"Father, glorify me with that glory wherewith I was with Thee before the world was.\"[fn-102-P10219_3185593:90-nf] And if this Word came down from heaven as a bridegroom to the flesh, that by the assumption of flesh He might ascend thither as the Son of man, whence the Son of God had descended as the Word, reasonably, while by the mutual connection both flesh wears the Word of God, and the Son of God assumes the frailty of the flesh; when the flesh being espoused ascending thither, whence without the flesh it had descended, it at length receives that glory which in being shown to have had before the foundation of the world, it is most manifestly proved. to be God. And, nevertheless, while the world itself is said to have been founded after Him, it is found to have been created by Him; by that very divinity in Him whereby, the world was made, both His glory and His authority are proved. Moreover, if, whereas it is the property of none but God to know the secrets of the heart, Christ beholds the secrets of the heart; and if, whereas it belongs to none but God to remit sins, the same Christ remits sins; and if, whereas it is the portion of no man to come from heaven, He descended by coming from heaven; and if, whereas this word can be true of no man, \"I and the Father are one,\"[fn-102-P10220_3186818:91-nf] Christ alone declared this word out of the consciousness of His divinity; and if, finally, the Apostle Thomas, instructed in all the proofs and conditions of Christ's divinity, says in reply to Christ, \"My Lord and my God; \"[fn-102-P10221_3187061:92-nf] and if, besides, the Apostle Paul says, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom Christ came according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for evermore,\"[fn-102-P10222_3187236:93-nf] writing in his epistles; and if the same apostle declares that he was ordained \"an apostle not by men, nor of man, but by Jesus Christ; \"[fn-102-P10223_3187392:94-nf] and if the same contends that he learned the Gospel not from men or by man, but received it from Jesus Christ, reasonably Christ is God. Therefore, in this respect, one of two things must needs be established. For since it is evident that all things were made by Christ, He is either before all things, since all things were by Him, and so He is justly God; or because He is man He is subsequent to all things, and justly nothing was made by Him. But we cannot say that nothing was made by Him, when we observe it written that all things were made by Him. He is not therefore subsequent to all things; that is, He is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since God is prior to all things. For He is before all things, because all things are by Him, while if He were only man, nothing would be by Him; or if all things were by Him, He would not be man only, because if He were only man, all things would not be by Him; nay, nothing would be by Him. What, then, do they reply? That nothing is by Him, so that He is man only? How then are all things by Him? Therefore He is not man only, but God also, since all things are by Him; so that we reasonably ought to understand that Christ is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since by Him all things were made.

Shall we bring an accusation against Solomon, or reject his former words because of his fall in after-life? Shall we say that the words are those of Wisdom herself, as it were of Knowledge and the Creator-word, in accordance with which all things were made? For Scripture often personifies many even lifeless objects; as for instance, \"The Sea said\"[fn-44-P4484_1413239:2-nf] so and so; and, \"The Depth saith, It is not in me;\"[fn-44-P4485_1413308:3-nf] and \"The Heavens declare the glory of God ;\"[fn-44-P4486_1413372:4-nf] and again a command is given to the Sword;[fn-44-P4487_1413430:5-nf] and the Mountains and Hills are asked the reason of their skipping.[fn-44-P4488_1413516:6-nf] We do not allege any of these, though some of our predecessors used them as powerful arguments.

What else could it be? Since then we find here clearly both the Created and the Begetteth Me, the argument is simple. Whatever we find joined with a cause we are to refer to the Manhood, but all that is absolute and unoriginate we are to reckon to the account of His Godhead. Well, then, is not this \"Created\" said in connection with a cause? He created Me, it so says, as the beginning of His ways, with a view to his works. Now, the Works of His Hands are verity and judgment;[fn-44-P4489_1414475:7-nf] for whose sake He was anointed with Godhead;;[fn-44-P4490_1414533:8-nf] for this anointing is of the Manhood; but the \"He begetteth Me\" is not connected with a cause; or it is for you to shew the adjunct.

It is manifest to us all who possess the Gospel narratives, which Celsus does not appear even to have read, that Jesus selected twelve apostles, and that of these Matthew alone was a tax-gatherer; that when he calls them indiscriminately sailors, he probably means James and John, because they left their ship and their father Zebedee, and followed Jesus; for Peter and his brother Andrew, who employed a net to gain their necessary subsistence, must be classed not as sailors, but as the Scripture describes them, as fishermen. The Lebes[fn-79-P7940_1919782:115-nf] also, who was a follower of Jesus, may have been a tax-gatherer; but he was not of the number of the apostles, except according to a statement in one of the copies of Mark's Gospel.[fn-79-P7941_1919979:116-nf] And we have not ascertained the employments of the remaining disciples, by which they earned their livelihood before becoming disciples of Jesus. I assert, therefore, in answer to such statements as the above, that it is clear to all who are able to institute an intelligent and candid examination into the history of the apostles of Jesus, that it was by help of a divine power that these men taught Christianity, and succeeded in leading others to embrace the word of God. For it was not any power of speaking, or any orderly arrangement of their message, according to the arts of Grecian dialectics or rhetoric, which was in them the effective cause of converting their hearers. Nay, I am of opinion that if Jesus had selected some individuals who were wise according to the apprehension of the multitude, and who were fitted both to think and speak so as to please them, and had used such as the ministers of His doctrine, He would most justly have been suspected of employing artifices, like those philosophers who are the leaders of certain sects, and consequently the promise respecting the divinity of His doctrine would not have manifested itself; for had the doctrine and the preaching consisted in the persuasive utterance and arrangement of words, then faith also, like that of the philosophers of the world in their opinions, would have been through the wisdom of men, and not through the power of God. Now, who is there on seeing fishermen and tax-gatherers, who had not acquired even the merest elements of learning (as the Gospel relates of them, and in respect to which Celsus believes that they speak the truth, inasmuch as it is their own ignorance which they record), discoursing boldly not only among the Jews of faith in Jesus, but also preaching Him with success among other nations, would not inquire whence they derived this power of persuasion, as theirs was certainly not the common method followed by the multitude? And who would not say that the promise, \"Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men,\"[fn-79-P7942_1922053:117-nf] had been accomplished by Jesus in the history of His apostles by a sort of divine power? And to this also, Paul, referring in terms of commendation, as we have stated a little above, says: \"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.\"[fn-79-P7943_1922470:118-nf] For, according to the predictions in the prophets, foretelling the preaching of the Gospel, \"the Lord gave the word in great power to them who preached it, even the King of the powers of the Beloved,\"[fn-79-P7944_1922699:119-nf] in order that the prophecy might be fulfilled which said, \"His words shall run very swiftly.\"[fn-79-P7945_1922831:120-nf] And we see that \"the voice of the apostles of Jesus has gone forth into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world,\"[fn-79-P7946_1922983:121-nf] On this account are they who hear the word powerfully proclaimed filled with power, which they manifest both by their dispositions and their lives, and by struggling even to death on behalf of the truth; while some are altogether empty, although they profess to believe in God through Jesus, inasmuch as, not possessing any divine power, they have the appearance only of being converted to the word of God. And although I have previously mentioned a Gospel declaration uttered by the Saviour, I shall nevertheless quote it again, as appropriate to the present occasion, as it confirms both the divine manifestation of our Saviour's foreknowledge regarding the preaching of His Gospel, and the power of His word, which without the aid of teachers gains the mastery over those who yield their assent to persuasion accompanied with divine power; and the words of Jesus referred to are, \"The harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth labourers into His harvest.\"[fn-79-P7947_1924035:122-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":19,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_58_book_i","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"135","folder":"ANF-01","text":"8.

I should like to say that they were incapable of movement in the direction of evil, and susceptible only of the movement of good, as being about God, and illumined with the first rays from God-for earthly beings have but the second illumination; but I am obliged to stop short of saying that, and to conceive and speak of them only as difficult to move because of him,[fn-49-P4904_1608739:21-nf] who for his splendour was called Lucifer, but became and is called Darkness through his pride; and the apostate hosts who are subject to him, creators of evil[fn-49-P4905_1609408:22-nf] by their revolt against good and our inciters.","title":"Oration XXXVIII","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":19,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_140_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5. But there is another sentence, which seems contrary to this if it have not one that understands.[fn-45-P4582_2471422:21-nf] Namely, it is said in a certain place of the Psalms, \"The fear of the Lord is chaste, enduring forever.\"[fn-45-P4583_2471551:22-nf] He shows us an eternal fear, but a chaste. But if he there shows us an eternal fear, does this epistle perchance contradict him, when it saith, \"There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear?\" Let us interrogate both utterances of God. One is the Spirit, though the books two, though the mouths two though the tongues two. For this is said by the mouth of John, that by the mouth of David: but think not that the Spirit is more than one. If one breath fills two pipes [of the double-flute], cannot one Spirit fill two hearts, move two tongues? But if two pipes filled by one breathing sound in unison, can two tongues filled with the Spirit or Breathing of God make a dissonance? There is then an unison there, there is a harmony, only it requires one that can hear. Behold, this Spirit of God hath breathed into and filled two hearts, hath moved two tongues: and we have heard from the one tongue, \"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear;\" we have heard from the other, \"The fear of the Lord is chaste, enduring for ever.\" How is this?The notes seem to jar. Not so: rouse thine ears: mark the melody. It is not without cause that in the one place there is added that word, chaste, in the other it is not added: but because thereis one fear which is called chaste, and there is another fear which is not called chaste. Let us mark the difference between these two fears, and so understand the harmony of the flutes. How are we to understand, or how to distinguish? Mark, my beloved. There are men who fear God, lest they be cast intohell, lest haply they burn with the devil in everlasting fire. This is the fear which introduces charity: but it comes that it may depart. For if thou as yet fearest God because of punishments, not yet dost thou love Him whom thou in such sort fearest. Thou dost not desire the good things, but art afraid of the evil things. Yet because thou art afraid of the evil things, thou correctest thyself and beginnest to desire the good things. When once thou hast begun to desire the good, there shall be in thee the chaste fear. What is the chaste fear? The fear lest thou lose the good things themselves. Mark! It is one thing to fear God lest He cast thee into hell with the devil, and another thing to fear God lest He forsake thee. The fear by which thou fearest lest thou be cast into hell with the devil, is not yet chaste; for it comes not from the love of God, but from the fear of punishment: but when thou fearest God lest His presence forsake thee, thou embracest Him, thou longest to enjoy God Himself.","title":"Homily IX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_62_book_iv_","source_chapter":35,"source_paragraph":"218","folder":"ANF-01","text":"13.

But because this passage itself signified that the gospel should be found hereafter in all nations and languages, and that the body of Christ should sound forth throughout all the world in every tongue, therefore he goes on to say, \"Their sound is gone out throughout all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.\" Hence it is that the true Church is hidden from no one. And hence comes that which the Lord Himself says in the gospel, \"A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.\"[fn-49-P4964_2434749:108-nf] And therefore David continues in the same psalm, \"In the sun hath He placed His tabernacle,\" that is, in the open light of day; as we read in the Book of Kings, \"For thou didst it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.\"[fn-49-P4965_2435025:109-nf] And He Himself is \"as a bridegroom coming out of His chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run His race.

For they were driven from the ancient palaces by Catholic emperors acting through judges, while you are not even driven forth by the mandates of the emperors themselves from the basilicas of unity.

But those, on the other hand, who have made some advance, and much more those who are perfectly trained in the art, accomplish easily and successfully the objects of their labours, and have great pleasure in the work, and would choose rather thus, in the discharge of the pursuits to which they are accustomed, to finish and carry perfectly out what their efforts aim at, than to be made masters of all those things which are reckoned advantageous among men. Yea, Democritus himself, as it is reported, averred that he would prefer the discovery of one true cause to being put in possession of the kingdom of Persia. And that was the declaration of a man who had only a vain and groundless conception of the causes of things,[fn-14-P1466_419095:79-nf] inasmuch as he started with an unfounded principle, and an erroneous hypothesis, and did not discern the real root and the common law of necessity in the constitution of natural things, and held as the greatest wisdom the apprehension of things that come about simply in an unintelligent and random way, and set up chance[fn-14-P1467_419554:80-nf] as the mistress and queen of things universal, and even things divine, and endeavoured to demonstrate that all things happen by the determination of the same, although at the same time he kept it outside the sphere of the life of men, and convicted those of senselessness who worshipped it. At any rate, at the very beginning of his Precepts[fn-14-P1468_419909:81-nf] he speaks thus: \"Men have made an image[fn-14-P1469_419966:82-nf] of chance, as a cover[fn-14-P1470_420004:83-nf] for their own lack of knowledge. For intellect and chance are in their very nature antagonistic to each other.[fn-14-P1471_420131:84-nf] And men have maintained that this greatest adversary to intelligence is its sovereign. Yea, rather, they completely subvert and do away, with the one, while they establish the other in its place. For they do not celebrate intelligence as the fortunate,[fn-14-P1472_420570:85-nf] but they laud chance[fn-14-P1473_420606:86-nf] as the most intelligent.\"[fn-14-P1474_420654:87-nf] Moreover, those who attend to things conducing to the good of life, take special pleasure in what serves the interests of those of the same race with themselves, and seek the recompense of praise and glory in return for labours undertaken in behalf of the general good; while some exert themselves as purveyors of ways and means,[fn-14-P1475_421006:88-nf] others as magistrates, others as physicians, others as statesmen; and even philosophers pride themselves greatly in their efforts after the education of men. Will, then, Epicurus or Democritus be bold enough to assert that in the exertion of philosophizing they only cause distress to themselves? Nay, rather they will reckon this a pleasure of mind second to none. For even though they maintain the opinion that the good is pleasure, they will be ashamed to deny that philosophizing is the greater pleasure to them.[fn-14-P1476_421539:89-nf] But as to the gods, of whom the poets among them sing that they are the \"bestowers of good gifts,\"[fn-14-P1477_421739:90-nf] these philosophers scoffingly celebrate them in strains like these: \"The gods are neither the bestowers nor the sharers in any good thing.\" And in what manner, forsooth, can they demonstrate that there are gods at all, when they neither perceive their presence, nor discern them as the doers of aught, wherein, indeed, they resemble those who, in their admiration and wonder at the sun and the moon and the stars, have held these to have been named gods,[fn-14-P1478_422255:91-nf] from their running[fn-14-P1479_422287:92-nf] such courses: when, further, they do not attribute to them any function or power of operation,[fn-14-P1480_422404:93-nf] so as to bold them gods[fn-14-P1481_422470:94-nf] from their constituting,[fn-14-P1482_422514:95-nf] that is, from their making objects,[fn-14-P1483_422573:96-nf] for thereby in all truth the one maker and operator of all things must be God: and when, in fine, they do not set forth any administration, or judgment, or beneficence of theirs in relation to men, so that we might be bound either by fear or by reverence to worship them? Has Epicurus then been able, forsooth, to see beyond this world, and to overpass the precincts of heaven? or has he gone forth by some secret gates known to himself alone, and thus obtained sight of the gods in the void?[fn-14-P1484_423081:97-nf] and, deeming them blessed in their full felicity, and then becoming himself a passionate aspirant after such pleasure, and an ardent scholar in that life which they pursue in the void, does he now call upon all to participate in this felicity, and urge them thus to make themselves like the gods, preparing[fn-14-P1485_423480:98-nf] as their true symposium of blessedness neither heaven nor Olympus, as the poets feign, but the sheer void, and setting before them the ambrosia of atoms,[fn-14-P1486_423651:99-nf] and pledging them in[fn-14-P1487_423729:100-nf] nectar made of the same? However, in matters which have no relation to us, he introduces into his books a myriad oaths and solemn asseverations, swearing constantly both negatively and affirmatively by Jove, and making those whom he meets, and with whom he discusses his doctrines, swear also by the gods, not certainly that he fears them himself, or has any dread of perjury, but that he pronounces all this to be vain, and false, and idle, and unintelligible, and uses it simply as a kind of accompaniment to his words, just as he might also clear his throat, or spit, or twist his face, or move his hand. So completely senseless and empty a pretence was this whole matter of the naming of the gods, in his estimation. But this is also a very patent fact, that, being in fear of the Athenians after (the warning of) the death of Socrates, and being desirous of preventing his being taken for what he really was-an atheist-the subtle charlatan invented for them certain empty shadows of unsubstantial gods. But never surely did he look up to heaven with eyes of true intelligence, so as to hear the clear voice from above, which another attentive spectator did hear, and of which he testified when he said, \"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork.\"[fn-14-P1488_425051:101-nf] And never surely did he look down upon the world's surface with due reflection l for then would he have learned that \"the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord\"[fn-14-P1489_425235:102-nf] and that \"the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; \"[fn-14-P1490_425319:103-nf] and that, as we also read, \"After this the Lord looked upon the earth, and filled it with His blessings.

I may perhaps declare that matter more plainly still. One lights a candle: that candle, for example, so far as regards the little flame which shines there-that fire has light in itself; but thine eyes, which lay idle and saw nothing, in the absence of the candle, now have light also, but not in themselves. Further, if they turn away from the candle, they are made dark; if they turn to it, they are illumined. But certainly that fire shines so long as it exists: if thou wouldst take the light from it, thou dost also at the same time extinguish it; for without the light it cannot remain. But Christ is light inextinguishable and co-eternal with the Father, always bright, always shining, always burning: for if He were not burning, would it be said in the psalm, \"Nor is there any that can hide himself from his heat?\"[fn-11-P1146_701663:15-nf] But thou wast cold in thy sin; thou turnest that thou mayest become warm; if thou wilt turn away, thou wilt become cold.

Because by participation of that light thou art light. But if thou wilt depart from the light by which thou art enlightened, thou returnest to thy darkness. Not so Christ, not so the Word of God. But how not? \"As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself;\" so that He lives, not by participation, but unchangeably, and is altogether Himself life. \"So hath He given also to the Son to have life.\" Even as He hath, so has He given.

Let us, brethren, let us understand, and may the Lord enable us to understand, and enable us also to do what we understand. And if we know this, we know of a truth what the Lord doeth; for it is only the Lord that so enables us, and by such means only do we attain to His friendship. For just as there are two kinds of fear, which produce two classes of fearers; so there are two kinds of service, which produce two classes of servants. There is a fear, which perfect love casteth out;[fn-29-P2959_1690430:3-nf] and there is another fear, which is clean, and endureth for ever.[fn-29-P2960_1690514:4-nf] The fear that lies not in love, the apostle pointed to when he said, \"For ye have not received the spirit of service again to fear.\"[fn-29-P2961_1690662:5-nf] But he referred to the clean fear when he said, \"Be not high-minded, but fear.\"[fn-29-P2962_1690760:6-nf] In that fear which love casteth out, there has also to be cast out the service along with it: for both were joined together by the apostle, that is, the service and the fear, when he said, \"For ye have not received the spirit of service again to fear.\" And it was the servant connected with this kind of service that the Lord also had in His eye when He said, \"Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth.\" Certainly not the servant characterized by the clean fear, to whom it is said, \"Well done, thou good servant: enter thou into the joy of thy lord;\" but the servant who is characterized by the fear which love casteth out, of whom He elsewhere saith, \"The servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth ever.\"[fn-29-P2963_1691547:7-nf] Since, therefore, He hath given us power to become the sons of God,[fn-29-P2964_1691634:8-nf] let us not be servants, but sons: that, in some wonderful and indescribable but real way, we may as servants have the power not to be servants; servants, indeed, with that clean fear which distinguishes the servant that enters into the joy of his lord, but not servants with the fear that i has to be cast out, and which marketh him that abideth not in the house for ever. But let us bear in mind that it is the Lord that enableth us to serve so as not to be servants. And this it is that is unknown to the servant, who knoweth not what his Lord doeth; and who, when he doeth any good thing, is lifted up as if he did it himself, and not his Lord; and so, glories not in the Lord, but in himself, thereby deceiving himself, because glorying, as if he had not received.[fn-29-P2965_1692419:9-nf] But let us, beloved, in order that we may be the friends of the Lord, know what our Lord doeth. For it is He who makes us not only men, but also righteous, and not we ourselves. And who but He is the doer, in leading us to such a knowledge? For \"we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-29-P2966_1692829:10-nf] Whatever good there is, is freely given by Him. And so because this also is good, by Him who graciously imparteth all good is this gift of knowing likewise bestowed; that, in respect of all good things whatever, he that glorieth may glory in the Lord.[fn-29-P2967_1693101:11-nf] But the words that follow, \"But I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you,\" are so profound, that we must by no means compress them within the limits of the present discourse, but leave them over till another.","title":"Tractate LXXXV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_93_tractate_lxxxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1. The Lord, in exhorting His servants to endure with patience the hatred of the world, proposes to them no greater and better example than His own; seeing that, as the Apostle Peter says, \"Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His steps.\"[fn-30-P3018_1708560:1-nf] And if we really do so, we do it by His assistance, who said, \"Without me ye can do nothing.\" But further, to those to whom He had already said, \"If the world hate you, know that it hated me before it hated] you,\" He now also says in the word you have just been hearing, when the Gospel was read, \"Remember my word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.\" Now in saying, \"The servant is not greater than his lord,\" does He not clearly indicate how He would have us understand what He had said above, \"Henceforth I call you not servants\"?[fn-30-P3019_1709253:2-nf] For, you see, He calleth them servants. For what else can the words imply, \"The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you\"? It is clear, therefore, that when it is said, \"Henceforth I call you not servants,\" He is to be understood as speaking of that servant[fn-30-P3020_1709592:3-nf] who abideth not in the house for ever,[fn-30-P3021_1709667:4-nf] but is characterized by the fear which love casteth out;[fn-30-P3022_1709743:5-nf] whereas, when it is here said, \"The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you,\" that servant is meant who is distinguished by the clean fear which endureth for ever.[fn-30-P3023_1709980:6-nf] For this is the servant who is yet to hear, \"Well done, thou good servant: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"[fn-30-P3024_1710108:7-nf] ","title":"Tractate LXXXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_98_tractate_xciii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1. In the words preceding this chapter of the Gospel, the Lord strengthened His disciples to endure the hatred of their enemies, and prepared them also by His own example to become the more courageous in imitating Him: adding the promise, that the Holy Spirit should. come to bear witness of Him, and also that they themselves could become His witnesses, through the effectual working of His Spirit in their hearts. For such is His meaning when He saith, \"He shall bear witness of me, and ye also shall bear witness.\" That is to say, because He shall bear witness, ye also shall bear witness: He in your hearts, you in your voices; He by inspiration, you by utterance: that the words might be fulfilled, \"Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth.\"[fn-31-P3111_1746482:1-nf] For it would have been to little purpose to have exhorted them by His example, had He not also filled them with His Spirit. Just as we see that the Apostle Peter, after having heard His words, when He said, \"The servant is not greater than his lord: if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you;\"[fn-31-P3112_1746806:2-nf] and seen that already fulfilled in Him, wherein, had example been sufficient, he ought to have imitated the patient endurance of his Lord, yet succumbed and fell into denial, as utterly unable to bear what He saw his Master enduring. But when he really received the gift of the Holy Spirit, he preached Him whom he had denied; and whom he had been afraid to confess, he had no fear now in openly proclaiming. Already, indeed, had he been sufficiently taught by example to know what was proper to be done; but not yet was he inspired with the power to do what he knew: he had got instruction to stand, but not the strength to keep him from falling. But after this was supplied by the Holy Spirit, he preached Christ even to the death, whom, in his fear of death, he had previously denied. And so the Lord in this succeeding chapter, on which we have now to address you, saith, \"These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.\" As it is sung in the psalm, \"Great peace have they who love Thy law, and nothing shall offend them.\"[fn-31-P3113_1747871:3-nf] Properly enough, therefore, with the promise of the Holy Spirit, by whose operation in their hearts they should be made His witnesses, He added, \"These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.\" For when the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given unto us,[fn-31-P3114_1748193:4-nf] they have great peace who love God's law, so that nothing may offend them.","title":"Tractate XCIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":19,"verse":91,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_26_letter_viii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"10. This examination of the passages before us is, so far as my ability goes, sufficient. Now let us turn the discussion on those who attack the Holy Spirit, and cast down every high thing of their intellect that exalts itself against the knowledge of God.[fn-27-P2725_919582:65-nf] You say that the Holy Ghost is a creature. And every creature is a servant of the Creator, for \"all are thy servants.\"[fn-27-P2726_919720:66-nf] If then He is a servant, His holiness is acquired; and everything of which the holiness is acquired is receptive of evil; but the Holy Ghost being holy in essence is called \"fount of holiness,\"[fn-27-P2727_919932:67-nf] Therefore the Holy Ghost is not a creature. If He is not a creature. He is of one essence and substance with the Father.
