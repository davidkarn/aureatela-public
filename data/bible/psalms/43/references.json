Now the judgment of God is sometimes taken in a bad sense, as, for example, \"They that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment;\"[fn-24-P2450_1186690:96-nf] sometimes in a good sense, as, \"Save me, O God, by Thy name, and judge me by Thy strength.\"[fn-24-P2451_1186818:97-nf] This is easily understood When we consider that it is the judgment of God which separates the good from the evil, and sets the good at His right hand, that they may be delivered from evil, and not destroyed with the wicked; and it is for this reason that the Psalmist cried, \"Judge me, O God,\" and then added, as if in explanation, \"and distinguish my cause from that of an ungodly nation.\"[fn-24-P2452_1187226:98-nf] ","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":43,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"187","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"71. Another question which it is also usual to put is this: How comes it that Matthew and Luke have stated that the Lord said to His disciples that they were not to take a staff with them, whereas Mark puts the matter in this way: \"And He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only;\"[fn-17-P1788_731464:313-nf] and proceeds further in this strain, \"no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:\" thereby making it quite evident that his narrative belongs to the same place and circumstances with which the narratives of those others deal who have mentioned that the staff was not to be taken? Now this question admits of being solved on the principle of understanding that the staff which, according to Mark, was to be taken, bears one sense, and that the staff which,according to Matthew and Luke, was not to be taken with them, is to be interpreted in a different sense; just in the same way as we find the term \"temptation\" used in one meaning, when it is said, \"God tempteth no man,\"[fn-17-P1789_732347:314-nf] and in a different meaning where it is said, \"The Lord your God tempteth [proveth] you, to know whether ye love Him.\"[fn-17-P1790_732484:315-nf] For in the former case the temptation of seduction is intended; but in the latter the temptation of probation. Another parallel occurs in the case of the term \"judgment,\" which must be taken in one way, where it is said, \"They that have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment;\"[fn-17-P1791_732849:316-nf] and in another way, where it is said, \"Judge me, O God, and discern[fn-17-P1792_732945:317-nf] my cause, in respect of an ungodly nation.\"[fn-17-P1793_733006:318-nf] For the former refers to the judgment of damnation, and the latter to the judgment of discrimination.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":43,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_114_letter_lx_to_adelphius_bishop_and_confessor_against_the_arians_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"6. Such then, as we have above described, is the madness and daring of those men. But our faith is right, and starts from the teaching of the Apostles and tradition of the fathers, being confirmed both by the New Testament and the Old. For the Prophets say: `Send out Thy Word and Thy Truth[fn-101-P10110_3620532:26-nf] ,' and `Behold the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is being interpreted God with us[fn-101-P10111_3620686:27-nf] .' But what does that mean, if not that God has come in the Flesh? While the Apostolic tradition teaches in the words of blessed Peter, `Forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the Flesh;' and in what Paul writes, `Looking for the blessed hope and appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, Who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a people for His own possession, and zealous of good works[fn-101-P10112_3621177:28-nf] .' How then has He given Himself, if He had not worn flesh? For flesh He offered, and gave Himself for us, in order that undergoing death in it, `He might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil[fn-101-P10113_3621431:29-nf] .' Hence also we always give thanks in the name of Jesus Christ, and we do not set at nought the grace which came to us through Him. For the coming of the Saviour in the flesh has been the ransom and salvation of all creation. So then, beloved and most longed-for, let what I have said put in mind those who love the Lord, while as to those who have imitated the behaviour of Judas, and deserted the Lord to join Caiaphas, let them by these things be taught better, if maybe they are willing, if maybe they are ashamed. And let them know that in worshipping the Lord in the flesh we do not worship a creature, but, as we said above, the Creator Who has put on the created body.","title":"Letter LX.

But true martyrs are such as those of whom the Lord says. \"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake.\"[fn-59-P5909_2856912:21-nf] It is not, therefore, those who suffer persecution for their unrighteousness, and for the divisions which they impiously introduce into Christian unity, but those who suffer for righteousness' sake, that are truly martyrs. For Hagar also suffered persecution at the hands of Sarah;[fn-59-P5910_2857210:22-nf] and in that case she who persecuted was righteous, and she unrighteous who suffered persecution. Are we to compare with this persecution which Hagar suffered the case of holy David, who was persecuted by unrighteous Saul?[fn-59-P5911_2857450:23-nf] Surely there is in essential difference, not in respect of his suffering, but because he suffered for righteousness' sake. And the Lord Himself was crucified with two thieves;[fn-59-P5912_2857657:24-nf] but those who were joined in their suffering were separated by the difference of its cause.

This point may also be solved from the word itself. Thou hast penal judgment spoken of in the Gospel: \"He that believeth not is judged[fn-18-P1833_1154711:12-nf] already;\" and in another place, \"The hour is coming, when those who are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.\"[fn-18-P1834_1154994:13-nf] You see how He has put judgment for condemnation and punishment. And yet if judgment were always to be taken for condemnation, should we ever have heard in the psalm, \"Judge me, O God\"? In the former place, judgment is used in the sense of inflicting pain; here, it is used in the sense of discernment.[fn-18-P1835_1155329:14-nf] How so? Just because so expounded by him who says, \"Judge me, O God.\" For read, and see what follows. What is this \"Judge me, O God,\" but just what he adds, \"and discern[fn-18-P1836_1155699:15-nf] my cause against an unholy nation\"?[fn-18-P1837_1155760:16-nf] Because then it was said, \"Judge me, O God, and discern [the true merits of] my cause against an unholy nation;\" similarly now said the Lord Christ, \"I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.\" How is there \"one that seeketh and judgeth\"? There is the Father, who discerns and distinguishes l between my glory and yours. For ye glory in the spirit of this present world. Not so do I who say to the Father, \"Father, glorify Thou me with that glory which I had with Thee before the world was.\"[fn-18-P1838_1156294:17-nf] What is \"that glory\"? One altogether different from human inflation. Thus doth the Father judge. And so to \"judge\" is to \"discern.\"[fn-18-P1839_1156446:18-nf] And what does He discern? The glory of His Son from the glory of mere men; for to that end is it said, \"God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.\"[fn-18-P1840_1156828:19-nf] For not because He became man is He now to be compared with us. We, as men, are sinful, He is sinless; we, as men, inherit from Adam both death and delinquency, He received from the Virgin mortal flesh, but no iniquity. In fine, neither because we wish it are we born, nor as long as we wish it do we live, nor in the way that we wish it do we die: but He, before He was born, chose of whom He should be born; at His birth He brought about the adoration of the Magi; He grew as an infant, and showed Himself God by His miracles, and surpassed man in His weakness. Lastly, He chose also the manner of His death, that is, to be hung on the cross, and to fasten the cross itself on the foreheads of believers, so that the Christian may say, \"God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-18-P1841_1157662:20-nf] On the very cross, when He pleased, He made His body be taken down, and departed; in the very sepulchre, as long as it pleased Him, He lay; and, when He pleased, He arose as from a bed. So, then, brethren, in respect to His very form as a servant (for who can speak of that other form as it ought to be spoken of, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"?)-in respect, I say, to His very form as a servant, the difference is great between the glory of Christ and the glory of other men.

But God, who is good, multiplied His loving-kindness towards us, not only when He granted the common salvation of us all through His Word, but now also, when enemies have persecuted us, and have sought to seize upon us. As the blessed Paul saith in a certain place, when describing the incomprehensible riches of Christ: `But God, being rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in follies and sins, quickened us with Christ[fn-92-P9240_3354086:16-nf] .' For the might of man and of all creatures, is weak and poor; but the Might which is above man, and uncreated, is rich and incomprehensible, and has no beginning, but is eternal. Hedoes not then possess one method only of healing, but being rich, He works in divers manners for our salvation by means of His Word, Who is not restricted or hindered in His dealings towards us; but since He is rich and manifold, He varies Himself according to the individual capacity of each soul. For He is the Word and the Power and the Wisdom of God, as Solomon testifies concerning Wisdom, that `being one, it can do all things, and remaining in itself, it maketh all things new; and passing upon holy souls, fashioneth the friends of God and the prophets[fn-92-P9241_3354859:17-nf] .' To those then who have not yet attained to the perfect way He becomes like a sheep giving milk, and this was administered by Paul: `I have fed you with milk, not with meat[fn-92-P9242_3355065:18-nf] .' To those who have advanced beyond the full stature of childhood, but still are weak as regards perfection, He is their food, according to their capacity, being again administered by Paul[fn-92-P9243_3355275:19-nf] , `Let him that is weak eat herbs.' But as soon as ever a man begins to walk in the perfect way, he is no longer fed with the things before mentioned, but he has the Word for bread, and flesh for food, for it is written, `Strong meat is for those who are of full age, for those who, by reason of their capacity, have their senses exercised[fn-92-P9244_3355920:20-nf] .' And further, when the word is sown it does not yield a uniform produce of fruit in this human life, but one various and rich; for it bringeth forth, some an hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty[fn-92-P9245_3356138:21-nf] , as the Saviour teaches-that Sower of grace, and Bestower of the Spirit[fn-92-P9246_3356618:22-nf] . And this is no doubtful matter, nor one that admits no confirmation; but it is in our power to behold the field which is sown by Him; for in the Church the word is manifold and the produce[fn-92-P9247_3356833:23-nf] rich. Not with virgins alone is such a field adorned; nor with monks alone but also with honourable matrimony and the chastity of each one. For in sowing, He did not compel the will beyond the power. Nor is mercy confined to the perfect, but it is sent down also among those who occupy the middle and the third ranks, so that He might rescue all men generally to salvation. To this intent He hath prepared many mansions[fn-92-P9248_3357322:24-nf] with the Father, so that although the dwelling-place is various in proportion to the advance in moral attainment, yet all of us are within the wall, and all of us enter within the same fence, the adversary being cast out, and all his host expelled thence. For apart from light there is darkness, and apart from blessing there is a curse, the devil also is apart from the saints, and sin far from virtue. Therefore the Gospel rebukes Satan, saying, `Get thee behind Me, Satan[fn-92-P9249_3357814:25-nf] .' But us it calls to itself, saying, `Enter ye in at the strait gate.' And again, `Come, blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom which is prepared for you[fn-92-P9250_3357991:26-nf] .' So also the Spirit cried aforetime in the Psalms, saying, `Enter into His gates with psalms[fn-92-P9251_3358121:27-nf] .' For through virtue a man enters in unto God, as Moses did into the thick cloud where God was. But through vice a man goes out from the presence of the Lord; as Cain[fn-92-P9252_3358304:28-nf] when he had slain his brother, went out, as far as his will was concerned, from before the face of God; and the Psalmist enters, saying, `And I will go in to the altar of God, even to the God that delighteth my youth[fn-92-P9253_3358552:29-nf] .' But of the devil the Scripture beareth witness, that the devil went out from before God, and smote Job[fn-92-P9254_3358677:30-nf] with sore boils. For this is the characteristic of those who go out from before God-to smite and to injure the men of God. And this is the characteristic of those who fall away from the faith-to injure and persecute the faithful. The saints on the other hand, take such to themselves and look upon them as friends; as also the blessed David, using openness of speech, says, `Mine eyes are on the faithful of the earth, that they may dwell with me.' But those that are weak in the faith[fn-92-P9255_3359227:31-nf] , Paul urges that we should especially take to ourselves. For virtue is philanthropic[fn-92-P9256_3359342:32-nf] , just as in men of an opposite character, sin is misanthropic. So Saul, being a sinner, persecuted David, whereas David, though he had a goodopportunity, did not kill Saul. Esau too persecuted Jacob, while Jacob overcame his wickedness by meekness.

There is therefore a kind of inward manifestation of God, which is entirely unknown to the ungodly, who receive no manifestation of God the Father and the Holy Spirit: of the Son, indeed, there might have been such, but only in the flesh; and that, too, neither of the same kind as the other, nor able under any form to remain with them, save only for a little while; and even that, for judgment, not for rejoicing; for punishment, not for reward.","title":"Tractate LXXVI.","author":"Augustine"}]
