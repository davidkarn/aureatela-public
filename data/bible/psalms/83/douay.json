{"verses":["Unto the end, for the winepresses, a psalm for the sons of Core.","How lovely are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!","my soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord.  My heart\nand my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.","For the sparrow hath found herself a house, and the turtle a nest\nfor herself where she may lay her young ones:  Thy altars, O Lord of\nhosts, my king and my God.","Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, O Lord:  they shall\npraise thee for ever and ever.","Blessed is the man whose help is from thee:  in his heart he hath\ndisposed to ascend by steps,","In the vale of tears, in the place which he hath set.","For the lawgiver shall give a blessing, they shall go from virtue\nto virtue:  the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.","O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer:  give ear, O God of Jacob.","Behold, O God our protector:  and look on the face of thy Christ.","For better is one day in thy courts above thousands.  I have\nchosen to be an abject in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in\nthe tabernacles of sinners.","For God loveth mercy and truth:  the Lord will give grace and\nglory.","He will not deprive of good things them that walk in innocence:\nO Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee."]}
