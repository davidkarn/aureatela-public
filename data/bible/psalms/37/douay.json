{"verses":["A psalm for David, for a remembrance of the sabbath.","Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; nor chastise me in thy\nwrath.","For thy arrows are fastened in me:  and thy hand hath been strong\nupon me.","There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath:  there is no\npeace for my bones, because of my sins.","For my iniquities are gone over my head:  and as a heavy burden\nare become heavy upon me.","My sores are putrified and corrupted, because of my foolishness.","I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end:  I\nwalked sorrowful all the day long.","For my loins are filled with illusions; and there is no health in\nmy flesh.","I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly:  I roared with the\ngroaning of my heart.","Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not\nhidden from thee.","My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the light of\nmy eyes itself is not with me.","My friends and my neighbours have drawn near, and stood against\nme.  And they that were near me stood afar off:","And they that sought my soul used violence.  And they that sought\nevils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the day long.","But I, as a deaf man, heard not:  and as a dumb man not opening\nhis mouth.","And I became as a man that heareth not:  and that hath no\nreproofs in his mouth.","For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped:  thou wilt hear me, O Lord my\nGod.","For I said:  Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me:  and\nwhilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against me.","For I am ready for scourges:  and my sorrow is continually before\nme.","For I will declare my iniquity:  and I will think for my sin.","But my enemies live, and are stronger than I:  and they that hate\nme wrongfully are multiplied.","They that render evil for good, have detracted me, because I\nfollowed goodness.","For sake me not, O Lord my God:  do not thou depart from me.","Attend unto my help, O Lord, the God of my salvation."]}
