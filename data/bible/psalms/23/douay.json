{"verses":["On the first day of the week, a psalm for David.  The earth is the\nLord's and the fulness thereof:  the world, and all they that dwell\ntherein.","For he hath founded it upon the seas; and hath prepared it upon\nthe rivers.","Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord:  or who shall\nstand in his holy place?","The innocent in hands, and clean of heart, who hath not taken his\nsoul in vain, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour.","He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his\nSaviour.","This is the generation of them that seek him, of them that seek\nthe face of the God of Jacob.","Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, O eternal\ngates:  and the King of Glory shall enter in.","Who is this King of Glory?  the Lord who is strong and mighty:  the\nLord mighty in battle.","Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, O eternal\ngates:  and the King of Glory shall enter in.","Who is this King of Glory?  the Lord of hosts, he is the King of\nGlory."]}
