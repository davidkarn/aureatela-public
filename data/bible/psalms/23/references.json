It was to give day the privileges of seniority that Scripture put the end of the first day before that of the first night, because night follows day: for, before the creation of light, the world was not in night, but in darkness. It is the opposite of day which was called night, and it did not receive its name until after day. Thus were created the evening and the morning.[fn-21-P2109_617638:37-nf] Scripture means the space of a day and a night, and afterwards no more says day and night, but calls them both under the name of the more important: a custom which you will find throughout Scripture. Everywhere the measure of time is counted by days, without mention of nights. \"The days of our years,\"[fn-21-P2110_618142:38-nf] says the Psalmist. \"Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been,\"[fn-21-P2111_618237:39-nf] said Jacob, and elsewhere \"all the days of my life.\"[fn-21-P2112_618310:40-nf] Thus under the form of history the law is laid down for what is to follow.And the evening and the morning were one day.[fn-21-P2113_618454:41-nf] Why does Scripture say \"one day the first day\"? Before speaking to us of the second, the third, and the fourth days, would it not have been more natural to call that one the first which began the series? If it therefore says \"one day,\" it is from a wish to determine the measure of day and night, and to combine the time that they contain. Now twenty-four hours fill up the space of one day-we mean of a day and of a night; and if, at the time of the solstices, they have not both an equal length, the time marked byScripture does not the less circumscribe their duration. It is as though it said: twenty-four hours measure the space of a day, or that, in reality a day is the time that the heavens starting from one point take to return there. Thus, every time that, in the revolution of the sun, evening and morning occupy the world, their periodical succession never exceeds the space of one day.But must we believe in a mysterious reason for this? God who made the nature of time measured it out and determined it by intervals of days; and, wishing to give it a week as a measure, he ordered the week to revolve from period to period upon itself, to count the movement of time, forming the week of one day revolving seven times upon itself: a proper circle begins and ends with itself. Such is also the character of eternity, to revolve upon itself and to end nowhere. If then the beginning of time is called \"one day\" rather than \"the first day,\" it is because Scripture wishes to establish its relationship with eternity. It was, in reality, fit and natural to call \"one\" the day whose character is to be one wholly separated and isolated from all the others. If Scripturespeaks to us of many ages, saying everywhere, \"age of age, and ages of ages,\" we do not see it enumerate them as first, second, and third. It follows that we are hereby shown not so much limits, ends and succession of ages, as distinctions between various states and modes of action. \"The day of the Lord,\" Scripture says, \"is great and very terrible,\"[fn-21-P2114_620516:42-nf] and elsewhere \"Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you? The day of the Lord is darkness and not light.\"[fn-21-P2115_620671:43-nf] A day of darkness for those who are worthy of darkness. No; this day without evening, without succession and without end is not unknown to Scripture, and it is the day that the Psalmist calls the eighth day, because it is outside this time of weeks.[fn-21-P2116_620938:44-nf] Thus whether you call it day, or whether you call it eternity, you express the same idea. Give this state the name of day; there are not several, but only one. If you call it eternity still it is unique and not manifold. Thus it is in order that you may carry your thoughts forward towards a future life, that Scripture marks by the word \"one\" the day which is the type of eternity, the first fruits of days, the contemporary of light, the holy Lord's day honoured by the Resurrection of our Lord.

Now when a man has felt glad that he has even by some good work overcome pride, from the very joy he lifts up his head and says: \"Behold, I live; why do you triumph? Nay, I live because you triumph.\" Premature, however, this forwardness of his to triumph over pride may perhaps be, as if it were now vanquished, whereas its last shadow is to be swallowed up, as I suppose, in that noontide which is promised in the scripture which says, \"He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday;\"[fn-20-P2085_876625:90-nf] provided that be done which was written in the preceding! verse: \"Commit thy way unto the Lord; trustalso in Him, and He shall bring it to pass,\"[fn-20-P2086_876791:91-nf] - not, as some suppose, that they themselves bring it to pass. Now, when he said, \"And He shall bring it to pass,\" he evidently had none other in mind but those who say, We ourselves bring it to pass; that is to say, we ourselves justify our own selves. In this matter, no doubt, we do ourselves, too, work; but we are fellow-workers with Him who does the work, because His mercy anticipates us. He anticipates us, however, that we may be healed; but then He will also follow us, that being healed we may grow healthy and strong. He anticipates us that we may be called; He will follow us that we may be glorified. He anticipates us that we may lead godly lives; He will follow us that we may always live with Him, because without Him we can do nothing.[fn-20-P2087_877565:92-nf] Now the Scriptures refer to both these operations of grace. There is both this: \"The God of my mercy shall anticipate me,\"[fn-20-P2088_877705:93-nf] and again this: \"Thy mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.\"[fn-20-P2089_877792:94-nf] Let us therefore unveil to Him our life by confession, not praise it with a vindication. For if it is not His way, but our own, beyond doubt it is not the right one. Let us therefore reveal this by making our confession to Him; for however much we may endeavour to conceal it, it is not hid from Him.

Surely, if no Christian will dare to say this, \"It is not of God that showeth mercy, but of man that willeth,\" lest he should openly contradict the apostle, it follows that the true interpretation of the saying, \"It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy,\" is that the whole work belongs to God, who both makes the will of man righteous, and thus prepares it for assistance, and assists it when it is prepared.

Which, then, of these is the essence of the Father supposed to be? For assuredly one cannot, by uttering all these phrases that disagree one with another in signification, intend to indicate by incompatible terms that Essence which is simple and uncompounded.

For it was not of all thought and conception that our master (Basil) laid down this definition, but, after making a special subdivision of the objects of thought and conception (not to encumber the question with too many words), and having made this part clear, he left men of sense to reason out the whole from the part for themselves.

Accordingly, even if another species come under consideration, it by no means follows that the one previously given is erroneously so called. Now if, says he, one of the Apostles or Prophets could be shown to have used these names of Christ, the falsehood would have something for its encouragement.

Accordingly, there would be no desire of good in man from the Lord if it were not a good; but if it is a good, we have it not save from Him who is supremely and incommunicably good. For what is the desire for good but love, of which John the apostle speaks without any ambiguity, and says,\" Love is of God\"?[fn-53-P5358_2107249:44-nf] Nor is its beginning of ourselves, and its perfection of God; but if love is of God, we have the whole of it from God. May God by all means turn away this folly of making ourselves first in His gifts, Himself last,-because \"His mercy shall prevent me.\"[fn-53-P5359_2107521:45-nf] And it is He to whom is faithfully and truthfully sung, \"For Thou hast prevented him with the blessings of sweetness.\"[fn-53-P5360_2107658:46-nf] And what is here more fitly understood than that very desire of good of which we are speaking? For good begins then to be longed for when it has begun to grow sweet. But when good is done by the fear of penalty, not by the love of righteousness good is not yet well done. Nor is that done in the heart which seems to be done in the act when a man would rather not do it if he could evade it with impunity. Therefore the \"blessing of sweetness\" is God's grace, by which is caused in us that what He prescribes to us delights us, and we desire it,-that is, we love it; in which if God does not precede us, not only is it not perfected, but it is not even begun, from us. For, if without Him we are able to do nothing actually, we are able neither to begin nor to perfect,-because to begin, it is said \"His mercy shall prevent me;\"[fn-53-P5361_2108504:47-nf] to finish, it is said, \"His mercy shall follow me.\"[fn-53-P5362_2108574:48-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":23,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_32_oration_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"VII.

So He is called Man, not only that through His Body He may be apprehended by embodied creatures, whereas otherwise this would be impossible because of His incomprehensible nature; but also that by Himself He may sanctify humanity, and be as it were a leaven to the whole lump; and by uniting to Himself that which was condemned may release it from all condemnation, becoming for all men all things that we are, except sin;-body, soul, mind and all through which death reaches-and thus He became Man, who is the combination of all these; God in visible form, because He retained that which is perceived by mind alone.
