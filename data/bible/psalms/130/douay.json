{"verses":["A gradual canticle of David.  Lord, my heart is not exalted:  nor\nare my eyes lofty.  Neither have I walked in great matters, nor in\nwonderful things above me.","If I was not humbly minded, but exalted my soul:  As a child that\nis weaned is towards his mother, so reward in my soul.","Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth now and for ever."]}
