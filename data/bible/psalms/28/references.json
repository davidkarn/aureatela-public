If he is wise, then his system of instruction is wisdom, and no other; and they are wise who follow it, and no others. Why then are we commonly esteemed as foolish, and visionary, and senseless, who follow a Master who is wise even by the confession of the gods themselves? For in that he said that He wrought wonderful deeds, by which He especially claimed faith is His divinity, he now appears to assent to us, when he says the same things in which we boast. But, however, he recovers himself, and again has recourse to demoniacal frauds. For when he had been compelled to speak the truth, he now appeared to be a betrayer of the gods and of himself, unless he had, by a deceptive falsehood, concealed that which the truth had extorted from him. He says, therefore, that He did indeed perform wonderful works, yet not by divine power, but by magic. What wonder if Apollo thus persuaded men ignorant of the truth, when the Jews also, worshippers (as they seemed to be) of the Most High God, entertained the same opinion, though they had every day before their eyes those miracles which the prophets had foretold to them as about to happen, and yet they could not be induced by the contemplation of such powers to believe that He whom they saw was God? On this account, David, whom they especially read above the other prophets, in the twenty-seventh Psalm[fn-13-P1313_568350:136-nf] thus condemns them: \"Render to them their desert, because they regard not the works of the Lord.\" Both David himself and other prophets announced that of the house of this very David, Christ should be born according to the flesh. Thus it is written in Isaiah:[fn-13-P1314_568635:137-nf] \"And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, and He who shall arise to rule over the nations, in Him shall the Gentiles trust; and His rest shall be glorious.\" And in another place:[fn-13-P1315_568841:138-nf] \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a blossom[fn-13-P1316_568933:139-nf] shall grow out of his root; and the Spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit of knowledge and ofpiety; and He shall be filled[fn-13-P1317_569189:140-nf] with the spirit of fear of the Lord.\" Now Jesse was the father of David, from whose root he foretold that a blossom would arise; namely him of whom the Sibyl speaks, \"A pure blossom shall spring forth.\"","title":"Book IV.

For those in whom the Holy One dwells, He makes holy, even as the Good One makes men good. And the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are holy and good, as has been shown. \"Acting as a guide to those who approach the mystery.\" This may well be said of Apollos who watered what Paul planted. For the Apostle plants by his guidance[fn-12-P1272_692308:250-nf] , and Apollos, when he baptizes, waters by Sacramental regeneration, bringing to the mystery those who were instructed by Paul. Thus he places on a level with Apollos that Spirit Who perfects men through baptism. \"Distributing every gift.\" With this we too agree; for everything that is good is a portion of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. \"Co-operating with the faithful for the understanding and contemplation of things appointed.\" As he does not add by whom they are appointed, he leaves his meaning doubtful, whether it is correct or the reverse. But we will by a slight addition advance his statement so as to make it consistent with godliness. For since, whether it be the word of wisdom, or the word of knowledge, or faith, or help, or government, or aught else that is enumerated in the lists of saving gifts, \"all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will[fn-12-P1273_693352:251-nf] ,\" we therefore do not reject the statement of Eunomius when he says that the Spirit \"co-operates with the faithful for understanding and contemplation of things appointed\" by Him, because by Him all good teachings are appointed for us. \"Sounding an accompaniment to those who pray.\" It would be foolish seriously to examine the meaning of this expression, of which the ludicrous and meaningless character is at once manifest to all. For who is so demented and beside himself as to wait for us to tell him that the Holy Spirit is not a bell nor an empty cask sounding an accompaniment and made to ring by the voice of him who prays as it were by a blow? \"Leading us to that which is expedient for us.\" This the Father and the Son likewise do: for \"He leadeth Joseph like a sheep[fn-12-P1274_694154:252-nf] ,\" and, \"led His people like sheep[fn-12-P1275_694209:253-nf] ,\" and, \"the good Spirit leadeth us in a land of righteousness[fn-12-P1276_694295:254-nf] .\" \"Strengthening us to godliness.\" To strengthen man to godliness David says is the work of God; \"For Thou art my strength and my refuge[fn-12-P1277_694460:255-nf] ,\" says the Psalmist, and \"the Lord is the strength of His people[fn-12-P1278_694550:256-nf] ,\" and, \"He shall give strength and power unto His people[fn-12-P1279_694630:257-nf] .\" If then the expressions of Eunomius are meant in accordance with the mind of the Psalmist, they are a testimony to the Divinity of the Holy Ghost: but if they are opposed to the word of prophecy, then by this very fact a charge of blasphemy lies against Eunomius, because he sets up his own opinions in opposition to the holy prophets. Next he says, \"Lightening souls with the light of knowledge.\" This grace also the doctrine of godliness ascribes alike to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. For He is called a light by David[fn-12-P1280_695195:258-nf] , and from thence the light of knowledge shines in them who are enlightened. In like manner also the cleansing of our thoughts of which the statement speaks is proper to the power of the Lord. For it was \"the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of His person,\" Who \"purged our sins[fn-12-P1281_695518:259-nf] .\" Again, to banish devils, which Eunomius says is a property of the Spirit, this also the only-begotten God, Who said to the devil, \"I charge thee[fn-12-P1282_695684:260-nf] ,\" ascribes to the power of the Spirit, when He says, \"If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils[fn-12-P1283_695808:261-nf] ,\" so that the expulsion of devils is not destructive of the glory of the Spirit, but rather a demonstration of His divine and transcendent power. \"Healing the sick,\" he says, \"curing the infirm, comforting the afflicted, raising up those who stumble, recovering the distressed.\" These are the words of those who think reverently of the Holy Ghost, for no one would ascribe the operation of any one of these effects to any one except to God. If then heresy affirms that those things which it belongs to none save God alone to effect, are wrought by the power of the Spirit, we have in support of the truths for which we are contending the witness even of our adversaries. How does the Psalmist seek his healing from God, saying, \"Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, for my hones are vexed[fn-12-P1284_696647:262-nf] !\" It is to God that Isaiah says, \"The dew that is from Thee is healing unto them[fn-12-P1285_696747:263-nf] .\" Again, prophetic language attests that the conversion of those in error is the work of God. For \"they went astray in the wilderness in a thirsty land,\" says the Psalmist, and he adds, \"So He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to the city where they dwelt[fn-12-P1286_697050:264-nf] :\" and, \"when the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion[fn-12-P1287_697131:265-nf] .\" In like manner also the comfort of the afflicted is ascribed to God, Paul thus speaking, \"Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1288_697344:266-nf] .\" Again, the Psalmist says, speaking in the person of God \"Thou calledst upon Me in trouble and I delivered thee[fn-12-P1289_697491:267-nf] .\" And the setting upright of those who stumble is innumerable times ascribed by Scripture to the power of the Lord: \"Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall, but the Lord was my help[fn-12-P1290_697703:268-nf] ,\" and \"Though he fall, he shall not be cast away, for the Lord upholdeth him with His hand[fn-12-P1291_697818:269-nf] ,\" and \"The Lord helpeth them that are fallen[fn-12-P1292_697887:270-nf] .\" And to the loving-kindness of God confessedly belongs the recovery of the distressed, if Eunomius means the same thing of which we learn in prophecy, as the Scripture says, \"Thou laidest trouble upon our loins; Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, and Thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place[fn-12-P1293_698246:271-nf] .\"","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":28,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_20_on_the_proceedings_of_pelagius_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The synod of bishops then proceeded to say: \"Let another section be read.\" Accordingly there was read the passage in the same book wherein Pelagius had laid down the position that \"all men are ruled by their own will.\" On this being read, Pelagius said in answer: \"This I stated in the interest of free will. God is its helper whenever it chooses good; man, however, when sinning is himself in fault, as under the direction of a free will.\" Upon hearing this, the bishops exclaimed: \"Nor again is this opposed to the doctrine of the Church.\" For who indeed could condemn or deny the freedom of the will, when God's help is associated with it? His opinion, therefore, as thus explained in his answer, was, with good reason, deemed satisfactory by the bishops. And yet, after all, the statement made in his book, \"All men are ruled by their own will,\" ought without doubt to have deeply disturbed the brethren, who had discovered what these men are accustomed to dispute against the grace of God. For it is said, \"All men are ruled by their own will,\" as if God rules no man, and the Scripture says in vain, \"Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; rule them, and lift them up for ever.\"[fn-28-P2820_1095107:4-nf] They would not, of course, stay, if they are ruled only by their own will without God, even as sheep which have no shepherd: which, God forbid for us. For, unquestionably to be led is something more compulsory than to be ruled. He who is ruled at the same time does something himself,indeed, when ruled by God, it is with the express view that he should also act rightly; whereas the man who is led can hardly be understood to do any thing himself at all. And yet the Saviour's helpful grace is so much better than our own wills and desires, that the apostle does not hesitate to say: \"As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.\"[fn-28-P2821_1095779:5-nf] And our free will can do nothing better for us than to submit itself to be led by Him who can do nothing amiss; and after doing this, not to doubt that it was helped to do it by Him of whom it is said in the psalm, \"He is my God, His mercy shall go before me.\"[fn-28-P2822_1096058:6-nf] ","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":28,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_26_the_first_epistle_of_clement_to_the_corinthians","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"119","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Do we then deem it any great and wonderful thing for the Maker of all things to raise up again those that have piously served Him in the assurance of a good faith, when even by a bird He shows us the mightiness of His power to fulfil His promise?[fn-54-P5487_794638:126-nf] For [the Scripture] saith in a certain place, \"Thou shalt raise me up, and I shall confess unto Thee\";[fn-54-P5488_794792:127-nf] and again, \"I laid me down, and slept\"; \"I awaked, because Thou art with me; \"[fn-54-P5489_794923:128-nf] and again, Job says, \"Thou shalt raise up this flesh of mine, which has suffered all these things.\"[fn-54-P5490_795048:129-nf] ","title":"The First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians","author":"Clement"},{"chapter":28,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_21_lecture_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"19.

But if He wills that we should call His own Father our Father, we must not on that account measure ourselves with the Son according to nature, for it is because of the Son that the Father is so called by us; for since the Word bore our body and came to be in us, therefore by reason of the Word in us, is God called our Father.
