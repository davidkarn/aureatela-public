{"verses":["A psalm for David, at the finishing of the tabernacle.  Bring to\nthe Lord, O ye children of God:  bring to the Lord the offspring of\nrams.","Bring to the Lord glory and honour:  bring to the Lord glory to\nhis name:  adore ye the Lord in his holy court.","The voice of the Lord is upon the waters; the God of majesty hath\nthundered, The Lord is upon many waters.","The voice of the Lord is in power; the voice of the Lord in\nmagnificence.","The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars:  yea, the Lord shall\nbreak the cedars of Libanus.","And shall reduce them to pieces, as a calf of Libanus, and as the\nbeloved son of unicorns.","The voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire:","The voice of the Lord shaketh the desert:  and the Lord shall\nshake the desert of Cades.","The voice of the Lord prepareth the stags:  and he will discover\nthe thick woods:  and in his temple all shall speak his glory.","The Lord maketh the flood to dwell:  and the Lord shall sit king\nfor ever.  The Lord will give strength to his people:  the Lord will\nbless his people with peace."]}
