{"verses":["A psalm for David himself.  Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle:\nbecause he hath done wonderful things.  His right hand hath wrought for\nhim salvation, and his arm is holy.","The Lord hath made known his salvation:  he hath revealed his\njustice in the sight of the Gentiles.","He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of\nIsrael.  All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.","Sing joyfully to God, all the earth; make melody, rejoice and\nsing.","Sing praise to the Lord on the harp, on the harp, and with the\nvoice of a psalm:","With long trumpets, and sound of cornet.  Make a joyful noise\nbefore the Lord our king:","Let the sea be moved and the fullness thereof:  the world and they\nthat dwell therein.","The rivers shall clap their hands, the mountains shall rejoice\ntogether","At the presence of the Lord:  because he cometh to judge the\nearth.  He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with\nequity."]}
