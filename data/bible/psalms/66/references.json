IT is, however, asked by our opponents, how it is that Scripture nowhere describes the Spirit as glorified together with the Father and the Son, but carefully avoids the use of the expression \"with the Spirit,\" while it everywhere prefers to ascribe glory \"in Him\" as being the fitter phrase. I should, for my own part, deny that the word in [or by] implies lower dignity than the word \"with;\" I should main-pain on the contrary that, rightly understood, it leads us up to the highest possible meaning. This is the case where, as we have observed, it often stands instead of with; as for instance, \"I will go into thy house in burnt offerings,\"[fn-17-P1789_460087:508-nf] instead of with burnt offerings and\"he brought them forth also by silver and gold,\"[fn-17-P1790_460193:509-nf] that is to say with silver and gold and \"thou goest not forth in our armies\"[fn-17-P1791_460289:510-nf] instead of with our armies, and innumerable similar passages. In short I should very much like to learn from this newfangled philosophy what kind of glory the Apostle ascribed by the word in, according to the interpretation which our opponents proffer as derived from Scripture, for I have nowhere found the formula \"To Thee, O Father, be honour and glory, through Thy only begotten Son, by [or in] the Holy Ghost,\"-a form which to our opponents comes, so to say, as naturally as the air they breathe. You may indeed find each of these clauses separately,[fn-17-P1792_460871:511-nf] but they will nowhere be able to show them to us arranged in this conjunction.

For we are not ashamed to confess that we have prepared for our contest no weapon of argument sharpened by rhetoric, that we can bring forward to aid us in the fight with those arrayed against us, no cleverness or sharpness of dialectic, such as with inexperienced judges lays even on truth the suspicion of falsehood. One strength our reasoning against falsehood has-first the very Word Himself, Who is the might of our word,[fn-13-P1313_704052:2-nf] and in the next place the rottenness of the arguments set against us, which is overthrown and falls by its own spontaneous action. Now in order that it may be made as clear as possible to all men, that the very efforts Of Eunomius serve as means for his own overthrow to those who contend with him, I will set forth to my readers his phantom doctrine (for so I think that doctrine may be called which is quite outside the truth), and I would have you all, who are present at our struggle, and watch the encounter now taking place between my doctrine and that which is matched with it, to be just judges of the lawful striving of our arguments, that by your just award the reasoning of godliness may be proclaimed as victor to the whole theatre of the Church, having won undisputed victory over ungodliness, and being decorated, in virtue of the three falls of its enemy, with the unfading crown of them that are saved. Now this statement is set forth against the truth by way of preface to his third discourse, and this is the fashion of it:-\"Preserving,\" he says, \"natural order, and abiding by those things which are known to us from above, we do not refuse to speak of the Son, seeing He is begotten, even by the name of `product of generation[fn-13-P1314_705372:3-nf] ,' since the generated essence and[fn-13-P1315_705419:4-nf] the appellation of Son make such a relation of words appropriate.\" I beg the reader to give his attention carefully to this point, that while he calls God both \"begotten\" and \"Son,\" he refers the reason of such names to \"natural order,\" and calls to witness to this conception the knowledge possessed from above: so that if anything should be found in the course of what follows contrary to the positions be has laid down, it is clear to all that he is overthrown by himself, refuted by his own arguments before ours are brought against him. And so let us consider his statement in the light of his own words. He confesses that the name of \"Son\" would by no means be properly applied to the Only-begotten God, did not \"natural order,\" as he says, confirm the appellation. If, then, one were to withdraw the order of nature from the consideration of the designation of \"Son,\" his use of this name, being deprived of its proper and natural significance, will be meaningless. And moreover the fact that he says these statements are confirmed, in that they abide by the knowledge possessed from above, is a strong additional support to the orthodox view touching the designation of \"Son,\" seeing that the inspired teaching of the Scriptures, which comes to us from above, confirms our argument on these matters. If these things are so, and this is a standard of truth that admits of no deception, that these two concur-the \"natural order,\" as he says, and the testimony of the knowledge given from above confirming the natural interpretation-it is clear, that to assert anything contrary to these, is nothing else than manifestly to fight against the truth itself. Let us hear again what this writer, who makes nature his instructor in the matter of this name, and says that he abides by the knowledge given to us from above by the instruction of the saints, sets out at length a little further on, after the passage I have just quoted. For I will pretermit for the time the continuous recital of what is set next in order in his treatise, that the contradiction in what he has written may not escape detection, being veiled by the reading of the intervening matter. \"The same argument,\" he says, \"will apply also in the case of what is made and created, as both the natural interpretation and the mutual relation of the things, and also the use of the saints, give us free authority for the use of the formula: wherefore one would not be wrong in treating the thing made as corresponding to the maker, and the thing created to the creator.\" Of what product of making or of creation does he speak, as having naturally the relation expressed in its name towards its maker and creator? If of those we contemplate in the creation, visible and invisible (as Paul recounts, when he says that by Him all things were created, visible and invisible)[fn-13-P1316_708420:5-nf] , so that this relative conjunction of names has a proper and special application, that which is made being set in relation to the maker, that which is created to the creator,-if this is his meaning, we agree with him. For in fact, since the Lord is the Maker of angels, the angel is assuredly a thing made by Him that made him: and since the Lord is the Creator of the world, clearly the world itself and all that is therein are called the creature of Him that created them. If however it is with this intention that he makes his interpretation of \"natural order,\" systematizing the appropriation of relative terms with a view to their mutual relation in verbal sense, even thus it would be an extraordinary thing, seeing that every one is aware of this, that he should leave his doctrinal statement to draw out for us a system of grammatical trivialities[fn-13-P1317_709296:6-nf] . But if it is to the Only-begotten God that he applies such phrases, so as to say that He is a thing made by Him that made Him, a creature of Him that created Him, and to refer this terminology to \"the use of the saints,\" let him first of all show us in his statement what saints he says there are who declared the Maker of all things to be a product and a creature, and whom he follows in this audacity of phrase. The Church knows as saints those whose hearts were divinely guided by the Holy Spirit,-patriarchs, lawgivers, prophets, evangelists, apostles. If any among these is found to declare in his inspired words that God over all, Who \"upholds all things with the word of His power,\" and grasps with His hand all things that are, and by Himself called the universe into being by the mere act of His will, is a thing created and a product, he will stand excused, as following, as he says, the \"use of the saints[fn-13-P1318_710274:7-nf] \" in proceeding to formulate such doctrines. But if the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures is freely placed within the reach of all, and nothing is forbidden to or hidden from any of those who choose to share in the divine instruction, how comes it that he endeavours to lead his hearers astray by his misrepresentation of the Scriptures, referring the term \"creature,\" applied to the Only-begotten, to \"the use of the saints\"? For that by Him all things were made, you may hear almost from the whole of their holy utterance, from Moses and the prophets and apostles who come after him, whose particular expressions it would be tedious here to set forth. Enough for our purpose, with the others, and above the others, is the sublime John, where in the preface to his discourse on the Divinity of the Only-begotten he proclaims aloud the fact that there is none of the things that were made which was not made through Him[fn-13-P1319_711386:8-nf] , a fact which is an incontestable and positive proof of His being Lord of the creation, not reckoned in the list of created things. For if all things that are made exist by no other but by Him (and John bears witness that nothing among the things that are, throughout the creation, was made without Him), who is so blinded in understanding as not to see in the Evangelist's proclamation the truth, that He Who made all the creation is assuredly something else besides the creation? For if all that is numbered among the things that were made has its being through Him, while He Himself is \"in the beginning,\" and is \"with God,\" being God, and Word, and Life, and Light, and express Image, and Brightness, and if none of the things that were made throughout creation is named by the same names-(not Word, not God, not Life, not Light, not Truthn not express Image, not Brightness, not any of the other names proper to the Deity is to be found employed of the creation)-then it is clear that He Who is these things is by nature something else besides the creation, which neither is nor is called any of these things. If, indeed, there existed in such phrases an identity of names between the creation and its Maker, he might perhaps be excused for making the name of \"creation\" also common to the thing created and to Him Who made it, on the ground of the community of the other names: but if the characteristics which are contemplated by means of the names, in the created and in the uncreated nature, are in no case reconcilable or common to both, how can the misrepresentation of that man fail to be manifest to all, who dares to apply the name of servitude to Him Who, as the Psalmist declares, \"ruleth with His power for ever[fn-13-P1320_713138:9-nf] ,\" and to bring Him Who, as the Apostle says, \"in all things hath the pre-eminence[fn-13-P1321_713245:10-nf] ,\" to a level with the servile nature, by means of the name and conception of \"creation\"? For that all[fn-13-P1322_713365:11-nf] the creation is in bondage the great Paul declares[fn-13-P1323_713472:12-nf] , - he who in the schools above the heavens was instructed in that knowledge which may not be spoken, learning these things in that place where every voice that conveys meaning by verbal utterance is still, and where unspoken meditation becomes the word of instruction, teaching to the purified heart by means of the silent illumination of the thoughts those truths which transcend speech. If then on the one hand Paul proclaims aloud \"the creation is in bondage,\" and on the other the Only-begotten God is truly Lord and God over all, and John bears witness to the fact that the whole creation of the things that were made is by Him, how can any one, who is in any sense whatever numbered among Christians, hold his peace when he sees Eunomius, by his inconsistent and inconsequent systematizing, degrading to the humble state of the creature, by means of an identity of name: that tends to servitude, that power of Lordship which surpasses all rule and all authority? And if he says that he has some of the saints who declared Him to be a slave, or created, or made, or any of these lowly and servile names, lo, here are the Scriptures. Let him, or some other on his behalf, produce to us one such phrase, and we will hold our peace. But if there is no such phrase (and there could never be found in those inspired Scriptures which we believe any such thought as to support this impiety), what need is there to strive further upon points admitted with one who not only misrepresents the words of the saints, but even contends against his own definitions? For if the \"order of nature,\" as he himself admits, bears additional testimony to the Son's name by reason of His being begotten, and thus the correspondence of the name is according to the relation of the Begotten to the Begetter, how comes it that he wrests the significance of the word \"Son\" from its natural application, and changes the relation to \"the thing made and its maker\"-a relation which applies not only in the case of the elements of the universe, but might also be asserted of a gnat or an ant-that in so far as each of these is a thing made, the relation of its name to its maker is similarly equivalent? The blasphemous nature of his doctrine is clear, not only from many other passages, but even from those quoted: and as for that \"use of the saints\" which he alleges that he follows in these expressions, it is clear that there is no such use at all.","title":"Book III","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":66,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_15_book_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"He next proceeds once mere to slander us as dishonouring the generation of the Son by human similitudes, and mentions what was written on these points by our father[fn-15-P1563_899327:79-nf] , where he says that while by the word \"Son\" two things are signified, the being formed by passion, and the true relationship to the begetter, he does not admit in discourses upon things divine the former sense, which is unseemly and carnal, but in so far as the latter tends to testify to the glory of the Only-begotten, this alone finds a place in the sublime doctrines.

Such a reproach Paul also once incurred with the Athenians, being charged therewith by them as \"a setter forth of strange gods[fn-15-P1565_900789:81-nf] ,\" when he was reproving the wandering among their gods of those who were mad in their idolatry, and was leading them to the truth, preaching the resurrection by the Son These charges are now brought against Paul's follower by the new Stoics and Epicureans, who \"spend their time in nothing else,\" as the history says of the Athenians, \"but either to tell or to hear some new thing[fn-15-P1566_901191:82-nf] .\" For what could be found newer than this,-a Son of an energy, and a Father of a creature, and a new God springing up from nothing, and good at variance with good? These are they who profess to honour Him with due honour by saying that He is not that which the nature of Him that begat Him is. Is Eunomius not ashamed of the form of such honour, if one were to say that he himself is not akin in nature to his father, but has community with something of another kind? If he who brings the Lord of the creation into community with the creation declares that he honours Him by so doing, let him also himself be honoured by having community assigned him with what is brute and senseless: but, if he finds community with an inferior nature hard and insolent treatment, how is it honour for Him Who, as the prophet saith, \"ruleth with His power for ever[fn-15-P1567_902061:83-nf] ,\" to be ranked with that nature which is in subjection and bondage?

To whom now will the just vote of those who have to try our cause be given, or who will seem to them to be under the weight of these charges? he who says that the created was saved by the uncreated God, or he who refers the cause of our salvation to the creature?

As for our saying that the Lord was in the form of a servant before His presence in the flesh, that is just like charging us with saying that the stars are black and the sun misty, and the sky low, and water dry, and so on:-a man who does not maintain a charge on the ground of what he has heard, but makes up what seems good to him at his own sweet will, need not be sparing in making against us such charges as these.

How could one who says distinctly that the true Son was in the glory of the Father, insult the eternal glory of the Only-begotten by conceiving it to have been \"in the form of a servant\"?

No emperor or monarch who finds under his government the people with this mark kills them, that is, makes them cease to be Jews, and as Jews to be separate in their observances, and unlike the rest of the world. Only when a Jew comes over to Christ, he is no longer Cain, nor goes out from the presence of God, nor dwells in the land of Nod, which is said to mean commotion. Against this evil of commotion the Psalmist prays, \"Suffer not my feet to be moved;\"[fn-14-P1420_757819:31-nf] and again, \"Let not the hands of the wicked remove me;\"[fn-14-P1421_757893:32-nf] and, \"Those that trouble me will rejoice when I am moved:\"[fn-14-P1422_757972:33-nf] and, \"The Lord is at my right hand, that I should not be moved;\"[fn-14-P1423_758055:34-nf] and so in innumerable places.

The Manichaeans should think of this, to keep them from the blasphemy of identifying themselves with the nature and substance of God. But they cannot think, because they are not content. The Sabbath of the heart they are Strangers to. If they were content, as Cain was told to be, they would refer their sin to themselves; that is, they would lay the blame on themselves, and not on a race of darkness that no one ever heard of, and so by the grace of God they would prevail over their sin. But now the Manichaeans, and all who oppose the truth by their various heresies, leave the presence of God, like Cain and the scattered Jews, and inhabit the land of commotion, that is, of carnal disquietude, instead of the enjoyment of God, that is instead of Eden, which is interpreted Feasting, where Paradise was planted.

But it is for that reason we ask not to be led into temptation, so that\nthis may not happen. And if we are heard, certainly it does not happen, because God does not allow it\nto happen. For nothing comes to pass except what either He Himself does, or Himself allows to be\ndone. Therefore He is powerful both to turn wills from evil to good, and to convert those that are\ninclined to fall, or to direct them into a way pleasing to Himself. For to Him it is not said in\nvain, \"O God, Thou shalt turn again and quicken us;\"[fn-69-P6994_2672173:20-nf] it is not vainly said, \"Give not my foot to be\nmoved;\"[fn-69-P6995_2672248:21-nf] it is not vainly said, \"Give me\nnot over, O Lord, from my desire to the sinner;\"[fn-69-P6996_2672347:22-nf] finally, not to mention many passages, since\nprobably more may occur to you, it is not vainly said, \"Lead us not into temptation.\"[fn-69-P6997_2672495:23-nf] For whoever is not led into temptation, certainly\nis not led into the temptation of his own evil will; and he who is not led into the temptation of his\nown evil will, is absolutely led into no temptation. For \"every one is tempted,\" as it is written,\n\"when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed;\"[fn-69-P6998_2672819:24-nf] \"but God tempteth no man,\"[fn-69-P6999_2672863:25-nf] -that is to say, with a hurtful temptation.

When, therefore, we say to\nGod, \"Lead us not into temptation,\" what do we say but, \"Permit us not to be led\"? Whence some pray\nin this manner, and it is read in many codices, and the most blessed Cyprian thus uses it: \"Do not\nsuffer us to be led into temptation.\" In the Greek gospel, however, I have never found it otherwise\nthan, \"Load us not into temptation.\" We live, therefore, more securely if we give up the whole to\nGod, and do not entrust ourselves partly to Him and partly to ourselves, as that venerable martyr\nsaw. For when he would expound the same clause of the prayer, he says among other things, \"But when\nwe ask that we may not come into temptation, we are reminded of our infirmity and weakness while we\nthus ask, lest any should insolently vaunt himself,-lest any should proudly and arrogantly assume\nanything to himself,-lest any should take to himself the glory either of confession or suffering as\nhis own; since the Lord Himself, teaching humility, said, 'Watch and pray, that ye enter not into\ntemptation; the Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.'
