{"verses":["A gradual canticle.  Out of the depths I have cried to thee, O\nLord:","Lord, hear my voice.  Let thy ears be attentive to the voice of\nmy supplication.","If thou, O Lord, wilt mark iniquities:  Lord, who shall stand it.","For with thee there is merciful forgiveness:  and by reason of\nthy law, I have waited for thee, O Lord.  My soul hath relied on his\nword:","my soul hath hoped in the Lord.","From the morning watch even until night, let Israel hope in the\nLord.","Because with the Lord there is mercy:  and with him plentiful\nredemption.","And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities."]}
