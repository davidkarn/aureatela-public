{"verses":["A psalm for David.  Judge me, O God, and distinguish my cause from\nthe nation that is not holy:  deliver me from the unjust and deceitful\nman.","For thou art God my strength:  why hast thou cast me off?  and why\ndo I go sorrowful whilst the enemy afflicteth me?","Sent forth thy light and thy truth:  they have conducted me, and\nbrought me unto thy holy hill, and into thy tabernacles.","And I will go in to the altar of God:  to God who giveth joy to my\nyouth.","To thee, O God my God, I will give praise upon the harp:  why art\nthou sad, O my soul?  and why dost thou disquiet me?","Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him:  the salvation\nof my countenance, and my God."]}
