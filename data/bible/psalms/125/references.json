While it separated Him from the Father, it united Him to men. We must now consider what was the spiritual constitution of the humanity which He assumed, as we have already considered the physical Man, as we saw (p. Ixix.) is constituted of body and soul, an outward and an inward substance, the one earthly, the other heavenly[fn-4-P489_357355:309-nf] . The exact ptocess of his creation has beenrevealed. First, man-that is, his soul-was made in the image of God; next, long afterwards, his body was fashioned out of dust; finally by a distinct act, man was made a living soul by the breath of God, the heavenly and earthly natures being thus coupled together[fn-4-P490_357709:310-nf] . The world was already complete when God created the highest, the most beautiful of His works after His own image. His other works were made by an instantaneous command; even the firmament was established by his hand[fn-4-P491_357948:311-nf] ; man alone was made by the hands of God;-'Thy hands have made me and fashioned me.' This singular honour of being made by a process, not an act, and by the hands, not the hand or the voice, of God, was paid to man not simply as the highest of the creatures, but as the one for whose sake the rest of the universe was called into being[fn-4-P492_358454:312-nf] . It is, of course, the soul, made after the image of God, which has this high honour; an honour which no length of sinful ancestry can forfeit, for each soul is still separately created. Hence no human soul is akin to any other human soul; the uniformity of type is secured by each being made in the same pattern, and the dignity of humanity by the fact that this pattern is that of the Son, the Image of God. But the soul pervades the whole body with which it is associated, even as God pervades the universe[fn-4-P493_358985:313-nf] . The soul of each man is individual, special to himself; his brotherhood with mankind belongs to him through his body, which has therefore something of universality. Hence the relation of mankind with Christ is not through his human soul; it was 'the nature of universal flesh' which He took[fn-4-P494_359314:314-nf] that has made Him one with us in the Incarnation and in the Eucharist[fn-4-P495_359534:315-nf] . The reality of His body, as we have seen, is amply secured by Hilary; its universality is assured by the absence of any individual human paternity, which would have isolated Him from others[fn-4-P496_359781:316-nf] . Thus He took all humanity into His one body; He is the Church[fn-4-P497_359954:317-nf] , for He contains her through the mystery of His body. In Him, by the same means, 'there is contained the congregation, so to speak, of the whole race of men.' Hence He spoke of Himself as the City set on a hill; the inhabitants are mankind[fn-4-P498_360222:318-nf] . But Christ not only embraces all humanity in Himself, but the archetype after Whom, and the final cause for Whom, man was made. Every soul, when it proceeds from the hands of God, is pure, free and immortal, with a natural affinity and capacity for good[fn-4-P499_360711:319-nf] , which can find its satisfaction only in Christ, the ideal Man. But if Christ is thus everything to man, humanity has also, in the foreordained purpose of God. something to confer upon Christ. The temporary humiliation of the Incarnation has for its result a higher glory than He possessed before[fn-5-P500_361063:320-nf] , acquired through the harmony of the two natures.","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":125,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"And yet the passages are true which he goes on to adduce by way of answer, saying: \"The Saviour in the gospel declares, `Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.'[fn-26-P2660_1048319:161-nf] David also says, `Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place? He that is innocent in his hands, and pure in his heart;'[fn-26-P2661_1048496:162-nf] and again in another passage, `Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good and upright in heart.'[fn-26-P2662_1048614:163-nf] So also in Solomon: `Riches are good unto him that hath no sin on his conscience;'[fn-26-P2663_1048717:164-nf] and again in the same book, `Leave off from sin, and order thine hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from wickedness.'[fn-26-P2664_1048861:165-nf] So in the Epistle of John, `If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God; and whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him.'\"[fn-26-P2665_1049033:166-nf] For all this is accomplished by the will, by the exercise of faith, hope, and love; by keeping under the body; by doing alms; by forgiving injuries; by earnest prayer; by supplicating for strength to advance in our course; by sincerely saying, \"Forgive us, as we also forgive others,\" and \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\"[fn-26-P2666_1049406:167-nf] By this process, it is certainly brought about that our heart is cleansed, and all our sin taken away; and what the righteous King, when sitting on His throne, shall find concealed in the heart and uncleansed as yet, shall be remitted by His mercy, so that the whole shall be rendered sound and cleansed for seeing God. For\" he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath showed no mercy: yet mercy triumpheth against judgment.\"[fn-26-P2667_1049861:168-nf] If it were not so, what hope could any of us have? \"When, indeed, the righteous King shall sit upon His throne, who shall boast that he hath a pure heart, or who shall boldly say that he is pure from sin?\" Then, however, through His mercy shall the righteous, being by that time fully and perfectly cleansed, shine forth like the glorious sun in the kingdom of their Father.[fn-26-P2668_1050257:169-nf] ","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":125,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_40_oration_xxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"18. Such was the lot of Job: such at first sight his history. In reality it was a contest between virtue and envy:[fn-40-P4088_1221965:53-nf] the one straining every nerve to overcome the good, the other enduring everything, that it might abide unsubdued; the one striving to smooth the way for vice, by means of the chastisement of the upright, the other to retain its hold upon the good, even if they do exceed others in misfortunes. What then of Him who answered Job out of the whirlwind and cloud,[fn-40-P4089_1222397:54-nf] Who is slow to chastise and swift to help, Who suffers not utterly the rod of the wicked to come into the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous should learn iniquity?[fn-40-P4090_1222588:55-nf] At the end of the contests He declares the victory of the athlete in a splendid proclamation and lays bare the secret of his calamities, saying: \"Thinkest thou that I have dealt with thee for any other purpose than the manifestation of thy righteousness?\"[fn-40-P4091_1222862:56-nf] This is the balm for his wounds, this is the crown of the contest, this the reward for his patience.

The eighth passage is, That they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent;[fn-45-P4560_1435250:66-nf] and There is none good save one, that is, God.[fn-45-P4561_1435315:67-nf] The solution of this appears to me very easy. For if you attribute this only to the Father, where will you place the Very Truth? For if you conceive in this manner of the meaning of To the only wise God,[fn-45-P4562_1435540:68-nf] or Who only hath Immortality, Dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto,[fn-45-P4563_1435643:69-nf] or of to the king of the Ages, immortal, invisible, and only wise God,[fn-45-P4564_1435731:70-nf] then the Son has vanished under sentence of death, or of darkness, or at any rate condemned to be neither wise nor king, nor invisible, nor God at all, which sums up all these points. And how will you prevent His Goodness, which especially belongs to God alone, from perishing with the rest? I, however, think that the passage That they may know Thee the only true God, was said to overthrow those gods which are falsely so called, for He would not have added and Jesus Christ Whom Thou hast sent, if The Only True God were contrasted with Him, and the sentence did not proceed upon the basis of a common Godhead. The \"None is Good\" meets the tempting Lawyer, who was testifying to His Goodness viewed as Man. For perfect goodness, He says, is God's alone, even if a man is called perfectly good. As for instance, A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things.[fn-45-P4565_1436638:71-nf] And, I will give the kingdom to one who is good above Thee.[fn-45-P4566_1436717:72-nf] ... Words of God, speaking to Saul about David. Or again, Do good, O Lord, unto the good[fn-45-P4567_1436826:73-nf] ... and all other like expressions concerning those of us who are praised, upon whom it is a kind of effluence from the Supreme Good, and has come to them in a secondary degree. It will be best of all if we can persuade you of this. But if not, what will you say to the suggestion on the other side, that on your hypothesis the Son has been called the only God. In what passage? Why, in this:-This is your God; no other shall be accounted of in comparison with Him, and a little further on, after this did He shew Himself upon earth, and conversed with men.[fn-45-P4568_1437402:74-nf] This addition proves clearly that the words are not used of the Father, but of the Son; for it was He Who in bodily form companied with us, and was in this lower world. Now, if we should determine to take these words as said in contrast with the Father, and not with the imaginary gods, we lose the Father by the very terms which we were pressing against the Son. And what could be more disastrous than such a victory?","title":"Oration XXX.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":125,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_38_life_of_antony","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"51. So he was alone in the inner mountain, spending his time in prayer and discipline. And the brethren who served him asked that they might come every month and bring him olives, pulse and oil, for by now he was an old man.

For there they heard tumults, many voices, and, as it were, the clash of arms. At night they saw the mountain become full of wild beasts, and him also fighting as though against visible beings, and praying against them. And those who came to him he encouraged, while kneeling he contended and prayed to the Lord. Surely it was a marvellous thing that a man, alone in such a desert, feared neither the demons who rose up against him, nor the fierceness of the four-footed beasts and creeping things, for all they were so many. But in truth, as it is written, `He trusted in the Lord as Mount Sion[fn-38-P3802_1582616:113-nf] ,' with a mind unshaken and undisturbed; so that the demons rather fled from him, and the wild beasts, as it is written[fn-38-P3803_1582756:114-nf] , `kept peace with him.'","title":"Life of Antony","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":125,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_76_iii_from_the_catena_on_luke_edited_by_corderius_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Luke 16:17.

And speaking of these things being delivered to him, to be always had in remembrance, he immediately writes to him. saying, `Meditate on these things: be engaged in them[fn-93-P9322_3382496:23-nf] ' For constant meditation, and the remembrance of divine words, strengthens piety towards God, and produces a love to Him inseparable and not merely formal[fn-93-P9323_3382672:24-nf] ; as he, being of this mind, speaks about himself and others like-minded, saying boldly, `Who shall separate us from the love of God[fn-93-P9324_3383110:25-nf] ?' For[fn-93-P9325_3383137:26-nf] such men, being confirmed in the Lord, and possessing an unshaken disposition towards Him, and being one in spirit (for[fn-93-P9326_3383432:27-nf] `he who is joined to the Spirit is one spirit'), are sure `as the mount Sion;' and although ten thousand trials may rage against them, they are founded upon a rock, which is Christ[fn-93-P9327_3383630:28-nf] . In Him the careless take no delight; and having no continuous purpose of good, they are sullied by temporal attacks, and esteem nothing more highly than present things, being unstable and deserving reproof as regards the faith. For `either the care of this world, or the deceitfulness of riches, chokes them[fn-93-P9328_3383986:29-nf] ;' or, as Jesus said in that parable which had reference to them, since they have not established the faith that has been preached to them, but continue only for a time, immediately, in time of persecution, or when affliction ariseth through the word, they are offended. Now those who meditate evil we say, [think] not truth, but falsehood and not righteousness, but iniquity, for their tongue learns to speak lies. They have done evil, and have not ceased that they might repent. For, persevering with delight in wicked actions, they hasten thereto without turning back, even treading under foot the commandment with regard to neighbours, and, instead of loving them, devise evil against them, as the saint testifies, saying, `And those who seek me evil have spoken vanity, and imagined deceit all the day[fn-93-P9329_3384814:30-nf] .' But that the cause of such meditation is none other than the want of instruction, the divine proverb has already declared; `The son that forsaketh the commandment of his father meditateth evil words[fn-93-P9330_3385038:31-nf] .' But such meditation, because it is evil, the Holy Spirit blames in these words, and reproves too in other terms, saying, `Your hands are polluted with blood, your fingers with sins; your lips have spoken lawlessness, and your tongue imagineth iniquity: no man speaketh right things, nor is there true judgment[fn-93-P9331_3385376:32-nf] .' But what the end is of such perverse imagining, He immediately declares, saying, `They trust in vanities and speak falsehood; for they conceive mischief, and bring forth lawlessness. They have hatched the eggs of an asp, and woven a spider's web; and he who is prepared to eat of their eggs, when he breaks them finds gall, and a basilisk therein[fn-93-P9332_3385755:33-nf] .' Again, what the hope of such is, He has already announced. `Because righteousness does not overtake them, when they waited for light, they had darkness; when they waited for brightness, they walked in a thick cloud. They shall grope for the wall like the blind, and as those who have no eyes shall they grope; they shall fall at noon-day as at midnight; when dead, they shall groan. They shall roar together as a bear, or as a dove[fn-93-P9333_3386210:34-nf] .'","title":"Letter XI. For 339.","author":"Athanasius"}]
