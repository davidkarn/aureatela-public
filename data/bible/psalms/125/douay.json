{"verses":["A gradual canticle.  When the Lord brought back the captivity of\nSion, we became like men comforted.","Then was our mouth filled with gladness; and our tongue with\njoy.  Then shall they say among the Gentiles:  The Lord hath done great\nthings for them.","The Lord hath done great things for us:  we are become joyful.","Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as a stream in the south.","They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.","Going they went and wept, casting their seeds.","But coming they shall come with joyfulness, carrying their\nsheaves."]}
