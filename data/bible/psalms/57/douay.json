{"verses":["Unto the end, destroy not, for David, for an inscription of a\ntitle.","If in very deed ye speak justice:  judge right things, ye sons of\nmen.","For in your heart you work iniquity:  your hands forge injustice\nin the earth.","The wicked are alienated from the womb; they have gone astray\nfrom the womb:  they have spoken false things.","Their madness is according to the likeness of a serpent:  like the\ndeaf asp that stoppeth her ears:","Which will not hear the voice of the charmers; nor of the wizard\nthat charmeth wisely.","God shall break in pieces their teeth in their mouth:  the Lord\nshall break the grinders of the lions.","They shall come to nothing, like water running down; he hath bent\nhis bow till they be weakened.","Like wax that melteth they shall be taken away:  fire hath fallen\non them, and they shall not see the sun.","Before your thorns could know the brier; he swalloweth them up,\nas alive, in his wrath.","The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge:  he shall\nwash his hands in the blood of the sinner.","And man shall say:  If indeed there be fruit to the just:  there\nis indeed a God that judgeth them on the earth."]}
