{"verses":["For David himself.  Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me:\noverthrow them that fight against me.","Take hold of arms and shield:  and rise up to help me.","Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that\npersecute me:  say to my soul:  I am thy salvation.","Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul.  Let\nthem be turned back and be confounded that devise evil against me.","Let them become as dust before the wind:  and let the angel of the\nLord straiten them.","Let their way become dark and slippery; and let the angel of the\nLord pursue them.","For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto\ndestruction:  without cause they have upbraided my soul.","Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him:  and let the net\nwhich he hath hidden catch him:  and into that very snare let them fall.","But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; and shall be delighted in\nhis salvation.","All my bones shall say:  Lord, who is like to thee?  Who\ndeliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he;\nthe needy and the poor from them that strip him.","Unjust witnesses rising up have asked me things I knew not.","They repaid me evil for good:  to the depriving me of my soul.","But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I was clothed\nwith haircloth.  I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall be\nturned into my bosom.","As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please:  as one\nmourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.","But they rejoiced against me, and came together:  scourges were\ngathered together upon me, and I knew not.","They were separated, and repented not:  they tempted me, they\nscoffed at me with scorn:  they gnashed upon me with their teeth.","Lord, when wilt thou look upon me?  rescue thou my soul from\ntheir malice:  my only one from the lions.","I will give thanks to thee in a great church; I will praise thee\nin a strong people.","Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:  who\nhave hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.","For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; and speaking in the anger\nof the earth they devised guile.","And they opened their mouth wide against me; they said:  Well\ndone, well done, our eyes have seen it.","Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent:  O Lord, depart not\nfrom me.","Arise, and be attentive to my judgment:  to my cause, my God, and\nmy Lord.","Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, and let them\nnot rejoice over me.","Let them not say in their hearts:  It is well, it is well, to our\nmind:  neither let them say:  We have swallowed him up.","Let them blush:  and be ashamed together, who rejoice at my\nevils.  Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, who speak great\nthings against me.","Let them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my\njustice, and let them say always:  The Lord be magnified, who delights\nin the peace of his servant.","And my tongue shall meditate thy justice, thy praise all the day\nlong."]}
