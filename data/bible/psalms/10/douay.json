{"verses":["Unto the end.  A psalm to David.","In the Lord I put my trust:  how then do you say to my soul:  Get\nthee away from hence to the mountain, like a sparrow.","For, lo, the wicked have bent their bow:  they have prepared their\narrows in the quiver, to shoot in the dark the upright of heart.","For they have destroyed the things which thou hast made:  but what\nhas the just man done?","The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven.\nHis eyes look on the poor man:  his eyelids examine the sons of men.","The Lord trieth the just and the wicked:  but he that loveth\niniquity, hateth his own soul.","He shall rain snares upon sinners:  fire and brimstone, and storms\nof winds, shall be the portion of their cup.","For the Lord is just, and hath loved justice:  his countenance\nhath beheld righteousness."]}
