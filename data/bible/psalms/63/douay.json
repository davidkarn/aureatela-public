{"verses":["Unto the end, a psalm for David.","Hear O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee:  deliver\nmy soul from the fear of the enemy.","Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; from\nthe multitude of the workers of iniquity.","For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; they have bent\ntheir bow a bitter thing,","To shoot in secret the undefiled.","They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear:  they are\nresolute in wickedness.  They have talked of hiding snares; they have\nsaid:  Who shall see them?","They have searched after iniquities:  they have failed in their\nsearch.  Man shall come to a deep heart:","And God shall be exalted.  The arrows of children are their\nwounds:","And their tongues against them are made weak.  All that saw them\nwere troubled;","And every man was afraid.  And they declared the works of God,\nand understood his doings.","The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him:  and\nall the upright in heart shall be praised."]}
