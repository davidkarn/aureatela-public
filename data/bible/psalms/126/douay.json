{"verses":["A gradual canticle of Solomon.  Unless the Lord build the house,\nthey labour in vain that build it.  Unless the Lord keep the city, he\nwatcheth in vain that keepeth it.","It is vain for you to rise before light, rise ye after you have\nsitten, you that eat the bread of sorrow.  When he shall give sleep to\nhis beloved,","Behold the inheritance of the Lord are children:  the reward, the\nfruit of the womb.","As arrows in the hand of the mighty, so the children of them\nthat have been shaken.","Blessed is the man that hath filled the desire with them; he\nshall not be confounded when he shall speak to his enemies in the gate."]}
