{"verses":["A psalm of David, when his son Absalom pursued him.  [2 Kings 17.]\nHear, O Lord, my prayer:  give ear to my supplication in thy truth:\nhear me in thy justice.","And enter not into judgment with thy servant:  for in thy sight\nno man living shall be justified.","For the enemy hath persecuted my soul:  he hath brought down my\nlife to the earth.  He hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that\nhave been dead of old:","And my spirit is in anguish within me:  my heart within me is\ntroubled.","I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all thy works:  I\nmeditated upon the works of thy hands.","I stretched forth my hands to thee:  my soul is as earth without\nwater unto thee.","Hear me speedily, O Lord:  my spirit hath fainted away.  Turn not\naway thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the\npit.","Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning; for in thee have I\nhoped.  Make the way known to me, wherein I should walk:  for I have\nlifted up my soul to thee.","Deliver me from my enemies, O Lord, to thee have I fled:","Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God.  Thy good spirit\nshall lead me into the right land:","for thy name's sake, O Lord, thou wilt quicken me in thy justice.\nThou wilt bring my soul out of trouble:","And in thy mercy thou wilt destroy my enemies.  And thou wilt\ncut off all them that afflict my soul:  for I am thy servant."]}
