{"verses":["Unto the end, a psalm for the sons of Core.","Hear these things, all ye nations:  give ear, all ye inhabitants\nof the world.","All you that are earthborn, and you sons of men:  both rich and\npoor together.","My mouth shall speak wisdom:  and the meditation of my heart\nunderstanding.","I will incline my ear to a parable; I will open my proposition on\nthe psaltery.","Why shall I fear in the evil day?  the iniquity of my heel shall\nencompass me.","They that trust in their own strength, and glory in the multitude\nof their riches,","No brother can redeem, nor shall man redeem:  he shall not give to\nGod his ransom,","Nor the price of the redemption of his soul:  and shall labour for\never,","And shall still live unto the end.","He shall not see destruction, when he shall see the wise dying:\nthe senseless and the fool shall perish together:  And they shall leave\ntheir riches to strangers:","And their sepulchres shall be their houses for ever.  Their\ndwelling places to all generations:  they have called their lands by\ntheir names.","And man when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared\nto senseless beasts, and is become like to them.","This way of theirs is a stumblingblock to them:  and afterwards\nthey shall delight in their mouth.","They are laid in hell like sheep:  death shall feed upon them.\nAnd the just shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their\nhelp shall decay in hell from their glory.","But God will redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when he shall\nreceive me.","Be not thou afraid, when a man shall be made rick, and when the\nglory of his house shall be increased.","For when he shall die he shall take nothing away; nor shall his\nglory descend with him.","For in his lifetime his soul will be blessed:  and he will praise\nthee when thou shalt do well to him.","He shall go in to the generations of his fathers:  and he shall\nnever see light.","Man when he was in honour did not understand:  he hath been\ncompared to senseless beasts, and made like to them."]}
