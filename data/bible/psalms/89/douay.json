{"verses":["A prayer of Moses the man of God.  Lord, thou hast been our refuge\nfrom generation to generation.","Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was\nformed; from eternity and to eternity thou art God.","Turn not man away to be brought low:  and thou hast said:  Be\nconverted, O ye sons of men.","For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is\npast.  And as a watch in the night,","Things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.","In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he\nshall flourish and pass away:  in the evening he shall fall, grow dry,\nand wither.","For in thy wrath we have fainted away:  and are troubled in thy\nindignation.","Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes:  our life in the\nlight of thy countenance.","For all our days are spent; and in thy wrath we have fainted\naway.  Our years shall be considered as a spider:","The days of our years in them are threescore and ten years.  But\nif in the strong they be fourscore years:  and what is more of them is\nlabour and sorrow.  For mildness is come upon us:  and we shall be\ncorrected.","Who knoweth the power of thy anger, and for thy fear","Can number thy wrath?  So make thy right hand known:  and men\nlearned in heart, in wisdom.","Return, O Lord, how long?  and be entreated in favour of thy\nservants.","We are filled in the morning with thy mercy:  and we have\nrejoiced, and are delighted all our days.","We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us:  for\nthe years in which we have seen evils.","Look upon thy servants and upon their works:  and direct their\nchildren.","And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us:  and\ndirect thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands\ndo thou direct."]}
