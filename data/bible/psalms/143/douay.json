{"verses":["Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to fight, and\nmy fingers to war.","My mercy, and my refuge:  my support, and my deliverer:  My\nprotector, and I have hoped in him:  who subdueth my people under me.","Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him?  or the son\nof man, that thou makest account of him?","Man is like to vanity:  his days pass away like a shadow.","Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend:  touch the mountains, and\nthey shall smoke.","Send forth lightning, and thou shalt scatter them:  shoot out thy\narrows, and thou shalt trouble them.","Put forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliver me\nfrom many waters:  from the hand of strange children:","Whose mouth hath spoken vanity:  and their right hand is the\nright hand of iniquity.","To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle:  on the psaltery and\nan instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee.","Who givest salvation to kings:  who hast redeemed thy servant\nDavid from the malicious sword:","Deliver me, And rescue me out of the hand of strange children;\nwhose mouth hath spoken vanity:  and their right hand is the right hand\nof iniquity:","Whose sons are as new plants in their youth:  Their daughters\ndecked out, adorned round about after the similitude of a temple:","Their storehouses full, flowing out of this into that.  Their\nsheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth:","Their oxen fat.  There is no breach of wall, nor passage, nor\ncrying out in their streets.","They have called the people happy, that hath these things:  but\nhappy is that people whose God is the Lord."]}
