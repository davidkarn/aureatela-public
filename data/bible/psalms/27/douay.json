{"verses":["A psalm for David himself.  Unto thee will I cry, O Lord:  O my\nGod, be not thou silent to me:  lest if thou be silent to me, I become\nlike them that go down into the pit.","Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee;\nwhen I lift up my hands to thy holy temple.","Draw me not away together with the wicked; and with the workers\nof iniquity destroy me not:  Who speak peace with their neighbour, but\nevils are in their hearts.","Give them according to their works, and according to the\nwickedness of their inventions.  According to the works of their hands\ngive thou to them:  render to them their reward.","Because they have not understood the works of the Lord, and the\noperations of his hands:  thou shalt destroy them, and shalt not build\nthem up.","Blessed be the Lord, for he hath heard the voice of my\nsupplication.","The Lord is my helper and my protector:  in him hath my heart\nconfided, and I have been helped.  And my flesh hath flourished again,\nand with my will I will give praise to him.","The Lord is the strength of his people, and the protector of the\nsalvation of his anointed.","Save, O Lord, thy people, and bless thy inheritance:  and rule\nthem and exalt them for ever."]}
