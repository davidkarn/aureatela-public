{"verses":["Unto the end, a psalm of David.  Lord, thou hast proved me, and\nknown me:","Thou hast known my sitting down, and my rising up.","Thou hast understood my thoughts afar off:  my path and my line\nthou hast searched out.","And thou hast foreseen all my ways:  for there is no speech in my\ntongue.","Behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things, the last and those\nof old:  thou hast formed me, and hast laid thy hand upon me.","Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me:  it is high, and I\ncannot reach to it.","Whither shall I go from thy spirit?  or whither shall I flee from\nthy face?","If I ascend into heaven, thou art there:  if I descend into hell,\nthou art present.","If I take my wings early in the morning, and dwell in the\nuttermost parts of the sea:","Even there also shall thy hand lead me:  and thy right hand\nshall hold me.","And I said:  Perhaps darkness shall cover me:  and night shall be\nmy light in my pleasures.","But darkness shall not be dark to thee, and night shall be\nlight all the day:  the darkness thereof, and the light thereof are\nalike to thee.","For thou hast possessed my reins:  thou hast protected me from\nmy mother's womb.","I will praise thee, for thou art fearfully magnified:  wonderful\nare thy works, and my soul knoweth right well.","My bone is not hidden from thee, which thou hast made in\nsecret:  and my substance in the lower parts of the earth.","Thy eyes did see my imperfect being, and in thy book all shall\nbe written:  days shall be formed, and no one in them.","But to me thy friends, O God, are made exceedingly honourable:\ntheir principality is exceedingly strengthened.","I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the\nsand, I rose up and am still with thee.","If thou wilt kill the wicked, O God:  ye men of blood, depart\nfrom me:","Because you say in thought:  They shall receive thy cities in\nvain.","Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hated thee:  and pined away\nbecause of thy enemies?","I have hated them with a perfect hatred:  and they are become\nenemies to me.","Prove me, O God, and know my heart:  examine me, and know my\npaths.","And see if there be in me the way of iniquity:  and lead me in\nthe eternal way."]}
