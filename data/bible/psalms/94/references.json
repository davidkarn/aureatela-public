But this mental infirmity is now more prevalent and hurtful than ever, to such an extent that even after the truth has been as fully demonstrated as man can prove it to man, they hold for the very truth their own unreasonable fancies, either on account of their great blindness, which prevents them from seeing what is plainly set before them, or on account of their opinionative obstinacy, which prevents them from acknowledging the force of what they do see. There therefore frequently arises a necessity of speaking more fully on those points which are already clear, that we may, as it were, present them not to the eye, but even to the touch, so that they may be felt even by those who close their eyes against them. And yet to what end shall we ever bring our discussions, or what bounds can be set to our discourse, if we proceed on the principle that we must always reply to those who reply to us? For those who are either unable to understand our arguments, or are so hardened by the habit of contradiction, that though they understand they cannot yield to them, reply to us, and, as it is written, \"speak hard things,\"[fn-3-P395_143168:1-nf] and are incorrigibly vain. Now, if we were to propose to confute their objections as often as they with brazen face chose to disregard our arguments, and so often as they could by any means contradict our statements, you see how endless, and fruitless, and painful a task we should be undertaking.

That the phrases are not opposed to one another and do not, like squadrons in war marshalled one against another, bring the natures to which they are applied into mutual conflict, is perfectly, plain from the passage in question. The blessed Paul brings both phrases to bear upon one and the same subject, in the words \"of him and through him and to him are all things.\"[fn-11-P1183_279909:31-nf] That this plainly refers to the Lord will be admitted even by a reader paying but small attention to the meaning of the words. The apostle has just quoted from the prophecy of Isaiah, \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counsellor,[fn-11-P1184_280850:32-nf] and then goes on, \"For of him and from him and to him are all things.\" That the prophet is speaking about God the Word, the Maker of all creation, may be learnt from what immediately precedes: \"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?

But the devil was to be overcome, not by the power of God, but by His righteousness. For what is more powerful than the Omnipotent? Or what creature is there of which the power can be compared to the power of the Creator? But since the devil, by the fault of his own perversity, was made a lover of power, and a forsaker and assailant of righteousness,-for thus also men imitate him so much the more in proportion as they set their hearts on power, to the neglect or even hatred of righteousness, and as they either rejoice in the attainment of power, or are inflamed by the lust of it,-it pleased God, that in order to the rescuing of man from the grasp of the devil, the devil should be conquered, not by power, but by righteousness; and that so also men, imitating Christ, should seek to conquer the devil by righteousness, not by: power. Not that power is to be shunned as as though it were something evil; but the order must be preserved, whereby righteousness is before it. For how great can be the power of mortals? Therefore let mortals cleave to righteousness; power will be given to immortals. And compared to this, the power, how great soever, of those men who are called powerful on earth, is found to be ridiculous weakness, and a pitfall is dug there for the sinner, where the wicked seem to be most powerful. And the righteous man says in his song, \"Blessed is the man whom Thou chasteneth, O Lord, and teachest him out of Thy law: that Thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. For the Lord will not cast off His people, neither will He forsake His inheritance, until righteousness return unto judgment, and all who follow it are upright in heart.\"[fn-16-P1679_837641:27-nf] At this present time, then, in which the might of the people of God is delayed, \"the Lord will not cast off His. people, neither will He forsake His inheritance,\" how bitter and unworthy things so-ever it may suffer in its humility and weakness; \"until the righteousness,\" which the weakness of the pious now possesses, \"shall return to judgment,\" that is, shall receive the power of judging; which is preserved in the end for the righteous when power in its due order shall have followed after righteousness going before. For power joined to righteousness, or righteousness added to power, constitutes a judicial authority. But righteousness belongs to a good will; whence it was said by the angels when Christ was born: \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will,\"[fn-16-P1680_838456:28-nf] But power ought to follow righteousness, not to go before it; and accordingly it is placed in \"second,\" that is, prosperous fortune; and this is called \"second,\"[fn-16-P1681_838636:29-nf] from \"following.\" For whereas two things make a man blessed, as we have argued above, to will well, and to be able to do what one wills, people ought not to be so perverse, as has been noted in the same discussion, as that a man should choose from the two things which make him blessed, the being able to do what he wills, and should neglect to will what he ought; whereas he ought first to have a good will, but great power afterwards. Further, a good will must be purged from vices, by which if a man is overcome, he is in such wise overcome as that he wills evil; and then how will his will be still good? It is to be wished, then, that power may now be given, but power against vices, to conquer which men do not wish to be powerful, while they wish to be so in order to conquer men; and why is this, unless that, being in truth conquered, they feignedly conquer, and are conquerors not in truth, but in opinion? Leta man will to be prudent, will to be strong, will to he temperate, will to be just; and that he may be able to have these things truly, let him certainly desire power, and seek to be powerful in himself, and (strange though it be) against himself for himself. But all the other things which he wills rightly, and yet is not able to have, as, for instance, immortality and true and full felicity, let him not cease to long for, and let him patiently expect.

Those, therefore, in the Church of Christ who savor anything morbid and depraved, and, on being corrected that they may savor what is wholesome and right, contumaciously resist, and will not amend their pestiferous and deadly dogmas, but persist in defending them, become heretics, and, going without, are to be reckoned as enemies who serve for her discipline. For even thus they profit by their wickedness those true catholic members of Christ, since God makes a good use even of the wicked, and all things work together for good to them that love Him.[fn-35-P3580_1939180:112-nf] For all the enemies of the Church, whatever error blinds or malice depraves them, exercise her patience if they receive the power to afflict her corporally; and if they only oppose her by wicked thought, they exercise her wisdom: but at the same time, if these enemies are loved, they exercise her benevolence, or even her beneficence, whether she deals with them by persuasive doctrine or by terrible discipline.

For without doubt the divine providence procures for her both consolation through prosperity, that she may not be broken by adversity, and trial through adversity, that she may not be corrupted by prosperity; and thus each is tempered by the other, as we recognize in the Psalms that voice which arises from no other cause, \"According to the multitude of my griefs in my heart, Thy consolations have delighted my soul.\"[fn-35-P3581_1940207:113-nf] Hence also is that saying of the apostle, \"Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.\"[fn-35-P3582_1940315:114-nf] ","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":94,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_24_book_xviii","source_chapter":53,"source_paragraph":"211","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"For it is not to be thought that what the same teacher says can at any time fail, \"Whoever will live piously in Christ shall suffer persecution.\"[fn-35-P3584_1940482:115-nf] Because even when those who are without do not rage, and thus there seems to be, and really is, tranquillity, which brings very much consolation, especially to the weak, yet there are not wanting, yea, there are many within who by their abandoned manners torment the hearts of those who live piously, since by them the Christian and catholic name is blasphemed; and the dearer that name is to those who will live piously in Christ, the more do they grieve that through the wicked, who have a place within, it comes to be less loved than pious minds desire. The heretics themselves also, since they are thought to have the Christian name and sacraments, Scriptures, and profession, cause great grief in the hearts of the pious, both because many who wish to be Christians are compelled by their dissensions to hesitate, and many evil-speakers also find in them matter for blaspheming the Christian name, because they too are at any rate called Christians. By these and similar depraved manners and errors of men, those who will live piously in Christ suffer persecution, even when no one molests or vexes their body; for they suffer this persecution, not in their bodies, but in their hearts. Whence is that word, \"According to the multitude of my griefs in my heart;\" for he does not say, in my body. Yet, on the other hand, none of them can perish, because the immutable divine promises are thought of.

Finally, great consolations grow out of their chastisement, which imbue the souls of the pious with a fecundity as great as the pains with which they were troubled concerning their own perdition. Thus in this world, in these evil days, not only from the time of the bodily presence of Christ and His apostles, but even from that of Abel, whom first his wicked brother slew because he was righteous,[fn-35-P3588_1942911:119-nf] and thenceforth even to the end of this world, the Church has gone forward on pilgrimage amid the persecutions of the world and the consolations of God.

And consequently they say, since the earth is the first of the elements, beginning from the base of the series, the second the water above the earth, the third the air above the water, the fourth the heaven above the air, it follows that a body of earth cannot live in the heaven; for each element is poised by its own weight so as to preserve its own place and rank. Behold with what arguments human infirmity, possessed with vanity, contradicts the omnipotence of God! What, then, do so many earthly bodies do in the air, since the air is the third element from the earth? Unless perhaps He who has granted to the earthly bodies of birds that they be carried through the air by the lightness of feathers and wings, has not been able to confer upon the bodies of men made immortal the power to abide in the highest heaven. The earthly animals, too, which cannot fly, among which are men, ought on these terms to live under the earth, as fishes, which are the animals of the water, live under the water. Why, then, can an animal of earth not live in the second element, that is, in water, while it can in the third? Why, though it belongs to the earth, is it forthwith suffocated if it is forced to live in the second element next above earth, while it lives in the third, and cannot live out of it? Is there a mistake here in the order of the elements, or is not the mistake rather in their reasonings, and not in the nature of things? I will not repeat what I said in the thirteenth book,[fn-44-P4415_2434056:25-nf] that many earthly bodies, though heavy like lead, receive from the workman's hand a form which enables them to swim in water; and yet it is denied that the omnipotent Worker can confer on the human body a property which shall enable it to pass into heaven and dwell there.","title":"Book XXII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":94,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_117_the_second_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-08","text":"It has been reported at the seat of the apostles by your delegates,[fn-89-P8911_2897971:3-nf] that certain of our brethren, bishops to wit, are being expelled from their churches and seats, and deprived of their goods, and summoned, thus destitute and spoiled, to trial; a thing which is void of all reason, since the constitutions of the apostles and their successors, and the statutes of emperors, and the regulations of laws, prohibit it, and the authority of the seat of the apostles forbids it to be done. It has been ordained, indeed, in the ancient statutes, that bishops who have been ejected and spoiled of their property should recover their churches, and, in the first place, have all their property restored to them; and then, in the second place, that if any one may desire to accuse them justly, he should do so at the like risk; that the judges should be discreet, the bishops right-minded and harmonious in the Church, where they should be witnesses for ever one who seemed to be oppressed; and that they should not answer till all that belonged to them was restored to them, and to their churches by law without detriment. Nor is it strange, brethren, if they persecute you, when they persecuted even to death your Head, Christ our Lord. Yet even persecutions are to be endured patiently, that ye may be known to be His disciples, for whom also ye suffer. Whence, too, he says Himself, \"Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake.\"[fn-89-P8912_2899720:4-nf] Sustained by these testimonies, we ought not greatly to fear the reproach of men, nor be overcome by their up-braidings, since the Lord gives us this command by Isaiah the prophet, saying, \"Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, my people, in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings; \"[fn-89-P8913_2900084:5-nf] considering what is written in the Psalm, \"Shall not God search this out? for He knoweth the secrets of the heart,[fn-89-P8914_2900214:6-nf] and the thoughts of such men, that they are vanity,\"[fn-89-P8915_2900284:7-nf] \"They spoke vanity every one with his neighbour: with deceitful lips in their heart, and with an evil heart they spoke. But the Lord shall cut off all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things; who have said, Our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? \"[fn-89-P8916_2900571:8-nf] For if they kept these things in memory, they would by no means break forth into so great wickedness. For they do not this by laudable and paternal instruction (probabili et paterna doctrina), but that they may wreak their vengeful feeling against the servants of God. For it is written, \"The way of a fool is right in his eyes; \"[fn-89-P8917_2900919:9-nf] and, \"There are ways which seem right unto a man, but the end thereof leads to death.\"[fn-89-P8918_2901025:10-nf] Now we who suffer these things ought to leave them to the judgment of God, who will render to every man according to his works;[fn-89-P8919_2901173:11-nf] who also has thundered through His servants, saying, \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay.\"[fn-89-P8920_2901281:12-nf] Assist ye, therefore, one another in good faith, and by deed and with a hearty will; nor let any one remove his hand from the help of a brother, since \"by this,\" saith the Lord, \"shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\"[fn-89-P8921_2901557:13-nf] Whence, too, He speaks by the prophet, saying, \"Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!\"[fn-89-P8922_2901706:14-nf] In a spiritual dwelling, I interpret it, and in a concord which is in God, and in the unity of the faith which distinguishes this pleasant dwelling according to truth, which indeed was more beauteously illustrated in Aaron and the priests[fn-89-P8923_2901966:15-nf] clothed with honour, as ointment upon the head, nurturing the highest understanding and leading even to the end of wisdom. For in this dwelling the Lord has promised blessing and eternal life. Apprehending, therefore, the importance of this utterance of the prophet, we have spoken this present brotherly word for love's sake, and by no means seeking, or meaning to seek, our own things. For it is not good to repay detraction with detraction, or according to the common proverb to cast out a beam with a beam (excutere palum palo). Be it far from us. Such manners are not ours. May the Godhead indeed forbid it. By the just judgment of God, power is given sometimes to sinners to persecute His saints, in order that they who are aided and borne on by the Spirit of God may become more glorious through the discipline of sufferings. But to those very persons who persecute, and reproach, and injure them, there will doubtless be woe. Woe, woe to those who injure the servants of God; for injury done to them concerns Him whose service they discharge, and whose function they execute. But we pray that a door of enclosure be placed upon their mouths, as we desire that no one perish or be defiled by their lips, and that they think or publish with their mouth no hurtful word. Whence also the Lord speaks by the prophet, \"I said I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue.\"[fn-89-P8924_2903416:16-nf] May the Lord Almighty, and His only-begotten Son and our Saviour Jesus Christ, give you this incitement, that with all means in your power you aid all the brethren under whatsoever tribulations they labour, and esteem, as is meet, their sufferings your own. Afford them the utmost assistance by word and deed, that ye may be found His true disciples, who enjoined all to love the brethren as themselves.","title":"The Second Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":94,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In the Creator, however, the two courses were perfectly compatible-both the predestination before the ages and the revelation at the end thereof, because that which He both fore-ordained and revealed He also in the intermediate space of time announced by the pre-ministration of figures, and symbols, and allegories.

But it is no longer open to me[fn-74-P7412_2135424:251-nf] even to interpret the princes and powers of this world as the Creator's, since the apostle imputes ignorance to them, whereas even the devil according to our Gospel recognised Jesus in the temptation,[fn-74-P7413_2135659:252-nf] and, according to the record which is common to both (Marcionites and ourselves) the evil spirit knew that Jesus was the Holy One of God, and that Jesus was His name, and that He was come to destroy them.[fn-74-P7414_2135887:253-nf] The parable also of the strong man armed, whom a stronger than he overcame and seized his goods, is admitted by Marcion to have reference to the Creator:[fn-74-P7415_2136061:254-nf] therefore the Creator could not have been ignorant any longer of the God of glory, since He is overcome by him;[fn-74-P7416_2136219:255-nf] nor could He have crucified him whom He was unable to cope with. The inevitable inference, therefore, as it seems to me, is that we must believe that the princes and powers of the Creator did knowingly crucify the God of glory in His Christ, with that desperation and excessive malice with which the most abandoned slaves do not even hesitate to slay their masters.

What has your god to do at all with the sayings of the prophets? \"Who hath discovered the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-74-P7423_2137895:262-nf] So says Isaiah. What has he also to do with illustrations from our God? For when (the apostle) calls himself \"a wise master-builder,\"[fn-74-P7424_2138049:263-nf] we find that the Creator by Isaiah designates the teacher who sketches[fn-74-P7425_2138143:264-nf] out the divine discipline by the same title, \"I will take away from Judah the cunning artificer,\"[fn-74-P7426_2138262:265-nf] etc. And was it not Paul himself who was there foretold, destined \"to be taken away from Judah\"-that is, from Judaism-for the erection of Christianity, in order \"to lay that only foundation, which is Christ? \"[fn-74-P7427_2138584:266-nf] Of this work the Creator also by the same prophet says, \"Behold, I lay in Sion for a foundation a precious stone and honourable; and he that resteth thereon shall not be confounded.\"[fn-74-P7428_2138790:267-nf] Unless it be, that God professed Himself to be the builder up of an earthly work, that so He might not give any sign of His Christ, as destined to be the foundation of such as believe in Him, upon which every man should build at will the superstructure of either sound or worthless doctrine; forasmuch as it is the Creator's function, when a man's work shall be tried by fire, (or) when a reward shall be recompensed to him by fire; because it is by fire that the test is applied to the building which you erect upon the foundation which is laid by Him, that is, the foundation of His Christ.[fn-74-P7429_2139407:268-nf] \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? \"[fn-74-P7430_2140182:269-nf] Now, since man is the property, and the work, and the image and likeness of the Creator, having his flesh, formed by Him of the ground, and his soul of His afflatus, it follows that Marcion's god wholly dwells in a temple which belongs to another, if so be we are not the Creator's temple.

But it is no longer open to me[fn-74-P7412_2135424:251-nf] even to interpret the princes and powers of this world as the Creator's, since the apostle imputes ignorance to them, whereas even the devil according to our Gospel recognised Jesus in the temptation,[fn-74-P7413_2135659:252-nf] and, according to the record which is common to both (Marcionites and ourselves) the evil spirit knew that Jesus was the Holy One of God, and that Jesus was His name, and that He was come to destroy them.[fn-74-P7414_2135887:253-nf] The parable also of the strong man armed, whom a stronger than he overcame and seized his goods, is admitted by Marcion to have reference to the Creator:[fn-74-P7415_2136061:254-nf] therefore the Creator could not have been ignorant any longer of the God of glory, since He is overcome by him;[fn-74-P7416_2136219:255-nf] nor could He have crucified him whom He was unable to cope with. The inevitable inference, therefore, as it seems to me, is that we must believe that the princes and powers of the Creator did knowingly crucify the God of glory in His Christ, with that desperation and excessive malice with which the most abandoned slaves do not even hesitate to slay their masters. For it is written in my Gospel[fn-74-P7417_2136672:256-nf] that \"Satan entered into Judas.\"[fn-74-P7418_2136721:257-nf] According to Marcion, however, the apostle in the passage under consideration[fn-74-P7419_2136820:258-nf] does not allow the imputation of ignorance, with respect to the Lord of glory, to the powers of the Creator; because, indeed, he will have it that these are not meant by \"the princes of this world.\" But (the apostle) evidently[fn-74-P7420_2137068:259-nf] did not speak of spiritual princes; so that he meant secular ones, those of the princely people, (chief in the divine dispensation, although) not, of course, amongst the nations of the world, and their rulers, and king Herod, and even Pilate, and, as represented by him,[fn-74-P7421_2137355:260-nf] that power of Rome which was the greatest in the world, and then presided over by him. Thus the arguments of the other side are pulled down, and our own proofs are thereby built up. But you still maintain that our glory comes from your god, with whom it also lay in secret. Then why does your god employ the self-same Scripture[fn-74-P7422_2137698:261-nf] which the apostle also relies on? What has your god to do at all with the sayings of the prophets? \"Who hath discovered the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-74-P7423_2137895:262-nf] So says Isaiah. What has he also to do with illustrations from our God? For when (the apostle) calls himself \"a wise master-builder,\"[fn-74-P7424_2138049:263-nf] we find that the Creator by Isaiah designates the teacher who sketches[fn-74-P7425_2138143:264-nf] out the divine discipline by the same title, \"I will take away from Judah the cunning artificer,\"[fn-74-P7426_2138262:265-nf] etc. And was it not Paul himself who was there foretold, destined \"to be taken away from Judah\"-that is, from Judaism-for the erection of Christianity, in order \"to lay that only foundation, which is Christ? \"[fn-74-P7427_2138584:266-nf] Of this work the Creator also by the same prophet says, \"Behold, I lay in Sion for a foundation a precious stone and honourable; and he that resteth thereon shall not be confounded.\"[fn-74-P7428_2138790:267-nf] Unless it be, that God professed Himself to be the builder up of an earthly work, that so He might not give any sign of His Christ, as destined to be the foundation of such as believe in Him, upon which every man should build at will the superstructure of either sound or worthless doctrine; forasmuch as it is the Creator's function, when a man's work shall be tried by fire, (or) when a reward shall be recompensed to him by fire; because it is by fire that the test is applied to the building which you erect upon the foundation which is laid by Him, that is, the foundation of His Christ.[fn-74-P7429_2139407:268-nf] \"Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? \"[fn-74-P7430_2140182:269-nf] Now, since man is the property, and the work, and the image and likeness of the Creator, having his flesh, formed by Him of the ground, and his soul of His afflatus, it follows that Marcion's god wholly dwells in a temple which belongs to another, if so be we are not the Creator's temple. But \"if any man defile the temple of God, he shall be himself destroyed\"[fn-74-P7431_2140568:270-nf] -of course, by the God of the temple.[fn-74-P7432_2140658:271-nf] If you threaten an avenger, you threaten us with the Creator. \"Ye must become fools, that ye may be wise.\"[fn-74-P7433_2140788:272-nf] Wherefore? \"Because the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.\"[fn-74-P7434_2140882:273-nf] With what God? Even if the ancient Scriptures have contributed nothing in support of our view thus far,[fn-74-P7435_2141009:274-nf] an excellent testimony turns up in what (the apostle) here adjoins: \"For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.\"[fn-74-P7436_2141337:275-nf] For in general we may conclude for certain that he could not possibly have cited the authority of that God whom he was bound to destroy, since he would not teach for Him.[fn-74-P7437_2141560:276-nf] \"Therefore,\" says he, \"let no man glory in man; \"[fn-74-P7438_2141638:277-nf] an injunction which is in accordance with the teaching of the Creator, \"wretched is the man that trusteth in man; \"[fn-74-P7439_2141777:278-nf] again, \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to confide in man; \"[fn-74-P7440_2141866:279-nf] and the same thing is said about glorying (in princes).[fn-74-P7441_2141944:280-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":94,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_27_book_v_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"253","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"198.

What Pilate said to Christ, or what He replied to Pilate, has to be considered and handled in the present discourse. For after the words had been addressed to the Jews, \"Take ye him, and judge him according to your law,\" and the Jews had replied, \"It is not lawful for us to put any man to death, Pilate entered again into the judgment hall, and called Jesus, and said unto Him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus answered, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?\" The Lord indeed knew both what He Himself asked, and what reply the other was to give; but yet He wished it to be spoken, not for the sake of information to Himself, but that what He wished us to know might be recorded in Scripture. \"Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.\" This is what the good Master wished us to know; but first there had to be shown us the vain notion that men had regarding His kingdom, whether Gentiles or Jews, from whom Pilate had heard it; as if He ought to have been punished with death on the ground of aspiring to an unlawful kingdom; or as those in the possession of royal power usually manifest their ill-will to such as are yet to attain it, as if, for example, precautions were to be used lest His kingdom should prove adverse either to the Romans or to the Jews. But the Lord was able to reply to the first question of the governor, when he asked Him, \"Art thou the King of the Jews?\" with the words, \"My kingdom is not of this world,\" etc.; but by questioning him in turn, whether he said this thing of himself, or heard it from others, He wished by his answer to show that He had been charged with this as a crime before him by the Jews: laying open to us the thoughts of men, which were all known to Himself, that they are but vain;[fn-36-P3670_2031122:1-nf] and now, after Pilate's answer, giving them, both Jews and Gentiles, all the more reasonable and fitting a reply, \"My kingdom is not of this world.\" But had He made an immediate answer to Pilate's question, His reply would have appeared to refer to the Gentiles only, without including the Jews, as entertaining such an opinion regarding Him. But now when Pilate replied, \"Am I a Jew? Thine own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee to me;\" he removed from himself the suspicion of being possibly supposed to have spoken of his own accord, in saying that Jesus was the king of the Jews, by showing that such a statement had been communicated to him by the Jews. And then by saying, \"What hast thou done?\" he made it sufficiently clear that this was charged against Him as a crime: as if he had said, If thou deniest such kingly claims, what hast thou done to cause thy being delivered unto me? As if there would be no ground for wonder that one should be delivered up to a judge for punishment, who proclaimed himself a king; but if no such assertion were made, it became needful to inquire of Him, what else, if anything, He had done, that He should thus deserve to be delivered unto the judge.","title":"Tractate CXV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":94,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_39_book_iv_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"137","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"7.

And what you piously believe, that pray that you may have a wise understanding of. And, indeed, it is for this very purpose,-that is, that we may have a wise understanding, that there is a free will.

Peter, our holy master, and the prince of the apostles, was translated for the sake of the common good from Antioch to Rome, in order that he might be in a position there of doing more service. Eusebius also was transferred from a certain minor city to Alexandria by apostolic authority. In like manner Felix, on account of the doctrine and the good life which he maintained, was translated by the common consent of the bishops and the other priests, and the people from the city in which, on the election of the citizens, he had been ordained, to Ephesus. For that man is not chargeable with shifting from city to city who does not do that of his own inclination or by the force of ambition, but who is transferred for the general good, or in virtue of some necessity, by the counsel and with the consent of the chief parties. Nor can he be said to transfer himself from a smaller city to a larger, who is placed in that position not by his own self-seeking or his own choice, but either as being driven out of his own proper seat by force, or as being compelled by some necessity, and who without pride and in humility has been translated and installed there by others for the good of the place or the people: for man looketh on the countenance, but the Lord seeth the heart. And the Lord, speaking by the prophet, says, \"The Lord knows the thoughts of men, that they are vanity.\"[fn-91-P9151_2967926:4-nf] That man, therefore, does not change his seat who does not change his mind. Nor does he change his city who is changed not of his own will, but by the decision and election of others. And accordingly he does not shift from city to city who does not leave his own city for the sake of gain to himself, or of his own choice, but who, as has already been said, has been translated to another city either in consequence of being driven out of his own seat, or compelled by some necessity, or in virtue of the election and injunction of the priests and people. For as the bishops have power regularly to ordain bishops and other orders of priests, so, as often as any matter of advantage or necessity constrains them, they have power in the above-mentioned manner both to transfer and to install. As ye have asked our opinion in these matters, though they are not subjects unknown to you, we give you these things in charge to hold them, lest, through the ignorance of some, that which is better and more profitable be avoided, and what is more profitless be taken up, even as we read in the holy Gospel: \"Woe unto you, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides, which strain out a gnat and swallow a camel.\"[fn-91-P9152_2969326:5-nf] What is lawful is with them not lawful, and what is not lawful is lawful. Even as Jannes and Mambres[fn-91-P9153_2969451:6-nf] resisted the truth, so do they, being reprobate in mind, and lovers of pleasure rather than of God, teach that that is unlawful which is lawful, to wit, that bishops should shift from city to city in the manner already noted; and what is unlawful they teach as lawful, to wit, to omit to show mercy to those who endure straits: that is to say, theft deny that a bishop belonging to another city should be bestowed for good, or for necessity's sake, upon those who have no bishop, and who want the sacred episcopal ministry; and that another episcopal seat should be assigned to bishops who endure persecution or straits.

The divine lessons, which we have just heard as they were being read, warn us to gather in a stock of virtues, to fortify a Christian heart, against the offences which were predicted to come, and this from the mercy of the Lord. \"For what is man,\" saith Scripture, \"saving that Thou art mindful of him? \"[fn-43-P4381_1859076:1-nf] \"Woe unto the world because of offences,\"[fn-43-P4382_1859134:2-nf] saith the Lord; the Truth says so; He alarmeth and warneth us, He would not have us to be off our guard; for surely He would not make us desperate.

Therefore to avoid offences, whither wilt thou go beyond the world, unless thou fly to Him who made the world? And how shall we be able to fly to Him who made the world, unless we give ear to His law which is preached everywhere? And to give ear to it is but a small matter, unless we love it.

Wherefore although they should make themselves dumb, or although they should bind on their garments larger borders than the Pharisees, and pour themselves forth in long speeches, and practise the tones of their voice[fn-39-P3986_1671490:59-nf] , they ought not to be believed; for it is not the mode of speaking, but the intentions of the heart and a godly conversation that recommend the faithful Christian. And thus the Sadducees and Herodians, although they have the law in their mouths, were put to rebuke by our Saviour, who said unto them, `Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God[fn-39-P3987_1671882:60-nf] :' and all men witnessed the exposure of those who pretended to quote the words of the Law, as being in their minds heretics and enemies of God[fn-39-P3988_1672047:61-nf] . Others indeed they deceived by these professions, but when our Lord became man they were not able to deceive Him; `for the Word was made Flesh,' who `knoweth the thoughts of men that they are vain.' Thus He exposed the carping of the Jews, saying, `If God were your Father, ye would love Me, for I proceeded forth from the Father, and am come to you[fn-39-P3989_1672415:62-nf] .' In like manner these men seem now to act; for they disguise their real sentiments, and then make use of the language of Scripture for their writings, which they hold forth as a bait for the ignorant, that they may inveigle them into their own wickedness.","title":"To the Bishops of Egypt","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":94,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_23_tractate_xviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"9. \"For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that Himself doeth.\" Here is that \"showeth.\" \"Showeth,\" as it were, to whom? Of course, as to one that sees. We return to that which we cannot explain, how the Word seeth. Behold, man was made by the Word; but man has eyes, ears, hands, divers members in the body: he is able by the eyes to see, by the ears to hear, by the hands to work; the members are diverse, their offices diverse. One member cannot do the office of another; yet, by reason of the unity of the body, the eye sees both for itself and for the ear, and the ear hears for itself and for the eye. Are we to suppose that something like this holds good in the Word, seeing all things are by Him; and Scripture has said in the psalm, \"Understand, ye brutish among the people; and ye fools, at length be wise. He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? And He that formed the eye, shall He not see?\"[fn-9-P982_565554:3-nf] Hence, if the Word is He that formed the eye, for all things are by the Word; if the Word is He that planted the ear, for all things are by the Word: we cannot say the Word doth not hear, the Word doth not see; lest the psalm reprove us, and say, \"Fools, at length be wise.\" Therefore, if the Word heareth and seeth, if the Son heareth and seeth, are we yet to search for eyes and ears in Him in separate places? Does He by one part hear, by another see; and cannot His ear do what His eye doth; and cannot His eye do what His ear can? Or is He not all sight, all hearing? Perhaps yes; nay, not perhaps, but truly yes; whilst, however, that seeing of His, and that hearing of His, is in a way far other than it is with us. Both to see and to hear exist together in the Word: seeing and hearing are not diverse things in Him; but hearing is sight, and sight is hearing.","title":"Tractate XVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":94,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_76_homily_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"But, if ye be so minded, we will bring before you the language of those who wrest these declarations.
