{"verses":["Come let us praise the Lord with joy:  let us joyfully sing to God\nour saviour.","Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; and make a\njoyful noise to him with psalms.","For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.","For in his hand are all the ends of the earth:  and the heights of\nthe mountains are his.","For the sea is his, and he made it:  and his hands formed the dry\nland.","Come let us adore and fall down:  and weep before the Lord that\nmade us.","For he is the Lord our God:  and we are the people of his pasture\nand the sheep of his hand.","To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts:","As in the provocation, according to the day of temptation in the\nwilderness:  where your fathers tempted me, they proved me, and saw my\nworks.","Forty years long was I offended with that generation, and I\nsaid:  These always err in heart.","And these men have not known my ways:  so I swore in my wrath\nthat they shall not enter into my rest."]}
