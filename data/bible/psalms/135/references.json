Again the phrase, \"not having lot in his power,\" we should rather pass by as un-meaning than confute as ungodly. For what sense is attached to the term \"having lot\" is not easy to discover from the common use of the word. Those cast lots, as the Scripture tells us, for the Lord's vesture, who were unwilling to rend His garment, but disposed to make it over to that one of their number in whose favour the lot should decide[fn-10-P1026_552554:57-nf] . They then who thus cast lots among themselves for the \"coat\" may be said, perhaps, to \"have had lot\" in it. But here in the case of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as Their power resides in Their nature (for the Holy Spirit breathes \"where He listeth[fn-10-P1027_552865:58-nf] ,\" and \"worketh all in all as He will[fn-10-P1028_552924:59-nf] ,\" and the Son, by Whom all things were made, visible and invisible, in heaven and in earth, \"did all things whatsoever He pleased[fn-10-P1029_553098:60-nf] ,\" and \"quickeneth whom He will[fn-10-P1030_553149:61-nf] ,\" and the Father put \"the times in His own powers[fn-10-P1031_553220:62-nf] ,\" while from the mention of \"times\" we conclude that all things done in time are subject to the power I of the Father), if, I say, it has been demonstrated that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit alike are in a position of power to do what They will, it is impossible to see what sense there can be in the phrase \"having lot in His power.\" For the heir of all things, the maker of the ages[fn-10-P1032_553633:63-nf] , He Who shines with the Father's glory and expresses in Himself the Father's person, has all things that the Father Himself has, and is possessor of all His power, not that the right is transferred from the Father to the Son, but that it at once remains in the Father and resides in the Son. For He Who is in the Father is manifestly in the Father with all His own might, and He Who has the Father in Himself includes all the power and might of the Father. For He has in Himself all the Father, and not merely a part of Him: and He Who has Him entirely assuredly has His power as well. With what meaning, then, Eunomius asserts that the Father has \"none who has lot in His power,\" those perhaps can tell who are disciples of his folly one who knows how to appreciate language confesses that he cannot understand phrases divorced from meaning. The Father, he says, \"has none Who has lot in His power.\" Why, who is there that says that the Father and Son contend together for power and cast lots to decide the matter? But the holy Eunomius comes as mediator between them and by a friendly agreement without lot assigns to the Father the superiority in power.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":135,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_14_lecture_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"9.

And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, to slay the third part of men; and the number of the army of the horsemen was two hundred thousand of thousand: I heard the number of them. And then I saw the horses in the vision, and those that sate upon them, having breastplates of fire, and of hyacinth, and of sulphur: and the heads of the horses (as the heads of lions); and out of their mouth went fire, and smoke, and sulphur. By these three plagues the third part of men was slain, by the fire, and the smoke, and the sulphur which went forth from their mouth, and is in their tails: for their tails were like unto eels; for they had heads, and with them they do mischief.

Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, rejected the salutary counsel of the old men, not to deal harshly with the people, and preferred listening to the words of the. young men of his own age, by returning a rough answer to those to whom he should have spoken gently. Now whence arose such conduct, except from his own will? Upon this, however, the ten tribes of Israel revolted from him, and chose for themselves another king, even Jeroboam, that the will of God in His anger might be accomplished which He had predicted would come to pass.[fn-62-P6256_2408485:248-nf] For what says the Scripture? \"The king hearkened not unto the people; for the turning was from the Lord, that He might perform His saying, which the Lord spake to Ahijah the Shilonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\"[fn-62-P6257_2408734:249-nf] All this, indeed, was done by the will of man, although the turning was from the Lord. Read the books of the Chronicles, and you will find the following passage in the second book: \"Moreover, the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were neighbours to the Ethiopians; and they came up to the land of Judah, and ravaged it, and carried away all the substance which was found in the king's house.\"[fn-62-P6258_2409206:250-nf] Here it is shown that God stirs up enemies to devastate the countries which He adjudges deserving of such chastisement. Still, did these Philistines and Arabians invade the land of Judah to waste it with no will of their own? Or were their movements so directed by their own will that the Scripture lies which tells us that \"the Lord stirred up their spirit\" to do all this? Both statements to be sure are true, because they both came by their own will, and yet the Lord stirred up their spirit; and this may also with equal truth be stated the other way: The Lord both stirred up their spirit, and yet they came of their own will. For the Almighty sets in motion even in the innermost hearts of men the movement of their will, so that He does through their agency whatsoever He wishes to perform through them,-even He who knows not how to will anything in unrighteousness. What, again, is the purport of that which the man of God said to King Amaziah: \"Let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, even with all the children of Ephraim: for if thou shalt think to obtain with these, the Lord shall put thee to flight before thine enemies: for God hath power either to strengthen or to put to flight \"?[fn-62-P6259_2410467:251-nf] Now, how does the power of God help some in war by giving them confidence, and put others to flight by injecting fear into them, except it be that He who has made all things according to His own will, in heaven and on earth,[fn-62-P6260_2410719:252-nf] also works in the hearts of men? We read also what Joash, king of Israel, said when he sent a message to Amaziah, king of Judah, who wanted to fight with him. After certain other words, he added, \"Now tarry at home; why dost thou challenge me to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?\"[fn-62-P6261_2411057:253-nf] Then the Scripture has added this sequel: \"But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might be delivered into their hands, because they sought after the gods of Edom.\"[fn-62-P6262_2411262:254-nf] Behold, now, how God, wishing to punish the sin of idolatry, wrought this in this man's heart, with whom He was indeed justly angry, not to listen to sound advice, but to despise it, and go to the battle, in which he with his army was routed. God says by the prophet Ezekiel, \"If the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet: I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.\"[fn-62-P6263_2411754:255-nf] Then there is the book of Esther, who was a woman of the people of Israel, and in the land of their captivity became the wife of the foreign King Ahasuerus. In this book it is written, that, being driven by necessity to interpose in behalf of her people, whom the king had ordered to be slain in every part of his dominions, she prayed to the Lord. So strongly was she urged by the necessity of the case, that she even ventured into the royal presence without the king's command, and contrary to her own custom. Now observe what the Scripture says: \"He looked at her like a bull in the vehemence of his indignation; and the queen was afraid, and her colour changed as she fainted; and she bowed herself upon the head of her delicate maiden which went before her. But God turned the king, and transformed his indignation into gentleness.\"[fn-62-P6264_2412613:256-nf] The Scripture says in the Proverbs of Solomon, \"Even as the rush of water, so is the heart of a king in God's hand; He will turn it in whatever way He shall choose.\"[fn-62-P6265_2412822:257-nf] Again, in the 104th Psalm, in reference to the Egyptians, one reads what God did to them: \"And He turned their heart to hate His people, to deal subtilly with His servants.\"[fn-62-P6266_2413017:258-nf] Observe, likewise, what is written in the letters of the apostles. In the Epistle of Paul, the Apostle, to the Romans occur these words: \"Wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts;\"[fn-62-P6267_2413257:259-nf] and a little afterwards: \"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections;\"[fn-62-P6268_2413357:260-nf] again, in the next passage: \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient.\"[fn-62-P6269_2413554:261-nf] So also in his second Epistle to the Thessalonians, the apostle says of sundry persons, \"Inasmuch as they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved; therefore also God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\"[fn-62-P6270_2413920:262-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":135,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_41_treatise_on_rebuke_and_grace","source_chapter":47,"source_paragraph":"146","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"It is not, then, to be doubted that men's wills cannot, so as to prevent His doing what he wills, withstand the will of God, \"who hath done all things whatsoever He pleased in heaven and in earth,\"[fn-66-P6613_2522412:158-nf] and who also \"has done those things that are to come;\"[fn-66-P6614_2522488:159-nf] since He does even concerning the wills themselves of men what He will, when He will. Unless, perchance (to mention some things among many), when God willed to give the kingdom to Saul, it was so in the power of the Israelites, as it certainly was placed in their will, either to subject themselves or not to the man in question, that they could even prevail to withstand God. God, however, did not do this, save by the will of the men themselves, because he beyond doubt had the most omnipotent power of inclining men's hearts whither it pleased Him. For thus it is written: \"And Samuel sent the people away, and every one went away unto his own place. And Saul went away to his house in Gibeah: and there went away with Saul mighty men, whose hearts the Lord touched. And pestilent children said, Who shall save us? This man? And they despised him, and brought him no presents.\"[fn-66-P6615_2523391:160-nf] Will any one say that any of those whose hearts the Lord touched to go with Saul would not have gone with him, or that any of those pestilent fellows, whose hearts He did not touch to do this, would have gone? Of David also, whom the Lord ordained to the kingdom in a more prosperous succession, we read thus: \"And David continued to increase, and was magnified, and the Lord was with him.\"[fn-66-P6616_2523806:161-nf] This having been premised, it is said a little afterwards, \"And the Spirit clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, and he said, We are thine, 0 David, and we will be with thee, 0 son of Jesse: Peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy helpers; because the Lord has helped thee.\"[fn-66-P6617_2524110:162-nf] Could he withstand the will of God, and not rather do the will of Him who wrought in his heart by His Spirit, with which he was clothed, to will, speak, and do thus? Moreover, a little afterwards the same Scripture says, \"All these warlike men, setting the battle in array, came with a peaceful heart to Hebron to establish David over all Israel.\"[fn-66-P6618_2524483:163-nf] By their own will, certainly, they appointed David king. Who cannot see this? Who can deny it? For they did not do it under constraint or without good-will, since they did it; with a peaceful heart. And yet He wrought this in them who worketh what He will in the hearts of men. For which reason the Scripture premised, \"And David continued to increase, and was magnified, and the Lord Omnipotent was with him.\" And thus the Lord Omnipotent, who was with him, induced these men to appoint him king. And how did He induce them? Did He constrain thereto by any bodily fetters? He wrought within; He held their hearts; He stirred their hearts, and drew them by their own wills, which He Himself wrought in them.

The (question of the)divine warrant goes first-whether God has willed and also commanded ought of the kind, so that they who assert that it is not good are not plied with arguments for thinking it profitable save when they have been subdued.[fn-109-P10979_3086835:14-nf] It is proper that heretics be driven[fn-109-P10980_3086934:15-nf] to duty, not enticed. Obstinacy must be conquered, not coaxed. And, certainly, that will be pronounced beforehand quite good enough, which will be shown to have been instituted and also enjoined by God. Let the Gospels wait a little, while I set forth their root the Law, while I ascertain the will of God from those writings from which I recall to mind Himself also: \"I am,\" says He, \"God, thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt. Thou shalt have no other gods besides me. Thou shalt not make unto thee a likeness of those things which are in heaven, and which are in the earth beneath, and which are in the sea under the earth. Thou shalt not worship them, nor serve them. For I am the Lord thy God.\"[fn-109-P10981_3087687:16-nf] Likewise in the same book of Exodus: \"Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. Ye shall not make unto you gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.\"[fn-109-P10982_3087895:17-nf] To the following effect also, in Deuteronomy: \"Hear, O Israel; The Lord thy God is one: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy might, and with all thy soul.\"[fn-109-P10983_3088116:18-nf] And again: \"Neither do thou forget the Lord thy God, who brought thee forth from the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve Him only, and cleave to Him, and swear by His name. Ye shall not go after strange gods, and the gods of the nations which are round about you, because the Lord thy God is also a jealous God among you, and lest His anger should be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.\"[fn-109-P10984_3088609:19-nf] But setting before them blessings and curses, He also says: \"Blessings shall be yours, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, whatsoever I command you this day, and do not wander from the way which I have commanded you, to go and serve other gods whom ye know not.\"[fn-109-P10985_3088905:20-nf] And as to rooting them out in every way: \"Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations, which ye shall possess by inheritance, served their gods, upon mountains and hills, and under shady trees. Ye shall overthrow all their altars, ye shall overturn and break in pieces their pillars, and cut down their groves, and burn with fire the graven images of the gods themselves, and destroy the names of them out of that place.\"[fn-109-P10986_3089362:21-nf] He further urges, when they (the Israelites) had entered the land of promise, and driven out its nations: \"Take heed to thy self, that thou do not follow them after they be driven out from before thee, that thou do not inquire after their gods, saying, As the nations serve their gods, so let me do likewise.\"[fn-109-P10987_3089694:22-nf] But also says He: \"If there arise among you a prophet himself, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and it come to pass, and he say, Let us go and serve other gods, whom ye know not, do not hearken to the words of that prophet or dreamer, for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye fear God with all your heart and with all your soul. After the Lord your God ye shall go, and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and obey His voice, and serve Him, and cleave unto Him. But that prophet or dreamer shall die; for he has spoken to turn thee away from the Lord thy God.\"[fn-109-P10988_3090316:23-nf] But also in another section.[fn-109-P10989_3090365:24-nf] \"If, however, thy brother, the son of thy father or of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend who is as thine own soul, solicit thee, saying secretly, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou knowest not, nor did thy fathers, of the gods of the nations which are round about thee, very nigh unto thee or far off from thee, do not consent to go with him, and do not hearken to him. Thine eye shall not spare him, neither shalt thou pity, neither shalt thou preserve him; thou shall certainly inform upon him. Thine hand shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hand of thy people; and ye shall stone him, and he shall die, seeing he has sought to turn thee away from the Lord thy God.\"[fn-109-P10990_3091220:25-nf] He adds likewise concerning cities, that if it appeared that one of these had, through the advice of unrighteous men, passed over to other gods, all its inhabitants should be slain, and everything belonging to it become accursed, and all the spoil of it be gathered together into all its places of egress, and be, even with all the people, burned with fire in all its streets in the sight of the Lord God; and, says He, \"it shall not be for dwelling in for ever: it shall not be built again any more, and there shall cleave to thy hands nought of its accursed plunder, that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger.\"[fn-109-P10991_3091867:26-nf] He has, from His abhorrence of idols, framed a series of curses too: \"Cursed be the man who maketh a graven or a molten image, an abomination, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place.\"[fn-109-P10992_3092106:27-nf] But in Leviticus He says: \"Go not ye after idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the Lord your God.\"[fn-109-P10993_3092239:28-nf] And in other passages: \"The children of Israel are my household servants; these are they whom I led forth from the land of Egypt:[fn-109-P10994_3092387:29-nf] I am the Lord your God. Ye shall not make you idols fashioned by the hand, neither rear you up a graven image. Nor shall ye set up a remarkable stone in your land (to worship it): I am the Lord your God.\"[fn-109-P10995_3092746:30-nf] These words indeed were first spoken by the Lord by the lips of Moses, being applicable certainly to whomsoever the Lord God of Israel may lead forth in like manner from the Egypt of a most superstitious world, and from the abode of human slavery. But from the mouth of every prophet in succession, sound forth also utterances of the same God, augmenting the same law of His by a renewal of the same commands, and in the first place announcing no other duty in so special a manner as the being on guard against all making and worshipping of idols; as when by the mouth of David He says: \"The gods of the nations are silver and gold: they have eyes, and see not; they have ears, and hear not; they have a nose, and smell not; a mouth, and they speak not; hands, and they handle not; feet and they walk not. Like to them shall be they who make them, and trust in them.\"[fn-109-P10996_3093643:31-nf] ","title":"Scorpiace.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":135,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"89","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"60.

The Son of God then, He is the `Word' and the `Wisdom;' He the `Understanding' and the Living `Counsel;' and in Him is the `Good Pleasure of the Father;' He is `Truth' and `Light' and `Power' of the Father. But if the Will of God is Wisdom and Understanding, and the Son is Wisdom, he who says that the Son is `by will,' says virtually that Wisdom has come into being in wisdom, and the Son is made in a son, and the Word created through the Word[fn-70-P7054_2804385:470-nf] ; which is incompatible with God and is opposed to His Scriptures. For the Apostle proclaims the Son to be the own Radiance and Expression, not of the Father's will[fn-70-P7055_2804590:471-nf] , but of His Essence[fn-70-P7056_2804636:472-nf] Itself, saying, `Who being the Radiance of His glory and the Expression of His Subsistence[fn-70-P7057_2805361:473-nf] .' But if, as we have said before, the Father's Essence and Subsistence be not from will, neither, as is very plain, is what is proper to the Father's Subsistence from will; for such as, and so as, that Blessed Subsistence, must also be the proper Offspring from It. And accordingly the Father Himself said not, `This is the Son originated at My will,' nor `the Son whom I have by My favour,' but simply `My Son,' and more than that, `in whom I am well pleased;' meaning by this, This is the Son by nature; and `in Him is lodged My will about what pleases Me.'","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":135,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_78_sermon_lxi_cxi_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1. \"The three measures of meal\"[fn-55-P5568_2357461:1-nf] of which the Lord spake, is the human race.
