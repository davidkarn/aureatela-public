Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of the majesty of God, did not come in the pomp of pride or arrogance, although He might have done so, but in a lowly condition, as the Holy Spirit had declared regarding Him. For He says, \"Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have declared [our message] in His presence: He is, as it were, a child, and like a root in thirsty ground; He has no form nor glory, yea, we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness; but His form was without eminence, yea, deficient in comparison with the [ordinary] form of men. He is a man exposed to stripes and suffering, anti acquainted with the endurance of grief: for His countenance was turned away; He was despised, and not esteemed. He bears our iniquities, and is in sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed that [on His own account] He was exposed to labour, and stripes, and affliction. But He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we were healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray; [every] man has wandered in his own way; and the Lord has delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst of His sufferings openeth not His mouth. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away; who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth. For the transgressions of my people was He brought down to death. And I will give the wicked for His sepulchre, and the rich for His death,[fn-2-P286_45008:65-nf] because He did no iniquity, neither was guile found in His mouth. And the Lord is pleased to purify Him by stripes.[fn-2-P287_45316:66-nf] If ye make[fn-2-P288_45449:67-nf] an offering for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived seed.

On this account He shall inherit many, and shall divide the spoil of the strong; because His soul was delivered to death, and He was reckoned among the transgressors, and He bare the sins of many, and for their sins was He delivered.\"[fn-2-P290_46100:69-nf] And again He saith, \"I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.

Give good heed to what follows, brethren, \"All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made,\" so as not to imagine that \"nothing\" is something. For many, wrongly understanding \"without Him was nothing made,\" are wont to fancy that \"nothing\" is something. Sin, indeed, was not made by Him; and it is plain that sin is nothing, and men become nothing when they sin. An idol also was not made by the Word ;-it has indeed a sort of human form, but man himself was made by the Word;-for the form of man in an idol was not made by the Word, and it is written, \"We know that an idol is nothing.\"[fn-2-P236_26139:16-nf] Therefore these things were not made by the Word; but whatever was made in the natural manner, whatever belongs to the creature, everything that is fixed in the sky, that shines from above, that flies under the heavens, and that moves in universal nature, every creature whatsoever: I will speak more plainly, brethren, that you may understand me; I will say, from an angel even to a worm. What more excellent than an angel among created things? what lower than a worm? He who made the angel made the worm also; but the angel is fit for heaven, the worm for earth. He who created also arranged. If He had placed the worm in heaven, thou mightest have found fault; if He had willed that angels should spring from decaying flesh, thou mightest have found fault: and yet God almost does this, and He is not to be found fault with. For all men born of flesh, what are they but worms? and of these worms God makes angels. For if the Lord Himself says, \"But I am a worm and no man,\"[fn-2-P237_27137:17-nf] who will hesitate to say what is written also in Job, \"How much more is man rottenness, and the son of man a worm?\"[fn-2-P238_27271:18-nf] First he said, \"Man is rottenness;\" and afterwards, \"The son of man a worm:\" because a worm springs from rottenness, therefore \"man is rottenness,\" and \"the son of man a worm.\" Behold what for thy sake He was willing to become, who \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God!\" Why did He for thy sake become this? That thou mightest suck, who wert not able to chew. Wholly in this sense, then, brethren, understand \"All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\" For every creature, great and small, was made by Him: by Him were made things above and things beneath; spiritual and corporeal, by Him were they made.

But these difficulties are easily solved, for the prophet predicted by means of imprecation what was about to happen, not as praying for what he wished, but in the spirit of one who saw it beforehand. So also the Lord, so also the apostle; although even in the words of these we do not find what they have wished, but what they have foretold. For when the Lord says, \"Woe unto thee, Capernaum,\" He does not utter anything else than that some evil will happen to her as a punishment of her unbelief; and that this would happen the Lord did not malevolently wish, but saw by means of His divinity. And the apostle does not say, May [the Lord] reward; but, \"The Lord will reward him according to his work;\" which is the word of one who foretells, not of one uttering an imprecation.

And in the same book we read that, after his return from Mesopotamia with his wives and his sons, Jacob pitched his tent before Salem, a city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan, and that he dwelt there and \"bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent at the band of Hamor, the father of Sychem, for an hundred lambs,\"[fn-23-P2395_611805:1713-nf] and that \"he erected there an altar and called there upon the God of Israel.\"[fn-23-P2396_611902:1714-nf] Abraham does not buy the cave from Hamor the father of Sychem, but from Ephron the son of Zohar, and he is not buried in Sychem but in Hebron which is corruptly called Arboch.

The same title of beatissimus is given to Daniel and to St. Paul when both are cited in Comm. in Matt. xxv. 3; indeed, he and others of his day seem to have felt that the Saints of the Old Covenant were as near to themselves as those of the New. Not many years bad passed since Christians were accustom d to encourage themselves to martyrdom, in default of well-known heroes of their own faith , by the example of Daniel and his companions, or of the Seven Maccabees and their Mother. But Scripture is not only harmonious throughout, as Origen had taught; it is also never otiose. It never repeats itself, and a significance must be sought not only in the smallest differences of language, but also in the order in which apparent synonyms occur[fn-3-P319_267593:151-nf] ; in fact, every detail, and every sense in which every detail may be interpreted, is a matter for profitable enquiry[fn-3-P320_267870:152-nf] . Hence, the text of Scripture not only bears, but demands, the most strict and literal interpretation. Hilary's explanation of the words, 'My soul is sorrowful even unto death,' in Tract. in Ps. cxli. efmqefmrefmsefmtefmuefmvefmwefmxefmy~ . His confidence in their work, which is not exceeded by that of St. Augustine, encourages him to draw lessons from the differences between the Hebrew and theSeptuagint titles of the Pslams. For instance, Psalm cxlii. has been furnished in the Septuagint with a title which attributes it to David when pursued by Absalom. The contents of the Psalm are appropriate neither to the circumstances nor to the date. But this does not justify us in ignoring the title. We must regard the fact that a wrong connection is given to the Pslam as a warning to ourselves not to attempt to discover its historical position, but confine ourselves to its spiritual sense. And this is not all. Another Psalm, the third, is assigned in the Hebrew to the same king in the same distress. But, though this attribution is certainly correct, here also we must follow the leading of the Septuagint, which was fell to give a wrong title to one Psalm lest we should attach importance to the correct title of another. In both cases we must fix our attention not On the afflictions of David, but on the sorrows of Christ. Thus, negatively if not positively , the Septuagint must it guide our judgement[fn-3-P321_269533:162-nf] . But Hilary often goes even further, and ventures upon a purely subjective interpretation, which sometimes gives useful insight into the modes of thought of Gaul h1 the fourth century. For instance, he is thoroughly classical in taking it for granted that the Psalmist's words, 'I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills,' cannot refer to the natural feature; that he can never mean the actual mountains bristling with woods, the naked rocks and pathless precipices and frozen snows[fn-3-P322_270081:163-nf] . And even Gregory the Great could not surpass the prosaic grotesqueness with which Hilary declares it impious to suppose that God would feed the young ravens' foul carrion birds[fn-3-P323_270285:164-nf] ; and that the lilies of the Sermon on the Mount must be explained away, because they wear no clothing, and because, as a matter of fact, it is quite possible for men to be more brightly attired than they[fn-3-P324_270512:165-nf] . Examples of such reasoning, more or less extravagant, might be multiplied from Hilary's exegetical writings; passages in which no allowance is made for Oriental imagery, for poetry or for rhetoric[fn-3-P325_270740:166-nf] .","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":22,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"6. Therefore on this double death of ours our Saviour bestowed His own single death; and to cause both our resurrections, He appointed beforehand and set forth in mystery and type His own one resurrection. For He was not a sinner or ungodly, that, as though dead in spirit, He should need to be renewed in the inner man, and to be recalled as it were to the life of righteousness by repentance; but being clothed in mortal flesh, and in that alone dying, in that alone rising again, in that alone did He answer to both for us; since in it was wrought a mystery as regards the inner man, and a type as regards the outer. For it was in a mystery as regards our inner man, so as to signify the death of our soul, that those words were uttered, not only in the Psalm, but also on the cross: \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"[fn-8-P841_325461:25-nf] To which words the apostle agrees, saying, \"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin;\" since by the crucifixion of the tuner man are understood the pains of repentance, and a certain wholesome agony of self-control, by which death the death of ungodliness is destroyed, and in which death God has left us. And so the body of sin is destroyed through such a cross, that now we should not yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin.[fn-8-P842_326043:26-nf] Because, if even the inner man certainly is renewed day by day,[fn-8-P843_326128:27-nf] yet undoubtedly it is old before it is renewed. For that is done inwardly of which the same apostle speaks: \"Put off the old man, and put on the new;\" which he goes on to explain by saying, \"Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth.\"[fn-8-P844_326394:28-nf] But where is lying put away, unless inwardly, that he who speaketh the truth from his heart may inhabit the holy hill of God?[fn-8-P845_326541:29-nf] But the resurrection of the body of the Lord is shown to belong to the mystery of our own inner resurrection, where, after He had risen, He says to the woman, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P846_326775:30-nf] with which mystery the apostle's words agree, where he says, \"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God; set your thoughts[fn-8-P847_326988:31-nf] on things above.\"[fn-8-P848_327019:32-nf] For not to touch Christ, unless when He had ascended to the Father, means not to have thoughts[fn-8-P849_327135:33-nf] of Christ after a fleshly manner. Again, the death of the flesh of our Lord contains a type of the death of our outer man, since it is by such suffering most of all that He exhorts His servants that they should not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.[fn-8-P850_327429:34-nf] Wherefore the apostle says, \"That I may fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-8-P851_327559:35-nf] And the resurrection of the body of the Lord is found to contain a type of the resurrection of our outward man, because He says to His disciples, \"Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\"[fn-8-P852_327802:36-nf] And one of the disciples also, handling His scars, exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God!\"[fn-8-P853_327907:37-nf] And whereas the entire integrity of that flesh was apparent, this was shown in that which He had said when exhorting His disciples: \"There shall not a hair of your head perish.\"[fn-8-P854_328104:38-nf] For how comes it that first is said, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P855_328216:39-nf] and how comes it that before He ascends to the Father, He actually is touched by the disciples: unless because in the former the mystery of the inner man was intimated, in the latter a type was given of the outer man? Or can any one possibly be so without understanding, and so turned away from the truth, as to dare to saythat He was touched by men before He ascended, but by women when He had ascended? It was on account of this type, which went before in the Lord, of our future resurrection in the body, that the apostle says, \"Christ the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's.\"[fn-8-P856_328826:40-nf] For it was the resurrection of the body to which this place refers, on account of which he also says, \"Who has changed our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.\"[fn-8-P857_329035:41-nf] The one death therefore of our Saviour brought salvation to our double death, and His one resurrection wrought for us two resurrections; since His body in both cases, that is, both in His death and in His resurrection, wasministered to us by a kind of healing suitableness, both as a mystery of the inner man, and as a type of the outer.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_06_prolegomena","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"As a specimen of the mode of treatment of a crucial passage, of interest in view of the writer's relations to the Nestorian and Eutychian controversies, the notes on I. Cor. xv. 27, I. Cor. xv. 28 may be quoted. \"This is a passage which Arians and Eunomians have been wont to be constantly adducing with the notion that they are thereby belittling the dignity of the only-begotten. They ought to have perceived that the divine apostle has written nothing in this passage about the Godhead of the only-begotten. He is exhorting us to believe in the resurrection of the flesh, and endeavours to prove the resurrection of the flesh by the resurrection of the Lord. It is obvious that like is conformed to like. On this account he calls Him `the first fruits of them that have fallen asleep,' and styles Him `Man,' and by comparison with Adam proves that by Him the general resurrection will come to pass, with the object of persuading objectors, by shewing the resurrection of one of like nature, to believe that all mankind will share His resurrection. It must therefore be recognised that the natures of the Lord are two: and that divine Scripture names Him sometimes from the human, and sometimes from the divine. If it speaks of God, it does not deny the manhood:if it mentions man it at the same time confesses the Godhead. It is impossible always to speak of Him in terms of sublimity, on account of the nature which He received from us, for if even when lowly terms are employed some men deny the assumption of the flesh, clearly still more would have been found infected with this unsoundness, had no lowly terms been used. What then is the meaning of `then is subjected'? This expression is applicable to sovereigns exercising sovereignty now, for if He then is subjected He is not yet subjected. So they are all in error who blaspheme and try to make subject Him who has not yet submitted to the limits of subjection. We must wait, and learn the mode of the subjection. But we have gone through long discussions on these points in our contests with them. It is enough now to indicate briefly the Apostle's aim. He is writing to the Corinthians who have only just been set free from the fables of heathendom. Their fables are full of violence and iniquity. Not to name others, and pollute my lips, they worship parricide gods, and say that sons revolted against their fathers, drove them from their realm, and seized their sovereignty. So after saying great things of Christ, in that He shall destroy all rule and authority and power, and shall put an end to death, and hath subdued all things under his feet; lest starting from those fables of theirs they should expect Him to treat His father like the Daemons whom they adore; after mentioning, as was necessary, the subjugation of all things the apostle adds `The Son Himself shall be subject to Him that did put all things under Him.' For not only shall He not subject the Father to Himself, but shall Himself accept the subjection becoming to a son. So the divine apostle, suspecting the mischief arising from the pagan mythology, uses expressions of lowliness because such terms are helpful. But let objectors tell us the form of that subjection. If they are willing to consider the truth, He shewed obedience when He was made man, and wrought out our salvation. How then shall He then be subjected, and how shall He then deliver the kingdom to God the Father? If the case be viewed in this way, it will appear that God the Father does not hold the kingdom now. So full of absurdity are their arguments. But He makes what is ours His own, since we are called His body, and He is called our Head. `He took our iniquities and bore our diseases.`[fn-7-P741_100065:117-nf] So He says in the Psalm `my God, my God, look upon me, why hast Thou forsaken me. The words of my transgressions are far from my health.'[fn-7-P742_100223:118-nf] And yet He did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth. But a mouth is made of our nature, in that He was made the first fruits of the nature. So He appropriates our frequent disobedience and the then subjection, and, when we are subjected after our delivery from corruption He is said to be subjected. What follows leads us on to this sense. For after the words `then shall the son be subject to Him that did put all things under Him,' the Apostle adds `that God may be all in all.' He is everywhere now in accordance with His essence, for His nature is uncircumscribed, as says the divine apostle, `in Him we live and move and have our being.'[fn-7-P743_100894:119-nf] But, as regards His good pleasure, He is not in all, for `the Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that hope in his mercy.'[fn-7-P744_101056:120-nf] But in these He is not wholly. For no one is pure of uncleanness,[fn-7-P745_101145:121-nf] and In thy sight shall no man living be justified[fn-7-P746_101203:122-nf] and `If thou Lord shouldst mark iniquities O Lord who shall stand?' Therefore the Lord taketh pleasure wherein they do right and taketh not pleasure wherein they err. But in the life to come where corruption ceases and immortality is given passions have no place; and after these have been quite driven out no kind of sin is committed for the future. Thus hereafter God shall be all in all, when all have been released from sin and turned to Him and are incapable of any inclination to the worse. And what in this place the divine Apostle has said of God in another passage he has laid down of Christ. His words are these. `Where there is neither Jew nor Greek, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian ... but Christ is all and in all.'[fn-7-P747_101975:123-nf] He would not have applied to the Son what is attributable to the Father had he not of divine grace learnt that He is of equal honour with Him.'[fn-7-P748_102143:124-nf] ","title":"Prolegomena","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":22,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_08_the_perpetual_virginity_of_blessed_mary","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"17. Innumerable instances of the same kind are to be found in the sacred books. But, to be brief, I will return to the last of the four classes of brethren, those, namely, who are brethren by affection, and these again fall into two divisions, those of the spiritual and those of the general relationship. I say spiritual because all of us Christians are called brethren, as in the verse,[fn-60-P6082_1813752:65-nf] \"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.\" And in another psalm the Saviour says,[fn-60-P6083_1813895:66-nf] \"I will declare thy name unto my brethren.\" And elsewhere,[fn-60-P6084_1813973:67-nf] \"Go unto my brethren and say to them.\" I say also general, because we are all children of one Father, there is a like bond of brotherhood between us all.[fn-60-P6085_1814148:68-nf] \"Tell these who hate you,\" says the prophet, \"ye are our brethren.\" And the Apostle writing to the Corinthians:[fn-60-P6086_1814278:69-nf] \"If any man that is named brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one no, not to eat.\" I now ask to which class you consider the Lord's brethren in the Gospel must be assigned. They are brethren by nature, you say. But Scripture does not say so; it calls them neither sons of Mary, nor of Joseph. Shall we say they are brethren by race? But it is absurd to suppose that a few Jews were called His brethren when all Jews of the time might upon this principle have borne the title. Were they brethren by virtue of close intimacy and the union of heart and mind? If that were so, who were more truly His brethren than the apostles who received His private instruction and were called by Him His mother and His brethren? Again, if all men, as such, were His brethren, it would have been foolish to deliver a special message, \"Behold, thy brethren seek thee,\" for all men alike were entitled to the name. The only alternative is to adopt the previous explanation and understand them to be called brethren in virtue of the bond of kindred, not of love and sympathy, nor by prerogative of race, nor yet by nature. Just as Lot was called Abraham's brother, and Jacob Laban's, just as the daughters of Zelophehad received a lot among their brethren, just as Abraham himself had to wife Sarah his sister, for he says,[fn-60-P6087_1815679:70-nf] \"She is indeed my sister, on the father's side, not on the mother's,\" that is to say, she was the daughter of his brother, not of his sister. Otherwise, what are we to say of Abraham, a just man, taking to wife the daughter of his own father? Scripture, in relating the history of the men of early times, does not outrage our ears by speaking of the enormity in express terms, but prefers to leave it to be inferred by the reader: and God afterwards gives to the prohibition the sanction of the law, and threatens,[fn-60-P6088_1816213:71-nf] \"He who takes his sister, born of his father, or of his mother, and beholds her nakedness, hath commited abomination, he shall be utterly destroyed.

Thou therefore who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonorest thou God? For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. Circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. Therefore, if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?

But they, in fact, were making their boast of God, as if they alone had deserved to receive His law, as the Psalmist said: \"He did not the like to any nation, nor His judgments has He displayed to them.\"[fn-13-P1337_668633:39-nf] And yet, they thought they were fulfilling the law of God by their righteousness, when they were rather breakers of it all the while! Accordingly, it \"wrought wrath\"[fn-13-P1338_668820:40-nf] upon them, and sin abounded, committed as it was by them who knew the law. For whoever did even what the law commanded, without the assistance of the Spirit of grace, acted through fear of punishment, not from love of righteousness, and hence in the sight of God that was not in the will, which in the sight of men appeared in the work; and such doers of the law were held rather guilty of that which God knew they would have preferred to commit, if only it had been possible with impunity. He calls, however, \"the circumcision of the heart\" the will that is pure from all unlawful desire; which comes not from the letter, inculcating and threatening, but from the Spirit, assisting and healing. Such doers of the law have their praise therefore, not of men but of God, who by His grace provides the grounds on which they receive praise, of whom it is said, \"My soul shall make her boast of the Lord;\"[fn-13-P1339_669740:41-nf] and to whom it is said, \"My praise shall be of Thee:\"[fn-13-P1340_669813:42-nf] but those are not such who would have God praised because they are men; but themselves, because they are righteous.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"151","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"What then is the import of the \"All, from the least unto the greatest of them,\" but all that belong spiritually to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah,-that is, to the children of Isaac, to the seed of Abraham?

From this swelling pride springs the audacity in prayer which marks the directions in your letter to a[fn-78-P7864_2546537:58-nf] certain widow as to how the saints ought to pray. \"He,\" you say,[fn-78-P7865_2546846:59-nf] \"rightly lifts up his hands to God; he pours out supplications with a good conscience who can say, `Thou knowest, Lord, how holy, how innocent, how pure from all deceit, wrong, and robbery are the hands which I spread out unto Thee; how righteous, how spotless, and free from all falsehood are the lips with which I pour forth my prayers unto Thee, that Thou mayest pity me.'\" Is this the prayer of a Christian, or of a proud Pharisee like him who[fn-78-P7866_2547743:60-nf] says in the Gospel, \"God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are, robbers, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican: I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.\" Yet he merely thanks God because, by His mercy, he is not as other men: he execrates sin, and does not claim his righteousness as his own. But you say, \"Now Thou knowest how holy, how innocent, how pure from all deceit, wrong, and robbery are the hands which I spread out before Thee.\" He says that he fasts twice in the week, that he may afflict his vicious and wanton flesh, and he gives tithes of all his substance. For[fn-78-P7867_2548381:61-nf] \"the ransom of a man's life is his riches.\" You join the devil in boasting,[fn-78-P7868_2548477:62-nf] \"I will ascend above the stars, I will place my throne in heaven, and I will be like the Most High.\" David says,[fn-78-P7869_2548652:63-nf] \"My loins are filled with illusions\"; and[fn-78-P7870_2548721:64-nf] \"My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness\"; and[fn-78-P7871_2548800:65-nf] \"Enter not into judgment with Thy servant\"; and[fn-78-P7872_2548868:66-nf] \"In Thy sight no man living shall be justified.\" You boast that you are holy, innocent, and pure, and spread out clean hands unto God. And you are not satisfied with glorying in all your works, unless you say that you are pure from all sins of speech; and you tell us how righteous, how spotless, how free from all falsehood your lips are. The Psalmist sings,[fn-78-P7873_2549242:67-nf] \"Every man is a liar\"; and this is supported by apostolical authority: \"That God may be true,\" says St. Paul,[fn-78-P7874_2549371:68-nf] \"and every man a liar\"; and yet you have lips righteous, spotless, and free from all falsehood. Isaiah laments, saying,[fn-78-P7875_2549509:69-nf] \"Woe is me! for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips\"; and afterwards one of the seraphim brings a hot coal, taken with the tongs, to purify the prophet's lips, for he was not, according to the tenor of your words, arrogant, but he confessed his own faults. Just as we read in the Psalms,[fn-78-P7876_2549879:70-nf] \"What shall be due unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee in respect of a deceitful tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals that make desolate.\" And after all this swelling with pride, and boastfulness in prayer, and confidence in your holiness, like one fool trying to persuade another, you finish with the words \"These lips with which I pour out my supplication that Thou mayest have pity on me.\" If you are holy, if you are innocent, if you are cleansed from all defilement, if you have sinned neither in word nor deed-although James says,[fn-78-P7877_2550462:71-nf] \"He who offends not in word is a perfect man,\" and \"No one can curb his tongue\"-how is it that you sue for mercy? so that, forsooth, you bewail yourself, and pour out prayers because you are holy, pure, and innocent, a man of stainless lips, free from all falsehood, and endowed with a power like that of God.

For He says, \"Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away; who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth. For the transgressions of my people was He brought down to death. And I will give the wicked for His sepulchre, and the rich for His death,[fn-54-P5407_779504:76-nf] because He did no iniquity, neither was guile found in His mouth.

His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away; and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.\"[fn-48-P4886_1545363:100-nf] Then indeed He shall have both a glorious form, and an unsullied beauty above the sons of men. \"Thou art fairer,\" says (the Psalmist), \"than the children of men; grace is poured into Thy lips; therefore God hath blessed Thee for ever. Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O most mighty, with Thy glory and Thy majesty.\"[fn-48-P4887_1545702:101-nf] For the Father, after making Him a little lower than the angels, \"will crown Him with glory and honour, and put all things under His feet.\"[fn-48-P4888_1545864:102-nf] \"Then shall they look on Him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him, tribe after tribe; \"[fn-48-P4889_1545992:103-nf] because, no doubt, they once refused to acknowledge Him in the lowliness of His human condition. He is even a man says Jeremiah, and who shall recognise Him Therefore, asks Isaiah, \"who shall declare His generation? \"[fn-48-P4890_1546236:104-nf] So also in Zechariah, Christ Jesus, the true High Priest of the Father, in the person of Joshua, nay, in the very mystery of His name,[fn-48-P4891_1546392:105-nf] is portrayed in a twofold dress with reference to both His advents. At first He is clad in sordid garments, that is to say, in the lowliness of suffering and mortal flesh: then the devil resisted Him, as the instigator of the traitor Judas, not to mention his tempting Him after His baptism: afterwards He was stripped of His first filthy raiment, and adorned with the priestly robe[fn-48-P4892_1546803:106-nf] and mitre, and a pure diadem;[fn-48-P4893_1546848:107-nf] in other words, with the glory and honour of His second advent.[fn-48-P4894_1546933:108-nf] If I may offer, moreover, an interpretation of the two goats which were presented on \"the great day of atonement,\"[fn-48-P4895_1547070:109-nf] do they not also figure the two natures of Christ? They were of like size, and very similar in appearance, owing to the Lord's identity of aspect; because He is not to come in any other form, having to be recognised by those by whom He was also wounded and pierced. One of these goats was bound[fn-48-P4896_1547406:110-nf] with scarlet,[fn-48-P4897_1547440:111-nf] and driven by the people out of the camp[fn-48-P4898_1547525:112-nf] into the wilderness,[fn-48-P4899_1547572:113-nf] amid cursing, and spitting, and pulling, and piercing,[fn-49-P4900_1547650:114-nf] being thus marked with all the signs of the Lord's own passion; while the other, by being offered up for sins, and given to the priests of the temple for meat, afforded proofs of His second appearance, when (after all sins have been expiated) the priests of the spiritual temple, that is, the church, are to enjoy the flesh, as it were,[fn-49-P4901_1548842:115-nf] of the Lord's own grace, whilst the residue go away from salvation without tasting it.[fn-49-P4902_1548996:116-nf] Since, therefore, the first advent was prophetically declared both as most obscure in its types, and as deformed with every kind of indignity, but the second as glorious and altogether worthy of God, they would on this very account, while confining their regards to that which they were easily able both to understand and to believe, even the second advent, be not undeservedly deceived respecting the more obscure, and, at any rate, the more lowly first coming. Accordingly, to this day they deny that their Christ has come, because He has not appeared in majesty, while they ignore the fact that He was to come also in lowliness.","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us compare with Scripture the rest of His dispensation. Whatever that poor despised body[fn-50-P5052_1590728:235-nf] may be, because it was an object of touch[fn-50-P5053_1590794:236-nf] and sight,[fn-50-P5054_1590821:237-nf] it shall be my Christ, be He inglorious, be He ignoble, be He dishonoured; for such was it announced that He should be, both in bodily condition and aspect. Isaiah comes to our help again: \"We have announced (His way) before Him,\" says he; \"He is like a servant,[fn-50-P5055_1591103:238-nf] like a root in a dry ground; He hath no form nor comeliness; we saw Him, and He had neither form nor beauty; but His form was despised, marred above all men.\"[fn-50-P5056_1591304:239-nf] Similarly the Father addressed the Son just before: \"Inasmuch as many will be astonished at Thee, so also will Thy beauty be without glory from men,\"[fn-50-P5057_1591509:240-nf] For although, in David's words, He is fairer than the children of men,\"[fn-50-P5058_1591602:241-nf] yet it is in that figurative state of spiritual grace, when He is girded with the sword of the Spirit, which is verily His form, and beauty, and glory. According to the same prophet, however, He is in bodily condition \"a very worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and an outcast of the people.\"[fn-50-P5059_1591915:242-nf] But no internal quality of such a kind does He announce as belonging to Him. In Him dwelt the fulness of the Spirit; therefore I acknowledge Him to be \"the rod of the stem of Jesse.\" His blooming flower shall be my Christ, upon whom hath rested, according to Isaiah, \"the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of piety, and of the fear of the Lord.\"[fn-50-P5060_1592344:243-nf] Now to no man, except Christ, would the diversity of spiritual proofs suitably apply. He is indeed like a flower for the Spirit's grace, reckoned indeed of the stem of Jesse, but thence to derive His descent through Mary. Now I purposely demand of you, whether you grant to Him the destination[fn-50-P5061_1592660:244-nf] of all this humiliation, and suffering, and tranquillity, from which He will be the Christ of Isaiah,-a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, who was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and who, like a lamb before the shearer, opened not His mouth;[fn-50-P5062_1592932:245-nf] who did not struggle nor cry, nor was His voice heard in the street who broke not the bruised reed-that is, the shattered faith of the Jews-nor quenched the smoking flax-that is, the freshly-kindled[fn-50-P5063_1593155:246-nf] ardour of the Gentiles. He can be none other than the Man who was foretold. It is right that His conduct[fn-50-P5064_1593280:247-nf] be investigated according to the rule of Scripture, distinguishable as it is unless I am mistaken, by the twofold operation of preaching[fn-50-P5065_1593431:248-nf] and of miracle. But the treatment of both these topics I shall so arrange as to postpone, to the chapter wherein I have determined to discuss the actual gospel of Marcion, the consideration of His wonderful doctrines and miracles-with a view, however, to our present purpose. Let us here, then, in general terms complete the subject which we had entered upon, by indicating, as we pass on,[fn-50-P5066_1593844:249-nf] how Christ was fore-announced by Isaiah as a preacher: \"For who is there among you,\" says he, \"that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of His Son? \"[fn-50-P5067_1594015:250-nf] And likewise as a healer: \"For,\" says he, \"He hath taken away our infirmities, and carried our sorrows.\"[fn-50-P5068_1594139:251-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Come now, when you read in the words of David, how that \"the Lord reigneth from the tree,\"[fn-50-P5088_1599797:265-nf] I want to know what you understand by it. Perhaps you think some wooden[fn-50-P5089_1599910:266-nf] king of the Jews is meant!-and not Christ, who overcame death by His suffering on the cross, and thence reigned! Now, although death reigned from Adam even to Christ, why may not Christ be said to have reigned from the tree, from His having shut up the kingdom of death by dying upon the tree of His cross? Likewise Isaiah also says: \"For unto us a child is born.\"[fn-50-P5090_1600307:267-nf] But what is there unusual in this, unless he speaks of the Son of God? \"To us is given He whose government is upon His shoulder.\"[fn-50-P5091_1600456:268-nf] Now, what king is there who bears the ensign of his dominion upon his shoulder, and not rather upon his head as a diadem, or in his hand as a sceptre, or else as a mark in some royal apparel? But the one new King of the new ages, Jesus Christ, carried on His shoulder both the power and the excellence of His new glory, even His cross; so that, according to our former prophecy, He might thenceforth reign from the tree as Lord. This tree it is which Jeremiah likewise gives you intimation of, when he prophesies to the Jews, who should say, \"Come, let us destroy the tree with the fruit, (the bread) thereof,\"[fn-50-P5092_1601086:269-nf] that is, His body. For so did God in your own gospel even reveal the sense, when He called His body bread; so that, for the time to come, you may understand that He has given to His body the figure of bread, whose body the prophet of old figuratively turned into bread, the Lord Himself designing to give by and by an interpretation of the mystery. If you require still further prediction of the Lord's cross, the twenty-first Psalm[fn-50-P5093_1601539:270-nf] is sufficiently able to afford it to you, containing as it does the entire passion of Christ, who was even then prophetically declaring[fn-50-P5094_1601712:271-nf] His glory. \"They pierced,\" says He, \"my hands and my feet,\"[fn-50-P5095_1601789:272-nf] which is the special cruelty of the cross. And again, when He implores His Father's help, He says, \"Save me from the lion's mouth,\" that is, the jaws of death, \"and my humiliation from the horns of the unicorns; \"in other words, from the extremities of the cross, as we have shown above. Now, David himself did not suffer this cross, nor did any other king of the Jews; so that you cannot suppose that this is the prophecy of any other's passion than His who alone was so notably crucified by the nation. Now should the heretics, in their obstinacy,[fn-50-P5096_1602360:273-nf] reject and despise all these interpretations, I will grant to them that the Creator has given us no signs of the cross of His Christ; but they will not prove from this concession that He who was crucified was another (Christ), unless they could somehow show that this death was predicted as His by their own god, so that from the diversity of predictions there might be maintained to be a diversity of sufferers,[fn-50-P5097_1602799:274-nf] and thereby also a diversity of persons. But since there is no prophecy of even Marcion's Christ, much less of his cross, it is enough for my Christ that there is a prophecy merely of death. For, from the fact that the kind of death is not declared, it was possible for the death of the cross to have been still intended, which would then have to be assigned to another (Christ), if the prophecy had had reference to another. Besides,[fn-50-P5098_1603309:275-nf] if he should be unwilling to allow that the death of my Christ was predicted, his confusion must be the greater[fn-50-P5099_1603435:276-nf] if he announces that his own Christ indeed died, whom he denies to have had a nativity, whilst denying that my Christ is mortal, though he allows Him to be capable of birth. However, I will show him the death, and burial, and resurrection of my Christ all[fn-51-P5100_1603719:277-nf] indicated in a single sentence of Isaiah, who says, \"His sepulture was removed from the midst of them.\" Now there could have been no sepulture without death, and no removal of sepulture except by resurrection. Then, finally, he added: \"Therefore He shall have many for his inheritance, and He shall divide the spoil of the many, because He poured out His soul unto death.\"[fn-51-P5101_1604109:278-nf] For there is here set forth the cause of this favour to Him, even that it was to recompense Him for His suffering of death. It was equally shown that He was to obtain this recompense for His death, was certainly to obtain it after His death by means of the resurrection.[fn-51-P5102_1604402:279-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"ANF-03","text":"You have the work of the apostles also predicted: \"How beautiful are the feet of them which preach the gospel of peace, which bring good tidings of good,\"[fn-51-P5141_1615228:309-nf] not of war nor evil tidings. In response to which is the psalm, \"Their sound is gone through all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world; \"[fn-51-P5142_1615415:310-nf] that is, the words of them who carry round about the law that proceeded from Sion and the Lord's word from Jerusalem, in order that that might come to pass which was written: \"They who were far from my righteousness, have come near to my righteousness and truth.\"[fn-51-P5143_1615698:311-nf] When the apostles girded their loins for this business, they renounced the elders and rulers and priests of the Jews. Well, says he, but was it not above all things that they might preach the other god? Rather[fn-51-P5144_1616043:312-nf] (that they might preach) that very self-same God, whose scripture they were with all their might fulfilling! \"Depart ye, depart ye,\" exclaims Isaiah; \"go ye out from thence, and touch not the unclean thing,\" that is blasphemy against Christ; \"Go ye out of the midst of her,\" even of the synagogue\" Be ye separate who bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-51-P5145_1616406:313-nf] For already had the Lord, according to the preceding words (of the prophet), revealed His Holy One with His arm, that is to say, Christ by His mighty power, in the eyes of the nations, so that all the[fn-51-P5146_1616628:314-nf] nations and the utmost parts of the earth have seen the salvation, which was from God. By thus departing from Judaism itself, when they exchanged the obligations and burdens of the law for the liberty of the gospel, they were fulfilling the psalm, \"Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast away their yoke from us; \"and this indeed (they did) after that \"the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain devices; \"after that \"the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers took their counsel together against the Lord, and against His Christ.\"[fn-51-P5147_1617197:315-nf] What did the apostles thereupon suffer? You answer: Every sort of iniquitous persecutions, from men that belonged indeed to that Creator who was the adversary of Him whom they were preaching. Then why does the Creator, if an adversary of Christ, not only predict that the apostles should incur this suffering, but even express His displeasure[fn-51-P5148_1617587:316-nf] thereat? For He ought neither to predict the course of the other god, whom, as you contend, He knew not, nor to have expressed displeasure at that which He had taken care to bring about. \"See how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and how merciful men are taken away, and no man considereth. For the righteous man has been removed from the evil person.\"[fn-51-P5149_1617980:317-nf] Who is this but Christ? \"Come, say they, let us take away the righteous, because He is not for our turn, (and He is clean contrary to our doings).\"[fn-51-P5150_1618149:318-nf] Premising, therefore, and likewise subjoining the fact that Christ suffered, He foretold that His just ones should suffer equally with Him-both the apostles and all the faithful in succession; and He signed them with that very seal of which Ezekiel spake: \"The Lord said unto me, Go through the gate, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set the mark <i>tau upon the foreheads of the men.\"[fn-51-P5151_1618567:319-nf] Now the Greek letter <i>tau and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which He predicted would be the sign on our foreheads in the true Catholic Jerusalem,[fn-51-P5152_1619095:320-nf] in which, according to the twenty-first Psalm, the brethren of Christ or children of God would ascribe glory to God the Father, in the person of Christ Himself addressing His Father; \"I will declare Thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I sing praise unto Thee.\" For that which had to come to pass in our day in His name, and by His Spirit, He rightly foretold would be of Him. And a little afterwards He says: \"My praise shall be of Thee in the great congregation.\"[fn-51-P5153_1619694:321-nf] In the sixty-seventh Psalm He says again: \"In the congregations bless ye the Lord God.\"[fn-51-P5154_1619807:322-nf] So that with this agrees also the prophecy of Malachi: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord; neither will I accept your offerings: for from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place sacrifice shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering\"[fn-51-P5155_1620161:323-nf] -such as the ascription of glory, and blessing, and praise, and hymns.

Ye saw not what was foretold and fulfilled concerning the ascension of Christ; \"Be Thou exalted above the Heavens, O God;\"[fn-33-P3367_1547489:28-nf] but ye see what follows immediately after, \"And above all the earth Thy Glory.\" Those things concerning Christ already done and past, all of them ye have not seen; but these things present in His Church ye deny not that ye see.

Accordingly turn over the prophets, and learn therefrom His entire course.[fn-56-P5697_1737750:424-nf] \"Into the high mountain,\" says Isaiah, \"get Thee up, who bringest good tidings to Sion; lift up Thy voice with strength, who bringest good tidings to Jerusalem.\"[fn-56-P5698_1737928:425-nf] \"They were mightily[fn-56-P5699_1737967:426-nf] astonished at His doctrine; for He was teaching as one who had power.\"[fn-57-P5700_1738152:427-nf] And again: \"Therefore, my people shall know my name in that day.\" What name does the prophet mean, but Christ's? \"That I am He that doth speak-even I.\"[fn-57-P5701_1738324:428-nf] For it was He who used to speak in the prophets-the Word, the Creator's Son. \"I am present, while it is the hour, upon the mountains, as one that bringeth glad tidings of peace, as one that publisheth good tidings of good.\"[fn-57-P5702_1738568:429-nf] So one of the twelve (minor prophets), Nahum: \"For behold upon the mountain the swift feet of Him that bringeth glad tidings of peace.\"[fn-57-P5703_1738748:430-nf] Moreover, concerning the voice of His prayer to the Father by night, the psalm manifestly says: \"O my God, I will cry in the day-time, and Thou shalt hear; and in the night season, and it shall not be in vain to me.\"[fn-57-P5704_1738985:431-nf] in another passage touching the same voice and place, the psalm says: \"I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy mountain.\"[fn-57-P5705_1739156:432-nf] You have a representation of the name; you have the action of the Evangelizer; you have a mountain for the site; and the night as the time; and the sound of a voice; and the audience of the Father: you have, (in short, ) the Christ of the prophets. But why was it that He chose twelve apostles,[fn-57-P5706_1739470:433-nf] and not some other number? In truth,[fn-57-P5707_1739530:434-nf] I might from this very point conclude[fn-57-P5708_1739580:435-nf] of my Christ, that He was foretold not only by the words of prophets, but by the indications of facts. For of this number I find figurative hints up and down the Creator's dispensation[fn-57-P5709_1739786:436-nf] in the twelve springs of Elfin;[fn-57-P5710_1739841:437-nf] in the twelve gems of Aaron's priestly vestment;[fn-57-P5711_1739913:438-nf] and in the twelve stones appointed by Joshua to be taken out of the Jordan, and set up for the ark of the covenant. Now, the same number of apostles was thus portended, as if they were to be fountains and rivers which should water the Gentile world, which was formerly dry and destitute of knowledge (as He says by Isaiah: \"I will put streams in the unwatered ground\"[fn-57-P5712_1740307:439-nf] ); as if they were to be gems to shed lustre upon the church's sacred robe, which Christ, the High Priest of the Father, puts on; as if, also, they were to be stones massive in their faith, which the true Joshua took out of the layer of the Jordan, and placed in the sanctuary of His covenant. What equally good defence of such a number has Marcion's Christ to show? It is impossible that anything can be shown to have been done by him unconnectedly,[fn-57-P5713_1740782:440-nf] which cannot be shown to have been done by my Christ in connection (with preceding types).[fn-57-P5714_1740954:441-nf] To him will appertain the event[fn-57-P5715_1741010:442-nf] in whom is discovered the preparation for the same.[fn-57-P5716_1741074:443-nf] Again, He changes the name of Simon to peter,[fn-57-P5717_1741145:444-nf] inasmuch as the Creator also altered the names of Abram, and Sarai, and Oshea, by calling the latter Joshua, and adding a syllable to each of the former. But why Peter? If it was because of the vigour of his faith, there were many solid materials which might lend a name from their strength. Was it because Christ was both a rock and a stone? For we read of His being placed \"for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence.\"[fn-57-P5718_1741613:445-nf] I omit the rest of the passage.[fn-57-P5719_1741694:446-nf] Therefore He would fain[fn-57-P5720_1741734:447-nf] impart to the dearest of His disciples a name which was suggested by one of His own especial designations in figure; because it was, I suppose, more peculiarly fit than a name which might have been derived from no figurative description of Himself.[fn-57-P5721_1742002:448-nf] There come to Him from Tyre, and from other districts even, a transmarine multitude. This fact the psalm had in view: \"And behold tribes of foreign people, and Tyre, and the people of the Ethiopians; they were there. Sion is my mother, shall a man say; and in her was born a man\" (forasmuch as the God-man was born), and He built her by the Father's will; that you may know how Gentiles then flocked to Him, because He was born the God-man who was to build the church according to the Father's will-even of other races also.[fn-57-P5722_1742668:449-nf] So says Isaiah too: \"Behold, these come from far; and these from the north and from the west;[fn-57-P5723_1742817:450-nf] and these from the land of the Persians.\"[fn-57-P5724_1742872:451-nf] Concerning whom He says again: \"Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold, all these have gathered themselves together.\"[fn-57-P5725_1743016:452-nf] And yet again: \"Thou seest these unknown and strange ones; and thou wilt say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these? But who hath brought me up these? And these, where have they been? \"[fn-57-P5726_1743228:453-nf] Will such a Christ not be (the Christ) of the prophets?

Who would have given such a commandment as this, but He who feeds the ravens and clothes[fn-60-P6074_1825696:776-nf] the flowers of the field? Who anciently enjoined for the treading ox an unmuzzled mouth,[fn-60-P6075_1825800:777-nf] that he might be at liberty to gather his fodder from his labour, on the principle that the worker is worthy of his hire?[fn-60-P6076_1825946:778-nf] Marcion may expunge such precepts, but no matter, provided the sense of them survives. But when He charges them to shake off the dust of their feet against such as should refuse to receive them, He also bids that this be done as a witness. Now no one bears witness except in a case which is decided by judicial process; and whoever orders inhuman conduct to be submitted to the trial by testimony,[fn-60-P6077_1826366:779-nf] does really threaten as a judge. Again, that it was no new god which recommended[fn-60-P6078_1826477:780-nf] by Christ, was dearly attested by the opinion of all men, because some maintained to Herod that Jesus was the Christ; others, that He was John; some, that He was Elias; and others, that He was one of the old prophetess.[fn-60-P6079_1826714:781-nf] Now, whosoever of all these He might have been, He certainly was not raised up for the purpose of announcing another god after His resurrection. He feeds the multitude in the desert place;[fn-60-P6080_1826925:782-nf] this, you must know[fn-60-P6081_1826968:783-nf] was after the manner of the Old Testament.[fn-60-P6082_1827028:784-nf] Or else,[fn-60-P6083_1827062:785-nf] if there was not the same grandeur, it follows that He is now inferior to the Creator. For He, not for one day, but during forty years, not on the inferior aliment of bread and fish, but with the manna of heaven, supported the lives[fn-60-P6084_1827307:786-nf] of not five thousand, but of six hundred thousand human beings. However, such was the greatness of His miracle, that He willed the slender supply of food, not only to be enough, but even to prove superabundant;[fn-60-P6085_1827537:787-nf] and herein He followed the ancient precedent. For in like manner, during the famine in Elijah's time, the scanty and final meal of the widow of Sarepta was multiplied[fn-60-P6086_1827722:788-nf] by the blessing of the prophet throughout the period of the famine. You have the third book of the Kings.[fn-60-P6087_1827850:789-nf] If you also turn to the fourth book, you will discover all this conduct[fn-60-P6088_1827949:790-nf] of Christ pursued by that man of God, who ordered ten[fn-60-P6089_1828019:791-nf] barley loaves which had been given him to be distributed among the people; and when his servitor, after contrasting the large number of the persons with the small supply of the food, answered, \"What, shall I set this before a hundred men? \"he said again, \"Give them, and they shall eat: for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof, according to the word of the Lord.\"[fn-60-P6090_1828600:792-nf] O Christ, even in Thy novelties Thou art old! Accordingly, when Peter, who had been an eye-witness of the miracle, and had compared it with the ancient precedents, and had discovered in them prophetic intimations of what should one day come to pass, answered (as the mouthpiece of them all) the Lord's inquiry, \"Whom say ye that I am? \"[fn-60-P6091_1828963:793-nf] in the words, \"Thou art the Christ,\" he could not but have perceived that He was that Christ, beside whom he knew of none else in the Scriptures, and whom he was now surveying[fn-60-P6092_1829159:794-nf] in His wonderful deeds. This conclusion He even Himself confirms by thus far bearing with it, nay, even enjoining silence respecting it.[fn-60-P6093_1829315:795-nf] For if Peter was unable to acknowledge Him to be any other than the Creator's Christ, while He commanded them \"to tell no man that saying,\" surely[fn-60-P6094_1829482:796-nf] He was unwilling to have the conclusion promulged which Peter had drawn. No doubt of that,[fn-60-P6095_1829588:797-nf] you say; but as Peter's conclusion was a wrong one, therefore He was unwilling to have a lie disseminated. It was, however, a different reason which He assigned for the silence, even because \"the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and scribes, and priests, and be slain, and be raised again the third day.\"[fn-60-P6096_1829940:798-nf] Now, inasmuch as these sufferings were actually foretold for the Creator's Christ (as we shall fully show in the proper place[fn-60-P6097_1830086:799-nf] ), so by this application of them to His own case[fn-60-P6098_1830172:800-nf] does He prove that it is He Himself of whom they were predicted. At all events, even if they had not been predicted, the reason which He alleged for imposing silence (on the disciples) was such as made it clear enough that Peter had made no mistake, that reason being the necessity of His undergoing these sufferings. \"Whosoever,\" says He, \"will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.\"[fn-60-P6099_1830638:801-nf] Surely[fn-61-P6100_1830665:802-nf] it is the Son of man[fn-61-P6101_1830700:803-nf] who uttered this sentence. Look carefully, then, along with the king of Babylon, into his burning fiery furnace, and there you will discover one \"like the Son of man\" (for He was not yet really Son of man, because not yet born of man), even as early as then[fn-61-P6102_1831007:804-nf] appointing issues such as these. He saved the lives of the three brethren,[fn-61-P6103_1831099:805-nf] who had agreed to lose them for God's sake; but He destroyed those of the Chaldµans, when they had preferred to save them by the means of their idolatry. Where is that novelty, which you pretend[fn-61-P6104_1831319:806-nf] in a doctrine which possesses these ancient proofs? But all the predictions have been fulfilled[fn-61-P6105_1831428:807-nf] concerning martyrdoms which were to happen, and were to receive the recompenses of their reward from God. \"See,\" says Isaiah, \"how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are taken away, and no man considereth.\"[fn-61-P6106_1831692:808-nf] When does this more frequently happen than in the persecution of His saints? This, indeed, is no ordinary matter,[fn-61-P6107_1831827:809-nf] no common casualty of the law of nature; but it is that illustrious devotion, that fighting for the faith, wherein whosoever loses his life for God saves it, so that you may here again recognize the Judge who recompenses the evil gain of life with its destruction, and the good loss thereof with its salvation. It is, however, a jealous God whom He here presents to me one who returns evil for evil. \"For whosoever,\" says He, \"shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.\"[fn-61-P6108_1832497:810-nf] Now to none but my Christ can be assigned the occasion[fn-61-P6109_1832572:811-nf] of such a shame as this. His whole course[fn-61-P6110_1832640:812-nf] was so exposed to shame as to open a way for even the taunts of heretics, declaiming[fn-61-P6111_1832738:813-nf] with all the bitterness in their power against the utter disgrace[fn-61-P6112_1832825:814-nf] of His birth and bringing-up, and the unworthiness of His very flesh.[fn-61-P6113_1832914:815-nf] But how can that Christ of yours be liable to a shame, which it is impossible for him to experience? Since he was never condensed[fn-61-P6114_1833511:816-nf] into human flesh in the womb of a woman, although a virgin; never grew from human seed, although only after the law of corporeal substance, from the fluids[fn-61-P6115_1833699:817-nf] of a woman; was never deemed flesh before shaped in the womb; never called f£tus[fn-61-P6116_1833806:818-nf] after such shaping; was never delivered from a ten months' writhing in the womb;[fn-61-P6117_1834077:819-nf] was never shed forth upon the ground, amidst the sudden pains of parturition, with the unclean issue which flows at such a time through the sewerage of the body, forthwith to inaugurate the light[fn-61-P6118_1834725:820-nf] of life with tears, and with that primal wound which severs the child from her who bears him;[fn-61-P6119_1834860:821-nf] never received the copious ablution, nor the meditation of salt and honey;[fn-61-P6120_1835064:822-nf] nor did he initiate a shroud with swaddling clothes;[fn-61-P6121_1835306:823-nf] nor afterwards did he ever wallow[fn-61-P6122_1835395:824-nf] in his own uncleanness, in his mother's lap; nibbling at her breast; long an infant; gradually[fn-61-P6123_1835524:825-nf] a boy; by slow degrees[fn-61-P6124_1835559:826-nf] a man.[fn-61-P6125_1835580:827-nf] But he was revealed[fn-61-P6126_1835618:828-nf] from heaven, full-grown at once, at once complete; immediately Christ; simply spirit, and power, and god. But as withal he was not true, because not visible; therefore he was no object to be ashamed of from the curse of the cross, the real endurance[fn-61-P6127_1835924:829-nf] of which he escaped, because wanting in bodily substance. Never, therefore, could he have said, \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of me.\" But as for our Christ, He could do no otherwise than make such a declaration;[fn-61-P6128_1836151:830-nf] \"made\" by the Father \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-61-P6129_1836234:831-nf] \"a worm and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people; \"[fn-61-P6130_1836323:832-nf] seeing that it was His will that \"with His stripes we should be healed,\"[fn-61-P6131_1836416:833-nf] that by His humiliation our salvation should be established. And justly did He humble Himself[fn-61-P6132_1836531:834-nf] for His own creature man, for the image and likeness of Himself, and not of another, in order that man, since he had not felt ashamed when bowing down to a stone or a stock, might with similar courage give satisfaction to God for the shamelessness of his idolatry, by displaying an equal degree of shamelessness in his faith, in not being ashamed of Christ. Now, Marcion, which of these courses is better suited to your Christ, in respect of a meritorious shame?[fn-61-P6133_1837014:835-nf] Plainly, you ought yourself to blush with shame for having given him a fictitious existence.[fn-61-P6134_1837138:836-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":44,"source_paragraph":"135","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For when He was brought before Pilate, they proceeded to urge Him with the serious charge[fn-70-P7001_2034359:1638-nf] , of declaring Himself to be Christ the King;[fn-70-P7002_2034433:1639-nf] that is, undoubtedly, as the Son of God, who was to sit at God's right hand.

Scripture saith, \"Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord.\"[fn-35-P3533_1672192:19-nf] When we read what great trials Job endured, it makes one shudder, it makes one shrink, it makes one quake. And what did he receive? The double of what he had lost. Let not a man therefore with an eye to temporal rewards be willing to have patience, and say to himself, \"Let me endure loss, God will give me back sons twice as many; Job received double of all, and begat as many sons as he had buried.\" Then is this not the double? Yes, precisely the double, because the former sons still lived. Let none say, \"Let me bear evils, and God will repay me as He repaid Job:\" that it be now no longer patience but avarice. For if it was not patience which that Saint had, nor a brave enduring of nil that came upon him; the testimony which the Lord gave, whence should he have it? \"Hast thou observed,\" saith the Lord, \"my servant Job? For there is not like him any on the earth, a man without fault,[fn-35-P3534_1673105:20-nf] true worshipper of God.\" What a testimony, my brethren, did this holy man deserve of the Lord! And yet him a bad woman sought by her persuasion to deceive, she too representing that serpent, who, like as in Paradise he deceived the man whom God first made, so likewise here by suggesting blasphemy thought to be able to deceive a man who pleased God. What things he suffered, my brethren! Who can have so much to suffer in his estate, his house, his sons, his flesh, yea in his very wife who was left to be his tempter! But even her who was left, the devil would have taken away long ago, but that he kept her to be his helper: because by Eve he had mastered the first man, therefore had he kept an Eve. What things, then, he suffered! He lost all that he had; his house fell; would that were all! it crushed his sons also. And, to see that patience had great place in him, hear what he answered; \"The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it pleased the Lord, so hath it been done;[fn-35-P3535_1674105:21-nf] blessed be the name of the Lord.\"[fn-35-P3536_1674160:22-nf] He hath taken what He gave, is He lost Who gave? He hath taken what He gave. As if he should say, He hath taken away all, let Him take all, send me away naked, and let me keep Him. What shall I lack if I have God? or what is the good of all else to me, if I have not God? Then it came to his flesh, he was stricken with a wound from head to foot; he was one running sore, one mass of crawling worms: and showed himself immovable in his God, stood fixed. The woman wanted, devil's helper as she was not husband's comforter, to put him up to blaspheme God. \"How long,\" said she, \"dost thou suffer\" so and so; \"speak some word against the Lord,[fn-35-P3537_1674818:23-nf] and die.\"[fn-35-P3538_1674849:24-nf] So then, because he had been brought low, he was to be exalted. And this the Lord did, in order to show it to men; as for His servant, He kept greater things for him in heaven. So then Job who was brought low, He exalted; the devil who was lifted up, He brought low: for \"He putteth down one and setteth up another.\"[fn-35-P3539_1675183:25-nf] But let not any man, my beloved brethren, when he suffers any such-like tribulations, look for a reward here: for instance, if he suffer any losses, let him not peradventure say, \"The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it pleased the Lord, so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord;\" only with the mind to receive twice as much again. Let patience praise God, not avarice. If what thou hast lost thou seekest to receive back twofold, and therefore praisest God, it is of covetousness thou praisest, not of love. Do not imagine this to be the example of that holy man; thou deceivest thyself. When Job was enduring all, he was not hoping for to have twice as much again. Both in his first confession when he bore up under his losses, and bore out to the grave the dead bodies of his sons, and in the second when he was now suffering torments of sores in his flesh, ye may observe what I am saying. Of his former confession the words run thus: \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it pleased the Lord, so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.\"[fn-35-P3540_1676273:26-nf] He might have said, \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; He that took away can once more give; can bring back more than He took.\" He said not this, but, \"As it pleased the Lord,\" said he, \"so is it done:\" because it pleases Him, let it please me: let not that which hath pleased the good Lord misplease His submissive servant; what pleased the Physician, not misplease the sick man. Hear his other confession: \"Thou hast spoken,\" said he to his wife, \"like one of the foolish women. If we have received good at the hand of the Lord, why shall we not bear evil?\"[fn-35-P3541_1676861:27-nf] He did not add, what, if he had said it, would have been true. \"The Lord is able both to bring back my flesh into its former condition, and that which He hath taken away from us, to make manifold more:\" lest he should seem to have endured in hope of this. This was not what he said, not what he hoped. But, that we might be taught, did the Lord that for him, not hoping for it, by which we should be taught, that God was with him: because if He had not also restored to him those things, there was the crown indeed, but hidden, and we could not see it. And therefore what says the divine Scripture in exhorting to patience and hope of things future, not reward of things present? \"Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord.\" Why is it, \"the patience of Job,\" and not, Ye have seen the end of Job himself? Thou wouldest open thy mouth for the \"twice as much;\" wouldest say, \"Thanks be to God; let me bear up: I receive twice as much again, like Job.\" \"Patience of Job, end of the Lord.\" The patience of Job we knows and the end of the Lord we know.[fn-35-P3542_1677956:28-nf] What end of the Lord? \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\" They are the words of the Lord hanging on the cross. He did as it were leave Him for present felicity, not leave Him for eternal immortality. In this is \"the end of the Lord.\" The Jews hold Him, the Jews insult, the Jews bind Him, crown Him with thorns, dishonor Him with spitting, scourge Him, overwhelm Him with revilings, hang Him upon the tree, pierce Him with a spear, last of all bury Him. He was as it were left: but by whom? By those insulting ones. Therefore thou shall but to this end have patience, that thou mayest rise again and not die, that is, never die, even as Christ.

Now what more marvellous, what more magnificent thing could our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and also the Son of man (for this also He vouchsafed to be), grant to us, than the gathering into His fold not only of the spectators of these foolish shows, but even some of the actors in them; for He hath combated[fn-28-P2899_1277668:4-nf] unto salvation not only the lovers of the combats of men with beasts, but even the combatants themselves, for He also was made a spectacle Himself. Hear how. He hath told us Himself, and foretold it before He was made a spectacle, and in the words of prophecy announced beforehand what was to come to pass, as if it were already done, saying in the Psalms, \"They pierced My hands and My feet, they told all My bones.\"[fn-29-P2900_1278129:5-nf] Lo! how He was made a spectacle, for His bones to be told! and this spectacle He expresseth more plainly, \"they observed and looked upon Me.\" He was made a spectacle and an object of derision, made a spectacle by them who were to show Him no favour indeed in that spectacle, but who were to be furious against Him, just as at first He made His martyrs spectacles; as saith the Apostle, \"We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\"[fn-29-P2901_1278605:6-nf] Now two sorts of men are spectators of such spectacles; the one, carnal, the other, spiritual men. The carnal look on, as thinking those martyrs who are thrown to the beasts, or beheaded, or burnt in the flames, to be wretched men, and they detest and abhor them; but others look on, like the holy Angels, not regarding the laceration of their bodies, but admiring the unimpaired purity of their faith. A grand spectacle to the eyes of the heart doth a whole mind in a mangled body exhibit! When these things are read of in the church, you behold them with pleasure with these eyes of the heart, for if you were to behold nothing, you would hear nothing; so you see you have not neglected the spectacles to-day, but have made a choice of spectacles. May God then be with you, and give you grace with gentle persuasiveness to report your spectacles to your friends, whom you have been pained to see this day running to the amphitheatre, and unwilling to come to the church; that so they too may begin to contemn those things, by the love of which themselves have become contemptible, and may, with you, love God, of whom none who love Him can ever be ashamed, for that they love Him who cannot be overcome: let them, as you do, love Christ, who by that very thing wherein He seemed to be overcome, overcame the whole world. For He hath overcome the whole world as we see, my brethren; He hath subjected all powers, He hath subjugated kings, not with the pride of soldiery, but by the ignominy of the Cross: not bythe fury of the sword, but by hanging on the Wood, by suffering in the body, by working in the Spirit.[fn-29-P2902_1280238:7-nf] His body was lifted up on the Cross, and so He subdued souls to the Cross; and now what jewel in their diadem is more precious than the Cross of Christ on the foreheads of kings? In loving Him you will never be ashamed. Whereas from the amphitheatre how many return conquered, because those are conquered, for whom they are so madly interested! still more would they be conquered were they to conquer. For so would they be enslaved to the vain joy, to the exultation of a depraved desire, who are conquered by the very circumstance of running to these shows. For how many, my brethren, do you think have this day been in hesitation whether they would go here or there? And they who in this hesitation, turning their thoughts to Christ, have run to the church, have overcome, not any man, but the devil himself, him that hunteth[fn-29-P2903_1281083:8-nf] after the souls of the whole world.

Which monstrous sacrilege we shall assuredly in no wise avoid unless we acknowledge the manhood united to the Godhead (but by unity of Person), not from the ascension, or the resurrection, or the baptism, but even in His mother, even in the womb, even in the Virigin's very conception.[fn-15-P1593_699571:53-nf] In consequence of which unity of Person, both those attributes which are proper to God are ascribed to man, and those which are proper to the flesh to God, indifferently and promiscuously.[fn-15-P1594_700669:54-nf] For hence it is written by divine guidance, on the one hand, that the Son of man came down from heaven;[fn-15-P1595_701552:55-nf] and on the other, that the Lord of glory was crucified on earth.[fn-15-P1596_701640:56-nf] Hence it is also that since the Lord's flesh was made, since the Lord's flesh was created, the very Word of God is said to have been made, the very omniscient Wisdom of God to have been created, just as propehtically His hands and His feet are described as having been pierced.[fn-15-P1597_701937:57-nf] From this unity of Person it follows, by reason of a like mystery, that, since the flesh of the Word was born of an undefiled mother, God the Word Himself is most Catholicly believed, most impiously denied, to have been born of the Virgin; which being the case, God forbid that any one should seek to defraud Holy Mary of her prerogative of divine grace and her special glory. For by the singular gift of Him who is our Lord and God, and withal, her own son, she is to be confessed most truly and most blessedly-The mother of God \"Theotocos,\" but not in the sense in which it is imagined by a certain impious heresy which maintains, that she is to be called the Mother of God for no other reason than because she gave birth to that man who afterwards became God, just as we speak of a woman as the mother of a priest, or the mother of a bishop, meaning that she was such, not by giving birth to one already a priest or a bishop, but by giving birth to one who afterwards became a priest or a bishop. Not thus, I say, was the holy Mary \"Theotocos,\" the mother of God, but rather, as was said before, because in her sacred womb was wrought that most sacred mystery whereby, on account of the singular and unique unity of Person, as the Word in flesh is flesh, so Man in God is God.[fn-15-P1598_703237:58-nf] ","title":"Introduction.","author":"Vincent of Lerins"},{"chapter":22,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Valentinus, indeed, on the strength of his heretical system, might consistently devise a spiritual flesh for Christ. Any one who refused to believe that that flesh was human might pretend it to be anything he liked, for-as much as (and this remark is applicable, to all heretics), if it was not human, and was not born of man, I do not see of what substance Christ Himself spoke when He called Himself man and the Son of man, saying: \"But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth; \"[fn-94-P9496_2607388:211-nf] and \"The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath-day.\"[fn-94-P9497_2607459:212-nf] For it is of Him that Isaiah writes: \"A man of suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of weakness; \"[fn-94-P9498_2607585:213-nf] and Jeremiah: \"He is a man, and who hath known Him? \"[fn-94-P9499_2607666:214-nf] and Daniel: \"Upon the clouds (He came) as the Son of man.\"[fn-95-P9500_2607752:215-nf] The Apostle Paul likewise says: \"The man Christ Jesus is the one Mediator between God and man.\"[fn-95-P9501_2607869:216-nf] Also Peter, in the Acts of the Apostles, speaks of Him as verily human (when he says), \"Jesus Christ was a man approved of God among you.\"[fn-95-P9502_2608029:217-nf] These passages alone ought to suffice as a prescriptive[fn-95-P9503_2608105:218-nf] testimony in proof that Christ had human flesh derived from man, and not spiritual, and that His flesh was not composed. of soul,[fn-95-P9504_2608264:219-nf] nor of stellar substance, and that it was not an imaginary flesh; (and no doubt they would be sufficient) if heretics could only divest themselves of all their contentious warmth and artifice.

Why, moreover, should it be born, not of corruptible [seed], but of incorruptible? Why, again, since His flesh has both risen and returned to heaven, is not ours, being like His, also taken up at once? Or else, why does not His flesh, since it is like ours, return in like manner to the ground, and suffer dissolution? Such objections even the heathen used constantly to bandy about.[fn-95-P9507_2609313:222-nf] Was the Son of God reduced to such a depth of degradation Again, if He rose again as a precedent for our hope, how is it that nothing like it has been thought desirable (to happen) to ourselves?[fn-95-P9508_2609551:223-nf] Such views are not improper for heathens and they are fit and natural for the heretics too. For, indeed, what difference is there between them, except it be that the heathen, in not believing, do believe; while the heretics, in believing, do not believe? Then, again, they read: \"Thou madest Him a little less than angels; \"[fn-95-P9509_2609971:224-nf] and they deny the lower nature of that Christ who declares Himself to be, \"not a man, but a worm; \"[fn-95-P9510_2610097:225-nf] who also had \"no form nor comeliness, but His form was ignoble, despised more than all men, a man in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of weakness.\"[fn-95-P9511_2610275:226-nf] Here they discover a human being mingled with a divine one and so they deny the manhood.

You say that He was born through[fn-95-P9574_2628189:274-nf] a virgin, not of[fn-95-P9575_2628218:275-nf] a virgin, and in a womb, not of a womb, because the angel in the dream said to Joseph, \"That which is born in her\" (not of her) \"is of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-95-P9576_2628381:276-nf] But the fact is, if he had meant \"of her,\" he must have said \"in her; \"for that which was of her, was also in her. The angel's expression, therefore, \"in her,\" has precisely the same meaning as the phrase \"of her.\" It is, however, a fortunate circumstance that Matthew also, when tracing down the Lord's descent from Abraham to Mary, says, \"Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Christ.\"[fn-95-P9577_2628808:277-nf] But Paul, too, silences these critics[fn-95-P9578_2628866:278-nf] when he says, \"God sent forth His Son, made of a woman.\"[fn-95-P9579_2628943:279-nf] Does he mean through a woman, or in a woman? Nay more, for the sake of greater emphasis, he uses the word \"made\" rather than born, although the use of the latter expression would have been simpler. But by saying \"made,\" he not only confirmed the statement, \"The Word was made flesh,\"[fn-95-P9580_2629246:280-nf] but he also asserted the reality of the flesh which was made of a virgin We shall have also the support of the Psalms on this point, not the \"Psalms\" indeed of Valentinus the apostate, and heretic, and Platonist, but the Psalms of David, the most illustrious saint and well-known prophet. He sings to us of Christ, and through his voice Christ indeed also sang concerning Himself. Hear, then, Christ the Lord speaking to God the Father: \"Thou art He that didst draw[fn-95-P9581_2629731:281-nf] me out of my mother's womb.\"[fn-95-P9582_2629779:282-nf] Here is the first point. \"Thou art my hope from my mother's breasts; upon Thee have I been cast from the womb.\"[fn-95-P9583_2629911:283-nf] Here is another point. \"Thou art my God from my mother's belly.\"[fn-95-P9584_2629996:284-nf] Here is a third point. Now let us carefully attend to the sense of these passages. \"Thou didst draw me,\" He says, \"out of the womb.\" Now what is it which is drawn, if it be not that which adheres, that which is firmly fastened to anything from which it is drawn in order to be sundered? If He clove not to the womb, how could He have been drawn from it? If He who clove thereto was drawn from it, how could He have adhered to it, if it were not that, all the while He was in the womb, He was tied to it, as to His origin,[fn-95-P9585_2630534:285-nf] by the umbilical cord, which communicated growth to Him from the matrix? Even when one strange matter amalgamates with another, it becomes so entirely incorporated[fn-95-P9586_2630724:286-nf] with that with which it amalgamates, that when it is drawn off from it, it carries with it some part of the body from which it is torn, as if in consequence of the severance of the union and growth which the constituent pieces had communicated to each other. But what were His \"mother's breasts\" which He mentions? No doubt they were those which He sucked. Midwives, and doctors, and naturalists, can tell us, from the nature of women's breasts, whether they usually flow at any other time than when the womb is affected with pregnancy, when the veins convey therefrom the blood of the lower parts[fn-95-P9587_2631401:287-nf] to the mammilla, and in the act of transference convert the secretion into the nutritious[fn-95-P9588_2631532:288-nf] substance of milk. Whence it comes to pass that during the period of lactation the monthly issues are suspended. But if the Word was made flesh of Himself without any communication with a womb, no mother's womb operating upon Him with its usual function and support, how could the lacteal fountain have been conveyed (from the womb) to the breasts, since (the womb) can only effect the change by actual possession of the proper substance? But it could not possibly have had blood for transformation into milk, unless it possessed the causes of blood also, that is to say, the severance (by birth)[fn-95-P9589_2632147:289-nf] of its own flesh from the mother's womb. Now it is easy to see what was the novelty of Christ's being born of a virgin. It was simply this, that (He was born) of a virgin in the real manner which we have indicated, in order that our regeneration might have virginal purity,-spiritually cleansed from all pollutions through Christ, who was Himself a virgin, even in the flesh, in that He was born of a virgin's flesh.","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"73","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Now some one will ask how this statement that there is no darkness in Him can be regarded as a thing peculiar to Him, when we consider that the Saviour also was quite without sin. Could it not be said of Him also that \"He is light, and that there is no darkness in Him\"? The difference between the two cases has been partly set forth above. We will now, however, go a step further than we did before, and add, that if God made Christ who knew no sin to be sin for us,[fn-65-P6562_1125652:77-nf] then it could not be said of Him that there was no darkness in Him. For if Jesus was in the likeness[fn-65-P6563_1125772:78-nf] of the flesh of sin and for sin, and condemned sin by taking ripen Him the likeness of the flesh of sin, then it cannot be said of Him, absolutely and directly, that there was no darkness in Him. We may add that \"He[fn-65-P6564_1126007:79-nf] took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses,\" both infirmities of the soul and sicknesses of the hidden man of our heart. On account of these infirmities and sicknesses which He bore away from us, He declares His soul to be sorrowful and sore troubled,[fn-65-P6565_1126282:80-nf] and He is said in Zechariah to have put on filthy garments,[fn-65-P6566_1126363:81-nf] which, when He was about to take them off, are said to be sins. \"Behold, it is said, I have taken away thy sins.\" Because He had taken on Himself the sins of the people of those who believed in Him, he uses many such expressions as these: \"Far from my salvation are the words of my transgressions,\"[fn-65-P6567_1126681:82-nf] and \"Thou knowest my foolishness, and my sins were not hid from Thee.\"[fn-65-P6568_1126770:83-nf] And let no one suppose that we say this from any lack of piety towards the Christ of God; for as the Father alone has immortality and our Lord took upon Himself. for His love to men, the death He died for us, so to the Father alone the words apply, \"In Him is no darkness,\" since Christ took upon Himself, for His goodwill towards men, our darknesses. This He did, that by His power He might destroy our death and remove the darkness which is in our soul, so that the saying in Isaiah might be fulfilled,[fn-65-P6569_1127293:84-nf] \"The people that sat in darkness saw a great light.\" This light, which came into being in the Logos, and is also life, shines in the darkness of our souls, and it has come where the rulers of this darkness carry on their struggle with the race of men and strive to subdue to darkness those who do not stand firm with all their power; that they might be enlightened the light has come so far, and that they might be called sons of light. And shining in darkness this light is pursued by the darkness, but not overtaken.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":22,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_41_the_epistle_of_barnabas","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"ANF-01","text":"For to this end the Lord endured to deliver up His flesh to corruption, that we might be sanctified through the remission of sins, which is effected by His blood of sprinkling. For it is written concerning Him, partly with reference to Israel, and partly to us; and [the Scripture] saith thus: \"He was wounded for our transgressions, and braised for our iniquities: with His stripes we are healed. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb which is dumb before its shearer.\"[fn-31-P3185_535452:38-nf] Therefore we ought to be deeply grateful to the Lord, because He has both made known to us things that are past, and hath given us wisdom concerning things present, and hath not left us without understanding in regard to things which are to come. Now, the Scripture saith, \"Not unjustly are nets spread out for birds.\"[fn-31-P3186_535793:39-nf] This means that the man perishes justly, who, having a knowledge of the way of righteousness, rushes off into the way of darkness.

The prophets, having obtained grace from Him, prophesied concerning Him. And He (since it behoved Him to appear in flesh), that He might abolish death, and reveal the resurrection from the dead, endured [what and as He did], in order that He might fulfill the promise made unto the fathers, and by preparing a new people for Himself, might show, while He dwelt on earth, that He, when He has raised mankind, will also judge them. Moreover, teaching Israel, and doing so great miracles and signs, He preached [the truth] to him, and greatly loved him. But when He chose His own apostles who where to preach His Gospel, [He did so from among those] who were sinners above all sin, that He might show He came \"not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.\"[fn-31-P3188_537045:41-nf] Then He manifested Himself to be the Son of God. For if He had not come in the flesh, how could men have been saved by beholding Him?[fn-31-P3189_537223:42-nf] Since looking upon the sun which is to cease to exist, and is the work of His hands, their eyes are not able to bear his rays. The Son of God therefore came in the flesh with this view, that He might bring to a head the sum of their sins who had persecuted His prophets[fn-31-P3190_537571:43-nf] to the death. For this purpose, then, He endured. For God saith, \"The stroke of his flesh is from them; \"[fn-31-P3191_537758:44-nf] and[fn-31-P3192_537807:45-nf] \"when I shall smite the Shepherd, then the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.\"[fn-31-P3193_538026:46-nf] He himself willed thus to suffer, for it was necessary that He should suffer on the tree.

The order of our arrangement now requires us, after the discussion of the preceding subjects, to institute a general inquiry regarding the soul;[fn-66-P6634_1339677:114-nf] and, beginning with points of inferior importance, to ascend to those that are of greater. Now, that there are souls[fn-66-P6635_1339808:115-nf] in all living things, even in those which live in the waters, is, I suppose, doubted by no one. For the general opinion of all men maintains this; and confirmation from the authority of holy Scripture is added, when it is said that \"God made great whales, and every living creature[fn-66-P6636_1340105:116-nf] that moveth which the waters brought forth after their kind.\"[fn-66-P6637_1340193:117-nf] It is confirmed also from the common intelligence of reason, by those who lay down in certain words a definition of soul. For soul is defined as follows: a substance fantastikh/ and o9rmhtikh/, which may be rendered into Latin, although not so appropriately, sensibilis et mobilis.[fn-66-P6638_1340518:118-nf] This certainly may be said appropriately of all living beings, even of those which abide in the waters; and of winged creatures too, this same definition of anima may be shown to hold good. Scripture also has added its authority to a second opinion, when it says, \"Ye shall not eat the blood, because the life[fn-66-P6639_1340990:119-nf] of all flesh is its blood; and ye shall not eat the life with the flesh; \"[fn-66-P6640_1341080:120-nf] in which it intimates most clearly that the blood of every animal is its life. And if any one now were to ask how it can be said with respect to bees, wasps, and ants, and those other things which are in the waters, oysters and cockles, and all others which are without blood, and are most clearly shown to be living things, that the \"life of all flesh is the blood,\" we must answer, that in living things of that sort the force which is exerted in other animals by the power of red blood is exerted in them by that liquid which is within them, although it be of a different colour; for colour is a thing of no importance, provided the substance be endowed with life.[fn-66-P6641_1341813:121-nf] That beasts of burden or cattle of smaller size are endowed with souls,[fn-66-P6642_1341901:122-nf] there is, by general assent, no doubt whatever. The opinion of holy Scripture, however, is manifest, when God says, \"Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, four-footed beasts, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind.\"[fn-66-P6643_1342182:123-nf] And now with respect to man, although no one entertains any doubt, or needs to inquire, yet holy Scripture declares that \"God breathed into his countenance the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\"[fn-66-P6644_1342433:124-nf] It remains that we inquire respecting the angelic order whether they also have souls, or are souls; and also respecting the other divine and celestial powers, as well as those of an opposite kind. We nowhere, indeed, find any authority in holy Scripture for asserting that either the angels, or any other divine spirits that are ministers of God, either possess souls or are called souls, and yet they are felt by very many persons to be endowed with life. But with regard to God, we find it written as follows: \"And I will put My soul upon that soul which has eaten blood, and I will root him out from among his people; \"[fn-66-P6645_1343092:125-nf] and also in another passage, \"Your new moons, and sabbaths, and great days, I will not accept; your fasts, and holidays, and festal days, My soul hateth.\"[fn-66-P6646_1343449:126-nf] And in the Psalms 22, regarding Christ-for it is certain, as the Gospel bears witness, that this Psalm is spoken of Him-the following words occur: \"O Lord, be not far from helping me; look to my defence: O God, deliver my soul from the sword, and my beloved one from the hand of the dog; \"[fn-66-P6647_1343762:127-nf] although there are also many other testimonies respecting the soul of Christ when He tabernacled in the flesh.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":22,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_47_on_repentance_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The narrower, then, the sphere of action of this second and only (remaining) repentance, the more laborious is its probation; in order that it may not be exhibited in the conscience alone, but may likewise be carried out in some (external) act.

It will not, I consider, be opposed to the nature of our undertaking, if we restate with all possible brevity our opinions on the immortality of rational natures. Every one who participates in anything, is unquestionably of one essence and nature with him who is partaker of the same thing. For example, as all eyes participate in the light, so accordingly all eyes which partake of the light are of one nature; but although every eye partakes of the light, yet, inasmuch as one sees more dearly, and another more obscurely, every eye does not equally share in the light. And again, all hearing receives voice or sound, and therefore all hearing is of one nature; but each one hears more rapidly or more slowly, according as the quality of his hearing is clear and sound. Let us pass now from these sensuous illustrations to the consideration of intellectual things. Every mind which partakes of intellectual light ought undoubtedly to be of one nature with every mind which partakes in a similar manner of intellectual light. If the heavenly virtues, then, partake of intellectual light, i.e., of divine nature, because they participate in wisdom and holiness, and if human souls, have partaken of the same light and wisdom, and thus are mutually of one nature and of one essence,-then, since the heavenly virtues are incorruptible and immortal, the essence of the human soul will also be immortal and incorruptible. And not only so, but because the nature of Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, whose intellectual light alone all created things have a share, is incorruptible and eternal, it is altogether consistent and necessary that every substance which partakes of that eternal nature should last for ever, and be incorruptible and eternal, so that the eternity of divine goodness may be understood also in this respect, that they who obtain its benefits are also eternal. But as, in the instances referred to, a diversity in the participation of the light was observed, when the glance of the beholder was described as being duller or more acute, so also a diversity is to be noted in the participation of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, varying with the degree of zeal or capacity of mind. If such were not the case,[fn-74-P7409_1708639:62-nf] we have to consider whether it would not seem to be an act of impiety to say that the mind which is capable of (receiving) God should admit of a destruction of its essence;[fn-74-P7410_1708827:63-nf] as if the very fact that it is able to feel and understand God could not suffice for its perpetual existence, especially since, if even through neglect the mind fall away from a pure and complete reception of God, it nevertheless contains within it certain seeds of restoration and renewal to a better understanding, seeing the \"inner,\" which is also called the \"rational\" man, is renewed after \"the image and likeness of God, who created him.\" And therefore the prophet says, \"All the ends of the earth shall remember, and turn unto the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Thee.\"[fn-74-P7411_1709465:64-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":22,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§10.

When the limbs of Saul were\npierced, his bones were not conscious of suffering, because he was dead. It was after Saul died, that\nthey hanged his body and those of his sons on the wall of Bethshan. But when David said, They\npierced my hands and my feet, and all my bones cried out, he said in the next verse:-O God,\nabide for my help, and deliver my soul from the sword.[fn-44-P4487_1499757:34-nf] Now Christ was delivered from the sword, and\nascended from out of Sheol, and revived and rose the third day, and so God abode for His help.\nBut Saul called upon the Lord and He did not answer him; and he asked through the Prophets, but no\nanswer was given to him.

He was worsted before the Philistines, and he slew himself with his own sword, when he saw\nthat the battle had overcome him. Moreover in this passage David said:-I will declare Thy name\nunto my brethren, and in the midst of the congregation will I glorify Thee.[fn-44-P4488_1500385:35-nf] How can these things apply to Saul? And again\nDavid said:-Thou didst not give Thy holy one to see corruption.[fn-44-P4489_1500514:36-nf] But all these things fitly apply to Christ. When\nHe came to them, they did not receive Him; but wickedly judged Him by false witness. And He was hung\nupon the tree by His hands, and they pierced His hands and His feet with the nails which they\nfastened in him; and all His bones cried out. And on that day a great prodigy happened. namely, that\nthe light became dark in the middle of the day, as Zechariah prophesied, saying:-The day shall be\nknown unto the Lord. It shall not be daytime, and it shall not be night; and at the evening time\nthere shall be light.[fn-44-P4490_1501095:37-nf] Now what is the\nday that was distinguished by the prodigy, that it was neither daytime nor night, and that at the\nevening time there was light?

And when as yet He had not come, I beforehand have believed on Him; and\nthrough Him I worship the God of Israel. When He comes, will He then blame me because before His\ncoming I beforehand believed on Him?

David was not\nslain; for he died in a good old age, and was buried in Bethlehem. And if they should say that it is\nspoken of Saul, for Saul was killed in the mountains of Gilboa in the battle with the Philistines,\nand if they should say that they pierced his hands and his feet, when they fastened up his\nbody on the wall of Bethshan; yet it does not fitly apply to Saul. When the limbs of Saul were\npierced, his bones were not conscious of suffering, because he was dead. It was after Saul died, that\nthey hanged his body and those of his sons on the wall of Bethshan.

But what did the Lord show written of Him in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms? What did He show? Let Himself say. The evangelist has put this briefly, that we might know what in all that great compass of the Scriptures we ought to believe and to understand. Certainly there are many pages, and many books; the contents of them all is this which the Lord briefly spake to His disciples. What is this? That \"it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again the third day.\" Thou hast it now concerning the Bridegroom, that \"it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again:\" the Bridegroom has been set forth to us. Concerning the Bride, let us see what He saith; that thou, when thou knowest the Bridegroom and the Bride, mayest not without reason come to the marriage. For every celebration is a celebration of marriage: the Church's nuptials are celebrated. The King's Son is about to marry a wife, and that King's Son is Himself a King: and the guests frequenting the marriage are themselves the Bride. Not, as in a carnal marriage, some are guests, and another is she that is married; in the Church they that come as guests, if they come to good purpose, become the Bride. For all the Church is Christ's Bride, of which the beginning and first fruits is the flesh of Christ: there was the Bride joined to the Bridegroom in the flesh. With good reason when He would betoken that same flesh, He brake bread, and with good reason \"in the breaking of bread,\" the eyes \"of the disciples were opened, and they knew Him.\" Well then, what did the Lord say was written of Him in the Law and Prophets and Psalms? That \"it behoved Christ to suffer.\" Had He not added, \"and to rise again,\" well might those mourn whose eyes were holden; but \"to rise again\" is also foretold. And wherefore this? Why did it behove Christ to suffer and to rise again? Because of that Psalm which we especially commended to your attention on the fourth day, the first station, of last week.[fn-40-P4061_2230537:6-nf] Why did it behove Christ to suffer and to rise again? For this reason: \"All the ends of the earth shall be reminded and converted unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Him.\"[fn-40-P4062_2230796:7-nf] For that ye may know that it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise again; in this place also what hath He added, that after setting forth the Bridegroom He might also set forth the Bride? \"And that there be preached,\" saith He, \"in His name, repentance and remission of sins throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\" Ye have heard, brethren; hold it fast. Let no man doubt concerning the Church, that it is \"throughout all nations:\" let no man doubt that it began at Jerusalem, and hath filled all nations. We know the field where the Vine is planted: but when it is grown we know it not, because it has taken up the whole. Whence did it begin? \"At Jerusalem.\" Whither has it come? To \"all nations.\" A few remain: it shall possess all. In the mean time, while it is taking possession of all, it has seemed good to the Husbandman to cut off some unprofitable branches, and they have made heresies and schisms. Let not the branches that are cut off induce you to be cut off: rather exhort ye them that are cut off that they be grafted in again. It is manifest that Christ hath suffered, is risen again, andis ascended into heaven: made manifest alsois the Church, because there is \"preached in His name repentance and remission of sins throughout all nations.\" Whence did it begin? \"Beginning at Jerusalem.\" The man hears this; foolish and vain, and (how, shall I express it?) worse than blind! so great a mountain, and he does not see it; a candle set upon a candlestick, and he shuts his eyes against it!","title":"Homily II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_45_a_commentary_on_the_apostles_creed_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"25.

For again and again, and frequently, he objects that it was said, \"Have I been so long time with you, and do ye not know me, Philip? He who hath seen me, hath seen the Father also.\"[fn-103-P10395_3272821:220-nf] But let him learn what he does not understand. Philip is reproved, and rightly, and deservedly indeed, because he has said, \"Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\"[fn-103-P10396_3273015:221-nf] For when had he either heard from Christ, or learnt that Christ was the Father? although, on the other hand, he had frequently heard, and had often learned, rather that He was the Son, not that He was the Father. For what the Lord said, \"If ye have known me, ye have known my Father also: and henceforth ye have known Him, and have seen Him,\"[fn-103-P10397_3273379:222-nf] He said not as wishing to be understood Himself to be the Father, but implying that he who thoroughly, and fully, and with all faith and all religiousness, drew near to the Son of God, by all means shall attain, through the Son Himself, in whom he thus believes, to the Father, and shall see Him. \"For no one,\" says He, \"can come to the Father, but by me.\"[fn-103-P10398_3273757:223-nf] And therefore he shall not only come to God the Father, and shall know the Father Himself; but, moreover, he ought thus to hold, and so to presume in mind and heart, that he has henceforth not only known, but seen the Father. For often the divine Scripture announces things that are not yet done as being done, because thus they shall be; and things which by all means have to happen, it does not predict as if they were future, but narrates as if they were done. And thus, although Christ had not been born as yet in the times of Isaiah the prophet, he said, \"For unto us a child is born; \"[fn-103-P10399_3274371:224-nf] and although Mary had not yet been approached, he said, \"' And I approached unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.\"[fn-104-P10400_3274524:225-nf] And when Christ had not yet made known the mind of the Father, it is said, \"And His name shall be called the Angel of Great Counsel.\"[fn-104-P10401_3274680:226-nf] And when He had not yet suffered, he declared, \"He is as a sheep led to the slaughter.\"[fn-104-P10402_3274820:227-nf] And although the cross had never yet existed, He said, \"All day long have I stretched out my hands to an unbelieving people.\"[fn-104-P10403_3274968:228-nf] And although not yet had He been scornfully given to drink, the Scripture says, \"In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.\"[fn-104-P10404_3275115:229-nf] And although He had not yet been stripped, He said, \"Upon my vesture they did cast lots, and they numbered my bones: they pierced my hands and my feet.\"[fn-104-P10405_3275290:230-nf] For the divine Scripture, foreseeing, speaks of things which it knows shall be as being already done, and speaks of things as perfected which it regards as future, but which shall come to pass without any doubt. And thus the Lord in the present passage said, \"Henceforth ye have known and have seen Him.\" Now He said that the Father should be seen by whomsoever had followed the Son, not as if the Son Himself should be the Father seen, but that whosoever was willing to follow Him, and be His disciple, should obtain the reward of being able to see the Father. For He also is the image of God the Father; so that it is added, moreover, to these things, that \"as the Father worketh, so also the Son worketh.\"[fn-104-P10406_3276024:231-nf] And the Son is an imitator[fn-104-P10407_3276071:232-nf] of all the Father's works, so that every one may regard it just as if he saw the Father, when he sees Him who always imitates the invisible Father in all His works. But if Christ is the Father Himself, in what manner does He immediately add, and say, \"Whosoever believeth in me, the works that I do he shall do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father?[fn-104-P10408_3276496:233-nf] And He further subjoins, \"If ye love me, keep my commandments; and I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter.\"[fn-104-P10409_3276649:234-nf] After which also He adds this: \"If any one loveth me, he shall keep my word: and my Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and will make our abode with him.\"[fn-104-P10410_3276842:235-nf] Moreover, also, He added this too: \"But the Advocate, that Holy Spirit whom the Father will send, He will teach you, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\"[fn-104-P10411_3277057:236-nf] He utters, further, that passage when He shows Himself to be the Son, and reasonably subjoins, and says, \"If ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.\"[fn-104-P10412_3277283:237-nf] But what shall we say when He also continues in these words: \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit He purgeth, that it may bring forth more fruit? \"[fn-104-P10413_3277564:238-nf] Still He persists, and adds: \"As the Father hath loved me, so also have I loved you: remain in my love. If ye have kept my commandments, ye shall remain in my love; even as I have kept the Father's commandments, and remain in His love.\"[fn-104-P10414_3277821:239-nf] Further, He says in addition: \"But I have called you friends; for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\"[fn-104-P10415_3277983:240-nf] Moreover, He adds to all this: \"But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not Him that sent me.\"[fn-104-P10416_3278141:241-nf] These things then, after the former, evidently attesting Him to be not the Father but the Son, the Lord would never have added, if He had had it in mind, either that He was the Father, or wished Himself to be understood as the Father, except that He might declare this, that every man ought henceforth to consider, in seeing the image of God the Father through the Son, that it was as if he saw the Father; since every one believing on the Son may be exercised in the contemplation of the likeness, so that, being accustomed to seeing the divinity in likeness, he may go forward, and grow even to the perfect contemplation of God the Father Almighty. And since he who has imbibed this truth into his mind and soul, and has believed of all things that thus it shall be, he shall even now see, as it were, in some measure the Father whom he will see hereafter; and he may so regard it, as if he actually held, what he knows for certain that he shall one day hold. But if Christ Himself had been the Father, why did He promise as future, a reward which He had already granted and given? For that He says, \"Blessed are they of a pure heart, for they shall see God,\"[fn-104-P10417_3279325:242-nf] it is understood to promise the contemplation and vision of the Father; therefore He had not given this; for why should He promise if He had already given? For He had given if He was the Father: for He was seen, and He was touched, But since, when Christ Himself is seen and touched, He still promises, and says that he who is of a pure heart shall see God, He proves by this very saying that He who was then present was not the Father, seeing that He was seen, and yet promised that whoever should be of a pure heart should see the Father. It was therefore not the Father, but the Son, who promised this, because He who was the Son promised that which had yet to be seen; and His promise would have been superfluous unless He had been the Son. For why did He promise to the pure in heart that they should see the Father, if already they who were then present saw Christ as the Father? But because He was the Son, not the Father, rightly also He was then seen as the Son, because He was the image of God; and the Father, because He is invisible, is promised and pointed out as to be seen by the pure in heart. Let it then be enough to have suggested even these points against that heretic; a few words about many things. For a field which is indeed both wide and expansive would be laid open if we should desire to discuss that heretic more fully; seeing that bereaved, in these two particulars, as it were of his eyes plucked out, he is altogether overcome in the blindness of his doctrine.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_45_oration_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"V. Take, in the next place, the subjection by which you subject the Son to the Father. What, you say, is He not now subject, or must He, if He is God, be subject to God?[fn-45-P4505_1418366:20-nf] You are fashioning your argument as if it concerned some robber, or some hostile deity. But look at it in this manner: that as for my sake He was called a curse,[fn-45-P4506_1418782:21-nf] Who destroyed my curse; and sin,[fn-45-P4507_1418834:22-nf] who taketh away the sin of the world; and became a new Adam[fn-45-P4508_1418913:23-nf] to take the place of the old, just so He makes my disobedience His own as Head of the whole body. As long then as I am disobedient and rebellious, both by denial of God and by my passions, so long Christ also is called disobedient on my account. But when all things shall be subdued unto Him on the one hand by acknowledgment of Him, and on the other by a reformation, then He Himself also will have fulfilled His submission, bringing me whom He has saved to God. For this, according to my view, is the subjection of Christ; namely, the fulfilling of the Father's Will. But as the Son subjects all to the Father, so does the Father to the Son; the One by His Work, the Other by His good pleasure, as we have already said. And thus He Who subjects presents to God that which he has subjected, making our condition His own. Of the same kind, it appears to me, is the expression, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\"[fn-45-P4509_1419855:24-nf] It was not He who was forsaken either by the Father, or by His own Godhead, as some have thought, as if It were afraid of the Passion, and therefore withdrew Itself from Him in His Sufferings (for who compelled Him either to be born on earth at all, or to be lifted up on the Cross?) But as I said, He was in His own Person representing us. For we were the forsaken and despised before, but now by the Sufferings of Him Who could not suffer, we were taken up and saved. Similarly, He makes His own our folly and our transgressions; and says what follows in the Psalm, for it is very evident that the Twenty-first[fn-45-P4510_1420486:25-nf] Psalm refers to Christ.","title":"Oration XXX.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":22,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_62_book_iv_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"152","folder":"ANF-01","text":"8. Inasmuch, then, as the Spirit of God pointed out by the prophets things to come, forming and adapting us beforehand for the purpose of our being made subject to God, but it was still a future thing that man, through the good pleasure of the Holy Spirit, should see [God], it necessarily behoved those through whose instrumentality future things were announced, to see God, whom they intimated as to be seen by men; in order that God, and the Son of God, and the Son, and the Father, should not only be prophetically announced, but that He should also be seen by all His members who are sanctified and instructed in the things of God, that man might be disciplined beforehand and previously exercised for a reception into that glory which shall afterwards be revealed in those who love God. For the prophets used not to prophesy in word alone, but in visions also, and in their mode of life, and in the actions which they performed, according to the suggestions of the Spirit.

But as to your saying that the whole world that rejoices in Christian communion is the party of Macarius, who with any remnant of sanity in his brain could make such a statement? But because we say that you are of the party of Donatus, you therefore seek for a man of whose party you may say we are; and, being in a great strait, you mention the name of some obscure person, who, if he is known in Africa, is certainly unknown in any other quarter of the globe. And therefore hearken to the answer made to you by all the seed of Abraham from every corner of the earth: Of that Macarius, to whose party you assert us to belong, we know absolutely nothing. Can you reply in turn that you know nothing of Donatus? But even if we were to say that you are the party of Optatus, which of you can say that he is unacquainted with Optatus, unless in the sense that he does not know him personally, as perhaps he does not know Donatus either? But you acknowledge that you rejoice in the name of Donatus, do you also take any pleasure in the name of Optatus? What then can the name of Donatus profit you, when all of you alike are polluted by Optatus? What advantage can you derive from the sobriety of Donatus, when you are defiled by the drunkenness of the Circumcelliones? What, according to your views, are you profiled by the innocence of Donatus, when you are stained by the rapacity of Optatus? For this is your mistake, that you think that the unrighteousness of a man has more power in infecting his neighbor than the righteousness of a man has in purifying those around him. Therefore, if two share in common the sacraments of God, the one a just man, the other an unrighteous one, but so that neither the former should imitate the unrighteousness of the latter, nor the latter the righteousness of the former, you say that the result is not that both are made just, but that both are made unrighteous; so that also that holy thing, which both receive in common, becomes unclean and loses its original holiness. When does unrighteousness find for herself such advocates as these, through whose madness she is esteemed victorious? How comes it then that, in the midst of such mistaken perversity, you congratulate yourselves upon the name of Donatus, when it shows not that Petilianus deserves to be what Donatus is, but that Donatus is compelled to be what Optatus is?

For you, too, through the sacrament which is in you, like Caiaphas the persecutor of the Lord, prophesy without being aware of it.[fn-50-P5035_2472309:145-nf] For what in Greek is expressed by the word MMaxarioj is in our language simply \"Blessed;\" and in this way certainly we are of the party of Macarius, the Blessed One. For what is more blessed than Christ, of whose party we are, after whom alI the ends of the earth are called, and to whom they all are turned, and in whose sight all the countries of the nations worship? Therefore the party of this Macarius, that is to say, of this Blessed One, feels no apprehension at your last curse, distorted from the words of Solomon, lest it should perish from the earth. For what is said by him of the impious you endeavor to apply to the inheritance of Christ, and you strive to prove that this has been achieved with inexpressible impiety; for when he was speaking of the impious, he says, \"Let their portion perish from off the earth.\"[fn-50-P5036_2473159:146-nf] But when you say, with reference to the words of Scripture, \"I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance,\"[fn-50-P5037_2473295:147-nf] and\" all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord,\"[fn-50-P5038_2473384:148-nf] that the promise contained in them has already perished from the earth, you are seeking to turn against the inheritance of Christ what was foretold about the lot of the impious; but so long as the inheritance of Christ endures and increases, you are perishing in saying such things.

We quote Isaiah, Daniel, Jeremiah, and other holy prophets: we tell him that they came long before Christ, by what length of time they preceded His coming. We make this reply then: Prophets came before Him, and they foretold His coming. One of them answers: What prophets? We quote for him those which are daily read to us. And, said he, Who are these prophets? We answer: Those who also foretold the things which we see come to pass. And he urges: You have forged these for yourselves, you have seen them come to pass, and have written them in what books you pleased, as if their coming had been predicted. Here in opposition to pagan enemies the witness of other enemies offers itself. We produce books written by the Jews, and reply: Doubtless both you and they are enemies of our faith. Hence are they scattered among the nations, that we may convince one class of enemies by another.

What means then, say they, `Before the morning star?' I would answer, that if `Before the morning star' shews that His birth from Mary was wonderful, many others besides have been born before the rising of the star. What then is said so wonderful in His instance, that He should record it as some choice prerogative[fn-72-P7250_2878546:125-nf] , when it is common to many? Next, to beget differs from bringing forth; for begetting involves the primary foundation, but to bring forth is nothing else than the production of what exists. If then the term belongs to the body, let it be observed that He did not then receive a beginning of coming to be when he was evangelized to the shepherds by night, but when the Angel spoke to the Virgin. And that was not night, for this is not said; on the contrary, it was night when He issued from the womb. This difference Scripture makes, and says on the one hand that He was begotten before the morning star, and on the other speaks of His proceeding from the womb, as in the twenty-first Psalm, `Thou art he that drew Me from the womb[fn-72-P7251_2879311:126-nf] .' Besides, He did not say, `before the rising of the morning star,' but simply `before the morning star.' If then the phrase must be taken of the body, then either the body must be before Adam, for the stars were before Adam, or we have to investigate the sense of the letter. And this John enables us to do, who says in the Apocalypse, `I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. Blessed are they who make broad their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever maketh and loveth a lie. I Jesus have sent My Angel, to testify these things in the Churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star.

If then `the Offspring of David' be the `Bright and Morning Star,' it is plain that the flesh of the Saviour is called `the Morning Star,' which the Offspring from God preceded; so that the sense of the Psalm is this, `I have begotten Thee from Myself before Thy appearance in the flesh;' for `before the Morning Star' is equivalent to `before the Incarnation of the Word.'","title":"Discourse IV","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":22,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_94_homily_lxxxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But mark herein also their wantonness, and intemperance, and folly.

Since, then, neither the apostle himself nor an angel from heaven can preach or teach any otherwise than Christ has once taught and His apostles have announced, I wonder very much whence has originated this practice, that, contrary to evangelical and apostolical discipline, water is offered in some places in the Lord's cup, which water by itself cannot express the blood of Christ.

It is a worthy subject of inquiry how these words of the Lord are to be understood, \"But I have called you friends: for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\" For who is there that dare affirm or believe that any man knoweth all things that the only-begotten Son hath heard of the Father; when there is no one that can comprehend even how He heareth any word of the Father, being as He is Himself the only Word of the Father? Nay more, is it not the case that a little afterwards, in this same discourse, which He delivered to the disciples between the Supper and His passion, He said, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\"?[fn-29-P2974_1694110:1-nf] How, then, are we to understand that He made known unto the disciples all that He had heard of the Father, when there are many things that He saith not, just because He knows that they cannot bear them now? Doubtless what He is yet to do He says that He has done as the same Being who hath made those things which are yet to be.[fn-29-P2975_1694457:2-nf] For as He says by the prophet, \"They pierced my hands and my feet,\"[fn-29-P2976_1694542:3-nf] and not, They will yet pierce; but speaking as it were of the past, and yet predicting what Was still in the future: so also in the passage before us He declares that He has made known to the disciples all, that He knows He will yet make known in that fullness of knowledge, whereof the apostle says, \"But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\" For in the same place he adds: \"Now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as also I am known; and now through a glass in a riddle, but then face to face.\"[fn-29-P2977_1695111:4-nf] For the same apostle also says that we have been saved by the washing of regeneration,[fn-29-P2978_1695222:5-nf] and yet declares in another place, \"We are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is no hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.\"[fn-29-P2979_1695453:6-nf] To a similar purpose it is also said by his fellow-apostle Peter, \"In whom, though now seeing Him not, ye believe; and in whom, when ye see Him, ye shall rejoice with a joy unspeakable and glorious: receiving the reward of faith, even the salvation of your souls.\"[fn-29-P2980_1695740:7-nf] If, then, it is now the season of faith, and faith's reward is the salvation of our souls; who, in that faith which worketh by love,[fn-29-P2981_1695892:8-nf] can doubt that the day must come to an end, and at its close the reward be received; not only the redemption of our body, whereof the Apostle Paul speaketh,[fn-29-P2982_1696063:9-nf] but also the salvation of our souls, as we are told by the Apostle Peter? For the felicity springing from both is at this present time, and in the existing state of mortality, a matter rather of hope than of actual possession. But this it concerns us to remember, that our outward man, to wit the body, is still decaying; but the inward, that is, the soul, is being renewed day by day.[fn-29-P2983_1696468:10-nf] Accordingly, while we are waiting for the immortality of the flesh and salvation of our souls in the future, yet with the pledge we have received, it may be said that we are saved already; so that knowledge of all things which the Only-begotten hath heard of the Father we are to regard as a matter of hope still lying in the future, although declared by Christ as something He had already imparted.","title":"Tractate LXXXVI.","author":"Augustine"}]
