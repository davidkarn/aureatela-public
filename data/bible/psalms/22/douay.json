{"verses":["A psalm for David.  The Lord ruleth me:  and I shall want nothing.","He hath set me in a place of pasture.  He hath brought me up, on\nthe water of refreshment:","He hath converted my soul.  He hath led me on the paths of\njustice, for his own name's sake.","For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I\nwill fear no evils, for thou art with me.  Thy rod and thy staff, they\nhave comforted me.","Thou hast prepared a table before me against them that afflict\nme.  Thou hast anointed my head with oil; and my chalice which\ninebreateth me, how goodly is it!","And thy mercy will follow me all the days of my life.  And that I\nmay dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days."]}
