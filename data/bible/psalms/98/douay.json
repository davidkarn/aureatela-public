{"verses":["A psalm for David himself.  The Lord hath reigned, let the people\nbe angry:  he that sitteth on the cherubims:  let the earth be moved.","The lord is great in Sion, and high above all people.","Let them give praise to thy great name:  for it is terrible and\nholy:","And the king's honour loveth judgment.  Thou hast prepared\ndirections:  thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob.","Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore his footstool, for it is\nholy.","Moses and Aaron among his priests:  and Samuel among them that\ncall upon his name.  They called upon the Lord, and he heard them:","He spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud.  They kept his\ntestimonies, and the commandment which he gave them.","Thou didst hear them, O Lord our God:  thou wast a merciful God to\nthem, and taking vengeance on all their inventions.","Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain:  for\nthe Lord our God is holy."]}
