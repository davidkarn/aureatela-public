{"verses":["The psalm of David, which he sung to the Lord, for the words of\nChusi, the son of Jemini.","O Lord, my God, in thee have I put my trust; same me from all them\nthat persecute me, and deliver me.","Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, while there is\nno one to redeem me, nor to save.","O Lord, my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in\nmy hands:","If I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly\nfall empty before my enemies.","Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life,\non the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust.","Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger:  and be thou exalted in the borders\nof my enemies.  And arise, O Lord, my God, in the precept which thou\nhast commanded:","And a congregation of people shall surround thee.  And for their\nsakes return thou on high.","The Lord judgeth the people.  Judge me, O Lord, according to my\njustice, and according to my innocence in me.","The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought; and thou\nshalt direct the just:  the searcher of hearts and reins is God.  Just","Is my help from the Lord; who saveth the upright of heart.","God is a just judge, strong and patient:  is he angry every day?","Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword; he hath\nbent his bow, and made it ready.","And in it he hath prepared to instruments of death, he hath made\nready his arrows for them that burn.","Behold he hath been in labour with injustice:  he hath conceived\nsorrow, and brought forth iniquity.","He hath opened a pit and dug it:  and he is fallen into the hole\nhe made.","His sorrow shall be turned on his own head:  and his iniquity\nshall come down upon his crown.","I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice:  and will\nsing to the name of the Lord the most high."]}
