He called the Most High God the Ancient of days, whose age and origin cannot be comprehended; for He alone was from generations, and He will be always to generations.[fn-12-P1294_559160:121-nf] But that Christ, after His passion and resurrection, was about to ascend to God the Father, David bore witness in these words in the cixth Psalm:[fn-12-P1295_559324:122-nf] \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\" Whom could this prophet, being himself a king, call his Lord, who sat at the right hand of God, but Christ the Son of God, who is King of kings and Lord of lords? And this is more plainly shown by Isaiah,[fn-12-P1296_559646:123-nf] when he says: \"Thus saith the Lord God to my Lord Christ, whose right hand I have holden; I will subdue nations before Him, and will break the strength of kings.

I will go before Thee, and will make the mountains level; and I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and shatter the bars of iron; and I will give Thee the hidden and invisible treasures, that Thou mayest know that I am the Lord God, which call Thee by Thy name, the God of Israel.\" Lastly, on account of the goodness and faithfulness which He displayed towards God on earth, there was given to Him a kingdom, and glory, and dominion; and all people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him; and His dominion is everlasting, and that which shall never pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed. And this is understood in two ways: that even now He has an everlasting dominion, when all nations and all languages adore His name, confess His majesty, follow His teaching, and imitate His goodness: He has power and glory, in that all tribes of the earth obey His precepts. And also, when He shall come again with majesty and glory to judge every soul, and to restore the righteous to life, then He shall truly have the government of the whole earth: then, every evil having been removed from the affairs of men, a golden age (as the poets call it), that is, a time of righteousness and peace, will arise.

The shortness of man's life is the punishment for man's sin; and the fact that even on the very threshold of the light death constantly overtakes the new-born child proves that the times are continually sinking into deeper depravity. For when the first tiller of paradise had been entangled by the serpent in his snaky coils, and had been forced in consequence to migrate earthwards, although his deathless state was changed for a mortal one, yet the sentence[fn-2-P295_52797:127-nf] of man's curse was put off for nine hundred years, or even more, a period so long that it may be called a second immortality. Afterwards sin gradually grew more and more virulent, till the ungodliness of the giants[fn-2-P296_53028:128-nf] brought in its train the shipwreck of the whole world. Then when the world had been cleansed by the baptism-if I may so call it-of the deluge, human life was contracted to a short span. Yet even this we have almost altogether wasted, so continually do our iniquities fight against the divine purposes. For how few there are, either who go beyond their hundredth year, or who, going beyond it, do not regret that they have done so; according to that which the Scripture witnesses in the book of Psalms: \"the days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow.\"[fn-2-P297_53697:129-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":90,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1209","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"6.

It was to give day the privileges of seniority that Scripture put the end of the first day before that of the first night, because night follows day: for, before the creation of light, the world was not in night, but in darkness. It is the opposite of day which was called night, and it did not receive its name until after day. Thus were created the evening and the morning.[fn-21-P2109_617638:37-nf] Scripture means the space of a day and a night, and afterwards no more says day and night, but calls them both under the name of the more important: a custom which you will find throughout Scripture. Everywhere the measure of time is counted by days, without mention of nights. \"The days of our years,\"[fn-21-P2110_618142:38-nf] says the Psalmist. \"Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been,\"[fn-21-P2111_618237:39-nf] said Jacob, and elsewhere \"all the days of my life.\"[fn-21-P2112_618310:40-nf] Thus under the form of history the law is laid down for what is to follow.And the evening and the morning were one day.[fn-21-P2113_618454:41-nf] Why does Scripture say \"one day the first day\"? Before speaking to us of the second, the third, and the fourth days, would it not have been more natural to call that one the first which began the series? If it therefore says \"one day,\" it is from a wish to determine the measure of day and night, and to combine the time that they contain. Now twenty-four hours fill up the space of one day-we mean of a day and of a night; and if, at the time of the solstices, they have not both an equal length, the time marked byScripture does not the less circumscribe their duration. It is as though it said: twenty-four hours measure the space of a day, or that, in reality a day is the time that the heavens starting from one point take to return there. Thus, every time that, in the revolution of the sun, evening and morning occupy the world, their periodical succession never exceeds the space of one day.But must we believe in a mysterious reason for this? God who made the nature of time measured it out and determined it by intervals of days; and, wishing to give it a week as a measure, he ordered the week to revolve from period to period upon itself, to count the movement of time, forming the week of one day revolving seven times upon itself: a proper circle begins and ends with itself. Such is also the character of eternity, to revolve upon itself and to end nowhere. If then the beginning of time is called \"one day\" rather than \"the first day,\" it is because Scripture wishes to establish its relationship with eternity. It was, in reality, fit and natural to call \"one\" the day whose character is to be one wholly separated and isolated from all the others. If Scripturespeaks to us of many ages, saying everywhere, \"age of age, and ages of ages,\" we do not see it enumerate them as first, second, and third. It follows that we are hereby shown not so much limits, ends and succession of ages, as distinctions between various states and modes of action. \"The day of the Lord,\" Scripture says, \"is great and very terrible,\"[fn-21-P2114_620516:42-nf] and elsewhere \"Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you? The day of the Lord is darkness and not light.\"[fn-21-P2115_620671:43-nf] A day of darkness for those who are worthy of darkness. No; this day without evening, without succession and without end is not unknown to Scripture, and it is the day that the Psalmist calls the eighth day, because it is outside this time of weeks.[fn-21-P2116_620938:44-nf] Thus whether you call it day, or whether you call it eternity, you express the same idea. Give this state the name of day; there are not several, but only one. If you call it eternity still it is unique and not manifold. Thus it is in order that you may carry your thoughts forward towards a future life, that Scripture marks by the word \"one\" the day which is the type of eternity, the first fruits of days, the contemporary of light, the holy Lord's day honoured by the Resurrection of our Lord.

In the first book, the unity and equality of that highest Trinity is shown from Holy Scripture. In the second, and third, and fourth, the same: but a careful handling of the question respecting the sending of the Son and of the Holy Spirit has resulted in three books; and we have demonstrated, that He who is sent is not therefore less than He who sends because the one sent, the other was sent; since the Trinity, which is in all things equal, being also equally in its own nature unchangeable, and invisible, and everywhere present, works indivisibly. In the fifth,-with a view to those who think that the substance of the Father and of the Son is therefore not the same, because they suppose everything that is predicated of God to be predicated according to substance, and therefore contend that to beget and to be begotten, or to be begotten and unbegotten, as being diverse, are diverse substances,-it is demonstrated that not everything that is predicated of God is predicated according to substance, as He is called good and great according to substance, or anything else that is predicated of Him in respect to Himself, but that some things also are predicated relatively, i.e. not in respect to Himself, but in respect to something which is not Himself; as He is called the Father in respect to the Son, or the Lord in respect to the creature that serves Him; and that here, if anything thus relatively predicated, i.e. predicated in respect to something that is not Himself, is predicated also as in time, as, e.g., \"Lord, Thou hast become our refuge,\"[fn-19-P1919_954967:10-nf] then nothing happens to Him so as to work a change in Him, but He Himself continues altogether unchangeable in His own nature or essence. In the sixth, the question how Christ is called by the mouth of the apostle \"the power of God and the wisdom of God,\"[fn-19-P1920_955239:11-nf] is so far argued that the more careful handling of that question is deferred, viz. whether He from whom Christ is begotten is not wisdom Himself, but only the father of His own wisdom, or whether wisdom begat wisdom. But be it which it may, the equality of the Trinity became apparent in this book also, and that God was not triple, but a Trinity; and that the Father and the Son are not, as it were, a double as opposed to the single Holy Spirit: for therein three are not anything more than one. We considered, too, how to understand the words of Bishop Hilary, \"Eternity in the Father, form in the Image, use in the Gift.\" In the seventh, the question is explained which had been deferred: in what way that God who begat the Son is not only Father of His own power and wisdom, but is Himself also power and wisdom; so, too, the Holy Spirit; and yet that they are not three powers or three wisdoms, but one power and one wisdom, as one God and one essence. It was next inquired, in what way they are called one essence, three persons, or by some Greeks one essence, three substances; and we found that the words were so used through the needs of speech, that there might be one term by which to answer, when it is asked what the three are, whom we truly confess to be three, viz. Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit. In the eighth, it is made plain by reason also to those who understand, that not only the Father is not greater than the Son in the substance of truth, but that both together are not anything greater than the Holy Spirit alone, nor that any two at all in the same Trinity are anything greater than one, nor all three together anything greater than each severally. Next, I have pointed out, that by means of the truth, which is beheld by the understanding, and by means of the highest good, from which is all good, and by means of the righteousness for which a righteous mind is loved even by a mind not yet righteous, we might understand, so far as it is possible to understand, that not only incorporeal but also unchangeable nature which is God; and by means, too, of love, which in the Holy Scriptures is called God,[fn-19-P1921_957395:12-nf] by which, first of all, those who have understanding begin also, however feebly, to discern the Trinity, to wit, one that loves, and that which is loved, and love. In the ninth, the argument advances as far as to the image of God, viz. man in respect to his mind; and in this we found a kind of trinity, i.e. the mind, and the knowledge whereby the mind knows itself, and the love whereby it loves both itself and its knowledge of itself; and these three are shown to be mutually equal, and of one essence. In the tenth, the same subject is more carefully and subtly handled, and is brought to this point, that we found in the mind a still more manifest trinity of the mind, viz. in memory, and understanding, and will. But since it turned out also, that the mind could never be in such a case as not to remember, understand, and love itself, although it did not always think of itself; but that when it did think of itself, it did not in the same act of thought distinguish itself from things corporeal; the argument respecting the Trinity, of which this is an image, was deferred, in order to find a trinity also in the things themselves that are seen with the body, and to exercise the reader's attention more distinctly in that. Accordingly, in the eleventh, we chose the sense of sight, wherein that which should have been there found to hold good might be recognized also in the other four bodily senses. although not expressly mentioned; and so a trinity of the outer man first showed itself in those things which are discerned from without, to wit, from the bodily object which is seen, and from the form which is thence impressed upon the eye of the beholder, and from the purpose of the will combining the two. But these three things, as was patent, were not mutually equal and of one substance. Next, we found yet another trinity in the mind itself, introduced into it, as it were, by the things perceived from without; wherein the same three things, as it appeared, were of one substance: the image of the bodily object which is in the memory, and the form thence impressed when the mind's eye of the thinker is turned to it, and the purpose of the will combining the two. But we found this trinity to pertain to the outer man, on this account, that it was introduced into the mind from bodily objects which are perceived from without. In the twelfth, we thought good to distinguish wisdom from knowledge, and to seek first, as being the lower of the two, a kind of appropriate and special trinity in that which is specially called knowledge; but that although we have got now in this to something pertaining to the inner man, yet it is not yet to be either called or thought an image of God. And this is discussed in the thirteenth book by the commendation of Christian faith. In the fourteenth we discuss the true wisdom of man, viz. that which is granted him by God's gift in the partaking of that very God Himself, which is distinct from knowledge; and the discussion reached this point, that a trinity is discovered in the image of God, which is man in respect to his mind, which mind is \"renewed in the knowledge\" of God,\"after the image of Him that created\" man;[fn-19-P1922_960598:13-nf] \"after His own image;\"[fn-19-P1923_960640:14-nf] and so obtains wisdom,wherein is the contemplation of things eternal.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":90,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_23_introductory_notice","source_chapter":35,"source_paragraph":"204","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"And so the human race was lying under a just condemnation, and all men were the children of wrath.

Jesus also, the son of Nave, the successor of Moses, himSelf broke the Sabbath-day; for on the Sabbath-day he commanded the children of Israel[fn-45-P4504_1734365:11-nf] to go round the walls of the city of Jericho with trumpets, and declare war against the aliens. Matthias[fn-45-P4505_1734487:12-nf] also, prince of Judah, broke the Sabbath; for he slew the prefect of Antiochus the king of Syria on the Sabbath, and subdued the foreigners by pursuing them. And in Matthew we read, that it is written Isaiah also and the rest of his colleagues broke the Sabbath[fn-45-P4506_1734780:13-nf] -that that true and just Sabbath should be observed in the seventh millenary of years. Wherefore to those seven days the Lord attributed to each a thousand years; for thus went the warning: \"In Thine eyes, O Lord, a thousand years are as one day.\"[fn-45-P4507_1735047:14-nf] Therefore in the eyes of the Lord each thousand of years is ordained, for I find that the Lord's eyes are seven.[fn-45-P4508_1735176:15-nf] Wherefore, as I have narrated, that true Sabbath will be in the seventh millenary of years, when Christ with His elect shall reign. Moreover, the seven heavens agree with those days; for thus we are warned: \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the powers of them by the spirit of His mouth.\"[fn-45-P4509_1735506:16-nf] There are seven spirits. Their names are the spirits which abode on the Christ of God, as was intimated in Isaiah the prophet: \"And there rests upon Him the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of wisdom[fn-45-P4510_1735839:17-nf] and of piety, and the spirit of God's fear hath filled Him.\"[fn-45-P4511_1735928:18-nf] Therefore the highest heaven is the heaven of wisdom; the second, of understanding; the third, of counsel; the fourth, of might; the fifth, of knowledge; the sixth, of piety; the seventh, of God's fear.

For He adds, \"The Lord will deliver him out of them all.\" And this is just in accordance with the Saviour's word, whereby He promises that they will overcome their afflictions, and that they will participate in that victory which He has won for them. For after saying, \"In the world ye shall have tribulation,\" He added, \"But be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\" And again, He taught them to pray that they might not fall into temptation, when He said, \"And lead us not into temptation; \"which means, \"Suffer us not to fall into temptation.\" And to show that this did not imply they should not be tempted, but really that they should be delivered from the evil, He added, \"But deliver us from evil.\" But perhaps you will say, What difference is there between being tempted, and falling or entering into temptation?

But if through the Son it has come to be, and `in Him all things consist[fn-53-P5356_2101724:69-nf] ,' it must follow that he who contemplates the creation rightly, is contemplating also the Word who framed it, and through Him begins to apprehend the Father[fn-53-P5357_2101899:70-nf] .

Thus, if Isaiah says, `The Everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth[fn-53-P5362_2102940:75-nf] ;' and Susanna said, `O Everlasting God[fn-53-P5363_2102997:76-nf] ;' and Baruch wrote, `I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days,' and shortly after, `My hope is in the Everlasting, that He will save you, and joy is come unto me from the Holy One[fn-53-P5364_2103200:77-nf] ;' yet forasmuch as the Apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says, `Who being the radiance of His glory and the Expression of His Person[fn-53-P5365_2103355:78-nf] ;' and David too in the eighty-ninth Psalm, `And the brightness of the Lord be upon us,' and, `In Thy Light shall we see Light[fn-53-P5366_2103498:79-nf] ,' who has so little sense as to doubt of the eternity of the Son[fn-53-P5367_2103595:80-nf] ? for when did man see light without the brightness of its radiance, that he may say of the Son, `There was once, when He was not,' or `Before His generation He was not.' And the words addressed to the Son in the hundred and forty-fourth Psalm, `Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages[fn-53-P5368_2103900:81-nf] ,' forbid any one to imagine any interval at all in which the Word did not exist.

And whereas the Lord Himself says, `I am the Truth[fn-53-P5370_2104791:83-nf] ,' not `I became the Truth;' but always, `I am,-I am the Shepherd,-I am the Light,'-and again, `Call ye Me not, Lord and Master? and ye call Me well, for so I am,' who, hearing such language from God, and the Wisdom, and Word of the Father, speaking of Himself, will any longer hesitate about the truth, and not forthwith believe that in the phrase `I am,' is signified that the Son is eternal and without beginning?","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":90,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"12.

It is plain then from the above that the Scriptures declare the Son's eternity; it is equally plain from what follows that the Arian phrases `He was not,' and `before' and `when,' are in the same Scriptures predicated of creatures. Moses, for instance, in his account of the generation of our system, says, `And every plant of the field, before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground[fn-53-P5372_2105783:84-nf] .' And in Deuteronomy, `When the Most High divided to the nations[fn-53-P5373_2105866:85-nf] .' And the Lord said in His own Person, `If ye loved Me, ye would rejoice because I said, I go unto the Father, for My Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it come to pass, that when it is come to pass, ye might believe[fn-53-P5374_2106128:86-nf] .' And concerning the creation He says by Solomon, `Or ever the earth was, when there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills. was I brought forth[fn-53-P5375_2106408:87-nf] .' And, `Before Abraham was, I am[fn-53-P5376_2106463:88-nf] .' And concerning Jeremiah He says,`Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee[fn-53-P5377_2106565:89-nf] .' And David in the Psalm says, `Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were made, Thou art, God from everlasting and world without end[fn-53-P5378_2106751:90-nf] .' And in Daniel, `Susanna cried out with a loud voice and said, O everlasting God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest all things before they be[fn-53-P5379_2106915:91-nf] .' Thus it appears that the phrases `once was not,' and `before it came to be,' and `when,' and the like, belong to things originate and creatures, which come out of nothing, but are alien to the Word. But if such terms are used in Scripture of things originate, but `ever' of the Word, it follows, O ye enemies of God, that the Son did not come out of nothing, nor is in the number of originated things at all, but is the Father's Image and Word eternal, never having not been, but being ever, as the, eternal Radiance[fn-53-P5380_2107455:92-nf] of a Light which is eternal. Why imagine then times before the Son? or wherefore blaspheme the Word as after times, by whom even the ages were made? for how did time or age at all subsist when the Word, as you say, had not appeared, `through' whom `all things have been made and without' whom `not one thing was made[fn-53-P5381_2107798:93-nf] ?' Or why, when you mean time, do you not plainly say, `a time was when the Word was not?' But while you drop the word `time' to deceive the simple, you do not at all conceal your own feeling, nor, even if you did, could you escape discovery. For you still simply mean times, when you say, `There was when He was not,' and `He was not before His generation.'","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":90,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_80_letter_xi_for_339_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"11. For such meditation and exercise in godliness, being at all times the habit of the saints, is urgent on us at the present time, when the divine word desires us to keep the feast with them if we are in this disposition. For what else is the feast, but the constant worship of God, and the recognition of godliness, and unceasing prayers from the whole heart with agreement? So Paul wishing us to be ever in this disposition, commands, saying, `Rejoice evermore; pray without ceasing; in everything give thanks,[fn-93-P9381_3399022:74-nf] .' Not therefore separately, but unitedly and collectively, let us all keep the feast together, as the prophet exhorts, saying, `O come, let us rejoice in the Lord; let us make a joyful noise unto God our Saviour[fn-93-P9382_3399259:75-nf] .' Who then is so negligent, or who so disobedient to the divine voice, as not to leave everything, and run to the general and common assembly of the feast? which is not in one place only, for not one place alone keeps the feast; but `into all the earth their song has gone forth, and to the ends of the world their words.' And the sacrifice is not offered in one place, but `in every nation, incense and a pure sacrifice is offered unto God[fn-93-P9383_3399718:76-nf] .' So when in like manner from all in every place, praise and prayer shall ascend to the gracious and good Father, when the whole Catholic Church which is in every place, with gladness and rejoicing, celebrates together the same worship to God, when all men in common send up a song of praise and say, Amen[fn-93-P9384_3400054:77-nf] ; how blessed will it not be, my brethren! who will not, at that time, be engaged, praying rightly? For the walls of every adverse power, yea even of Jericho especially, failing down, and the gift[fn-93-P9385_3400306:78-nf] of the Holy Spirit being then richly poured upon all men, every man perceiving the coming of the Spirit shall say, `We are all filled in the morning with Thy favour, and we rejoice and are made glad in our days[fn-93-P9386_3400595:79-nf] .'","title":"Letter XI.

There is also another form of His divine presence unknown to mortal senses, of which He likewise says, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-25-P2583_1523284:2-nf] This, at least, is not the same as \"yet a little while I am with you;\" for it is not a little while until the end of the world. Or if even this is so (for time flies, and a thousand years are in God's sight as one day, or as a watch in the night,)[fn-25-P2584_1523553:3-nf] yet we cannot believe that He intended any such meaning on this occasion, especially as He went on to say, \"Ye shall seek me, and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come.\" That is to say, after this little while that I am with you, \"ye shall seek me, and whither I go, ye cannot come.\" Is it after the end of the world that, whither He goes, they will not be able to come?
