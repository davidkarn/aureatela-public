{"verses":["To David himself, understanding.  Blessed are they whose\niniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.","Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin, and in\nwhose spirit there is no guile.","Because I was silent my bones grew old; whilst I cried out all\nthe day long.","For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me:  I am turned in my\nanguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.","I have acknowledged my sin to thee, and my injustice I have not\nconcealed.  I said I will confess against my self my injustice to the\nLord:  and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.","For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee in a\nseasonable time.  And yet in a flood of many waters, they shall not come\nnigh unto him.","Thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me:  my\njoy, deliver me from them that surround me.","I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this\nway, in which thou shalt go:  I will fix my eyes upon thee.","Do not become like the horse and the mule, who have no\nunderstanding.  With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, who come not\nnear unto thee.","Many are the scourges of the sinner, but mercy shall encompass\nhim that hopeth in the Lord.","Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just, and glory, all ye\nright of heart."]}
