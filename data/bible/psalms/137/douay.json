{"verses":["For David himself.  I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole\nheart:  for thou hast heard the words of my mouth.  I will sing praise to\nthee in the sight of the angels:","I will worship towards thy holy temple, and I will give glory to\nthy name.  For thy mercy, and for thy truth:  for thou hast magnified thy\nholy name above all.","In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear me:  thou shalt\nmultiply strength in my soul.","May all the kings of the earth give glory to thee:  for they have\nheard all the words of thy mouth.","And let them sing in the ways of the Lord:  for great is the\nglory of the Lord.","For the Lord is high, and looketh on the low:  and the high he\nknoweth afar off.","If I shall walk in the midst of tribulation, thou wilt quicken\nme:  and thou hast stretched forth thy hand against the wrath of my\nenemies:  and thy right hand hath saved me.","The Lord will repay for me:  thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for\never:  O despise not the works of thy hands."]}
