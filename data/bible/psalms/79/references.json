But godly confidence is not appalled by so ill-omened a circumstance; for the faithful bear in mind that assurance has been given that not a hair of their head shall perish, and that, therefore, though they even be devoured by beasts, their blessed resurrection will not hereby be hindered. The Truth would nowise have said, \"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul,\"[fn-2-P274_76108:35-nf] if anything whatever that an enemy could do to the body of the slain could be detrimental to the future life. Or will some one perhaps take so absurd a position as to contend that those who kill the body are not to be feared before death, and lest they kill the body, but after death, lest they deprive it of burial? If this be so, then that is false which Christ says, \"Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do;\"[fn-2-P275_76586:36-nf] for it seems they can do great injury to the dead body. Far be it from us to suppose that the Truth can be thus false. They who kill the body are said \"to do something,\" because the deathblow is felt, the body still having sensation; but after that, they have no more that they can do, for in the slain body there is no sensation. And so there are indeed many bodies of Christians lying unburied; but no one has separated them from heaven, nor froth that earth which is all filled with the presence of Him who knows whence He will raise again what He created. It is said, indeed, in the Psalm: \"The dead bodies of Thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of Thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.\"[fn-2-P276_77438:37-nf] But this was said rather to exhibit the cruelty of those who did these things, than the misery of those who suffered them. To the eyes of men this appears a harsh and doleful lot, yet \"precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.\"[fn-2-P277_77709:38-nf] Wherefore all these last offices and ceremonies that concern the dead, the careful funeral arrangements, and the equipment of the tomb, and the pomp of obsequies, are rather the solace of the living than the comfort of the dead. If a costly burial does any good to a wicked man, a squalid burial, or none at all, may harm the godly. His crowd of domestics furnished the purple-clad Dives with a funeral gorgeous in the eye of man; but in the sight of God that was a more sumptuous funeral which the ulcerous pauper received at the hands of the angels, who did not carry him out to a marble tomb, but bore him aloft to Abraham's bosom.","title":"Book I","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":79,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1112","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"19.

Down to the very day of her death two things were conspicuous in her life, one her great patience and the other the jealousy which was manifested towards her.

But now, perhaps, you also demand of me as a debt that which, previous to the promise which I made, I was under no obligation to give, namely, that I should not count it burdensome to unfold some sort of example of the discourse intended, and to set it before you for your study, just as if I were myself engaged in catechising some individual. Before I do that, however, I wish you to keep in mind the fact that the mental effort is of one kind in the case of a person who dictates, with a future reader in his view, and that it is of quite another kind in the case of a person who speaks with a present hearer to whom to direct his attention. And further, it is to be remembered that, in this latter instance in particular, the effort is of one kind when one is admonishing in private, and when there is no other person at hand to pronounce judgment on us; whereas it is of a different order when one is conveying any instruction in public, and when there stands around him an audience of persons holding dissimilar opinions; and again, that in this exercise of teaching, the effort will be of one sort when only a single individual is being instructed, while all the rest listen, like persons judging or attesting things well known to them, and that it will be different when all those who are present wait for what we have to deliver to them; and once more, that, in this same instance, the effort will be one thing when all are seated, as it were, in private conference with a view to engaging in some discussion, and that it will be quite another thing when the people sit silent and intent on giving their attention to some single speaker who is to address them from a higher position. It will likewise make a considerable difference, even when we are discoursing in that style, whether there are few present or many, whether they are learned or unlearned, or made up of both classes combined; whether they are city-bred or rustics, or both the one and the other together; or whether, again, they are a people composed of all orders of men in due proportion. For it is impossible but that they will affect in different ways the person who has to speak to them and discourse with them, and that the address which is delivered will both bear certain features, as it were, expressive of the feelings of the mind from which it proceeds, and also influence the hearers in different ways, in accordance with that same difference (in the speaker's disposition), while at the same time the hearers themselves will influence one another in different ways by the simple force of their presence with each other. But as we are dealing at present with the matter of the instruction of the unlearned, I am a witness to you, as regards my own experience, that I find myself variously moved, according as I see before me, for the purposes of catechetical instruction, a highly educated man, a dull fellow, a citizen, a foreigner, a rich man, a poor man, a private individual, a man of honors, a person occupying some position of authority, an individual of this or the other nation, of this or the other age or sex, one proceeding from this or the other sect, from this or the other common error,-and ever in accordance with the difference of my feelings does my discourse itself at once set out, go on, and reach its end. And inasmuch as, although the same charity is due to all, yet the same medicine is not to be administered to all, in like manner charity itself travails with some, is made weak together with others; is at pains to edify some, tremblingly apprehends being an offense to others; bends to some, lifts itself erect to others; is gentle to some, severe to others; to none an enemy, to all a mother. And when one, who has not gone through the kind of experience to which I refer in the same spirit of charity, sees us attaining, in virtue of some gift which has been conferred upon us, and which carries the power of pleasing, a certain repute of an eulogistic nature in the mouth of the multitude, he counts us happy on that account.

For you hold that God is confined not only in trees and plants, or in the human body, but also in the flesh of animals, which contaminates Him with its impurity. And how can your soul give praise to God, when you actually reproach Him by calling your soul a particle of His substance taken captive by the race of darkness; as if God could not maintain the conflict except by this corruption of His members, and this dishonorable captivity? Instead of honoring God in your prayers, you insult Him. For what sin did you commit, when you belonged to Him, that you should be thus punished by the god you cry to, not because you left Him sinfully of your own: choice; for he himself gave you to His enemies, to obtain peace for His kingdom? You are not even given as hostages to be honorably guarded. Nor is it as when a shepherd lays a snare to catch a wild beast: for he does not put one of his own members in the snare, but some animal from his flock; and generally, so that the wild beast is caught before the animal is hurt. You, though you are the members of your god, are given to the enemy, whose ferocity you keep off from your god only by being contaminated with their impurity, infected with their corruptions, without any fault of your own. You cannot in your prayers use the words: \"Free us, O Lord, for the glory of Thy name; and for Thy name's sake pardon our sins.\"[fn-19-P1949_1126690:11-nf] Your prayer is: \"Free us by Thy skill, for we suffer here oppression, and torture, and pollution, only that Thou mayest mourn unmolested in Thy kingdom.\" These are words of reproach, not of entreaty.

If it is the race of darkness, you do not forgive their debts, but make them be utterly cast out and shut up in eternal imprisonment. And how can God forgive your debts, when He rather sinned against you by sending you into such a state, than you against Him, whom you obeyed by going? If this was not a sin in Him, because He was compelled to do it, this excuse must apply you, now that you have been overthrown in the conflict, more than to Him before the conflict began. You suffer now from the mixture of evil, which was not the case with Him when nevertheless He was compelled to send you. So either He requires that you should forgive Him his debt; or, if He is not in debt to you, still less are you to Him.

Or are the disturbances and changes of the universe, (which was originally constituted, blended, bound together, and set in motion in a harmony known only to Him Who gave it motion,) directed by reason and order under the guidance of the reins of Providence? Whence come famines and tornadoes and hailstorms, our present warning blow? Whence pestilences, diseases, earthquakes, tidal waves, and fearful things in the heavens? And how is the creation, once ordered for the enjoyment of men, their common and equal delight, changed for the punishment of the ungodly, in order that we may be chastised through that for which, when honoured with it, we did not give thanks, and recognise in our sufferings that power which we did not recognise in our benefits? How is it that some receive at the Lord's hand double for their sins,[fn-37-P3754_1090584:29-nf] and the measure of their wickedness is doubly filled up, as in the correction of Israel, while the sins of others are done away by a sevenfold recompense into their bosom?[fn-37-P3755_1090774:30-nf] What is the measure of the Amorites that is not yet full?[fn-37-P3756_1090852:31-nf] And how is the sinner either let go, or chastised again, let go perhaps, because reserved for the other world, chastised, because healed thereby in this? Under what circumstances again is the righteous, when unfortunate, possibly being put to the test, or, when prosperous, being observed, to see if he be poor in mind or not very far superior to visible things, as indeed conscience, our interior and unerring tribunal, tells us. What is our calamity, and what its cause? Is it a test of virtue, or a touchstone of wickedness? And is it better to bow beneath it as a chastisement, even though it be not so, and humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God,[fn-37-P3757_1091529:32-nf] or, considering it as a trial, to rise superior to it? On these points give us instruction and warning, lest we be too much discouraged by our present calamity, or fall into the gulf of evil and despise it; for some such feeling is very general; but rather that we may bear our admonition quietly, and not provoke one more severe by our insensibility to this.","title":"Oration XVI.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":79,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_38_oration_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"12. Far be it from me that I should ever, among other chastisements, be thus reproached by Him Who is good, but walks contrary to me in fury[fn-38-P3802_1102176:70-nf] because of my own contrariness: I have smitten you with blasting and mildew, and blight;[fn-38-P3803_1102284:71-nf] without result. The sword from without[fn-38-P3804_1102347:72-nf] made you childless, yet have ye not returned unto Me, saith the Lord. May I not become the vine of the beloved, which after being planted and entrenched, and made sure with a fence and tower and every means which was possible, when it ran wild and bore thorns, was consequently despised, and had its tower broken down and its fence taken away, and was not pruned nor digged, but was devoured and laid waste and trodden down by all![fn-38-P3805_1102817:73-nf] This is what I feel I must say as to my fears, thus have I been pained by this blow, and this, I will further tell you, is my prayer.

If Thou shut the heaven, who will open it? And if Thou let loose Thy torrents, who will restrain them?

Thou art angry, and we have sinned,[fn-38-P3810_1104330:78-nf] says one of old, making confession; and it is now time for me to say the opposite, \"We have sinned, and Thou art angry:\" therefore have we become a reproach to our neighbours.[fn-38-P3811_1104525:79-nf] Thou didst turn Thy face from us, and we were filled with dishonour. But stay, Lord, cease, Lord, forgive, Lord, deliver us not up for ever because of our iniquities, and let not our chastisements be a warning for others, when we might learn wisdom from the trials of others. Of whom? Of the nations which know Thee not, and kingdoms which have not been subject to Thy power.

For Daniel said:-I was considering the ten horns that were upon the head of the\nbeast. Far the ten horns were ten kings[fn-41-P4119_1371182:61-nf] who arose at that time until Antiochus. And\nhesaid:-A little horn arose from between those ten and three fell before it.[fn-41-P4120_1371325:62-nf] For when Antiochus arose in the kingdom, he\nhumbled three kings, and he exalted himself against the saints of the Most High and against\nJerusalem. And he defiled the sanctuary.[fn-41-P4121_1371520:63-nf]\nAnd he caused the sacrifice and the offerings to cease for a week and half a week, namely, for test\nand a-half years. And he brought in fornicators into the house of the Lord, and he caused the\nobservances of the Law to cease.[fn-41-P4122_1371769:64-nf] And he\nslew righteous men and gave them to the birds of heaven and to the beasts of the earth. For in his\ndays was fulfilled the word that David spoke:[fn-41-P4123_1371940:65-nf] -O God, the Gentiles have come into thine\ninheritance, and have defiled Thy holy temple. They have made Jerusalem desolate. They have given the\ndead bodies of Thy servants as food to the birds of heaven, and the flesh of Thy righteous ones to\nthe beasts of the earth. They have poured out their blood like water round about Jerusalem, and there\nis none to bury them. For this was accomplished at that time, when the venerable and aged Eleazar\nwas slain, and the sons of the blessed Samuna, seven in number,[fn-41-P4124_1372468:66-nf] and when Judas (Maccabeus) and his brethren were\nstruggling on behalf of their people, when they were dwelling in hiding-places.[fn-41-P4125_1372626:67-nf] At that time the horn made war with the\nsaints,[fn-41-P4126_1372693:68-nf] and their power prevailed. And\nthe wicked Antiochus spake wards against the Most High, and change the times and the\nseasons.[fn-41-P4127_1372837:69-nf] And he made to cease the\ncovenant of Abraham, and abolished the Sabbath of rest.[fn-41-P4128_1372937:70-nf] For he commanded the Jews that they should not\ncircumcise. Therefore, (the Prophet) said concerning him;-He shall think to change the times and\nthe seasons and the laws, and they were given into his hand for a time, times, and half a\ntime.[fn-41-P4129_1373202:71-nf] Now the time and half a time is\nthe week and a half, which is ten years and a half. Again he said:-The judgment was set and they\ntook away his authority from him, to injure and destroy him until the end of the kingdom.[fn-41-P4130_1373440:72-nf] For the judgment came upon Antiochus, a judgment\nfrom heaven;[fn-41-P4131_1373520:73-nf] and he became sick with a\ngrievous and evil sickness, and on account of the smell of him as he rotted, no man could approach\nhim, for worms were crawling and falling from him and eating his flesh because he oppressed the\nworm Jacob.[fn-41-P4132_1373776:74-nf] And his flesh rotted in\nhis lifetime, because he caused the dead bodies of the sons of Jerusalem to rot and they were not\nburied.

And he\nprayed and was not heard,[fn-41-P4133_1374041:75-nf] because he did\nnot hearken to the groanings of the righteous whom he slew.

As to the honour paid to Seven there are many testimonies, but we will be content with a few out of the many. For instance, seven precious spirits are named; for I think Isaiah[fn-53-P5359_1785494:7-nf] loves to call the activities of the Spirit spirits; and the Oracles of the Lord are purified seven times according to David,[fn-53-P5360_1785634:8-nf] and the just is delivered from six troubles and in the seventh is not smitten.[fn-53-P5361_1785728:9-nf] But the sinner is pardoned not seven times, but seventy times seven.[fn-53-P5362_1785812:10-nf] And we may see it by the contrary also (for the punishment of wickedness is to be praised), Cain being avenged seven times, that is, punishment being exacted from him for his fratricide, and Lamech seventy times seven,[fn-53-P5363_1786053:11-nf] because he was a murderer after the law and the condemnation.[fn-53-P5364_1786133:12-nf] And wicked neighbours receive sevenfold into their bosom;[fn-53-P5365_1789533:13-nf] and the House of Wisdom rests on seven pillars[fn-53-P5366_1789600:14-nf] and the Stone of Zerubbabel is adorned with seven eyes;[fn-53-P5367_1789674:15-nf] and God is praised seven times a day.[fn-53-P5368_1789732:16-nf] And again the barren beareth seven,[fn-53-P5369_1789788:17-nf] the perfect number, she who is contrasted with her who is imperfect in her children.\"[fn-53-P5370_1789893:18-nf] ","title":"Oration XLI.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":79,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_253_letter_ccxxxv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"3. Let them tell me in what sense Paul says, \"Now we know in part\";[fn-54-P5475_1725560:4-nf] do we know His essence in part, as knowing parts of His essence?

How then \"When that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\"[fn-54-P5476_1725818:5-nf] Why are idolaters found fault with? Is it not because they knew God and did not honour Him as God?

But, I repeat, knowledge is manifold-it involves perception of our Creator, recognition of His wonderful works, observance of His commandments and intimate communion with Him. All this they thrust on one side and force knowledge into one single meaning, the contemplation of God's essence. Thou shall put them, it is said, before the testimony and I shall be known of thee thence.[fn-54-P5482_1727073:11-nf] Is the term, \"I shall be known of thee,\" instead of, \"I will reveal my essence\"? \"The Lord knoweth them that are his.\"[fn-54-P5483_1727305:12-nf] Does He know the essence of them that are His, but is ignorant of the essence of those who disobey Him ? \"Adam knew his wife.\"[fn-54-P5484_1727452:13-nf] Did he know her essence?

Does Mary mean \"I do not know the essence of any man\" ? Is it not the custom of Scripture to use the word \"know\" of nuptial embraces?
