{"verses":["Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, a testimony for\nAsaph, a psalm.","Give ear, O thou that rulest Israel:  thou that leadest Joseph\nlike a sheep.  Thou that sittest upon the cherubims, shine forth","Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses.  Stir up thy might, and\ncome to save us.","Convert us, O God:  and shew us thy face, and we shall be saved.","O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the\nprayer of thy servant?","How long wilt thou feed us with the bread of tears:  and give us\nfor our drink tears in measure?","Thou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours:  and\nour enemies have scoffed at us.","O God of hosts, convert us:  and shew thy face, and we shall be\nsaved.","Thou hast brought a vineyard out of Egypt:  thou hast cast out the\nGentiles and planted it.","Thou wast the guide of its journey in its sight:  thou plantedst\nthe roots thereof, and it filled the land.","The shadow of it covered the hills:  and the branches thereof the\ncedars of God.","It stretched forth its branches unto the sea, and its boughs\nunto the river.","Why hast thou broken down the hedge thereof, so that all they\nwho pass by the way do pluck it?","The boar out of the wood hath laid it waste:  and a singular wild\nbeast hath devoured it.","Turn again, O God of hosts, look down from heaven, and see, and\nvisit this vineyard:","And perfect the same which thy right hand hath planted:  and upon\nthe son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.","Things set on fire and dug down shall perish at the rebuke of\nthy countenance.","Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand:  and upon the son\nof man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.","And we depart not from thee, thou shalt quicken us:  and we will\ncall upon thy name.","O Lord God of hosts, convert us and shew thy face, and we shall\nbe saved."]}
