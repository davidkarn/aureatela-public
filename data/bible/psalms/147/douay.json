{"verses":["Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem:  praise thy God, O Sion.","Because he hath strengthened the bolts of thy gates, he hath\nblessed thy children within thee.","Who hath placed peace in thy borders:  and filleth thee with the\nfat of corn.","Who sendeth forth his speech to the earth:  his word runneth\nswiftly.","Who giveth snow like wool:  scattereth mists like ashes.","He sendeth his crystal like morsels:  who shall stand before the\nface of his cold?","He shall send out his word, and shall melt them:  his wind shall\nblow, and the waters shall run.","Who declareth his word to Jacob:  his justices and his judgments\nto Israel.","He hath not done in like manner to every nation:  and his\njudgments he hath not made manifest to them.  Alleluia."]}
