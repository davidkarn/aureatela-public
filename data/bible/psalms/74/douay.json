{"verses":["Unto the end, corrupt not, a psalm of a canticle for Asaph.","We will praise thee, O God:  we will praise, and we will call upon\nthy name.  We will relate thy wondrous works:","When I shall take a time, I will judge justices.","The earth is melted, and all that dwell therein:  I have\nestablished the pillars thereof.","I said to the wicked:  Do not act wickedly:  and to the sinners:\nLift not up the horn.","Lift not up your horn on high:  speak not iniquity against God.","For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert\nhills:","For God is the judge.  One he putteth down, and another he lifteth\nup:","For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of\nmixture.  And he hath poured it out from this to that:  but the dregs\nthereof are not emptied:  all the sinners of the earth shall drink.","But I will declare for ever:  I will sing to the God of Jacob.","And I will break all the horns of sinners:  but the horns of the\njust shall be exalted."]}
