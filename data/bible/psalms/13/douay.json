{"verses":["Unto the end, a psalm for David.  The fool hath said in his heart:\nThere is no God.  They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their\nways:  there is none that doth good, no not one.","The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men,\nto see if there be any that understand and seek God.","They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together:\nthere is none that doth good:  no not one.  Their throat is an open\nsepulchre; with their tongues they acted deceitfully:  the poison of\nasps is under their lips.  Their mouth is full of cursing and\nbitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood.  Destruction and\nunhappiness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known:\nthere is no fear of God before their eyes.","Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people\nas they eat bread?","They have not called upon the Lord:  there have they trembled for\nfear, where there was no fear.","For the Lord is in the just generation:  you have confounded the\ncounsel of the poor man; but the Lord is his hope.","Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel?  when the Lord\nshall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall\nrejoice, and Israel shall be glad."]}
