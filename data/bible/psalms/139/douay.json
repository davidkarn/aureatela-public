{"verses":["Unto the end, a psalm of David.","Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man:  rescue me from the unjust\nman.","Who have devised iniquities in their hearts:  all the day long\nthey designed battles.","They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent:  the venom of\nasps is under their lips.","Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the wicked:  and from unjust\nmen deliver me.  Who have proposed to supplant my steps:","The proud have hidden a net for me.  And they have stretched out\ncords for a snare:  they have laid for me a stumblingblock by the\nwayside.","I said to the Lord:  Thou art my God:  hear, O Lord, the voice of\nmy supplication.","O Lord, Lord, the strength of my salvation:  thou hast\novershadowed my head in the day of battle.","Give me not up, O Lord, from my desire to the wicked:  they have\nplotted against me; do not thou forsake me, lest they should triumph.","The head of them compassing me about:  the labour of their lips\nshall overwhelm them.","Burning coals shall fall upon them; thou wilt cast them down\ninto the fire:  in miseries they shall not be able to stand.","A man full of tongue shall not be established in the earth:\nevil shall catch the unjust man unto destruction.","I know that the Lord will do justice to the needy, and will\nrevenge the poor.","But as for the just, they shall give glory to thy name:  and the\nupright shall dwell with thy countenance."]}
