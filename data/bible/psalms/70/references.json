Just as my Christ is to be expected,[fn-75-P7561_2166421:390-nf] who was predicted from the beginning, so his Christ therefore has no existence, as not having been announced from the beginning. Ours is a better faith, which believes in a future Christ, than the heretic's, which has none at all to believe in. Touching the resurrection of the dead,[fn-75-P7562_2166833:391-nf] let us first inquire how some persons then denied it. No doubt in the same way in which it is even now denied, since the resurrection of the flesh has at all times men to deny it. But many wise men claim for the soul a divine nature, and are confident of its undying destiny, and even the multitude worship the dead[fn-75-P7563_2167171:392-nf] in the presumption which they boldly entertain that their souls survive. As for our bodies, however, it is manifest that they perish either at once by fire or the wild beasts,[fn-75-P7564_2167409:393-nf] or even when most carefully kept by length of time. When, therefore, the apostle refutes those who deny the resurrection of the flesh, he indeed defends, in opposition to them, the precise matter of their denial, that is, the resurrection of the body. You have the whole answer wrapped up in this.[fn-75-P7565_2167752:394-nf] All the rest is superfluous. Now in this very point, which is called the resurrection of the dead, it is requisite that the proper force of the words should be accurately maintained.[fn-75-P7566_2167953:395-nf] The word dead expresses simply what has lost the vital principle,[fn-75-P7567_2168035:396-nf] by means of which it used to live. Now the body is that which loses life, and as the result of losing it becomes dead. To the body, therefore, the term dead is only suitable. Moreover, as resurrection accrues to what is dead, and dead is a term applicable only to a body, therefore the body alone has a resurrection incidental to it. So again the word Resurrection, or (rising again), embraces only that which has fallen down. \"To rise,\" indeed, can be predicated of that which has never fallen down, but had already been always lying down. But \"to rise again\" is predicable only of that which has fallen down; because it is by rising again, in consequence of its having fallen down, that it is said to have re-risen.[fn-75-P7568_2168768:397-nf] For the syllable RE always implies iteration (or happening again). We say, therefore, that the body falls to the ground by death, as indeed facts themselves show, in accordance with the law of God. For to the body it was said, (\"Till thou return to the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for) dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\"[fn-75-P7569_2169270:398-nf] That, therefore, which came from the ground shall return to the ground. Now that falls down which returns to the ground; and that rises again which falls down. \"Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection.\"[fn-75-P7570_2169592:399-nf] Here in the word man, who consists of bodily sub stance, as we have often shown already, is presented to me the body of Christ. But if we are all so made alive in Christ, as we die in Adam, it follows of necessity that we are made alive in Christ as a bodily substance, since we died in Adam as a bodily substance. The similarity, indeed, is not complete, unless our revival[fn-75-P7571_2169989:400-nf] in Christ concur in identity of substance with our mortality[fn-75-P7572_2170071:401-nf] in Adam. But at this point[fn-75-P7573_2170119:402-nf] (the apostle) has made a parenthetical statement[fn-75-P7574_2170182:403-nf] concerning Christ, which, bearing as it does on our present discussion, must not pass unnoticed. For the resurrection of the body will receive all the better proof, in proportion as I shall succeed in showing that Christ belongs to that God who is believed to have provided this resurrection of the flesh in His dispensation. When he says, \"For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet,\"[fn-75-P7575_2170616:404-nf] we can see at once[fn-75-P7576_2170661:405-nf] from this statement that he speaks of a God of vengeance, and therefore of Him who made the following promise to Christ: \"Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. The rod of Thy strength shall the Lord send forth from Sion, and He shall rule along with Thee in the midst of Thine enemies.\"[fn-75-P7577_2170998:406-nf] It is necessary for me to lay claim to those Scriptures which the Jews endeavour to deprive us of, and to show that they sustain my view. Now they say that this Psalm[fn-75-P7578_2171199:407-nf] was a chant in honour of Hezekiah,[fn-75-P7579_2171249:408-nf] because \"he went up to the house of the Lord,\"[fn-75-P7580_2171326:409-nf] and God turned back and removed his enemies. Therefore, (as they further hold, ) those other words, \"Before the morning star did I beget thee from the womb,\"[fn-75-P7581_2171627:410-nf] are applicable to Hezekiah, and to the birth of Hezekiah. We on our side[fn-75-P7582_2173635:411-nf] have published Gospels (to the credibility of which we have to thank[fn-75-P7583_2173716:412-nf] them[fn-75-P7584_2173737:413-nf] for having given some confirmation, indeed, already in so great a subject[fn-75-P7585_2173854:414-nf] ); and these declare that the Lord was born at night, that so it might be \"before the morning star,\" as is evident both from the star especially, and from the testimony of the angel, who at night announced to the shepherds that Christ had at that moment been born,[fn-75-P7586_2174153:415-nf] and again from the place of the birth, for it is towards night that persons arrive at the (eastern)\" inn.\" Perhaps, too, there was a mystic purpose in Christ's being born at night, destined, as He was, to be the light of the truth amidst the dark shadows of ignorance. Nor, again, would God have said, \"I have begotten Thee,\" except to His true Son. For although He says of all the people (Israel), \"I have begotten[fn-75-P7587_2174600:416-nf] children,\"[fn-75-P7588_2174646:417-nf] yet He added not \"from the womb.\" Now, why should He have added so superfluously this phrase \"from the womb\" (as if there could be any doubt about any one's having been born from the womb), unless the Holy Ghost had wished the words to be with especial care[fn-75-P7589_2174922:418-nf] understood of Christ? \"I have begotten Thee from the womb,\" that is to say, from a womb only, without a man's seed, making it a condition of a fleshly body[fn-75-P7590_2175096:419-nf] that it should come out of a womb. What is here added (in the Psalm), \"Thou art a priest for ever,\"[fn-75-P7591_2175244:420-nf] relates to (Christ) Himself. Hezekiah was no priest; and even if he had been one, he would not have been a priest for ever. \"After the order,\" says He, \"of Melchizedek.\" Now what had Hezekiah to do with Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God, and him uncircumcised too, who blessed the circumcised Abraham, after receiving from him the offering of tithes? To Christ, however, \"the order of Melchizedek\" will be very suitable; for Christ is the proper and legitimate High Priest of God. He is the Pontiff of the priesthood of the uncircumcision, constituted such, even then, for the Gentiles, by whom He was to be more fully received, although at His last coming He will favour with His acceptance and blessing the circumcision also, even the race of Abraham, which by and by is to acknowledge Him. Well, then, there is also another Psalm, which begins with these words: \"Give Thy judgments, O God, to the King,\" that is, to Christ who was to come as King, \"and Thy righteousness unto the King's son,\"[fn-75-P7592_2176269:421-nf] that is, to Christ's people; for His sons are they who are born again in Him. But it will here be said that this Psalm has reference to Solomon. However, will not those portions of the Psalm which apply to Christ alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ, and not to Solomon? \"He shall come down,\" says He, \"like rain upon a fleece,[fn-75-P7593_2176653:422-nf] and like dropping showers upon the earth,\"[fn-75-P7594_2176740:423-nf] describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as gentle and unobserved.[fn-75-P7595_2176835:424-nf] Solomon, however, if he had indeed any descent at all, came not down like a shower, because he descended not from heaven. But I will set before you more literal points.[fn-75-P7596_2177230:425-nf] \"He shall have dominion,\" says the Psalmist, \"from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"[fn-75-P7597_2177361:426-nf] To Christ alone was this given; whilst Solomon reigned over only the moderately-sized kingdom of Judah. \"Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him.\" Whom, indeed, shall they all thus worship, except Christ? \"All nations shall serve Him.\"[fn-75-P7598_2177618:427-nf] To whom shall all thus do homage, but Christ? \"His name shall endure for ever.\" Whose name has this eternity of fame, but Christ's? \"Longer than the sun shall His name remain,\" for longer than the sun shall be the Word of God, even Christ. \"And in Him shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-75-P7599_2177921:428-nf] In Solomon was no nation blessed; in Christ every nation. And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even God? \"They shall call Him blessed.\"[fn-76-P7600_2178079:429-nf] (On what ground? ) Because blessed Is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful things.\"[fn-76-P7601_2178195:430-nf] \"Blessed also is His glorious name, and with His glory shall all the earth be filled.\"[fn-76-P7602_2178302:431-nf] On the contrary, Solomon (as I make bold to affirm) lost even the glory which he had from God, seduced by his love of women even into idolatry. And thus, the statement which occurs in about the middle of this Psalm, \"His enemies shall lick the dust\"[fn-76-P7603_2178572:432-nf] (of course, as having been, (to use the apostle's phrase, ) \"put under His feet\"[fn-76-P7604_2178672:433-nf] ), will bear upon the very object which I had in view, when I both introduced the Psalm, and insisted on my opinion of its sense,-namely, that I might demonstrate both the glory of His kingdom and the subjection of His enemies in pursuance of the Creator's own plans, with the view of laying down[fn-76-P7605_2178995:434-nf] this conclusion, that none but He can be believed to be the Christ of the Creator.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":70,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Meanwhile the Marcionite will exhibit nothing of this kind; he is by this time afraid to say which side has the better right to a Christ who is not yet revealed.

Now they say that this Psalm[fn-75-P7578_2171199:407-nf] was a chant in honour of Hezekiah,[fn-75-P7579_2171249:408-nf] because \"he went up to the house of the Lord,\"[fn-75-P7580_2171326:409-nf] and God turned back and removed his enemies. Therefore, (as they further hold, ) those other words, \"Before the morning star did I beget thee from the womb,\"[fn-75-P7581_2171627:410-nf] are applicable to Hezekiah, and to the birth of Hezekiah. We on our side[fn-75-P7582_2173635:411-nf] have published Gospels (to the credibility of which we have to thank[fn-75-P7583_2173716:412-nf] them[fn-75-P7584_2173737:413-nf] for having given some confirmation, indeed, already in so great a subject[fn-75-P7585_2173854:414-nf] ); and these declare that the Lord was born at night, that so it might be \"before the morning star,\" as is evident both from the star especially, and from the testimony of the angel, who at night announced to the shepherds that Christ had at that moment been born,[fn-75-P7586_2174153:415-nf] and again from the place of the birth, for it is towards night that persons arrive at the (eastern)\" inn.\" Perhaps, too, there was a mystic purpose in Christ's being born at night, destined, as He was, to be the light of the truth amidst the dark shadows of ignorance. Nor, again, would God have said, \"I have begotten Thee,\" except to His true Son. For although He says of all the people (Israel), \"I have begotten[fn-75-P7587_2174600:416-nf] children,\"[fn-75-P7588_2174646:417-nf] yet He added not \"from the womb.\" Now, why should He have added so superfluously this phrase \"from the womb\" (as if there could be any doubt about any one's having been born from the womb), unless the Holy Ghost had wished the words to be with especial care[fn-75-P7589_2174922:418-nf] understood of Christ? \"I have begotten Thee from the womb,\" that is to say, from a womb only, without a man's seed, making it a condition of a fleshly body[fn-75-P7590_2175096:419-nf] that it should come out of a womb. What is here added (in the Psalm), \"Thou art a priest for ever,\"[fn-75-P7591_2175244:420-nf] relates to (Christ) Himself. Hezekiah was no priest; and even if he had been one, he would not have been a priest for ever. \"After the order,\" says He, \"of Melchizedek.\" Now what had Hezekiah to do with Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God, and him uncircumcised too, who blessed the circumcised Abraham, after receiving from him the offering of tithes? To Christ, however, \"the order of Melchizedek\" will be very suitable; for Christ is the proper and legitimate High Priest of God. He is the Pontiff of the priesthood of the uncircumcision, constituted such, even then, for the Gentiles, by whom He was to be more fully received, although at His last coming He will favour with His acceptance and blessing the circumcision also, even the race of Abraham, which by and by is to acknowledge Him. Well, then, there is also another Psalm, which begins with these words: \"Give Thy judgments, O God, to the King,\" that is, to Christ who was to come as King, \"and Thy righteousness unto the King's son,\"[fn-75-P7592_2176269:421-nf] that is, to Christ's people; for His sons are they who are born again in Him. But it will here be said that this Psalm has reference to Solomon. However, will not those portions of the Psalm which apply to Christ alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ, and not to Solomon? \"He shall come down,\" says He, \"like rain upon a fleece,[fn-75-P7593_2176653:422-nf] and like dropping showers upon the earth,\"[fn-75-P7594_2176740:423-nf] describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as gentle and unobserved.[fn-75-P7595_2176835:424-nf] Solomon, however, if he had indeed any descent at all, came not down like a shower, because he descended not from heaven. But I will set before you more literal points.[fn-75-P7596_2177230:425-nf] \"He shall have dominion,\" says the Psalmist, \"from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"[fn-75-P7597_2177361:426-nf] To Christ alone was this given; whilst Solomon reigned over only the moderately-sized kingdom of Judah. \"Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him.\" Whom, indeed, shall they all thus worship, except Christ? \"All nations shall serve Him.\"[fn-75-P7598_2177618:427-nf] To whom shall all thus do homage, but Christ? \"His name shall endure for ever.\" Whose name has this eternity of fame, but Christ's? \"Longer than the sun shall His name remain,\" for longer than the sun shall be the Word of God, even Christ. \"And in Him shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-75-P7599_2177921:428-nf] In Solomon was no nation blessed; in Christ every nation. And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even God? \"They shall call Him blessed.\"[fn-76-P7600_2178079:429-nf] (On what ground? ) Because blessed Is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful things.\"[fn-76-P7601_2178195:430-nf] \"Blessed also is His glorious name, and with His glory shall all the earth be filled.\"[fn-76-P7602_2178302:431-nf] On the contrary, Solomon (as I make bold to affirm) lost even the glory which he had from God, seduced by his love of women even into idolatry. And thus, the statement which occurs in about the middle of this Psalm, \"His enemies shall lick the dust\"[fn-76-P7603_2178572:432-nf] (of course, as having been, (to use the apostle's phrase, ) \"put under His feet\"[fn-76-P7604_2178672:433-nf] ), will bear upon the very object which I had in view, when I both introduced the Psalm, and insisted on my opinion of its sense,-namely, that I might demonstrate both the glory of His kingdom and the subjection of His enemies in pursuance of the Creator's own plans, with the view of laying down[fn-76-P7605_2178995:434-nf] this conclusion, that none but He can be believed to be the Christ of the Creator.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":70,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Meanwhile the Marcionite will exhibit nothing of this kind; he is by this time afraid to say which side has the better right to a Christ who is not yet revealed. Just as my Christ is to be expected,[fn-75-P7561_2166421:390-nf] who was predicted from the beginning, so his Christ therefore has no existence, as not having been announced from the beginning. Ours is a better faith, which believes in a future Christ, than the heretic's, which has none at all to believe in. Touching the resurrection of the dead,[fn-75-P7562_2166833:391-nf] let us first inquire how some persons then denied it. No doubt in the same way in which it is even now denied, since the resurrection of the flesh has at all times men to deny it. But many wise men claim for the soul a divine nature, and are confident of its undying destiny, and even the multitude worship the dead[fn-75-P7563_2167171:392-nf] in the presumption which they boldly entertain that their souls survive. As for our bodies, however, it is manifest that they perish either at once by fire or the wild beasts,[fn-75-P7564_2167409:393-nf] or even when most carefully kept by length of time. When, therefore, the apostle refutes those who deny the resurrection of the flesh, he indeed defends, in opposition to them, the precise matter of their denial, that is, the resurrection of the body. You have the whole answer wrapped up in this.[fn-75-P7565_2167752:394-nf] All the rest is superfluous. Now in this very point, which is called the resurrection of the dead, it is requisite that the proper force of the words should be accurately maintained.[fn-75-P7566_2167953:395-nf] The word dead expresses simply what has lost the vital principle,[fn-75-P7567_2168035:396-nf] by means of which it used to live. Now the body is that which loses life, and as the result of losing it becomes dead. To the body, therefore, the term dead is only suitable. Moreover, as resurrection accrues to what is dead, and dead is a term applicable only to a body, therefore the body alone has a resurrection incidental to it. So again the word Resurrection, or (rising again), embraces only that which has fallen down. \"To rise,\" indeed, can be predicated of that which has never fallen down, but had already been always lying down. But \"to rise again\" is predicable only of that which has fallen down; because it is by rising again, in consequence of its having fallen down, that it is said to have re-risen.[fn-75-P7568_2168768:397-nf] For the syllable RE always implies iteration (or happening again). We say, therefore, that the body falls to the ground by death, as indeed facts themselves show, in accordance with the law of God. For to the body it was said, (\"Till thou return to the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for) dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\"[fn-75-P7569_2169270:398-nf] That, therefore, which came from the ground shall return to the ground. Now that falls down which returns to the ground; and that rises again which falls down. \"Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection.\"[fn-75-P7570_2169592:399-nf] Here in the word man, who consists of bodily sub stance, as we have often shown already, is presented to me the body of Christ. But if we are all so made alive in Christ, as we die in Adam, it follows of necessity that we are made alive in Christ as a bodily substance, since we died in Adam as a bodily substance. The similarity, indeed, is not complete, unless our revival[fn-75-P7571_2169989:400-nf] in Christ concur in identity of substance with our mortality[fn-75-P7572_2170071:401-nf] in Adam. But at this point[fn-75-P7573_2170119:402-nf] (the apostle) has made a parenthetical statement[fn-75-P7574_2170182:403-nf] concerning Christ, which, bearing as it does on our present discussion, must not pass unnoticed. For the resurrection of the body will receive all the better proof, in proportion as I shall succeed in showing that Christ belongs to that God who is believed to have provided this resurrection of the flesh in His dispensation. When he says, \"For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet,\"[fn-75-P7575_2170616:404-nf] we can see at once[fn-75-P7576_2170661:405-nf] from this statement that he speaks of a God of vengeance, and therefore of Him who made the following promise to Christ: \"Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. The rod of Thy strength shall the Lord send forth from Sion, and He shall rule along with Thee in the midst of Thine enemies.\"[fn-75-P7577_2170998:406-nf] It is necessary for me to lay claim to those Scriptures which the Jews endeavour to deprive us of, and to show that they sustain my view.

We on our side[fn-75-P7582_2173635:411-nf] have published Gospels (to the credibility of which we have to thank[fn-75-P7583_2173716:412-nf] them[fn-75-P7584_2173737:413-nf] for having given some confirmation, indeed, already in so great a subject[fn-75-P7585_2173854:414-nf] ); and these declare that the Lord was born at night, that so it might be \"before the morning star,\" as is evident both from the star especially, and from the testimony of the angel, who at night announced to the shepherds that Christ had at that moment been born,[fn-75-P7586_2174153:415-nf] and again from the place of the birth, for it is towards night that persons arrive at the (eastern)\" inn.\" Perhaps, too, there was a mystic purpose in Christ's being born at night, destined, as He was, to be the light of the truth amidst the dark shadows of ignorance.

However, will not those portions of the Psalm which apply to Christ alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ, and not to Solomon? \"He shall come down,\" says He, \"like rain upon a fleece,[fn-75-P7593_2176653:422-nf] and like dropping showers upon the earth,\"[fn-75-P7594_2176740:423-nf] describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as gentle and unobserved.[fn-75-P7595_2176835:424-nf] Solomon, however, if he had indeed any descent at all, came not down like a shower, because he descended not from heaven. But I will set before you more literal points.[fn-75-P7596_2177230:425-nf] \"He shall have dominion,\" says the Psalmist, \"from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"[fn-75-P7597_2177361:426-nf] To Christ alone was this given; whilst Solomon reigned over only the moderately-sized kingdom of Judah. \"Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him.\" Whom, indeed, shall they all thus worship, except Christ? \"All nations shall serve Him.\"[fn-75-P7598_2177618:427-nf] To whom shall all thus do homage, but Christ? \"His name shall endure for ever.\" Whose name has this eternity of fame, but Christ's? \"Longer than the sun shall His name remain,\" for longer than the sun shall be the Word of God, even Christ. \"And in Him shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-75-P7599_2177921:428-nf] In Solomon was no nation blessed; in Christ every nation. And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even God? \"They shall call Him blessed.\"[fn-76-P7600_2178079:429-nf] (On what ground? ) Because blessed Is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful things.\"[fn-76-P7601_2178195:430-nf] \"Blessed also is His glorious name, and with His glory shall all the earth be filled.\"[fn-76-P7602_2178302:431-nf] On the contrary, Solomon (as I make bold to affirm) lost even the glory which he had from God, seduced by his love of women even into idolatry. And thus, the statement which occurs in about the middle of this Psalm, \"His enemies shall lick the dust\"[fn-76-P7603_2178572:432-nf] (of course, as having been, (to use the apostle's phrase, ) \"put under His feet\"[fn-76-P7604_2178672:433-nf] ), will bear upon the very object which I had in view, when I both introduced the Psalm, and insisted on my opinion of its sense,-namely, that I might demonstrate both the glory of His kingdom and the subjection of His enemies in pursuance of the Creator's own plans, with the view of laying down[fn-76-P7605_2178995:434-nf] this conclusion, that none but He can be believed to be the Christ of the Creator.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":70,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Meanwhile the Marcionite will exhibit nothing of this kind; he is by this time afraid to say which side has the better right to a Christ who is not yet revealed. Just as my Christ is to be expected,[fn-75-P7561_2166421:390-nf] who was predicted from the beginning, so his Christ therefore has no existence, as not having been announced from the beginning. Ours is a better faith, which believes in a future Christ, than the heretic's, which has none at all to believe in. Touching the resurrection of the dead,[fn-75-P7562_2166833:391-nf] let us first inquire how some persons then denied it. No doubt in the same way in which it is even now denied, since the resurrection of the flesh has at all times men to deny it. But many wise men claim for the soul a divine nature, and are confident of its undying destiny, and even the multitude worship the dead[fn-75-P7563_2167171:392-nf] in the presumption which they boldly entertain that their souls survive. As for our bodies, however, it is manifest that they perish either at once by fire or the wild beasts,[fn-75-P7564_2167409:393-nf] or even when most carefully kept by length of time. When, therefore, the apostle refutes those who deny the resurrection of the flesh, he indeed defends, in opposition to them, the precise matter of their denial, that is, the resurrection of the body. You have the whole answer wrapped up in this.[fn-75-P7565_2167752:394-nf] All the rest is superfluous. Now in this very point, which is called the resurrection of the dead, it is requisite that the proper force of the words should be accurately maintained.[fn-75-P7566_2167953:395-nf] The word dead expresses simply what has lost the vital principle,[fn-75-P7567_2168035:396-nf] by means of which it used to live. Now the body is that which loses life, and as the result of losing it becomes dead. To the body, therefore, the term dead is only suitable. Moreover, as resurrection accrues to what is dead, and dead is a term applicable only to a body, therefore the body alone has a resurrection incidental to it. So again the word Resurrection, or (rising again), embraces only that which has fallen down. \"To rise,\" indeed, can be predicated of that which has never fallen down, but had already been always lying down. But \"to rise again\" is predicable only of that which has fallen down; because it is by rising again, in consequence of its having fallen down, that it is said to have re-risen.[fn-75-P7568_2168768:397-nf] For the syllable RE always implies iteration (or happening again). We say, therefore, that the body falls to the ground by death, as indeed facts themselves show, in accordance with the law of God. For to the body it was said, (\"Till thou return to the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for) dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\"[fn-75-P7569_2169270:398-nf] That, therefore, which came from the ground shall return to the ground. Now that falls down which returns to the ground; and that rises again which falls down. \"Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection.\"[fn-75-P7570_2169592:399-nf] Here in the word man, who consists of bodily sub stance, as we have often shown already, is presented to me the body of Christ. But if we are all so made alive in Christ, as we die in Adam, it follows of necessity that we are made alive in Christ as a bodily substance, since we died in Adam as a bodily substance. The similarity, indeed, is not complete, unless our revival[fn-75-P7571_2169989:400-nf] in Christ concur in identity of substance with our mortality[fn-75-P7572_2170071:401-nf] in Adam. But at this point[fn-75-P7573_2170119:402-nf] (the apostle) has made a parenthetical statement[fn-75-P7574_2170182:403-nf] concerning Christ, which, bearing as it does on our present discussion, must not pass unnoticed. For the resurrection of the body will receive all the better proof, in proportion as I shall succeed in showing that Christ belongs to that God who is believed to have provided this resurrection of the flesh in His dispensation. When he says, \"For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet,\"[fn-75-P7575_2170616:404-nf] we can see at once[fn-75-P7576_2170661:405-nf] from this statement that he speaks of a God of vengeance, and therefore of Him who made the following promise to Christ: \"Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. The rod of Thy strength shall the Lord send forth from Sion, and He shall rule along with Thee in the midst of Thine enemies.\"[fn-75-P7577_2170998:406-nf] It is necessary for me to lay claim to those Scriptures which the Jews endeavour to deprive us of, and to show that they sustain my view. Now they say that this Psalm[fn-75-P7578_2171199:407-nf] was a chant in honour of Hezekiah,[fn-75-P7579_2171249:408-nf] because \"he went up to the house of the Lord,\"[fn-75-P7580_2171326:409-nf] and God turned back and removed his enemies. Therefore, (as they further hold, ) those other words, \"Before the morning star did I beget thee from the womb,\"[fn-75-P7581_2171627:410-nf] are applicable to Hezekiah, and to the birth of Hezekiah. We on our side[fn-75-P7582_2173635:411-nf] have published Gospels (to the credibility of which we have to thank[fn-75-P7583_2173716:412-nf] them[fn-75-P7584_2173737:413-nf] for having given some confirmation, indeed, already in so great a subject[fn-75-P7585_2173854:414-nf] ); and these declare that the Lord was born at night, that so it might be \"before the morning star,\" as is evident both from the star especially, and from the testimony of the angel, who at night announced to the shepherds that Christ had at that moment been born,[fn-75-P7586_2174153:415-nf] and again from the place of the birth, for it is towards night that persons arrive at the (eastern)\" inn.\" Perhaps, too, there was a mystic purpose in Christ's being born at night, destined, as He was, to be the light of the truth amidst the dark shadows of ignorance. Nor, again, would God have said, \"I have begotten Thee,\" except to His true Son. For although He says of all the people (Israel), \"I have begotten[fn-75-P7587_2174600:416-nf] children,\"[fn-75-P7588_2174646:417-nf] yet He added not \"from the womb.\" Now, why should He have added so superfluously this phrase \"from the womb\" (as if there could be any doubt about any one's having been born from the womb), unless the Holy Ghost had wished the words to be with especial care[fn-75-P7589_2174922:418-nf] understood of Christ? \"I have begotten Thee from the womb,\" that is to say, from a womb only, without a man's seed, making it a condition of a fleshly body[fn-75-P7590_2175096:419-nf] that it should come out of a womb. What is here added (in the Psalm), \"Thou art a priest for ever,\"[fn-75-P7591_2175244:420-nf] relates to (Christ) Himself. Hezekiah was no priest; and even if he had been one, he would not have been a priest for ever. \"After the order,\" says He, \"of Melchizedek.\" Now what had Hezekiah to do with Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God, and him uncircumcised too, who blessed the circumcised Abraham, after receiving from him the offering of tithes? To Christ, however, \"the order of Melchizedek\" will be very suitable; for Christ is the proper and legitimate High Priest of God. He is the Pontiff of the priesthood of the uncircumcision, constituted such, even then, for the Gentiles, by whom He was to be more fully received, although at His last coming He will favour with His acceptance and blessing the circumcision also, even the race of Abraham, which by and by is to acknowledge Him. Well, then, there is also another Psalm, which begins with these words: \"Give Thy judgments, O God, to the King,\" that is, to Christ who was to come as King, \"and Thy righteousness unto the King's son,\"[fn-75-P7592_2176269:421-nf] that is, to Christ's people; for His sons are they who are born again in Him. But it will here be said that this Psalm has reference to Solomon. However, will not those portions of the Psalm which apply to Christ alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ, and not to Solomon? \"He shall come down,\" says He, \"like rain upon a fleece,[fn-75-P7593_2176653:422-nf] and like dropping showers upon the earth,\"[fn-75-P7594_2176740:423-nf] describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as gentle and unobserved.[fn-75-P7595_2176835:424-nf] Solomon, however, if he had indeed any descent at all, came not down like a shower, because he descended not from heaven.

And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even God? \"They shall call Him blessed.\"[fn-76-P7600_2178079:429-nf] (On what ground? ) Because blessed Is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful things.\"[fn-76-P7601_2178195:430-nf] \"Blessed also is His glorious name, and with His glory shall all the earth be filled.\"[fn-76-P7602_2178302:431-nf] On the contrary, Solomon (as I make bold to affirm) lost even the glory which he had from God, seduced by his love of women even into idolatry.

If, then, none of these, nor of the images formed by human hands, and destitute of feeling, is held to be a God, while a providence exercised about us is evidently the result of a divine power,[fn-32-P3204_942177:136-nf] it remains only to acknowledge this, that He alone who is truly God, only truly is and subsists. But those who are insensible to this are like men who have drunk mandrake or some other drug. May God grant that you may at length awake from this slumber, and know God; and that neither Gold, nor Stone, nor Tree, nor Action, nor Suffering, nor Disease, nor Fear, may appear in your eyes as a god. For there are, in sooth, \"on the fruitful earth thrice ten thousand\" demons, not immortal, nor indeed mortal; for they are not endowed with sensation, so as to render them capable of death, but only things of wood and stone, that hold despotic sway over men insulting and violating life through the force of custom. \"The earth is the Lord's,\" it is said, \"and the fulness thereof.\"[fn-32-P3205_943378:137-nf] Then why darest thou, while luxuriating in the bounties of the Lord, to ignore the Sovereign Ruler? \"Leave my earth,\" the Lord will say to thee. \"Touch not the water which I bestow. Partake not of the fruits of the earth produced by my husbandry\" Give to God recompense for your sustenance; acknowledge thy Master. Thou art God's creature. What belongs to Him, how can it with justice be alienated? For that which is alienated, being deprived of the properties that belonged to it, is also deprived of truth. For, after the fashion of Niobe, or, to express myself more mystically, like the Hebrew woman called by the ancients Lot's wife, are ye not turned into a state of insensibility? This woman we have heard, was turned into stone for her love of Sodore. And those who are godless, addicted to impiety, hard-hearted and foolish are Sodomites. Believe that these utterances are addressed to you from God. For think not that stones, and stocks, and birds, and serpents are sacred things, and men are not; but, on the contrary, regard men as truly sacred,[fn-32-P3206_944473:138-nf] and take beasts and stones for what they are. For there are miserable wretches of human kind, who consider that God utters His voice by the raven and the jackdaw, but says nothing by man; and honour the raven as a messenger of God. But the man of God, who croaks not, nor chatters, but speaks rationally and instructs lovingly, alas, they persecute; and while he is inviting them to cultivate righteousness, they try inhumanly to slay him, neither welcoming the grace which, comes from above, nor fearing the penalty. For they believe not God, nor understand His power, whose love to man is ineffable; and His hatred of evil is inconceivable. His anger augments punishment against sin; His love bestows blessings on repentance. It is the height of wretchedness to be deprived of the help which comes from God. Hence this blindness of eyes and dulness of hearing are more grievous than other inflictions of the evil one; for the one deprives them of heavenly vision, the other robs them of divine instruction. But ye, thus maimed as respects the truth, blind in mind, deaf in understanding, are not grieved, are not pained, have had no desire to see heaven and the Maker of heaven, nor, by fixing your choice on salvation, have sought to hear the Creator of the universe, and to learn of Him; for no hindrance stands in the way of him who is bent on the knowledge of God. Neither childlessness, nor poverty, nor obscurity, nor want, can hinder him who eagerly strives after the knowledge of God; nor does any one who has conquered[fn-32-P3207_946125:139-nf] by brass or iron the true wisdom for himself choose to exchange it, for it is vastly preferred to everything else. Christ is able to save in every place. For he that is fired with ardour and admiration for righteousness, being the lover of One who needs nothing, needs himself but little, having treasured up his bliss in nothing but himself and God, where is neither moth,[fn-32-P3208_946659:140-nf] robber, nor pirate, but the eternal Giver of good. With justice, then, have you been compared to those serpents who shut their ears against the charmers. For \"their mind,\" says the Scripture, \"is like the serpent, like the deaf adder, which stoppeth her ear, and will not hear the voice of the charmers.\"[fn-32-P3209_946988:141-nf] But allow yourselves to feel the influence of the charming strains of sanctity, and receive that mild word of ours, and reject the deadly poison, that it may be granted to you to divest yourselves as much as possible of destruction, as they[fn-32-P3210_947371:142-nf] have been divested of old age. Hear me, and do not stop your ears; do not block up the avenues of hearing, but lay to heart what is said. Excellent is the medicine of immortality! Stop at length your grovelling reptile motions.[fn-32-P3211_947654:143-nf] \"For the enemies of the Lord,\" says Scripture, \"shall lick the dust.\"[fn-32-P3212_947866:144-nf] Raise your eyes from earth to the skies, look up to heaven, admire the sight, cease watching with outstretched head the heel of the righteous, and hindering the way of truth. Be wise and harmless. Perchance the Lord will endow you with the wing of simplicity (for He has resolved to give wings to those that are earth-born), that you may leave your holes and dwell in heaven. Only let us with our whole heart repent, that we may be able with our whole heart to contain God. \"Trust in Him, all ye assembled people; pour out all your hearts before Him.\"[fn-32-P3213_948438:145-nf] He says to those that have newly abandoned wickedness, \"He pities them, and fills them with righteousness.\" Believe Him who is man and God; believe, O man. Believe, O man, the living God, who suffered and is adored. Believe, ye slaves,[fn-32-P3214_948694:146-nf] Him who died; believe, all ye of human kind, Him who alone is God of all men. Believe, and receive salvation as your reward. Seek God, and your soul shall live. He who seeks God is busying himself about his own salvation. Hast thou found God?-then thou hast life. Let us then seek, in order that we may live. The reward of seeking is life with God. \"Let all who seek Thee be glad and rejoice in Thee; and let them say continually, God be magnified.\"[fn-32-P3215_949221:147-nf] A noble hymn of God is an immortal man, established in righteousness, in whom the oracles of truth are engraved. For where but in a soul that is wise can you write truth? where love? where reverence? where meekness? Those who have had these divine characters impressed on them, ought, I think, to regard wisdom as a fair port whence to embark, to whatever lot in life they turn; and likewise to deem it the calm haven of salvation: wisdom, by which those who have betaken themselves to the Father, have proved good fathers to their children; and good parents to their sons, those who have known the Son; and good husbands to their wives, those who remember the Bridegroom; and good masters to their servants,[fn-32-P3216_949950:148-nf] those who have been redeemed from utter slavery. Oh, happier far the beasts than men involved in error! who live in ignorance as you, but do not counterfeit the truth. There are no tribes of flatterers among them. Fishes have no superstition: the birds worship not a single image; only they look with admiration on heaven, since, deprived as they are of reason, they are unable to know God. So are you not ashamed for living through so many periods of life in impiety, making yourselves more irrational than irrational creatures? You were boys, then striplings, then youths, then men, but never as yet were you good. If you have respect for old age, be wise, now that you have reached life's sunset; and albeit at the close of life, acquire the knowledge of God, that the end of life may to you prove the beginning of salvation. You have become old in superstition; as young, enter on the practice of piety. God regards you as innocent children. Let, then, the Athenian follow the laws of Solon, and the Argive those of Phoroneus, and the Spartan those of Lycurgus: but if thou enrol thyself as one of God's people, heaven is thy country, God thy lawgiver. And what are the laws? \"Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not seduce boys; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt love the Lord thy God.\"[fn-32-P3217_951387:149-nf] And the complements of these are those laws. of reason and words of sanctity which are inscribed on men's hearts: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; to him who strikes thee on the cheek, present also the other; \"[fn-32-P3218_951643:150-nf] \"thou shalt not lust, for by lust alone thou hast committed adultery.\"[fn-32-P3219_951734:151-nf] How much better, therefore, is it for men from the beginning not to wish to desire things forbidden, than to obtain their desires! But ye are not able to endure the austerity of salvation; but as we delight in sweet' things, and prize them higher for the agreeableness of the pleasure they yield, while, on the other hand, those bitter things which are distasteful to the palate are curative and healing, and the harshness of medicines strengthens people of weak stomach, thus custom pleases and, tickles; but custom pushes into the abyss, while truth conducts to heaven. Harsh it is at first, but a good nurse of youth; and it is at once the decorous place where the household maids and matrons dwell together, and the sage council-chamber. Nor is it difficult to approach, or impossible to attain, but is very near us in our very homes; as Moses, endowed with all wisdom, says, while referring to it, it has its abode in three departments of our constitution-in the hands, the mouth, and the heart: a meet emblem this of truth, which is embraced by these three things in all-will, action, speech. And be not afraid lest the multitude of pleasing objects which rise before you withdraw you from wisdom. You yourself will spontaneously surmount the frivolousness of custom, as boys when they have become men throw aside their toys. For with a celerity unsurpassable, and a benevolence to which we have ready access, the divine power, casting its radiance on the earth, hath filled the universe with the seed of salvation. For it was not without divine care that so great a work was accomplished in so brief a space by the Lord, who, though despised as to appearance, was in reality adored, the expiator of sin, the Saviour, the clement, the Divine Word, He that is truly most manifest Deity, He that is made equal to the Lord of the universe; because He was His Son, and the Word was in God, not disbelieved in by all when He was first preached, nor altogether unknown when, assuming the character of man, and fashioning Himself in flesh, He enacted the drama of human salvation: for He was a true champion and a fellow-champion with the creature. And being communicated most speedily to men, having dawned from His Father's counsel quicker than the sun, with the most perfect ease He made God shine on us. Whence He was and what He was, He showed by what He taught and exhibited, manifesting Himself as the Herald of the Covenant, the Reconciler, our Saviour, the Word, the Fount of life, the Giver of peace, diffused over the whole face of the earth; by whom, so to speak, the universe has already become an ocean of blessings.[fn-32-P3220_954384:152-nf] ","title":"Exhortation to the Heathen","author":"Clement of Alexandria"}]
