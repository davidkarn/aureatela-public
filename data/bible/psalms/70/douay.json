{"verses":["A psalm for David.  Of the sons of Jonadab, and the former\ncaptives.  In thee, O Lord, I have hoped, let me never be put to\nconfusion:","Deliver me in thy justice, and rescue me.  Incline thy ear unto\nme, and save me.","Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a place of strength:  that\nthou mayst make me safe.  For thou art my firmament and my refuge.","Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner, and out of\nthe hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust.","For thou art my patience, O Lord:  my hope, O Lord, from my youth.","By thee have I been confirmed from the womb:  from my mother's\nwomb thou art my protector.  Of thee I shall continually sing:","I am become unto many as a wonder, but thou art a strong helper.","Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory;\nthy greatness all the day long.","Cast me not off in the time of old age:  when my strength shall\nfail, do not thou forsake me.","For my enemies have spoken against me; and they that watched my\nsoul have consulted together,","Saying:  God hath forsaken him:  pursue and take him, for there is\nnone to deliver him.","O God, be not thou far from me:  O my God, make haste to my help.","Let them be confounded and come to nothing that detract my soul;\nlet them be covered with confusion and blame that seek my hurt.","But I will always hope; and will add to all thy praise.","My mouth shall shew forth thy justice; thy salvation all the day\nlong.  Because I have not known learning,","I will enter into the powers of the Lord:  O Lord, I will be\nmindful of thy justice alone.","Thou hast taught me, O God, from my youth:  and till now I will\ndeclare thy wonderful works.","And unto old age and grey hairs:  O God, forsake me not, Until I\nshew forth thy arm to all the generation that is to come:  Thy power,","And thy justice, O God, even to the highest great things thou\nhast done:  O God, who is like to thee?","How great troubles hast thou shewn me, many and grievous:  and\nturning thou hast brought me to life, and hast brought me back again\nfrom the depths of the earth:","Thou hast multiplied thy magnificence; and turning to me thou\nhast comforted me.","For I will also confess to thee thy truth with the instruments\nof psaltery:  O God, I will sing to thee with the harp, thou holy one of\nIsrael.","My lips shall greatly rejoice, when I shall sing to thee; and my\nsoul which thou hast redeemed.","Yea and my tongue shall meditate on thy justice all the day;\nwhen they shall be confounded and put to shame that seek evils to me."]}
