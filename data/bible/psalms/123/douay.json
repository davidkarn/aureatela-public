{"verses":["A gradual canticle.  If it had not been that the Lord was with\nus, let Israel now say:","If it had not been that the Lord was with us, When men rose up\nagainst us,","Perhaps they had swallowed us up alive.  When their fury was\nenkindled against us,","Perhaps the waters had swallowed us up.","Our soul hath passed through a torrent:  perhaps our soul had\npassed through a water insupportable.","Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us to be a prey to their\nteeth.","Our soul hath been delivered as a sparrow out of the snare of\nthe fowlers.  The snare is broken, and we are delivered.","Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth."]}
