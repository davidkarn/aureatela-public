{"verses":["Unto the end, for her that obtaineth the inheritance.  A psalm for\nDavid.","Give ear, O Lord, to my words, understand my cry.","Hearken to the voice of my prayer, O my King and my God.","For to thee will I pray:  O Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my\nvoice.","In the morning I will stand before thee, and I will see:  because\nthou art not a God that willest iniquity.","Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee:  nor shall the unjust\nabide before thy eyes.","Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity:  thou wilt destroy all\nthat speak a lie.  The bloody and the deceitful man the Lord will abhor.","But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy, I will come into thy\nhouse; I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy fear.","Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice:  because of my enemies, direct\nmy way in thy sight.","For there is no truth in their mouth:  their heart is vain.","Their throat is an open sepulchre:  they dealt deceitfully with\ntheir tongues:  judge them, O God.  Let them fall from their devices:\naccording to the multitude of their wickednesses cast them out:  for\nthey have provoked thee, O Lord.","But let all them be glad that hope in thee:  they shall rejoice\nfor ever, and thou shalt dwell in them.  And all they that love thy name\nshall glory in thee.","For thou wilt bless the just.  O Lord, thou hast crowned us, as\nwith a shield of thy good will."]}
