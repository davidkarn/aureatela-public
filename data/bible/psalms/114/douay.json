{"verses":["I have loved, because the Lord will hear the voice of my prayer.","Because he hath inclined his ear unto me:  and in my days I will\ncall upon him.","The sorrows of death have compassed me:  and the perils of hell\nhave found me.  I met with trouble and sorrow:","And I called upon the name of the Lord.  O Lord, deliver my soul.","The Lord is merciful and just, and our God sheweth mercy.","The Lord is the keeper of little ones:  I was humbled, and he\ndelivered me.","Turn, O my soul, into thy rest:  for the Lord hath been bountiful\nto thee.","For he hath delivered my soul from death:  my eyes from tears, my\nfeet from falling.","I will please the Lord in the land of the living."]}
