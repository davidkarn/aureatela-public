{"verses":["Unto the end, a psalm for David, to bring to remembrance that the\nLord saved him.","O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me.","Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek my soul:","Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame that desire\nevils to me:  Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that\nsay to me:  'Tis well, 'tis well.","Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such\nas love thy salvation say always:  The Lord be magnified.","But I am needy and poor; O God, help me.  Thou art my helper and\nmy deliverer:  O lord, make no delay."]}
