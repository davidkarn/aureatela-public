But I hungered and thirsted not even after those first works of Thine, but after Thee Thyself, the Truth, \"with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning;\"[fn-4-P481_150281:16-nf] yet they still served up to me in those dishes glowing phantasies, than which better were it to love this very sun (which, at least, is true to our sight), than those illusions which deceive the mind through the eye.

Let us now turn our attention to the next best advice, in regard of human infirmity; admonished hereto by the examples of certain, who, when an opportunity for the practice of Continence has been offered them, by divorce, or by the decease of the husband, have not only thrown away the opportunity of attaining so great a good, but not even in their remarriage have chosen to be mindful of the rule that \"above all[fn-8-P840_200607:1-nf] they marry in the Lord.\" And thus my mind has been thrown into confusion, in the fear that, having exhorted you myself to perseverance in single husbandhood and widowhood, I may now, by the mention of precipitate[fn-8-P841_200864:2-nf] marriages, put \"an occasion of falling\"[fn-8-P842_200919:3-nf] in your way. But if you are perfect in wisdom, you know, of course, that the course which is the more useful is the course which you must keep. But, inasmuch as that course is difficult, and not without its embarrassments,[fn-8-P843_201292:4-nf] and on this account is the highest aim of (widowed) life, I have paused somewhat (in my urging you to it); nor would there have been any causes for my recurring to that point also in addressing you, had I not by this time taken up a still graver solicitude. For the nobler is the continence of the flesh which ministers to widowhood, the more pardonable a thing it seems if it be not persevered in. For it is then when things are difficult that their pardon is easy. But in as far as marrying \"in the Lord\" is permissible, as being within our power, so far more culpable is it not to observe that which you can observe. Add to this the fact that the apostle, with regard to widows and the unmarried, advises them to remain permanently in that state, when he says, \"But I desire all to persevere in (imitation of) my example: \"[fn-8-P844_202138:5-nf] but touching marrying \"in the Lord,\" he no longer advises, but plainly[fn-8-P845_202229:6-nf] bids.[fn-8-P846_202306:7-nf] Therefore in this case especially, if we do not obey, we run a risk, because one may with more impunity neglect an \"advice\" than an \"order; \"in that the former springs from counsel, and is proposed to the will (for acceptance or rejection): the other descends from authority, and is bound to necessity. In the former case, to disregard appears liberty, in the latter, contumacy.","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":69,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_15_book_ix_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"1. We certainly seek a trinity,-not any trinity, but that Trinity which is God, and the true and supreme and only God. Let my hearers then wait, for we are still seeking. And no one justly finds fault with such a search, if at least he who seeks that which either to know or to utter is most difficult, is steadfast in the faith. But whosoever either sees or teaches better, finds fault quickly and justly with any one who confidently affirms concerning it. \"Seek God,\" he says, \"and your heart shall live;\"[fn-13-P1312_584545:1-nf] and lest any one should rashly rejoice that he has, as it were, apprehended it, \"Seek,\" he says, \"His face evermore.\"[fn-13-P1313_584680:2-nf] And the apostle: \"if any man,\" he says, \"think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. But if any man love God, the same is known of Him.\"[fn-13-P1314_584863:3-nf] He has not said, has known Him, which is dangerous presumption, but \"is known of Him.\" So also in another place, when he had said, \"But now after that ye have known God:\" immediately correcting himself, he says, \"or rather are known of God.\"[fn-13-P1315_585124:4-nf] And above all in that other place, \"Brethren,\" he says, \"I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press in purpose[fn-13-P1316_585378:5-nf] toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded.\"[fn-13-P1317_585539:6-nf] Perfection in this life, he tells us, is nothing else than to forget those things which are behind, and to reach forth and press in purpose toward those things which are before. For he that seeks has the safest purpose, [who seeks] until that is taken hold of whither we are tending, and for which we are reaching forth. But that is the right purpose which starts from faith. For a certain faith is in some way the starting-point of knowledge; but a certain knowledge will not be made perfect, except after this life, when we shall see face to face.[fn-13-P1318_586110:7-nf] Let us therefore be thus minded, so as to know that the disposition to seek the truth is more safe than that which presumes things unknown to be known. Let us therefore so seek as if we should find, and so find as if we were about to seek. For \"when a man hath done, then he beginneth.\"[fn-13-P1319_586417:8-nf] Let us doubt without unbelief of things to be believed; let us affirm without rashness of things to be understood: authority must be held fast in the former, truth sought out in the latter. As regards this question, then, let us believe that theFather, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit is one God, the Creator and Ruler of the whole creature; and that the Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Spirit either the Father or the Son, but a trinity of persons mutually interrelated, and a unity of an equal essence.

As, for the sake of example, if we say anything concerning the Father that does not properly belong to the Father, or does belong to the Son, or to the Holy Spirit, or to the Trinity itself; and if anything of the Son which does not properly suit with the Son, or at all events which does suit with the Father, or with the Holy Spirit, or with the Trinity; or if, again, anything concerning the Holy Spirit, which is not fitly a property of the Holy Spirit, yet is not alien from the Father, or from the Son, or from the one God the Trinity itself. Even as now our wish is to see whether the Holy Spirit is properly that love which is most excellent which if He is not, either the Father is love, or the Son, or the Trinity itself; since we cannot withstand the most certain faith and weighty authority of Scripture, saying, \"God is love.\"[fn-13-P1320_588079:9-nf] And yet we ought not to deviate into profane error, so as to say anything of the Trinity which does not suit the Creator, but rather the creature, or which is feigned outright by mere empty thought.","title":"Book IX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":69,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Concerning the last step, plainly, of His passion you raise a doubt; affirming that the passion of the cross was not predicted with reference to Christ, and urging, besides, that it is not credible that God should have exposed His own Son to that kind of death; because Himself said, \"Cursed is every one who shall have hung on a tree.\"[fn-23-P2316_765398:188-nf] But the reason of the case antecedently explains the sense of this malediction; for He says in Deuteronomy: \"If, moreover, (a man) shall have been (involved) in some sin incurring the judgment of death, and shall die, and ye shall suspend him on a tree, his body shall not remain on the tree, but with burial ye shall bury him on the very day; because cursed by God is every one who shall have been suspended on a tree; and ye shall not defile the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee for (thy) lot.\"[fn-23-P2317_765996:189-nf] Therefore He did not maledictively adjudge Christ to this passion, but drew a distinction, that whoever, in any sin, had incurred the judgment of death, and died suspended on a tree, he should be \"cursed by God,\" because his own sins were the cause of his suspension on the tree.

What, then, is the righteousness by which the devil was conquered? What,except the righteousness of Jesus Christ? And how was he conquered? Because, when he found in Him nothing worthy of death, yet he slew Him. And certainly it is just, that we whom he held as debtors, should be dismissed free by believing in Him whom he slew without any debt. In this way it is that we are said to be justified in the blood of Christ.[fn-16-P1685_840544:30-nf] For so that innocent blood was shed for the remission of our sins. Whence He calls Himself in the Psalms, \"Free among the dead.\"[fn-16-P1686_840689:31-nf] For he only that is dead is free from the debt of death. Hence also in another psalm Hesays, \"Then I restored that which I seized not;\"[fn-16-P1687_840847:32-nf] meaning sin by the thing seized, because sin is laid hold of against what is lawful. Whence also He says, by the mouth of His own Flesh, as is read in the Gospel: \"For the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me,\" that is, no sin; but \"that the world may know,\" He says, \"that I do the commandment of the Father; arise, let us go hence.\"[fn-16-P1688_841215:33-nf] And hence He proceeds to His passion, that He might pay for us debtors that which He Himself did not owe. Would then the devil be conquered by this most just right, if Christ had willed to deal with him by power, not by righteousness? But He held back what was possible to Him, in order that He might first do what was fitting. And hence it was necessary that He should be both man and God. For unless He had been man, He could not have been slain; unless He had been God. men would not have believed that He would not do what He could, but that He could not do what He would; nor should we have thought that righteousness was preferred by Him to power, but that He lacked power. But now He suffered for us things belonging to man, because He was man; but if He had been unwilling, it would have been in His power to not so to suffer, because He was also God. And righteousness was therefore made more acceptable in humility, because so great power as was in His Divinity, if He had been unwilling, would have been able not to suffer humility; and thus by Him who died, being thus powerful, both righteousness was commended, and power promised, to us, weak mortals. For He did one of these two things by dying, the other by rising again. For what is more righteous, than to come even to the death of the cross for righteousness? And what more powerful, than to rise from the dead, and to ascend into heaven with that very flesh in which He was slain? And therefore He conquered the devil first by righteousness, and afterwards by power: namely, by righteousness, because He had no sin, and was slain by him most unjustly; but by power, because having been dead He lived again, never afterwards to die.[fn-16-P1689_842939:34-nf] But He would have conquered the devil by power, even though He could not have been slain by him: although it belongs to a greater power to conquer death itself also by rising again, than to avoid it by living. But the reason is really a different one, why we are justified in the blood of Christ, when we are rescued from the power of the devil through the remission of sins: it pertains to this, that the devil is conquered by Christ by righteousness, not by power. For Christ was crucified, not through immortal power, but through the weakness which He took upon Him in mortal flesh; of which weakness nevertheless the apostle says, \"that the weakness of God is stronger than men.\"[fn-16-P1690_843640:35-nf] ","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":69,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_14_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Since, then, Christ is Wisdom, let the intelligent reader consider our opponent's account of the matter, and our own, and judge which is the more pious, which better preserves in the text those conceptions which are befitting the Divine nature; whether that which declares the Creator and Lord of all to have been made, and places Him on a level with the creation that is in bondage, or that rather which looks to the Incarnation, and preserves the due proportion with regard to our conception alike of the Divinity and of the Humanity, bearing in mind that the great Paul testifies in favour of our view, who sees in the \"new man\" creation, and in the true Wisdom the power of creation.

And thus sometimes we weep in spite of ourselves, being carried beyond ourselves, not indeed by culpable desire; but by praiseworthy charity. In us, therefore, these affections arise from human infirmity; but it was not so with the Lord Jesus, for even His infirmity was the consequence of His power. But so long as we wear the infirmity of this life, we are rather worse men than better if we have none of these emotions at all. For the apostle vituperated and abominated some who, as he said, were \"without natural affection.\"[fn-24-P2405_1339574:76-nf] The sacred Psalmist also found fault with those of whom he said, \"I looked for some to lament with me, and there was none.\"[fn-24-P2406_1339716:77-nf] For to be quite free from pain while we are in this place of misery is only purchased, as one of this world's literati perceived and remarked,[fn-24-P2407_1339879:78-nf] at the price of blunted sensibilities both of mind and body. And therefore that which the Greeks call a0paqeia, and what the Latins would call, if their language would allow them, \"impassibilitas,\" if it be taken to mean an impassibility of spirit and not of body, or, in other words, a freedom from those emotions which are contrary to reason and disturb the mind, then it is obviously a good and most desirable quality, but it is not one which is attainable in this life. For the words of the apostle are the confession, not of the common herd, but of the eminently pious, just, and holy men: \"If we say we have: no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-24-P2408_1340630:79-nf] When there shall be no sin in a man, then there shall be this apa/qeia. At present it is enough if we live without crime; and he who thinks he lives without sin puts aside not sin, but pardon. And if that is to be called apathy, where the mind is the subject of no emotion, then who would not consider this insensibility to be worse than all vices? It may, indeed, reasonably be maintained that the perfect blessedness we hope for shall be free from all sting of fear or sadness; but who thai is not quite lost to truth would say that neither love nor joy shall be experienced there?

Yet what we read in the Proverbs of impious men saying, \"Let us unrighteously hide in the earth the righteous man; yea, let us swallow him up alive as hell, and let us take away his memory from the earth: let us seize his precious possession,\"[fn-32-P3229_1772210:137-nf] is not so obscure that it may not be understood, without laborious exposition, of Christ and His possession the Church. Indeed, the gospel parable about the wicked husbandmen shows that our Lord Jesus Himself said something like it: \"This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.\"[fn-32-P3230_1772544:138-nf] In like manner also that passage in this same book, on which we have already touched[fn-32-P3231_1772652:139-nf] when we were speaking of the barren woman who hath born seven, must soon after it was tittered have come to be understood of only Christ and the Church by those who knew that Christ was the Wisdom of God. \"Wisdom hath builded her an house, and hath set up seven pillars; she hath sacrificed her victims, she hath mingled her wine in the bowl; she hath also furnished her table. She hath sent her servants summoning to the bowl with excellent proclamation, saying, Who is simple, let him turn aside to me. And to the void of sense she hath said, Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled for you.\"[fn-32-P3232_1773287:140-nf] Here certainly we perceive that the Wisdom of God, that is, the Word co-eternal with the Father, hath builded Him an house, even a human body in the virgin womb, and hath subjoined the Church to it as members to a head, hath slain the martyrs as victims, hath furnished a table with wine and bread, where appears also the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, and hath called the simple and the void of sense, because, as saith the apostle, \"He hath chosen the weak things of this world that He might confound the things which are mighty.\"[fn-32-P3233_1773888:141-nf] Yet to these weak ones she saith what follows, \"Forsake simplicity, that ye may live; and seek prudence, that ye may have life.\"[fn-32-P3234_1774039:142-nf] But to be made partakers of this table is itself to begin to have life. For when he says in another book, which is called Ecclesiastes, \"There is no good for a man, except that he should eat and drink,\"[fn-32-P3235_1774262:143-nf] what can he be morecredibly understood to say, than what belongs to the participation of this table which the Mediator of the New Testament Himself, the Priest after the order of Melchizedek, furnishes with His own body and blood? For that sacrifice has succeeded all the sacrifices of the Old Testament, which were slain as a shadow of that which was to come; wherefore also we recognize the voice in the 40th Psalm as that of the same Mediator speaking through prophesy,\" Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not desire; but a body hast Thou perfected for me.\"[fn-32-P3236_1774872:144-nf] Because, instead of all these sacrifices and oblations, His body is offered, and is served up to the partakers of it. For that this Ecclesiastes, in this sentence about eating and drinking, which he often repeats, and very much commends, does not savor the dainties of carnal pleasures, is made plain enough when he says, \"It is better to go into the house of mourning than to go into the house of feasting.\"[fn-32-P3237_1775299:145-nf] And a little after He says, \"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, and the heart of the simple in the house of feasting.\"[fn-32-P3238_1775458:146-nf] But I think that more worthy of quotation from this book which relates to both cities, the one of the devil, the other of Christ, and to their kings, the devil and Christ: \"Woe to thee, O land,\" he says, \"when thy king is a youth, and thy princes eat in the morning! Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in season, in fortitude, and not in confusion!\"[fn-32-P3239_1775878:147-nf] He has called the devil a youth, because of the folly and pride, and rashness and unruliness, and other vices which are wont to abound at that age; but Christ is the Son of nobles, that is, of the holy patriarchs, of those belonging to the free city, of whom He was begotten in the flesh. The princes of that and other cities are eaters in the morning, that is, before the suitable hour, because they do not expect the seasonable felicity, which is the true, in tile world to come, desiring to be speedily made happy with the renown of this world; but the princes of the city of Christ patiently wait for the time of a blessedness that is not fallacious. This is expressed by the words, \"in fortitude, and not in confusion,\" because hope does not deceive them; of which the apostle says, \"But hope maketh not ashamed.\"[fn-32-P3240_1776724:148-nf] A psalm also saith, \"For they that hope in Thee shall not be put to shame.\"[fn-32-P3241_1776818:149-nf] But now the Song of Songs is a certain spiritual pleasure of holy minds, in the marriage of that King and Queen-city, that is, Christ and the Church. But this pleasure is wrapped up in allegorical veils, that the Bridegroom may be more ardently desired, and more joyfully unveiled, and may appear; to whom it is said in this same song, \"Equity hath delighted Thee;[fn-32-P3242_1777204:150-nf] and the bride who there hears, \"Charity is in thy delights.\"[fn-32-P3243_1777284:151-nf] We pass over many things in silence, in our desire to finish this work.","title":"Book XVII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":69,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_19_dialogue_i_the_immutable_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"297","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"\"Since his going down into Mary is useless; for why went He down into her if He was designed to take nothing from her?

Such persons[fn-27-P2707_1849126:36-nf] \"have their conscience seared with a hot iron,\" as the Apostle expresses it; and very truly too, considering that, deserting the guidance of the Holy Spirit for the \"doctrines of devils,\" they have some ulcers and blisters stamped upon their hearts, abominating God's creatures, and calling them \"foul,\" \"seducing,\" \"mischievous,\" and so on. \"But what have I to do to judge them that are without[fn-27-P2708_1849541:37-nf] ?\" asks the Apostle. Truly those persons are outside the Court in which the words of our mysteries are spoken; they are not installed under God's roof, but in the monastery of the Evil One. They \"are taken captive by him at his will[fn-27-P2709_1849793:38-nf] .\" They therefore do not understand that all virtue is found in moderation, and that any declension to either side[fn-27-P2710_1849928:39-nf] of it becomes a vice. He, in fact, who grasps the middle point between doing too little and doing too much has hit the distinction between vice and virtue. Instances will make this clearer. Cowardice and audacity are two recognized vices opposed to each other; the one the defect, the other the excess of confidence; between them lies courage. Again, piety is neither atheism nor superstition; it is equally impious to deny a God and to believe in many gods. Is there need of more examples to bring this principle home? The man who avoids both meanness and prodigality will by this shunning of extremes form the moral habit of liberality; for liberality is the thing which is neither inclined to spend at random vast and useless sums, nor yet to be closely calculating in necessary expenses. We need not go into details in the case of all good qualities. Reason, in all of them, has established virtue to be a middle state between two extremes. Sobriety itself therefore is a middle state, and manifestly involves the two declensions on either side towards vice; he, that is, who is wanting in firmness of soul, and is so easily worsted in the combat with pleasure as never even to have approached the path of a virtuous and sober life, slides into shameful indulgence; while he who goes beyond the safe ground of sobriety and overshoots the moderation of this virtue, falls as it were from a precipice into the \"doctrines of devils,\" \"having his conscience seared with a hot iron.\" In declaring marriage abominable he brands himself with such reproaches; for \"if the tree is corrupt\" (as the Gospel says), \"the fruit also of the tree will be like it[fn-27-P2711_1851679:40-nf] \"; if a man is the shoot and fruitage of the tree of marriage, reproaches cast on that turn upon him who casts them[fn-27-P2712_1851937:41-nf] . These persons, then, are like branded criminals already; their conscience is covered with the stripes of this unnatural teaching. But our view of marriage is this; that, while the pursuit of heavenly things should be a man's first care, yet if he can use the advantages of marriage with sobriety and moderation, he need not despise this way of serving the state. An example might be found in the patriarch Isaac. He married Rebecca when he was past the flower of his age and his prime was well-nigh spent, so that his marriage was not the deed of passion, but because of God's blessing that should be upon his seed. He cohabited with her till the birth of her only children[fn-27-P2713_1852693:42-nf] , and then, closing the channels of the senses, lived wholly for the Unseen; for this is what seems to be meant by the mention in his history of the dimness of the Patriarch's eyes. But let that be as those think who are skilled in reading these meanings, and let us proceed with the continuity of our discourse. What then, were we saying? That in the cases where it is possible at once to be true to the diviner love, and to embrace wedlock, there is no reason for setting aside this dispensation of nature and misrepresenting as abominable that which is honourable. Let us take again our illustration of the water and the spring. Whenever the husbandman, in order to irrigate a particular spot, is bringing the stream thither, but there is need before it gets there of a small outlet, he will allow only so much to escape into that outlet as is adequate to supply the demand, and can then easily be blended again with the main stream. If, as an inexperienced and easy-going steward, he opens too wide a channel, there will be danger of the whole stream quitting its direct bed and pouring itself sideways. In the same way, if (as life does need a mutual succession) a man so treats this need as to give spiritual things the first thought, and because of the shortness[fn-27-P2714_1854143:43-nf] of the time indulges but sparingly the sexual passion and keeps it under restraint, that man would realize the character of the prudent husband man to which the Apostle exhorts us. About the details of paying these trifling debts of nature he will not be over-calculating, but the long hours of his prayers[fn-27-P2715_1854471:44-nf] will secure the purity which is the key-note of his life. He will always fear lest by this kind of indulgence he may become nothing but flesh and blood; for in them God's Spirit does not dwell. He who is of so weak a character that he cannot make a manful stand against nature's impulse had better[fn-27-P2716_1855070:45-nf] keep himself very far away from such temptations, rather than descend into a combat which is above his strength. There is no small danger for him lest, cajoled in the valuation of pleasure, he should think that there exists no other good but that which is enjoyed along with some sensual emotion, and, turning altogether from the love of immaterial delights, should become entirely of the flesh, seeking always his pleasure only there, so that his character will be a Pleasure-lover, not a God-lover. It is not every man's gift, owing to weakness of nature, to hit the due proportion in these matters; there is a danger of being carried far beyond it, and \"sticking fast in the deep mire[fn-27-P2717_1855821:46-nf] ,\" to use the Psalmist's words. It would therefore be for our interest, as our discourse has been suggesting, to pass through life without a trial of these temptations, lest under cover of the excuse of lawful indulgence passion should gain an entrance into the citadel of the soul.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":69,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"If any one supposes that[fn-28-P2817_1908584:116-nf] this want of mutual harmony between his life and a single one of its circumstances is quite unimportant, let him be taught the meaning of our maxim by looking at the management of a house. The master of a private dwelling will not allow any untidiness or unseemliness to be seen in the house, such as a couch upset, or the table littered with rubbish, or vessels of price thrown away into dirty corners, while those which serve ignobler uses are thrust forward for entering guests to see. He has everything arranged neatly and in the proper place, where it stands to most advantage; and then he can welcome his guests, without any misgivings that he need be ashamed of opening the interior of his house to receive them. The same duty, I take it, is incumbent on that master of our \"tabernacle,\" the mind; it has to arrange everything within us, and to put each particular faculty of the soul, which the Creator has fashioned to be our implement or our vessel, to fitting and noble uses. We will now mention in detail the way in which any one might manage his life, with its present advantages, to his improvement, hoping that no one will accuse us of trifling[fn-28-P2818_1909802:117-nf] , or over-minuteness. We advise, then, that love's passion be placed in the soul's purest shrine, as a thing chosen to be the first fruits of all our gifts, and devoted[fn-28-P2819_1910017:118-nf] entirely to God; and when once this has been done, to keep it untouched and unsullied by any secular defilement. Then indignation, and anger, and hatred must be as watch-dogs to be roused only against attacking sins; they must follow their natural impulse only against the thief and the enemy who is creeping in to plunder the divine treasure-chamber, and who comes only for that, that he may steal, and mangle, and destroy. Courage and confidence are to be weapons in our hands to baffle any sudden surprise and attack of the wicked who advance. Hope and patience are to be the staffs to lean upon, whenever we are weary with the trials of the world. As for sorrow, we must have a stock of it ready to apply, if need should happen to arise for it, in the hour of repentance for our sins; believing at the same time that it is never useful, except to minister to that. Righteousness will be our rule of straightforwardness, guarding us from stumbling either in word or deed, and guiding us in the disposal of the faculties of our soul, as well as in the due consideration for every one we meet. The love of gain, which is a large, incalculably large, element in every soul, when once applied to the desire for God, will bless the man who has it; for he will be violent[fn-28-P2820_1911376:119-nf] where it is right to be violent. Wisdom and prudence will be our advisers as to our best interests; they will order our lives so as never to suffer from any thoughtless folly. But suppose a man does not apply the aforesaid faculties of the soul to their proper use, but reverses their intended purpose; suppose he wastes his love upon the basest objects, and stores up his hatred only for his own kinsmen; suppose he welcomes iniquity, plays the man only against his parents, is bold only in absurdities, fixes his hopes on emptiness, chases prudence and wisdom from his company, takes gluttony and folly for his mistresses, and uses all his other opportunities in the same fashion, he would indeed be a strange and unnatural character to a degree beyond any one's power to express. If we could imagine any one putting his armour on all the wrong way, reversing the helmet so as to cover his face while the plume nodded backward, putting his feet into the cuirass, and fitting the greaves on to his breast, changing to the right side all that ought to go on the left and vice versa, and how such a hoplite would be likely to fare in battle, then we should have an idea of the fate in life which is sure to await him whose confused judgment makes him reverse the proper uses of his soul's faculties. We must therefore provide this balance in all feeling; the true sobriety of mind is naturally able to supply it; and if one had to find an exact definition of this sobriety, one might declare absolutely, that it amounts to our ordered control, by dint of wisdom and prudence, over every emotion of the soul. Moreover, such a condition in the soul will be no longer in need of any laborious method to attain to the high and heavenly realities; it will accomplish with the greatest ease that which erewhile seemed so unattainable; it will grasp the object of its search as a natural consequence of rejecting the opposite attractions. A man who comes out of darkness is necessarily in the light; a man who is not dead is necessarily alive. Indeed, if a man is not to have received his soul to no purpose[fn-28-P2821_1913528:120-nf] , he will certainly be upon the path of truth; the prudence and the science employed to guard against error will be itself a sure guidance along the right road. Slaves who have been freed and cease to serve their former masters, the very moment they become their own masters, direct all their thoughts towards themselves so, I take it, the soul which has been freed from ministering to the body becomes at once cognizant of its own inherent energy. But this liberty consists, as we learn from the Apostle[fn-28-P2822_1914149:121-nf] , in not again being held in the yoke of slavery, and in not being bound again, like a runaway or a criminal, with the fetters of marriage. But I must return here to what I said at first; that the perfection of this liberty does not consist only in that one point of abstaining from marriage. Let no one suppose that the prize of virginity is so insignificant and so easily won as that; as if one little observance of the flesh could settle so vital a matter. But we have seen that every man who doeth a sin is the servant of sin[fn-28-P2823_1914697:122-nf] ; so that a declension towards vice in any act, or in any practice whatever, makes a slave, and still more, a branded slave, of the man, covering him through sin's lashes with bruises and seared spots. Therefore it behoves the man who grasps at the transcendent aim of all virginity to be true to himself in h every respect, and to manifest his purity equally in every relation of his life. If any of the inspired words are required to aid our pleading, the Truth[fn-28-P2824_1915186:123-nf] Itself will be sufficient to corroborate the truth when It inculcates this very kind of teaching in the veiled meaning of a Gospel Parable: the good and eatable fish are separated by the fishers' skill from the bad and poisonous fish, so that the enjoyment of the good should not be spoilt by any of the bad getting into the \"vessels\" with them. The work of true sobriety is the same; from all pursuits and habits to choose that which is pure and improving, rejecting in every case that which does not seem likely to be useful, and letting it go back into the universal and secular life, called \"the sea[fn-28-P2825_1915813:124-nf] ,\" in the imagery of the Parable. The Psalmist[fn-28-P2826_1915902:125-nf] also, when expounding the doctrine of a full confession[fn-28-P2827_1915978:126-nf] , calls this restless suffering tumultuous life, \"waters coming in even unto the soul,\" \"depths of waters,\" and a \"hurricane\"; in which sea indeed every rebellious thought sinks, as the Egyptian did, with a stone's weight into the deeps[fn-28-P2828_1916261:127-nf] . But all in us that is dear to God, and has a piercing insight into the truth (called \"Israel\" in the narrative), passes, but that alone, over that sea as if it were dry land, and is never reached by the bitterness and the brine of life's billows. Thus, typically, under the leadership of the Law (for Moses was a type of the Law that was coming) Israel passes unwetted over that sea, while the Egyptian who crosses in her track is overwhelmed. Each fares according to the disposition which he carries with him; one walks lightly enough, the other is dragged into the deep water. For virtue is a light and buoyant thing, and all who live in her way \"fly like clouds[fn-28-P2829_1916948:128-nf] ,\" as Isaiah says, \"and as doves with their young ones\"; but sin is a heavy affair, \"sitting,\" as another of the prophets says, \"upon a talent of lead[fn-28-P2830_1917155:129-nf] .\" If, however, this reading of the history appears to any forced and inapplicable, and the miracle at the Red Sea does not present itself to him as written for our profit, let him listen to the Apostle: \"Now all these things happened unto them for types, and they are written for our admonition[fn-28-P2831_1917684:130-nf] .\"","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":69,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"73","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Now some one will ask how this statement that there is no darkness in Him can be regarded as a thing peculiar to Him, when we consider that the Saviour also was quite without sin. Could it not be said of Him also that \"He is light, and that there is no darkness in Him\"? The difference between the two cases has been partly set forth above. We will now, however, go a step further than we did before, and add, that if God made Christ who knew no sin to be sin for us,[fn-65-P6562_1125652:77-nf] then it could not be said of Him that there was no darkness in Him. For if Jesus was in the likeness[fn-65-P6563_1125772:78-nf] of the flesh of sin and for sin, and condemned sin by taking ripen Him the likeness of the flesh of sin, then it cannot be said of Him, absolutely and directly, that there was no darkness in Him. We may add that \"He[fn-65-P6564_1126007:79-nf] took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses,\" both infirmities of the soul and sicknesses of the hidden man of our heart. On account of these infirmities and sicknesses which He bore away from us, He declares His soul to be sorrowful and sore troubled,[fn-65-P6565_1126282:80-nf] and He is said in Zechariah to have put on filthy garments,[fn-65-P6566_1126363:81-nf] which, when He was about to take them off, are said to be sins. \"Behold, it is said, I have taken away thy sins.\" Because He had taken on Himself the sins of the people of those who believed in Him, he uses many such expressions as these: \"Far from my salvation are the words of my transgressions,\"[fn-65-P6567_1126681:82-nf] and \"Thou knowest my foolishness, and my sins were not hid from Thee.\"[fn-65-P6568_1126770:83-nf] And let no one suppose that we say this from any lack of piety towards the Christ of God; for as the Father alone has immortality and our Lord took upon Himself. for His love to men, the death He died for us, so to the Father alone the words apply, \"In Him is no darkness,\" since Christ took upon Himself, for His goodwill towards men, our darknesses. This He did, that by His power He might destroy our death and remove the darkness which is in our soul, so that the saying in Isaiah might be fulfilled,[fn-65-P6569_1127293:84-nf] \"The people that sat in darkness saw a great light.\" This light, which came into being in the Logos, and is also life, shines in the darkness of our souls, and it has come where the rulers of this darkness carry on their struggle with the race of men and strive to subdue to darkness those who do not stand firm with all their power; that they might be enlightened the light has come so far, and that they might be called sons of light. And shining in darkness this light is pursued by the darkness, but not overtaken.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":69,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"107","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now, to upset all conceits of this sort, let me dispel at once the preliminary idea on which they rest-their assertion that the prophets make all their announcements in figures of speech.

And, indeed, if all are figures, where will be that of which they are the figures? How can you hold up a mirror for your face, if the face nowhere exists? But, in truth, all are not figures, but there are also literal statements; nor are all shadows, but there are bodies too: so that we have prophecies about the Lord Himself even, which are clearer than the day For it was not figuratively that the Virgin conceived in her womb; nor in a trope did she bear Emmanuel, that is, Jesus, God with us.[fn-98-P9851_2722924:112-nf] Even granting that He was figuratively to take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria,[fn-98-P9852_2723054:113-nf] still it was literally that He was to \"enter into judgment with the elders and princes of the people.\"[fn-98-P9853_2723178:114-nf] For in the person of Pilate \"the heathen raged,\" and in the person of Israel \"the people imagined vain things; \"\"the kings of the earth\" in Herod, and the rulers in Annas and Caiaphas, were gathered together against the Lord, and against His anointed.\"[fn-98-P9854_2723452:115-nf] He, again, was \"led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearer,\" that is, Herod, \"is dumb, so He opened not His mouth.\"[fn-98-P9855_2723613:116-nf] \"He gave His back to scourges, and His cheeks to blows, not turning His face even from the shame of spitting.\"[fn-98-P9856_2723745:117-nf] \"He was numbered with the transgressors; \"[fn-98-P9857_2723812:118-nf] \"He was pierced in His hands and His feet; \"[fn-98-P9858_2723879:119-nf] \"they cast lots for his raiment\"[fn-98-P9859_2723933:120-nf] \"they gave Him gall, and made Him drink vinegar; \"[fn-98-P9860_2724000:121-nf] \"they shook their heads, and mocked Him; \"[fn-98-P9861_2724135:122-nf] \"He was appraised by the traitor in thirty pieces of silver.\"[fn-98-P9862_2724217:123-nf] What figures of speech does Isaiah here give us?

Who would prefer affixing a metaphorical interpretation to all these events, instead of accepting their literal truth? The realities are involved in the words, just as the words are read in the realities.

He then adds: \"After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and fixed it upon hyssop, and put it to His mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, He said, It is finished: and He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost.\" Who has the power of so adjusting what he does, as this Man had of arranging all that He suffered? But this Man was the Mediator between God and men; the Man of whom we read in prophecy, He is man also, and who shall acknowledge Him for the men who did such things acknowledged not this Man as God. For He who was manifest as man, was hid as God: He who was manifest suffered all these things, and He Himself also, who was hid, arranged them all.

I feel myself growing dizzy with all this, and wonder whether, in obeying you, I have not been obeying God, nor walking in the footsteps of the saints, unless it be that my too great love to you, and my unwillingness to cause you any pain, has led me astray and caused me to think of all these excuses. We started from the words of the preacher, where he says: \"My son, beware of making many books.\" With this I compare a saying from the Proverbs of the same Solomon,[fn-66-P6671_1166477:10-nf] \"In the multitude of words thou shall not escape sin; but in sparing thy lips thou shalt be wise.\" Here I ask whether speaking many words of whatever kind is a multitude of words (in the sense of the preacher), even if the many words a man speaks are sacred and connected with salvation. If this be the case, and if he who makes use of many salutary words is guilty of \"multitude of words,\" then Solomon himself did not escape this sin, for \"he spoke[fn-66-P6672_1166940:11-nf] three thousand proverbs, and five thousand songs, and he spoke of trees from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall, he spoke also of beasts and of fowl, and of creeping things and of fishes.\" How, I may ask, can any one give any course of instruction, without a multitude of words, using the phrase in its simplest sense? Does not Wisdom herself say to those who are perishing,[fn-66-P6673_1167382:12-nf] \"I stretched out my words, and ye heeded not\"? Do we not find Paul, too, extending his discourse from morning to midnight,[fn-66-P6674_1167523:13-nf] when Eutychus was borne down with sleep and fell down, to the dismay of the hearers. who thought he was killed? If, then, the words are true, \"In much speaking thou wilt not escape sin,\" and if Solomon was yet not guilty of great sin when he discoursed on the subjects above mentioned, nor Paul when he prolonged his discourse till midnight, then the question arises, What is that much speaking which is referred to? and then we may pass on to consider what are the many books. Now the entire Word of God, who was in the beginning with God, is not much speaking, is not words; for the Word is one, being composed of the many speculations (theoremata), each of which is a part of the Word in its entirety. Whatever words there be outside of this one, which promise to give any description and exposition, even though they be words about truth, none of these, to put it in a somewhat paradoxical way, is Word or Reason, they are all words or reasons. They are not the monad, far from it; they are not that which agrees and is one in itself, by their inner divisions and conflicts unity has departed from them, they have become numbers, perhaps infinite numbers. We are obliged, therefore, to say that whoever speaks that which is foreign to religion is using many words, while he who speaks the words of truth, even should he go over the whole field and omit nothing, is always speaking the one word. Nor are the saints guilty of much speaking, since they always have the aim in view which is connected with the one word. It appears, then, that the much speaking which is condemned is judged to be so rather from the nature of the views propounded, than from the number of the words pronounced. Let us see if we cannot conclude in the same way that all the sacred books are one book, but that those outside are the \"many books\" of the preacher. The proof of this must be drawn from Holy Scripture, and it will be most satisfactorily established if I am able to show that it is not only one book, taking the word now in its commoner meaning, that we find to be written about Christ. Christ is written about even in the Pentateuch; He is spoken of in each of the Prophets, and in the Psalms, and, in a word, as the Saviour Himself says, in all the Scriptures. He refers us to them all, when He says:[fn-66-P6675_1169838:14-nf] \"Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and these are they which testify of Me.\" And if He refers us to the Scriptures as testifying of Him, it is not to one that He sends us, to the exclusion of another, but to all that speak of Him, those which, in the Psalms, He calls the chapter of the book, saying,[fn-66-P6676_1170187:15-nf] \"In the chapter of the book it is written of Me.\" If any one proposes to take these words, \"In the chapter of the book it is written of Me,\" literally, and to apply them to this or that special passage where Christ is spoken of, let him tell us on what principle he warrants his preference for one book over another. If any one supposes that we are doing something of this kind ourselves. and applying the words in question to the book of Psalms, we deny that we do so, and we would urge that in that case the words should have been, \"In this book it is written of Me.\" But He speaks of all the books as one chapter, thus sum-ruing up in one all that is spoken of Christ for our instruction. In fact the book was seen by John,[fn-66-P6677_1170927:16-nf] \"written within and without, and sealed; and no one could open it to read it, and to loose the seals thereof, but the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, who has the key of David,[fn-66-P6678_1171137:17-nf] he that openeth and none shall shut, and that shutteth and none shall open.\" For the book here spoken of means the whole of Scripture; and it is written within (lit. in front), on account of the meaning which is obvious, and on the back, on account of its remoter and spiritual sense. Observe, in addition to this, if a proof that the sacred writings are one book, and those of an opposite character many. may not be found in the fact that there is one book of the living from which those who have proved unworthy to be in it are blotted out, as it is written:[fn-66-P6679_1171717:18-nf] \"Let them be blotter out of the book of the living,\" while of those who are to undergo the judgment, there are books in the plural, as Daniel says:[fn-66-P6680_1171884:19-nf] \"The judgment was set, and the books were opened.\" But Moses also bears witness to the unity of the sacred book, when he says:[fn-66-P6681_1172030:20-nf] \"If Thou forgive the people their sins, forgive, but if not, then wipe me out of the book which Thou hast written.\" The passage in Isaiah,[fn-66-P6682_1172191:21-nf] too, I read in the same way. It is not peculiar to his prophecy that the words of the book should be sealed, and should neither be read by him who does not know letters, because he is ignorant of letters, nor by him who is learned, because the book is sealed. This is true of every writing, for every written work needs the reason (Logos) which closed it to open it. \"He shall shut, and none shall open,\"[fn-66-P6683_1172615:22-nf] and when He opens no one can cast doubt on the interpretation He brings. Hence it is said that He shall open and no man shall shut. I infer a similar lesson from the book spoken of in Ezekiel,[fn-66-P6684_1172828:23-nf] in which was written lamentation, and a song, and woe. For the whole book is full of the woe of the lost, and the song of the saved, and the lamentation of those between these two. And John, too, when he speaks of his eating the one roll,[fn-66-P6685_1173079:24-nf] in which both front and back were written on, means the whole of Scripture, one book which is, at first, most sweet when one begins, as it were, to chew it, but bitter in the revelation of himself which it makes to the conscience of each one who knows it. I will add to the proof of this an apostolic saying which has been quite misunderstood by the disciples of Marcion, who, therefore, set the Gospels at naught. The Apostle says:[fn-66-P6686_1173533:25-nf] \"According to my Gospel in Christ Jesus; \"he does not speak of Gospels in the plural, and, hence, they argue that as the Apostle only speaks of one Gospel in the singular, there was only one in existence. But they fail to see that, as He is one of whom all the evangelists write, so the Gospel, though written by several hands, is, in effect, one. And, in fact, the Gospel, though written by four, is one. From these considerations, then, we learn what the one book is, and what the many books, and what I am now concerned about is, not the quantity I may write, but the effect of what I say, lest, if I fail in this point, and set forth anything against the truth itself, even in one of my writings, I should prove to have transgressed the commandment, and to be a writer of \"many books.\" Yet I see the heterodox assailing the holy Church of God in these days, under the pretence of higher wisdom, and bringing forward works in many volumes in which they offer expositions of the evangelical and apostolic writings, and I fear that if I should be silent and should not put before our members the saving and true doctrines, these teachers might get a hold of curious souls, which, in the absence of wholesome nourishment, might go after food that is forbidden, and, in fact, unclean and horrible. It appears to me, therefore, to be necessary that one who is able to represent in a genuine manner the doctrine of the Church, and to refute those dealers in knowledge, falsely so-called, should take his stand against historical fictions, and oppose to them the true and lofty evangelical message in which the agreement of the doctrines, found both in the so-called Old Testament and in the so-called New, appears so plainly and fully. You yourself felt at one time the lack of good representatives of the better cause, and were impatient of a faith which was at issue with reason and absurd, and you then, for the love you bore to the Lord, gave yourself to composition from which, however, in the exercise of the judgment with which you are endowed, you afterwards desisted. This is the defence which I think admits of being made for those who have the faculty of speaking and writing. But I am also pleading my own cause, as I now devote myself with what boldness I may to the work of exposition; for it may be that I am not endowed with that habit and disposition which he ought to have who is fitted by God to be a minister of the New Covenant, not of the letter but of the spirit.","title":"From the Fifth Book.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":69,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The excuse such as men are in the habit of alleging from ignorance is taken away from those persons who know God's commandments. But neither will those be without punishment who know not the law of God. \"For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[fn-59-P5935_2319280:38-nf] Now the apostle does not appear to me to have said this as if he meant that they would have to suffer something worse who in their sins are ignorant of the law than they who know it. [III.] It is seemingly worse, no doubt, \"to perish\" than \"to be judged;\" but inasmuch as he was speaking of the Gentiles and of the Jews when he used these words, because the former were without the law, but the latter had received the law, who can venture to say that the Jews who sin in the law will not perish, since they refused to believe in Christ, when it was of them that the apostle said, \"They shall be judged by the law\"? For without faith in Christ no man can be delivered; and therefore they will be so judged that they perish. If, indeed, the condition of those who are ignorant of the law of God is worse than the condition of those who know it, how can that be true which the Lord says in the gospel: \"The servant who knows not his lord's will, and commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes; whereas the servant who knows his lord's will, and commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with many stripes \"?[fn-59-P5936_2320437:39-nf] Observe how clearly He here shows that it is a graver matter for a man to sin with knowledge than in ignorance. And yet we must not on this account betake ourselves for refuge to the shades of ignorance, with the view of finding our excuse therein. It is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be unwilling to know. For the will is at fault in the case of the man of whom it is said, \"He is not inclined to understand, so as to do good.\"[fn-59-P5937_2320906:40-nf] But even the ignorance, which is not theirs who refuse to know, but theirs who are, as it were, simply ignorant, does not so far excuse any one as to exempt him from the punishment of eternal fire, though his failure to believe has been the result of his not having at all heard what he should believe; but probably only so far as to mitigate his punishment. For it was not said without reason: \"Pour out Thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known Thee;\"[fn-59-P5938_2321384:41-nf] nor again according to what the apostle says: \"When He shall come from heaven in a flame of fire to take vengeance on them that know not God.\"[fn-59-P5939_2321545:42-nf] But yet in order that we may have that knowledge that will prevent our saying, each one of us, \"I did not know,\" \"I did not hear,\" \"I did not understand;\" the human will is summoned, in such words as these: \"Wish not to be as the horse or as the mule, which have no understanding;\"[fn-59-P5940_2321850:43-nf] although it may show itself even worse, of which it is written, \"A stubborn servant will not be reproved by words; for even if he understand, yet he will not obey.\"[fn-59-P5941_2322034:44-nf] But when a man says, \"I cannot do what I am commanded, because I am mastered by my concupiscence,\" he has no longer any excuse to plead from ignorance, nor reason to blame God in his heart, but he recognises and laments his own evil in himself; and still to such an one the apostle says: \"Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good;\"[fn-59-P5942_2322399:45-nf] and of course the very fact that the injunction, \"Consent not to be overcome,\" is addressed to him, undoubtedly summons the determination of his will. For to consent and to refuse are functions proper to will.","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":69,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§10. And if thou shouldest say that Christ has not yet come, I will grant this also to thy\ncontentiousness. For it is written that when He shall come, the Gentiles shall expect\nHim.[fn-44-P4480_1496968:27-nf] Lo! I, one of the Gentiles, have\nheard that Christ is to come. And when as yet He had not come, I beforehand have believed on Him; and\nthrough Him I worship the God of Israel. When He comes, will He then blame me because before His\ncoming I beforehand believed on Him? But, thou fool, the prophets suffer thee not to say that Christ\nhas not yet come; for Daniel confutes thee,[fn-44-P4481_1497406:28-nf] saying:-After sixty-two weeks shall Messiah\ncome and shall be slain. And in His coming shall the Holy City be laid waste, and her end shall be\nwith a flood. And until the accomplishment of the things that are determined, shall she continue in\ndesolation. Thou expectest and hopest that, at the coming of Christ, Israel shall be gathered\ntogether from all regions, and Jerusalem shall be built up and inhabited. But Daniel testifies that,\nwhen Christ comes and is slain, Jerusalem shall be destroyed, and shall continue in desolation until\nthe accomplishment of the things which are determined, forever. And concerning the suffering of\nChrist, David said:-They pierced my hands and my feet, and all my bones cried out. They gazed and\nlooked upon me, and divided my garments amongst them, and upon my vesture did they cast the\nlot.[fn-44-P4482_1498258:29-nf] And Isaiah said:-Lo! My\nservant shall be known and shall be revealed and shall be lifted up, so that many shall be astonished\nat Him.

David was not\nslain; for he died in a good old age, and was buried in Bethlehem. And if they should say that it is\nspoken of Saul, for Saul was killed in the mountains of Gilboa in the battle with the Philistines,\nand if they should say that they pierced his hands and his feet, when they fastened up his\nbody on the wall of Bethshan; yet it does not fitly apply to Saul. When the limbs of Saul were\npierced, his bones were not conscious of suffering, because he was dead. It was after Saul died, that\nthey hanged his body and those of his sons on the wall of Bethshan. But when David said, They\npierced my hands and my feet, and all my bones cried out, he said in the next verse:-O God,\nabide for my help, and deliver my soul from the sword.[fn-44-P4487_1499757:34-nf] Now Christ was delivered from the sword, and\nascended from out of Sheol, and revived and rose the third day, and so God abode for His help.\nBut Saul called upon the Lord and He did not answer him; and he asked through the Prophets, but no\nanswer was given to him. And he disguised himself and inquired by soothsayers, and learned from\nthence. He was worsted before the Philistines, and he slew himself with his own sword, when he saw\nthat the battle had overcome him. Moreover in this passage David said:-I will declare Thy name\nunto my brethren, and in the midst of the congregation will I glorify Thee.[fn-44-P4488_1500385:35-nf] How can these things apply to Saul? And again\nDavid said:-Thou didst not give Thy holy one to see corruption.[fn-44-P4489_1500514:36-nf] But all these things fitly apply to Christ. When\nHe came to them, they did not receive Him; but wickedly judged Him by false witness. And He was hung\nupon the tree by His hands, and they pierced His hands and His feet with the nails which they\nfastened in him; and all His bones cried out. And on that day a great prodigy happened. namely, that\nthe light became dark in the middle of the day, as Zechariah prophesied, saying:-The day shall be\nknown unto the Lord. It shall not be daytime, and it shall not be night; and at the evening time\nthere shall be light.[fn-44-P4490_1501095:37-nf] Now what is the\nday that was distinguished by the prodigy, that it was neither daytime nor night, and that at the\nevening time there was light? Evidently the day on which they crucified Him, for in the midst of that\nday there came darkness, and at the evening time there was light. And again he said:-That day\nthere shall be cold and frost.[fn-44-P4491_1501455:38-nf] -As\nthou knowest, on that day on which they crucified Him, it was cold, and they had made them a fire to\nwarm themselves when Simon came and stood with them.

He who hath seen me, hath seen the Father also.\"[fn-103-P10395_3272821:220-nf] But let him learn what he does not understand. Philip is reproved, and rightly, and deservedly indeed, because he has said, \"Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\"[fn-103-P10396_3273015:221-nf] For when had he either heard from Christ, or learnt that Christ was the Father? although, on the other hand, he had frequently heard, and had often learned, rather that He was the Son, not that He was the Father. For what the Lord said, \"If ye have known me, ye have known my Father also: and henceforth ye have known Him, and have seen Him,\"[fn-103-P10397_3273379:222-nf] He said not as wishing to be understood Himself to be the Father, but implying that he who thoroughly, and fully, and with all faith and all religiousness, drew near to the Son of God, by all means shall attain, through the Son Himself, in whom he thus believes, to the Father, and shall see Him. \"For no one,\" says He, \"can come to the Father, but by me.\"[fn-103-P10398_3273757:223-nf] And therefore he shall not only come to God the Father, and shall know the Father Himself; but, moreover, he ought thus to hold, and so to presume in mind and heart, that he has henceforth not only known, but seen the Father. For often the divine Scripture announces things that are not yet done as being done, because thus they shall be; and things which by all means have to happen, it does not predict as if they were future, but narrates as if they were done. And thus, although Christ had not been born as yet in the times of Isaiah the prophet, he said, \"For unto us a child is born; \"[fn-103-P10399_3274371:224-nf] and although Mary had not yet been approached, he said, \"' And I approached unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.\"[fn-104-P10400_3274524:225-nf] And when Christ had not yet made known the mind of the Father, it is said, \"And His name shall be called the Angel of Great Counsel.\"[fn-104-P10401_3274680:226-nf] And when He had not yet suffered, he declared, \"He is as a sheep led to the slaughter.\"[fn-104-P10402_3274820:227-nf] And although the cross had never yet existed, He said, \"All day long have I stretched out my hands to an unbelieving people.\"[fn-104-P10403_3274968:228-nf] And although not yet had He been scornfully given to drink, the Scripture says, \"In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.\"[fn-104-P10404_3275115:229-nf] And although He had not yet been stripped, He said, \"Upon my vesture they did cast lots, and they numbered my bones: they pierced my hands and my feet.\"[fn-104-P10405_3275290:230-nf] For the divine Scripture, foreseeing, speaks of things which it knows shall be as being already done, and speaks of things as perfected which it regards as future, but which shall come to pass without any doubt. And thus the Lord in the present passage said, \"Henceforth ye have known and have seen Him.\" Now He said that the Father should be seen by whomsoever had followed the Son, not as if the Son Himself should be the Father seen, but that whosoever was willing to follow Him, and be His disciple, should obtain the reward of being able to see the Father. For He also is the image of God the Father; so that it is added, moreover, to these things, that \"as the Father worketh, so also the Son worketh.\"[fn-104-P10406_3276024:231-nf] And the Son is an imitator[fn-104-P10407_3276071:232-nf] of all the Father's works, so that every one may regard it just as if he saw the Father, when he sees Him who always imitates the invisible Father in all His works. But if Christ is the Father Himself, in what manner does He immediately add, and say, \"Whosoever believeth in me, the works that I do he shall do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father?[fn-104-P10408_3276496:233-nf] And He further subjoins, \"If ye love me, keep my commandments; and I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter.\"[fn-104-P10409_3276649:234-nf] After which also He adds this: \"If any one loveth me, he shall keep my word: and my Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and will make our abode with him.\"[fn-104-P10410_3276842:235-nf] Moreover, also, He added this too: \"But the Advocate, that Holy Spirit whom the Father will send, He will teach you, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\"[fn-104-P10411_3277057:236-nf] He utters, further, that passage when He shows Himself to be the Son, and reasonably subjoins, and says, \"If ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.\"[fn-104-P10412_3277283:237-nf] But what shall we say when He also continues in these words: \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit He purgeth, that it may bring forth more fruit? \"[fn-104-P10413_3277564:238-nf] Still He persists, and adds: \"As the Father hath loved me, so also have I loved you: remain in my love. If ye have kept my commandments, ye shall remain in my love; even as I have kept the Father's commandments, and remain in His love.\"[fn-104-P10414_3277821:239-nf] Further, He says in addition: \"But I have called you friends; for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\"[fn-104-P10415_3277983:240-nf] Moreover, He adds to all this: \"But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not Him that sent me.\"[fn-104-P10416_3278141:241-nf] These things then, after the former, evidently attesting Him to be not the Father but the Son, the Lord would never have added, if He had had it in mind, either that He was the Father, or wished Himself to be understood as the Father, except that He might declare this, that every man ought henceforth to consider, in seeing the image of God the Father through the Son, that it was as if he saw the Father; since every one believing on the Son may be exercised in the contemplation of the likeness, so that, being accustomed to seeing the divinity in likeness, he may go forward, and grow even to the perfect contemplation of God the Father Almighty. And since he who has imbibed this truth into his mind and soul, and has believed of all things that thus it shall be, he shall even now see, as it were, in some measure the Father whom he will see hereafter; and he may so regard it, as if he actually held, what he knows for certain that he shall one day hold. But if Christ Himself had been the Father, why did He promise as future, a reward which He had already granted and given? For that He says, \"Blessed are they of a pure heart, for they shall see God,\"[fn-104-P10417_3279325:242-nf] it is understood to promise the contemplation and vision of the Father; therefore He had not given this; for why should He promise if He had already given? For He had given if He was the Father: for He was seen, and He was touched, But since, when Christ Himself is seen and touched, He still promises, and says that he who is of a pure heart shall see God, He proves by this very saying that He who was then present was not the Father, seeing that He was seen, and yet promised that whoever should be of a pure heart should see the Father. It was therefore not the Father, but the Son, who promised this, because He who was the Son promised that which had yet to be seen; and His promise would have been superfluous unless He had been the Son. For why did He promise to the pure in heart that they should see the Father, if already they who were then present saw Christ as the Father?

Let us, on the other hand, be walking always in the way, till we reach the end to which it leads; let us nowhere tarry in it till we reach the proper place of abode: and so we shall both persevere in our seeking, and be making some attainments in our finding, and, thus seeking and finding, be passing on to that which remains, till the very end of all seeking shall be reached in that world where perfection shall admit of no further effort at advancement. Let these prefatory remarks, dearly beloved, make your Charity attentive to this discourse of our Lord's, which He addressed to the disciples before His passion: for it is profound in itself; and where, in particular, the preacher purposes to expend much labor, the hearer ought not to be remiss in attention.","title":"Tractate LXIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":69,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_200_sermon_lv_on_the_lord_s_passion_iv_delivered_on_wednesday_in_holy_week_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"But the chief priests, for whom the Saviour sought forgiveness, rendered the torture of the cross yet worse by the barbs of railery; and at Him, on Whom they could vent no more fury with their hands, they hurled the weapons of their tongues, saying, \"He saved others; Himself he cannot save.

But what says He next? \"Hereafter I will not talk much with you; for the prince of this world cometh;\" and who is that, but the devil? \"And hath nothing in me;\" that is to say, no sin at all. For by such words He points to the devil, as the prince, not of His creatures, but of sinners, whom He here designates by the name of this world. And as often as the name of the world is used in a bad sense, He is pointing only to the lovers of such a world; of whom it is elsewhere recorded, \"Whosoever will be a friend of this world, becomes the enemy of God.\"[fn-28-P2856_1648884:7-nf] Far be it from us, then, so to understand the devil as prince of the world, as if he wielded the government of the whole world, that is, of heaven and earth, and all that is in them; of which sort of world it was said, when we were lecturing on Christ the Word, \"And the world was made by Him.\"[fn-28-P2857_1649194:8-nf] The whole world therefore, from the highest heavens to the lowest earth, is subject to the Creator, not to the deserter; to the Redeemer, not to the destroyer; to the Deliverer, not to the enslaver; to the Teacher, not to the deceiver. And in what sense the devil is to be understood as the prince of the world, is still more clearly unfolded by the Apostle Paul, who, after saying, \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood,\" that is, against men, went on to say, \"but against principalities and powers, and the world-rulers of this darkness.\"[fn-28-P2858_1649753:9-nf] For in the very next word he has explained what he meant by \"world,\" when he added, \"of this darkness;\" so that no one, by the name of the world, should understand the whole creation, of which in no sense are fallen angels the rulers. \"Of this darkness,\" he says, that is, of the lovers of this world: of whom, nevertheless, there were some elected, not from any deserving of their own, but by the grace of God, to whom he says, \"Ye were sometimes darkness; but now are ye light in the Lord.\"[fn-28-P2859_1650360:10-nf] For all have been under the rulers of this darkness, that is, [under the rulers] of wicked men, or darkness, as it were, in subjection to darkness: but \"thanks be to God, who hath delivered us,\" says the same apostle, \"from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.\"[fn-28-P2860_1650688:11-nf] And in Him the prince of this world, that is, of this darkness, had nothing; for neither did He come with sin as God, nor had His flesh any hereditary taint of sin in its procreation by the Virgin. And, as if it were said to Him, Why, then, dost Thou die, if Thou hast no sin to merit the punishment of death? He immediately added, \"But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do: arise, let us go hence.\" For He was sitting at table with those who were similarly occupied. But \"let us go,\" He said, and whither, but to the place where He, who had nothing in Him deserving of death, was to be delivered up to death? But He had the Father's commandment to die, as the very One of whom it had been foretold, \"Then I paid for that which I took not away;\"[fn-28-P2861_1651518:12-nf] and so appointed to pay death to the full, while owing it nothing, and to redeem us from the death that was our due. For Adam had seized on sin as a prey, when, deceived, he presumptuously stretched forth his hand to the tree, and attempted to invade the incommunicable name of that Godhead I which was disallowed him, and with which the Son of God was endowed by nature, and not by robbery.","title":"Tractate LXXIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":69,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_234_book_vii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"That your Excellency, though placed in so great a tumult of affairs, is full of the fruitfulness of the sacred word, and incessantly pants after eternal joys, for this I give great thanks to Almighty God, in that in you I see fulfilled what is written of the elect fathers, But the children of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea (Exod. xv. 19).

The Holy God Holy God has promised a happy of issue out of all their infirmities to those that trust in Him. We, therefore, though we have been cut off in a mid-ocean of troubles, though we are tossed by the great waves raised up against us by the spirits of wickedness, nevertheless hold out in Christ Who strengthens us. We have not slackened the strength of our zeal for the Churches, nor, as though despairing of our salvation, while the billows in the tempest rise above our heads, do we look to be destroyed. On the contrary, we are still holding out with all possible earnestness, remembering how even he who was swallowed by the sea monster, because he did not despair of his life, but cried to the Lord, was saved. Thus too we, though we have reached the last pitch of peril, do not give up our hope in God. On every side we see His succour round about us. For these reasons now we turn our eyes to you, right honourable brethren. In many an hour of our affliction we have expected that you would be at our side; and disappointed in that hope we have said to ourselves, \"I looked for some to take pity and there was none; and for comforters but I found none.\"[fn-56-P5607_1763085:3-nf] Our sufferings are such as to have reached the confines of the empire; and since, when one member suffers, all the members suffer,[fn-56-P5608_1763233:4-nf] it is doubtless right that your pity should be shown to us who have been so long in trouble.
