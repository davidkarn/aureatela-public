Nevertheless it was His pleasure that He should be born as a man, that in all things He might be like His supreme FatherÂ· For God the Father Himself, who is the origin and source of all things, inasmuch as He is without parents, is most truly named by Trismegistus \"fatherless\" and \"motherless,\"[fn-13-P1301_562201:125-nf] because He was born from no one. For which reason it was befitting that the Son also should be twice born, that He also might become \"fatherless\" and \"motherless.\" For in His first nativity, which was spiritual, He was \"motherless,\" because He was begotten by God the Father alone, without the office of a mother. But in His second, which was in the flesh, He was born of a virgin's womb without the office of a father, that, bearing a middle substance between God and man, He might be able, as it were, to take by the hand this frail and weak nature of ours, and raise it to immortality. He became both the Son of God through the Spirit, and the Son of man through the flesh,-that is, both God and man. The power of God was displayed in Him, from the works which He performed; the frailty of the man, from the passion which He endured: on what account He undertook it I will mention a little later. In the meantime, we learn from the predictions of the prophets that He was both God and man-composed[fn-13-P1302_563288:126-nf] of both natures. Isaiah testifies that He was God in these words:[fn-13-P1303_563787:127-nf] \"Egypt is wearied,[fn-13-P1304_563830:128-nf] and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabaeans, men of stature, shall come over unto Thee, and shall be Thy servants: and they shall walk behind Thee; in chains they shall fall down unto Thee, and shall make supplication unto Thee, Since God is in Thee, and there is no other God besides Thee. For Thou art God, and we knew Thee not, the God of Israel, the Savour. They shall all be confounded and ashamed who oppose Thee, and shall fall into confusion.\" In like manner the prophet Jeremiah[fn-13-P1305_564389:129-nf] thus speaks: \"This is our God, and there shall none other be compared unto Him. He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant, and to Israel His beloved. Afterward He was seen upon earth, and dwelt among men.\"David also, in the forty-fourth Psalm:[fn-13-P1306_564809:130-nf] \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness.\" By which word he also shows His name, since (as I have shown above) He was called Christ from His anointing. Then, that He was also man, Jeremiah teaches, saying:[fn-13-P1307_565217:131-nf] \"And He is a man, and who hath known Him? \"Also Isaiah:[fn-13-P1308_565337:132-nf] \"And God shall send to them a man, who shall save them, shall save them by judging.\" But Moses also, in Numbers,[fn-13-P1309_565499:133-nf] thus speaks: \"There shall arise a star out of Jacob, and a man[fn-13-P1310_565761:134-nf] shall spring forth from Israel.\" On which account the Milesian Apollo,[fn-13-P1311_565970:135-nf] being asked whether He was God or man, replied in this manner: \"He was mortal as to His body, being wise with wondrous works; but being taken with arms under Chaldean judges, with nails and the cross He endured a bitter end.\" In the first verse he spoke the truth, but he skilfully deceived him who asked the question, who was entirely ignorant of the mystery of the truth. For he appears to have denied that He was God. But when he acknowledges that He was mortal as to the flesh, which we also declare, it follows that as to the spirit He was God, which we affirm. For why would it have been necessary to make mention of the flesh, since it was sufficient to say that He was mortal? But being pressed by the truth, he could not deny the real state of the case; as that which he says, that He was wise.","title":"Book IV.

As the brief compass of a letter does not suffer us to delay too long on a single point, let us now pass to those which remain. In explaining the testimony of the apostle, \"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise, also, the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife,\"[fn-15-P1544_349566:1054-nf] we have subjoined the following:[fn-15-P1545_349623:1055-nf] \"The entire question relates to those who are living in wedlock, whether it is lawful for them to put away their wives, a thing which the Lord also has forbidden in the Gospel.[fn-15-P1546_349824:1056-nf] Hence, also, the apostle says: `It is good for a man not to touch' a wife or `a woman,'[fn-15-P1547_349935:1057-nf] as if there were danger in the contact which he who should so touch one could not escape. Accordingly, when the Egyptian woman desired to touch Joseph he flung away his cloak and fled from her hands.[fn-15-P1548_350159:1058-nf] But as he who has once married a wife cannot, except by consent, abstain from intercourse with her or repudiate her, so long as she does not sin, he must render unto his wife her due,[fn-15-P1549_350384:1059-nf] because he has of his own free will bound himself to render it under compulsion.\" Can one who declares that it is a precept of the Lord that wives should not be put away, and that what God has joined together man must not, without consent, put asunder[fn-15-P1550_350665:1060-nf] -can such an one be said to condemn marriage? Again, in the verses which follow, the apostle says: \"But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.\"[fn-15-P1551_350879:1061-nf] In explanation of this saying we made the following remarks:[fn-15-P1552_350964:1062-nf] \"What I myself would wish, he says, is clear. But since there are diversities of gifts in the church,[fn-15-P1553_351090:1063-nf] I allow marriage as well, that I may not appear to condemn nature. Reflect, too, that the gift of virginity is one thing, that of marriage another. For had there been one reward for married women and for virgins he would never, after giving the counsel of continence, have gone on to say: `But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner and another after that.' Where each class has its proper gift, there must be some distinction between the classes. I allow that marriage, as well as virginity, is the gift of God, but there is a great difference between gift and gift. Finally, the apostle himself says of one who had lived in incest and afterwards repented: `Contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him,'[fn-15-P1554_351857:1064-nf] and `To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also.'[fn-15-P1555_351931:1065-nf] And, lest we might suppose a man's gift to be but a small thing, he has added: `For if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the sight[fn-15-P1556_352125:1066-nf] of Christ.'[fn-15-P1557_352157:1067-nf] The gifts of Christ are different. Hence Joseph as a type of Him had a coat of many colors.[fn-15-P1558_352273:1068-nf] So in the forty-fourth psalm[fn-15-P1559_352328:1069-nf] we read of the Church: `Upon thy right hand did stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colors.'[fn-15-P1560_352503:1070-nf] The apostle Peter, too, speaks (of husbands and wives) `as being heirs together of the manifold grace of God.'[fn-15-P1561_352643:1071-nf] In Greek the expression is still more striking, the word used being poiai/lh, that is, `many-colored.'\"","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":45,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"651","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3.

But because these things are known to men, in that they are done by men, they may well meet with reverence as being holy things, but they cannot cause wonder as being miracles. And therefore those things which are done by angels are the more wonderful to us, in that they are more difficult and more known; but they are known and easy to them as being their own actions. An angel speaks in the person of God to man, saying, \"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;\" the Scripture having said just before, \"The angel of the Lord appeared to him.\"[fn-7-P748_286662:49-nf] And a man also speaks in the person of God, saying, \"Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee, O Israel: I am the Lord thy God.\"[fn-7-P749_286818:50-nf] A rod was taken to serve as a sign, and was changed into a serpent by angelical power;[fn-7-P750_286928:51-nf] but although that power is wanting to man, yet a stone was taken also by man for a similar sign.[fn-7-P751_287043:52-nf] There is a wide difference between the deed of the angel and the deed of the man. The former is both to be wondered at and to be understood, the latter only to be understood. That which is understood from both, is perhaps one and the same; but those things from which it is understood, are different. Just as if the name of God were written both in gold and in ink; the former would be the more precious, the latter the more worthless; yet that which is signified in both is one and the same. And although the serpent that came from Moses' rod signified the same thing as Jacob's stone, yet Jacob's stone signified something better than did the serpents of the magicians. For as the anointing of the stone signified Christ in the flesh, in which He was anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows;[fn-7-P752_287871:53-nf] so the rod of Moses, turned into a serpent, signified Christ Himself made obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.[fn-7-P753_288012:54-nf] Whence it is said, \"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life;.\"[fn-7-P754_288226:55-nf] just as by gazing on that serpent which was lifted up in the wilderness, they did not perish by the bites of the serpents. For \"our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed.\"[fn-7-P755_288454:56-nf] For by the serpent death is understood, which was wrought by the serpent in paradise,[fn-7-P756_288557:57-nf] the mode of speech expressing the effect by the efficient. Therefore the rod passed into the serpent, Christ into death; and the serpent again into the rod, whole Christ with His body into the resurrection; which body is the Church;[fn-7-P757_288805:58-nf] and this shall be in the end of time, signified by the tail, which Moses held, in order that it might return into a rod.[fn-7-P758_288943:59-nf] But the serpents of the magicians, like those who are dead in the world, unless by believing in Christ they shall have been as it were swallowed up by,[fn-7-P759_289111:60-nf] and have entered into, His body, will not be able to rise again in Him. Jacob's stone, therefore, as I said, signified something better than did the serpents of the magicians; yet the deed of the magicians was much more wonderful.

In his forged fables Valentinus maintained a distinction between the only-begotten and the Word, and further between the Christ within the pleroma and Jesus, and also the Christ who is without. He said that Jesus became man, by putting on the Christ that is without, and assuming a body of the substance of the soul; and that He made a passage only through the Virgin, having assumed nothing of the nature of man. Basilides in like manner distinguished between the only-begotten, the Word and the Wisdom. Cerdon, on the other hand, Marcion, and Manes, said that the Christ appeared as man, though he had nothing human. Cerinthus maintained that Jesus was generated of Joseph and Mary after the common manner of men, but that the Christ came down from on high on Jesus. The Ebionites, the Theodotians, the Artemonians, and Photinians said that the Christ was bare man born of the Virgin. Arius and Eunomius taught that He assumed a body, but that the Godhead discharged the function of the soul. Apollinarius held that the body of the Saviour had a soul,[fn-7-P790_119873:148-nf] but had not the reasonable soul; for, according to his views, intelligence was superfluous, God the Word being present. I have stated the opinions taught by the majority of heresies with the wish of making plain the truth taught by the church. Now the church makes no distinction between (ton auton onomazei) the Son, the only begotten, God the Word, the Lord the Saviour, and Jesus Christ. `Son,' `only begotten,' `God the Word,' and `Lord,' He was called before the Incarnation; and is so called also after the Incarnation; but after the Incarnation the same (Lord) was called Jesus Christ, deriving the titles from the facts. `Jesus' is interpreted to mean the Saviour, whereof Gabriel is witness in his words to the Virgin `Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins.'[fn-7-P791_120696:149-nf] But He was styled `Christ' on account of the unction of the Spirit. So the Psalmist David says `Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.'[fn-7-P792_120900:150-nf] And through the Prophet Isaiah the Lord Himself says `The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me.'[fn-7-P793_121044:151-nf] Thus the Lord Himself taught us to understand the prophecy, for when He had come into the synagogue, and opened the book of the Prophets, He read the passage quoted, and said to those present `This day is the Scripture fulfilled in your ears.'[fn-7-P794_121307:152-nf] The great Peter, too, preached in terms harmonious with the prophets, for in his explanation of the mystery to Cornelius he said `That word ye know which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee after the Baptism which John preached; how God anointed Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost and with power.'[fn-7-P795_121647:153-nf] Hence it is clear that He is called Christ on account of the unction of the spirit. But he was anointed not as God, but as man. And as in His human nature He was anointed, after the Incarnation He was called also `Christ.' But yet there is no distinction between God the Word and the Christ, for God the Word incarnate was named Christ Jesus. And He was incarnate that He might renew the nature corrupted by sin. The reason of His taking all the nature which had sinned was that He might heal all. For He did not take the nature of the body using it as a veil of His Godhead, according to the wild teaching of Arius and Eunomius; for it had been easy for Him even without a body to be made visible as He was seen of old by Abraham, Jacob and the rest of the saints. But he wished the very nature that had been worsted to beat down the enemy and win the victory. For this reason He took both a body and a reasonable soul. For Holy Scripture does not divide man in a threefold division, but states that this living being consists of a body and a soul.[fn-7-P796_122728:154-nf] For God after forming the body out of the dust breathed into it the soul and shewed it to be two natures not three. And the same Lord in the Gospels says, `Fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul,'[fn-7-P797_122990:155-nf] and many similar passages may be found in divine Scripture. And that He did not assume man's nature in its perfection, contriving it as a veil for His Godhead, according to the heretics' fables, but achieving victory by means of the first fruits for the whole race, is truly witnessed and accurately taught by the divine apostle, for in His Epistle to the Romans, when unveiling the mystery of the Incarnation, he writes `Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: for until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them who had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of Him that is to come.'[fn-7-P798_123817:156-nf] ","title":"Prolegomena","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":45,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_09_homily_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But wherefore dost thou search out thine own doings, and bring them out before us continually?

For probably, if this were our business, we should not have any other, but should spend all our time upon it: decking the bondmaid with countess decorations, but letting her who is the mistress of this bond-maid lie perpetually in a state of deformity and neglect. For this reason God, having delivered us from this vain occupation, implanted in us the power of working upon the nobler element, and he who cannot turn an ugly body into a comely on, can raise the soul, even when it has been reduced to the extremity of ugliness, to the very acme of grace, and make it so amiable and desirable that not only are good men brought to long after it but even He who is the sovereign and God of all, even as the Psalmist also when discoursing concerning this beauty, said \"And the king shall have desire of thy beauty.\"[fn-6-P669_391705:50-nf] Seest thou not also that in the houses of prostitutes the women who are ugly and shameless would hardly be accepted by prize-fighters, and runaway slaves, and gladiators: but should any comely, well-born and modest woman, owing to some mischance, have been reduced to this necessity, no man, even amongst those who are very illustrious and great, would be ashamed of marriage with her? Now if there is so much pity amongst men, and so much disdain of glory as to release from that bondage the women who have often been disgraced in the brothel, and to place them in the position of wives, much more is this the case with God, and those souls which, owing to the usurpation of the devil, have then from their original noble condition into the harlotry of this present life. And you will find the prophets filled with examples of this kind, when they address Jerusalem; for she fell into fornication, and a novel form of it, even as Ezekiel says: \"To all harlots wages are given, but thou hast given wages to thy lovers, and there hath been perversion in thee beyond all other women,\"[fn-6-P670_392807:51-nf] and again another saith \"Thou didst sit waiting for them like a deserted bird.\"[fn-6-P671_392940:52-nf] This one then who hath committed fornication in this fashion God calls back again. For the captivity which took place was not so much by way of vengeance as for the purpose of conversion and amendment since if God had wished to punish them out-fight He would not again have brought them back to their home. He would not have established their city and their temple in greater splendour than before: \"For the final glory of this house\" He said \"shall exceed the former.\"[fn-6-P672_393429:53-nf] Now if God did not exclude from repentance her who who had many times committed fornication, much more will He embrace My soul, which has now fallen for the first time. For certainly there is no lover of corporeal beauty, even if he be very frantic, who is so inflamed will the love of his mistress as God longs after the salvation of our souls; and this we may perceive both from the divine Scriptures. See at least, both in the introduction of Jeremiah, and many other places of the prophets, when He is despised and contemned, how He again hastens forward and pursues the friendship of those who turn away from him; which also He Himself made dear in the Gospels saying, \"O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?\"[fn-6-P673_394349:54-nf] And Paul writing to the Corinthians said \"that God was in Christ reconciling the word unto Himself, not reckoning their trespasses unto them, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

Take the case of the man who outraged his step-mother. Does not the Apostle, after delivering him, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that his spirit might be saved, in the second Epistle take the offender back and strive to prevent a brother from being swallowed up by overmuch grief. The Apostle's wish is one thing, his pardon another. If a wish be expressed, it confers a right; if a thing is only called pardonable, we are wrong in using it. If you wish to know the Apostle's real mind, you must take in what follows: \"but I would that all men were as I am.\" Happy is the man who is like Paul! Fortunate is he who attends to the Apostle's command, not to his concession. This, says he, I wish, this I desire that ye be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ, who was a Virgin born of a Virgin, uncorrupt of her who was uncorrupt. We, because we are men, cannot imitate our Lord's nativity; but we may at least imitate His life. The former was the blessed prerogative of divinity, the latter belongs to our human condition and is part of human effort. I would that all men were like me, that while they are like me, they may also become like Christ, to whom I am like.

But since in the Church there is a diversity of gifts, I acquiesce in marriage, lest I should seem to condemn nature. At the same time consider, that the gift of virginity is one, that of marriage, another. For were the reward the same for the married and for virgins, he would never after enjoining continence have said:[fn-61-P6186_1865742:45-nf] \"Each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.\" Where there is a distinction in one particular, there is a diversity also in other points. I grant that even marriage is a gift of God, but between gift and gift there is great diversity. In fact the Apostle himself speaking of the same person who had repented of his incestuous conduct, says:[fn-61-P6187_1866141:46-nf] \"so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, and to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also.\" And that we might not think a man's gift contemptible, he added,[fn-61-P6188_1866352:47-nf] \"for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it, in the presence of Christ.\" There is diversity in the gifts of Christ.

Does not the Apostle, after delivering him, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that his spirit might be saved, in the second Epistle take the offender back and strive to prevent a brother from being swallowed up by overmuch grief. The Apostle's wish is one thing, his pardon another. If a wish be expressed, it confers a right; if a thing is only called pardonable, we are wrong in using it. If you wish to know the Apostle's real mind, you must take in what follows: \"but I would that all men were as I am.\" Happy is the man who is like Paul! Fortunate is he who attends to the Apostle's command, not to his concession. This, says he, I wish, this I desire that ye be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ, who was a Virgin born of a Virgin, uncorrupt of her who was uncorrupt. We, because we are men, cannot imitate our Lord's nativity; but we may at least imitate His life.

But since in the Church there is a diversity of gifts, I acquiesce in marriage, lest I should seem to condemn nature. At the same time consider, that the gift of virginity is one, that of marriage, another. For were the reward the same for the married and for virgins, he would never after enjoining continence have said:[fn-61-P6186_1865742:45-nf] \"Each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.\" Where there is a distinction in one particular, there is a diversity also in other points. I grant that even marriage is a gift of God, but between gift and gift there is great diversity. In fact the Apostle himself speaking of the same person who had repented of his incestuous conduct, says:[fn-61-P6187_1866141:46-nf] \"so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, and to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also.\" And that we might not think a man's gift contemptible, he added,[fn-61-P6188_1866352:47-nf] \"for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it, in the presence of Christ.\" There is diversity in the gifts of Christ.

I pass to the Song of Songs, and whereas our opponent thinks it makes altogether for marriage, I shall show that it contains the mysteries of virginity. Let us hear what the bride says before that the bridegroom comes to earth, suffers, descends to the lower world, and rises again.[fn-63-P6358_1955785:195-nf] \"We will make for thee likenesses of gold with ornaments of silver while the king sits at his table.\" Before the Lord rose again, and the Gospel shone, the bride had not gold, but likenesses of gold. As for the silver, however, which she professes to have at the marriage, she not only had silver ornaments, but she had them in variety-in widows, in the continent, and in the married. Then the bridegroom makes answer to the bride, and teaches her that the shadow of the old law has passed away, and the truth of the Gospel has come.[fn-63-P6359_1956395:196-nf] \"Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away, for lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.\" This relates to the Old Testament. Once more he speaks of the Gospel and of virginity: \"The flowers appear on the earth, the time of the pruning of vines has come.\" Does he not seem to you to say the very same thing that the Apostle says:[fn-63-P6360_1956774:197-nf] \"The time is shortened that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none\"? And more plainly does he herald chastity:[fn-63-P6361_1956938:198-nf] \"The voice,\" he says, \"of the turtle is heard in our land.\" The turtle, the chastest of birds, always dwelling in lofty places, is a type of the Saviour. Let us read the works of naturalists and we shall find that it is the nature of the turtle-dove, if it lose its mate, not to take another; and we shall understand that second marriage is repudiated even by dumb birds. And immediately the turtle says to its fellow:[fn-63-P6362_1957378:199-nf] \"The fig tree hath put forth its green figs,\" that is, the commandments of the old law have fallen, and the blossoming vines of the Gospel give forth their fragrance Whence the Apostle also says,[fn-63-P6363_1957592:200-nf] \"We are a sweet savour of Christ.\"[fn-63-P6364_1957649:201-nf] \"Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. O my dove, thou art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place. Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.\"[fn-63-P6365_1957917:202-nf] Whilst thou coveredst thy countenance like Moses and the veil of the law remained, I neither saw thy face, nor did I condescend to hear thy voice. I said,[fn-63-P6366_1958127:203-nf] \"Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear.\" But now with unveiled face behold my glory, and shelter thyself in the cleft and steep places of the solid rock. On hearing this the bride disclosed the mysteries of chastity:[fn-63-P6367_1958372:204-nf] \"My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth his flock among the lilies,\" that is among the pure virgin bands. Would you know what sort of a throne our true Solomon, the Prince of Peace, has, and what his attendants are like?[fn-63-P6368_1958620:205-nf] \"Behold,\" he says, \"it is the litter of Solomon: threescore mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel. They all handle the sword, and are expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh.\" They who are about Solomon have their sword upon their thigh, like Ehud, the left-handed judge, who slew the fattest of foes, a man devoted to the flesh, and cut short all his pleasures.[fn-63-P6369_1959048:206-nf] \"I will get me,\" he says, \"to the mountain of myrrh;\" to those, that is, who have mortified their bodies; \"and to the hill of frankincense,\" to the crowds of pure virgins; \"and I will say to my bride, thou art all fair, my love, and there is no spot in thee.\" Whence too the Apostle:[fn-63-P6370_1959352:207-nf] \"That he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.\"[fn-63-P6371_1959483:208-nf] \"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon. Thou shalt come[fn-63-P6372_1959579:209-nf] and pass on from the beginning of faith, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.\" Lebanon is, being interpreted, whiteness. Come then, fairest bride, concerning whom it is elsewhere said[fn-63-P6373_1959866:210-nf] \"Who is she that cometh up, all in white?\" and pass on by way of this world, from the beginning of faith, and from Sanir, which is by interpretation, God of light, as we read in the psalm:[fn-63-P6374_1960077:211-nf] \"Thy word is a lantern unto my feet, and light unto my path;\" and \"from Hermon,\" that is, consecration: and \"flee from the lions' dens, and the mountains of the leopards who cannot change their spots.\" Flee, he says, from the lions' dens, flee from the pride of devils, that when thou hast been consecrated to me, I may be able to say unto thee:[fn-63-P6375_1960445:212-nf] \"Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride, thou hast ravished mine heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.\" What he says is something like this-I do not reject marriage: you have a second eye, the left, which I have given to you on account of the weakness of those who cannot see the right. But I am pleased with the right eye of virginity, and if it be blinded the whole body is in darkness. And that we might not think he had in view carnal love and bodily marriage, he at once excludes this meaning by saying[fn-63-P6376_1961003:213-nf] \"Thou hast ravished my heart, my bride, my sister.\" The name sister excludes all suspicion of unhallowed love. \"How fair are thy breasts with wine,\" those breasts concerning which he had said above, My beloved is mine, and I am his: \"betwixt my breasts shall he lie,\" that is in the princely portion of the heart where the Word of God has its lodging. What wine is that which gives beauty to the breasts of the bride, and fills them with the milk of chastity? That, forsooth, of which the bridegroom goes on to speak:[fn-63-P6377_1961555:214-nf] \"I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends: yea, drink and be drunken, my brethren.\" Hence the Apostles also were said to be filled with new wine; with new, he says, not with old wine; because[fn-63-P6378_1961775:215-nf] new wine is put into fresh wine-skins, and they[fn-63-P6379_1961847:216-nf] did not walk in oldness of the letter, but in newness of the Spirit. This is wine wherewith when youths and maidens are intoxicated, they at once thirst for virginity; they are filled with the spirit of chastity, and the prophecy of Zechariah comes to pass, at least if we follow the Hebrew literally, for he prophesied concerning virgins:[fn-63-P6380_1962207:217-nf] \"And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof. For what is his goodness, and what is his beauty, but the corn of the elect, and wine that giveth birth to virgins?\" They are virgins of whom it is written in the forty-fifth psalm:[fn-63-P6381_1962646:218-nf] \"The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be led: they shall enter into the King's palace.\" 31. Then follows:[fn-63-P6382_1962857:219-nf] \"A garden shut up is my sister, my bride: a garden shut up, a fountain sealed.\" That which is shut up and sealed reminds us of the mother of our Lord who was a mother and a Virgin. Hence it was that no one before or after our Saviour was laid in his new tomb, hewn in the solid rock. And yet she that was ever a Virgin is the mother of many virgins. For next we read: \"Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates with precious fruits.\" By pomegranates and fruits is signified the blending of all virtues in virginity.[fn-63-P6383_1963409:220-nf] \"My beloved is white and ruddy\"; white in virginity, ruddy in martyrdom. And because He is white and ruddy, therefore it is immediately added[fn-63-P6384_1963571:221-nf] \"His mouth is most sweet, yea, he is altogether lovely.\" The virgin bridegroom having been praised by the virgin bride, in turn praises the virgin bride, and says to her:[fn-63-P6385_1963762:222-nf] \"How beautiful are thy feet in sandals,[fn-63-P6386_1963823:223-nf] O daughter of Aminadab,\" which is, being interpreted, a people that offereth itself willingly. For virginity is voluntary, and therefore the steps of the Church in the beauty of chastity are praised. This is not the time for me like a commentator to explain all the mysteries of virginity from the Song of Songs I have no doubt that the fastidious reader will turn up his nose at what has already been said.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":45,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"30.

For such expressions are customary in the Scriptures; and yet some persons, while maintaining the Catholic faith, do not carefully attend to them, in such wise that they think the words, \"God made man in the image of God,\" to mean that the Father made man after the image of the Son; and they thus desire to assert that the Son also is called God in the divine Scriptures, as if there were not other most true and clear proofs wherein the Son is called not only God, but also the true God. For whilst they aim at explaining another difficulty in this text, they become so entangled that they cannot extricate themselves. For if the Father made man after the image of the Son, so that he is not the image of the Father, but of the Son, then the Son is unlike the Father. But if a pious faith teaches us, as it does. that the Son is like the Father after an equality of essence, then that which is made in the likeness of the Son must needs also be made in the likeness of the Father. Further, if the Father made man not in His own image, but in the image of His Son, why does He not say, \"Let us make man afterThy image and likeness,\" whereas He does say, \"our;\" unless it be because the image of the Trinity was made in man, that in this way man should be the image of the one true God, because the Trinity itself is the one true God? Such expressions are innumerable in the Scriptures, but it will suffice to have produced these. It is so said in the Psalms, \"Salvation belongeth unto the Lord; Thy blessing is upon Thy people;\"[fn-15-P1524_747000:7-nf] as if the words were spoken to some one else, not to Him of whom it had been said, \"Salvation belongeth unto the Lord.\" And again, \"For by Thee,\" he says, \"I shall be delivered from temptation, and by hoping in my God I shall leap over the wall;\"[fn-15-P1525_747262:8-nf] as if he said to some one else, \"By Thee I shall be delivered from temptation.\" And again, \"In the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under Thee;\"[fn-15-P1526_747445:9-nf] as if he were to say, in the heart of Thy enemies. For he had said to that King, that is, to our Lord Jesus Christ, \"The people fall under Thee,\" whom he intended by the word King, when he said, \"In the heart of the king's enemies.\" Things of this kind are found more rarely in the New Testament. But yet the apostle says to the Romans, \"Concerning His Son who was made to Him of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ our Lord;\"[fn-15-P1527_748025:10-nf] as though he were speaking above of some one else. For what is meant by the Son of God declared by the resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ, except of the same Jesus Christ who was declared to be Son of God with power? And as then in this passage, when we are told, \"the Son of God with power of Jesus Christ,\" or \"the Son of God according to the spirit of holiness of Jesus Christ,\" or \"the Son of God by the resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ,\" whereas it might have been expressed in the ordinary way, In His own power, or according to the spirit of His own holiness, or by the resurrection of His dead, or of their dead: as, I says we are not compelled to understand another person, but one and the same, that is, the person of the Son of God our Lord Jesus Christ; so, when we are told that \"God made man in the image of God,\" although it might have been more usual to say, after His own image, yet we are not compelled to understand any other person in the Trinity, but the one and selfsame Trinity itself, who is one God, and after whose image man is made.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":45,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_13_to_pammachius_against_john_of_jerusalem","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"27. Here we have the complete explanation, of the fact that in your exposition of the faith, to deceive the ears of the ignorant, you nine times make mention of the body, and not even once of the flesh, and all the while men think that you confess the body of flesh, and that the flesh is identical with the body. If it is the same as the body, it means nothing different. I say this, for I know your answer: \"I thought the body was the same as the flesh; I spoke with all simplicity.\" Why do you not rather call it flesh to signify the body, and speak indifferently at one time of the flesh, at another of the body, that the body may be shown to consist of flesh, and the flesh to be the body. But believe me, your silence is not the silence of simplicity. For flesh is defined one way, the body another; all flesh is body, but not every body is flesh. Flesh is properly what is comprised in blood, veins, bones, and sinews. Although the body is also called flesh, yet sometimes it is designated ethereal or aÃ«rial, because it is not subject to touch and sight; and yet it is frequently both visible and tangible. A wall is a body, but is not flesh; a stone is a body, but it is not said to be flesh. Wherefore the Apostle calls some bodies celestial, some terrestrial. A celestial body is that of the sun, moon, stars; a terrestrial body is that of fire, air, water, and the rest, which bodies being inanimate are known as consisting of material elements. You see we understand your subtleties, and publish abroad the mysteries which you utter in the bedchamber and amongst the perfect, mysteries which may not reach the ears of outsiders. You smile, and with hand uplifted and a snap of the fingers retort,[fn-70-P7089_2334436:62-nf] \"All the glory of the king's daughter is within.\" And,[fn-70-P7090_2334509:63-nf] \"The king led me into his bedchamber.\" It is clear why you spoke of the resurrection of the body and not of that of the flesh; of course it was that we in our ignorance might think that when body was spoken of flesh was meant; while yet the perfect would understand that, when body was spoken of, flesh was denied. Lastly, the Apostle, in his Epistle to the Colossians, wishing to show that the body of Christ was made of flesh, and was not spiritual, aÃ«rial, attenuated, said significantly,[fn-70-P7091_2335018:64-nf] \"And you, when you were some time alienated from Christ and enemies of His spirit in evil works, He has reconciled in the body of His flesh through death.\" And again in the same Epistle:[fn-70-P7092_2335233:65-nf] \"In whom ye were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands in the putting off of the body of the flesh.\" If by body is meant flesh only, and the word is not ambiguous, nor capable of diverse significations, it was quite superfluous to use both expressions-bodily and of flesh-as though body did not imply flesh.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":45,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_14_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Perhaps that passage in the Proverbs might be brought forward against us which the champions of heresy are wont to cite as a testimony that the Lord was created-the passage, \"The Lord created me in the beginning of His ways, for His works[fn-13-P1327_716277:13-nf] .\" For because these words are spoken by Wisdom, and the Lord is called Wisdom by the great Paul[fn-13-P1328_716441:14-nf] , they allege this passage as though the Only-begotten God Himself, under the name of Wisdom, acknowledges that He was created by the Maker of all things. I imagine, however, that the godly sense of this utterance is clear to moderately attentive and painstaking persons, so that, in the case of those who are instructed in the dark sayings of the Proverbs, no injury is done to the doctrine of the faith. Yet I think it well briefly to discuss what is to be said on this subject, that when the intention of this passage is more clearly explained, the heretical doctrine may have no room for boldness of speech on the ground that it has evidence in the writing of the inspired author. It is universally admitted that the name of \"proverb,\" in its scriptural use, is not applied with regard to the evident sense, but is used with a view to some hidden meaning, as the Gospel thus gives the name of \"proverbs[fn-13-P1329_717367:15-nf] \" to dark and obscure sayings; so that the \"proverb,\" if one were to set forth the interpretation of the name by a definition, is a form of speech which, by means of one set of ideas immediately presented, points to something else which is hidden, or a form of speech which does not point out the aim of the thought directly, but gives its instruction by an indirect signification. Now to this book such a name is especially attached as a title, and the force of the appellation is at once interpreted in the preface by the wise Solomon. For he does not call the sayings in this book \"maxims,\" or \"counsels,\" or \"clear instruction,\" but \"proverbs,\" and proceeds to add an explanation. What is the force of the signification of this word? \"To know,\" he tells us, \"wisdom and instruction[fn-13-P1330_718183:16-nf] \"; not setting before us the course of instruction in wisdom according to the method common in other kinds of learning; he bids a man, on the other hand[fn-13-P1331_718353:17-nf] , first to become wise by previous training, and then so to receive the instruction conveyed by proverb. For he tells us that there are \"words of wisdom\" which reveal their aim \"by a turn[fn-13-P1332_718590:18-nf] .\" For that which is not directly understood needs some turn for the apprehension of the thing concealed; and as Paul, when about to exchange the literal sense of the history for figurative contemplation, says that he will \"change his voice[fn-13-P1333_718859:19-nf] ,\" so here the manifestation of the hidden meaning is called by Solomon a \"turn of the saying,\" as if the beauty of the thoughts could not be perceived, unless one were to obtain a view of the revealed brightness of the thought by turning the apparent meaning of the saying round about, as happens with the plumage with which the peacock is decked behind. For in him, one who sees the back of his plumage quite despises it for its want of beauty and tint, as a mean sight; but if one were to turn it round and show him the other view of it, he then sees the varied painting of nature, the half-circle shining in the midst with its dye of purple, and the golden mist round the circle ringed round and glistening at its edge with its many rainbow hues. Since then there is no beauty in what is obvious in the saying (for \"all the glory of the king's daughter is within[fn-13-P1334_719744:20-nf] ,\" shining with its hidden ornament in golden thoughts), Solomon of necessity suggests to the readers of this book \"the turn of the saying,\" that thereby they may \"understand a parable and a dark saying, words of the wise and riddles[fn-13-P1335_720003:21-nf] .\" Now as this proverbial teaching embraces these elements, a reasonable man will not receive any passage cited from this book, be it never so clear and intelligible at first sight, without examination and inspection; for assuredly there is some mystical contemplation underlying even those passages which seem manifest. And if the obvious passages of the work necessarily demand a somewhat minute scrutiny, how much more do those passages require it where even immediate apprehension presents to us much that is obscure and difficult?","title":"Book III","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":45,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_15_lecture_x_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"5.

If, however, he should teach that the immortal being of the soul also is sown along with the mortal body, he will not be believed; for the Almighty alone breathes into man the undying and undecaying part, as also it is He alone who is Creator of the invisible and indestructible. For, He says, He \"breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\"[fn-49-P4941_1491140:13-nf] And those artificers who, to the destruction of men, make images in human form, not perceiving and knowing their own Maker, are blamed by the Word, which says, in the Book of Wisdom, a book full of all virtue,[fn-49-P4942_1491367:14-nf] \"his heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay; forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and Him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit; \"[fn-49-P4943_1491710:15-nf] that is, God, the Maker of all men; therefore, also, according to the apostle, He \"will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.\"[fn-49-P4944_1491893:16-nf] And now, although this subject be scarcely completed, yet there are others which remain to be discussed. For when one thoroughly examines and understands those things which happen to man according to his nature, he will know not to despise the procreation of children, although he applauds chastity, and prefers it in honour. For although honey be sweeter and more pleasant than other things, we are not for that reason to consider other things bitter which are mixed up in the natural sweetness of fruits. And, in support of these statements, I will bring forward a trustworthy witness, namely, Paul, who says, \"So then he that giveth her[fn-49-P4945_1492552:17-nf] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth bet ter.\"[fn-49-P4946_1492760:18-nf] Now the word, in setting forth that which is better and sweeter, did not intend to take away the inferior, but arranges so as to assign to each its own proper use and advantage. For there are some to whom it is not given to attain virginity; and there are others whom He no longer wills to be excited by procreations to lust, and to be defiled, but henceforth to meditate and to keep the mind upon the transformation of the body to the likeness of angels, when they \"neither marry nor are given in marriage,\"[fn-49-P4947_1493290:19-nf] according to the infallible words of the Lord; since it is not given to all to attain that undefiled state of being a eunuch for the sake of the kingdom of heaven,[fn-49-P4948_1493475:20-nf] but manifestly to those only who are able to preserve the ever-blooming and unfading flower of virginity. For it is the custom of the prophetic Word to compare the Church to a flower covered and variegated meadow, adorned and crowned not only with the flowers of virginity, but also with those of child-bearing and of continence; for it is written, \"Upon thy[fn-49-P4949_1493854:21-nf] right hand did stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.\"[fn-49-P4950_1493966:22-nf] ","title":"Discourse II.-Theophila.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":45,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_23_book_xvii","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"For whatever direct and manifest prophetic utterances there may be about anything, it is necessary that those which are tropical should be mingled with them; which, chiefly on account of those of slower understanding, thrust upon the more learned the laborious task of clearing up and expounding them.

We have an example of this in that same Book of Psalms: \"My heart bubbled up a good matter: I utter my words to the king. My tongue is the pen of a scribe, writing swiftly.

For who is so untaught in this religion, or so deaf to its far and wide spread fame, as not to know that Christ is named from this chrism, that is, from this anointing? But when it is acknowledged that this King is Christ, let each one who is already subject to Him who reigns because of truth, meekness, and righteousness, inquire at his leisure into these other things that are here said tropically: how His form is beautiful beyond the sons of men, with a certain beauty that is the more to be loved and admired the less it is corporeal; and what His sword, arrows, and other things of that kind may be, which are set down, not properly, but tropically.","title":"Book XVII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":45,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_23_book_xvii","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Then let him look upon His Church, joined to her so great Husband in spiritual marriage and divine love, of which it is said in these words which follow, \"The queen stood upon Thy right hand in gold-embroidered vestments, girded about with variety.

Some there were who said, \"I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me;\"[fn-36-P3643_1397870:42-nf] and, \"There is no rest in my bones, by reason of my sins;\"[fn-36-P3644_1397945:43-nf] and, \"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts;\"[fn-36-P3645_1398053:44-nf] and, \"Stablish me with Thy directing Spirit;\"[fn-36-P3646_1398116:45-nf] and, \"Take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.\"[fn-36-P3647_1398174:46-nf] There were some, again, who said: \"I believed, therefore have I spoken.\"[fn-36-P3648_1398264:47-nf] For they too were cleansed with the self-same faith with which we ourselves are.

Speaking through the mouth of the holy Patriarch David, He says, Thy God, O God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows[fn-22-P2208_1415139:29-nf] , which refers to no less a mystery than the Dispensation of His assumption of flesh.

No one is fellow to the Only-begotten Christ, God the Word: but we know that we are His fellows by the assumption which made Him flesh. That anointing did not exalt the blessed and incorruptible Begotten Who abides in the nature of God, but it established the mystery of His body, and sanctified the manhood which He assumed.

Let us suppose, then, a conversation with a heathen inquirer, in which Faustus described us as making a poor appearance, though his own appearance was much more deplorable. If we say to the heathen, Believe in Christ, for He is God, and, on his asking for evidence, produce the authority of the prophets, if he says that he does not believe the prophets, because they are Hebrew and he is a Gentile, we can prove the truth of the prophets from the actual fulfillment of their prophecies. He could scarcely be ignorant of the persecutions suffered by the early Christians from the kings of this world; or if he was ignorant, he could be informed from history and the records of imperial laws. But this is what we find foretold long ago by the prophet, saying, \"Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the princes take counsel together against the Lord, and against His Christ.\" The rest of the Psalm shows that this is not said of David. For what follows might convince the most stubborn unbeliever: \"The Lord said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Thy possession.\"[fn-15-P1530_830341:8-nf] This never happened to the Jews, whose king, David was, but is now plainly fulfilled in the subjection of all nations to the name of Christ. This and many similar prophecies, which it would take too long to quote, would surely impress the mind of the inquirer. He would see these very kings of the earth now happily subdued by Christ, and all nations serving Him; and he would hear the words of the Psalm in which this was so long before predicted: \"All the kings of the earth shall bow down to Him; all nations shall serve Him.\"[fn-15-P1531_830888:9-nf] And if he were to read the whole of that Psalm, which is figuratively applied to Solomon, he would find that Christ is the true King of peace, for Solomon means peaceful; and he would find many things in the Psalm applicable to Christ, which have no reference at all to the literal King Solomon. Then there is that other Psalm where God is spoken of as anointed by God, the very word anointed pointing to Christ, showing that Christ is God, for God is represented as being anointed.[fn-15-P1532_831390:10-nf] In reading what is said in this Psalm of Christ and of the Church, he would find that what is there foretold is fulfilled in the present state of the world. He would see the idols of the nations perishing from off the earth, and he would find that this is predicted by the prophets, as in Jeremiah, \"Then shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth, and from under heaven;\"[fn-15-P1533_831843:11-nf] and again, \"O Lord, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto Thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit. Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?

We affirm that, as there are two conditions demonstrated by the prophets to belong to Christ, so these presignified the same number of advents; one, and that the first, was to be in lowliness,[fn-48-P4876_1543459:90-nf] when He had to be led as a sheep to be slain as a victim, and to be as a lamb dumb before the shearer, not opening His mouth, and not fair to look upon.[fn-48-P4877_1543629:91-nf] For, says (the prophet), we have announced concerning Him: \"He is like a tender plant,[fn-48-P4878_1543779:92-nf] like a root out of a thirsty ground; He hath no form nor comeliness; and we beheld Him, and He was without beauty: His form was disfigured; \"[fn-48-P4879_1543984:93-nf] \"marred more than the sons of men; a man stricken with sorrows, and knowing how to bear our infirmity; \"[fn-48-P4880_1544140:94-nf] \"placed by the Father as a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; \"[fn-48-P4881_1544246:95-nf] \"made by Him a little lower than the angels; \"[fn-48-P4882_1544312:96-nf] declaring Himself to be \"a worm and not a man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people.\"[fn-48-P4883_1544425:97-nf] Now these signs of degradation quite suit His first coming, just as the tokens of His majesty do His second advent, when He shall no longer remain \"a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence,\" but after His rejection become \"the chief corner-stone,\" accepted and elevated to the top place[fn-48-P4884_1544732:98-nf] of the temple, even His church, being that very stone in Daniel, cut out of the mountain, which was to smite and crush the image of the secular kingdom.[fn-48-P4885_1544934:99-nf] Of this advent the same prophet says: \"Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days; and they brought Him before Him, and there was given Him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away; and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.\"[fn-48-P4886_1545363:100-nf] Then indeed He shall have both a glorious form, and an unsullied beauty above the sons of men. \"Thou art fairer,\" says (the Psalmist), \"than the children of men; grace is poured into Thy lips; therefore God hath blessed Thee for ever. Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O most mighty, with Thy glory and Thy majesty.\"[fn-48-P4887_1545702:101-nf] For the Father, after making Him a little lower than the angels, \"will crown Him with glory and honour, and put all things under His feet.\"[fn-48-P4888_1545864:102-nf] \"Then shall they look on Him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him, tribe after tribe; \"[fn-48-P4889_1545992:103-nf] because, no doubt, they once refused to acknowledge Him in the lowliness of His human condition. He is even a man says Jeremiah, and who shall recognise Him Therefore, asks Isaiah, \"who shall declare His generation? \"[fn-48-P4890_1546236:104-nf] So also in Zechariah, Christ Jesus, the true High Priest of the Father, in the person of Joshua, nay, in the very mystery of His name,[fn-48-P4891_1546392:105-nf] is portrayed in a twofold dress with reference to both His advents. At first He is clad in sordid garments, that is to say, in the lowliness of suffering and mortal flesh: then the devil resisted Him, as the instigator of the traitor Judas, not to mention his tempting Him after His baptism: afterwards He was stripped of His first filthy raiment, and adorned with the priestly robe[fn-48-P4892_1546803:106-nf] and mitre, and a pure diadem;[fn-48-P4893_1546848:107-nf] in other words, with the glory and honour of His second advent.[fn-48-P4894_1546933:108-nf] If I may offer, moreover, an interpretation of the two goats which were presented on \"the great day of atonement,\"[fn-48-P4895_1547070:109-nf] do they not also figure the two natures of Christ?

One of these goats was bound[fn-48-P4896_1547406:110-nf] with scarlet,[fn-48-P4897_1547440:111-nf] and driven by the people out of the camp[fn-48-P4898_1547525:112-nf] into the wilderness,[fn-48-P4899_1547572:113-nf] amid cursing, and spitting, and pulling, and piercing,[fn-49-P4900_1547650:114-nf] being thus marked with all the signs of the Lord's own passion; while the other, by being offered up for sins, and given to the priests of the temple for meat, afforded proofs of His second appearance, when (after all sins have been expiated) the priests of the spiritual temple, that is, the church, are to enjoy the flesh, as it were,[fn-49-P4901_1548842:115-nf] of the Lord's own grace, whilst the residue go away from salvation without tasting it.[fn-49-P4902_1548996:116-nf] Since, therefore, the first advent was prophetically declared both as most obscure in its types, and as deformed with every kind of indignity, but the second as glorious and altogether worthy of God, they would on this very account, while confining their regards to that which they were easily able both to understand and to believe, even the second advent, be not undeservedly deceived respecting the more obscure, and, at any rate, the more lowly first coming. Accordingly, to this day they deny that their Christ has come, because He has not appeared in majesty, while they ignore the fact that He was to come also in lowliness.","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":45,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"ANF-03","text":"This interpretation of ours will derive confirmation, when, on your supposing that Christ is in any passage called a warrior, from the mention of certain arms and expressions of that sort, you weigh well the analogy of their other meanings, and draw your conclusions accordingly. \"Gird on Thy sword,\" says David, \"upon Thy thigh.\"[fn-50-P5003_1577578:195-nf] But what do you read about Christ just before? \"Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured forth upon Thy lips.\"[fn-50-P5004_1577726:196-nf] It amuses me to imagine that blandishments of fair beauty and graceful lips are ascribed to one who had to gird on His sword for war!

For this is what He says: \"Ride on prosperously in Thy majesty[fn-50-P5010_1579919:202-nf] \"-advancing His word into every land, so as to call all nations: destined to prosper in the success of that faith which received Him, and reigning, from the fact that[fn-50-P5011_1580128:203-nf] He conquered death by His resurrection. \"Thy right hand,\" says He, \"shall wonderfully lead Thee forth,\"[fn-50-P5012_1580251:204-nf] even the might of Thy spiritual grace, whereby the knowledge of Christ is spread. \"Thine arrows are sharp; \"[fn-50-P5013_1580392:205-nf] everywhere Thy precepts fly about, Thy threatenings also, and convictions[fn-50-P5014_1580485:206-nf] of heart, pricking and piercing each conscience. \"The people shall fall under Thee,\"[fn-50-P5015_1580591:207-nf] that is, in adoration. Thus is the Creator's Christ mighty in war, and a bearer of arms; thus also does He now take the spoils, not of Samaria alone, but of all nations. Acknowledge, then, that His spoils are figurative, since you have learned that His arms are allegorical. Since, therefore, both the Lord speaks and His apostle writes such things[fn-50-P5016_1580959:208-nf] in a figurative style, we are not rash in using His interpretations, the records[fn-50-P5017_1581057:209-nf] of which even our adversaries admit; and thus in so far will it be Isaiah's Christ who has come, in as far as He was not a warrior, because it is not of such a character that He is described by Isaiah.","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":45,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us compare with Scripture the rest of His dispensation. Whatever that poor despised body[fn-50-P5052_1590728:235-nf] may be, because it was an object of touch[fn-50-P5053_1590794:236-nf] and sight,[fn-50-P5054_1590821:237-nf] it shall be my Christ, be He inglorious, be He ignoble, be He dishonoured; for such was it announced that He should be, both in bodily condition and aspect. Isaiah comes to our help again: \"We have announced (His way) before Him,\" says he; \"He is like a servant,[fn-50-P5055_1591103:238-nf] like a root in a dry ground; He hath no form nor comeliness; we saw Him, and He had neither form nor beauty; but His form was despised, marred above all men.\"[fn-50-P5056_1591304:239-nf] Similarly the Father addressed the Son just before: \"Inasmuch as many will be astonished at Thee, so also will Thy beauty be without glory from men,\"[fn-50-P5057_1591509:240-nf] For although, in David's words, He is fairer than the children of men,\"[fn-50-P5058_1591602:241-nf] yet it is in that figurative state of spiritual grace, when He is girded with the sword of the Spirit, which is verily His form, and beauty, and glory. According to the same prophet, however, He is in bodily condition \"a very worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and an outcast of the people.\"[fn-50-P5059_1591915:242-nf] But no internal quality of such a kind does He announce as belonging to Him. In Him dwelt the fulness of the Spirit; therefore I acknowledge Him to be \"the rod of the stem of Jesse.\" His blooming flower shall be my Christ, upon whom hath rested, according to Isaiah, \"the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of piety, and of the fear of the Lord.\"[fn-50-P5060_1592344:243-nf] Now to no man, except Christ, would the diversity of spiritual proofs suitably apply. He is indeed like a flower for the Spirit's grace, reckoned indeed of the stem of Jesse, but thence to derive His descent through Mary. Now I purposely demand of you, whether you grant to Him the destination[fn-50-P5061_1592660:244-nf] of all this humiliation, and suffering, and tranquillity, from which He will be the Christ of Isaiah,-a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, who was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and who, like a lamb before the shearer, opened not His mouth;[fn-50-P5062_1592932:245-nf] who did not struggle nor cry, nor was His voice heard in the street who broke not the bruised reed-that is, the shattered faith of the Jews-nor quenched the smoking flax-that is, the freshly-kindled[fn-50-P5063_1593155:246-nf] ardour of the Gentiles. He can be none other than the Man who was foretold. It is right that His conduct[fn-50-P5064_1593280:247-nf] be investigated according to the rule of Scripture, distinguishable as it is unless I am mistaken, by the twofold operation of preaching[fn-50-P5065_1593431:248-nf] and of miracle. But the treatment of both these topics I shall so arrange as to postpone, to the chapter wherein I have determined to discuss the actual gospel of Marcion, the consideration of His wonderful doctrines and miracles-with a view, however, to our present purpose. Let us here, then, in general terms complete the subject which we had entered upon, by indicating, as we pass on,[fn-50-P5066_1593844:249-nf] how Christ was fore-announced by Isaiah as a preacher: \"For who is there among you,\" says he, \"that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of His Son? \"[fn-50-P5067_1594015:250-nf] And likewise as a healer: \"For,\" says he, \"He hath taken away our infirmities, and carried our sorrows.\"[fn-50-P5068_1594139:251-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":45,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_22_book_xi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Not even Marcion himself, the patron of your opinions, supports you in this. It is true that in common with you he holds a dualism of gods, and thinks that one is different in nature from the other, but it is the more courteous view to attribute goodness to the God of the Gospel. You however actually separate the Only begotten God from the nature of good, that you may surpass even Marcion in the depravity of your doctrines. However, they claim the Scripture on their side, and say that they are hardly treated when they are accused for using the very words of Scripture. For they say that the Lord Himself has said, \"There is none good but one, that is, God[fn-20-P2020_1217688:5-nf] .\" Accordingly, that misrepresentation may not prevail against the Divine words, we will briefly examine the actual passage in the Gospel. The history regards the rich man to whom the Lord spoke this word as young-the kind of person, I suppose, inclined to enjoy the pleasures of this life-and attached to his possessions; for it says that he was grieved at the advice to part with what he had, and that he did not choose to exchange his property for life eternal. This man, when he heard that a teacher of eternal life was in the neighbourhood, came to him in the expectation of living in perpetual luxury, with life indefinitely extended, flattering the Lord with the title of \"good,\"-flattering, I should rather say, not the Lord as we conceive Him, but as He then appeared in the form of a servant. For his character was not such as to enable him to penetrate the outward veil of flesh, and see through it into the inner shrine of Deity. The Lord, then, Who seeth the hearts, discerned the motive with which the young man approached Him as a suppliant,-that he did so, not with a soul intently fixed upon the Divine, but that it was the man whom he besought, calling Him \"Good Master,\" because he hoped to learn from Him some lore by which the approach of death might be hindered. Accordingly, with good reason did He Who was thus besought by him answer even as He was addressed[fn-20-P2021_1219096:6-nf] . For as the entreaty was not addressed to God the Word, so correspondingly the answer was delivered to the applicant by the Humanity of Christ, thereby impressing on the youth a double lesson. For He teaches him, by one and the same answer, both the duty of reverencing and paying homage to the Divinity, not by flattering speeches but by his life, by keeping the commandments and buying life eternal at the cost of all possessions, and also the truth that humanity, having been sunk in depravity by reason of sin, is debarred from the title of \"Good\": and for this reason He says, \"Why callest Thou Me good?\" suggesting in His answer by the word \"Me\" that human nature which encompassed Him, while by attributing goodness to the Godhead He expressly declared Himself to be good, seeing that He is proclaimed to be God by the Gospel. For had the Only-begotten Son been excluded from the title of God, it would perhaps not have been absurd to think Him alien also from the appellation of \"good.\" But if, as is the case, prophets, evangelists, and Apostles proclaim aloud the Godhead of the Only-begotten, and if the name of goodness is attested by the Lord Himself to belong to God, how is it possible that He Who is partaker of the Godhead should not be partaker of the goodness too? For that both prophets, evangelists, disciples and apostles acknowledge the Lord as God, there is none so uninitiated in Divine mysteries as to need to be expressly told. For who knows not that in the forty-fourth[fn-20-P2022_1220629:7-nf] Psalm the prophet in his word affirms the Christ to be God, anointed by God? And again, who of all that are conversant with prophecy is unaware that Isaiah, among other passages, thus openly proclaims the Godhead of the Son, where he says: \"The Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and shall be servants unto thee: they shall come after thee bound in fetters, and in thee shall they make supplication, because God is in thee, and there is no God beside thee; for thou art God[fn-20-P2023_1221227:8-nf] .\" For what other God there is Who has God in Himself, and is Himself God, except the Only-begotten, let them say who hearken not to the prophecy; but of the interpretation of Emmanuel, and the confession of Thomas after his recognition of the Lord, and the sublime diction of John, as being manifest even to those who are outside the faith, I will say nothing. Nay, I do not even think it necessary to bring forward in detail the utterances of Paul, since they are, as one may say, in all men's mouths, who gives the Lord the appellation not only of \"God,\" but of \"great God\" and \"God over all,\" saying to the Romans, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Who is over all, God blessed for ever[fn-20-P2024_1221999:9-nf] ,\" and writing to his disciple Titus, \"According to the appearing of Jesus Christ the great God and our Saviour[fn-20-P2025_1222127:10-nf] ,\" and to Timothy, proclaims in plain terms, \"God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit[fn-20-P2026_1222403:11-nf] .\" Since then the fact has been demonstrated on every side that the Only-begotten God is God[fn-20-P2027_1222591:12-nf] , how is it that he who says that goodness belongs to God, strives to show that the Godhead of the Son is alien from this ascription, and this though the Lord has actually claimed for Himself the epithet \"good\" in the parable of those who were hired into the vineyard? For there, when those who had laboured before the others were dissatisfied at all receiving the same pay, and deemed the good fortune of the last to be their own loss, the just judge says to one of the murmurers[fn-20-P2028_1223220:13-nf] , \"Friend, I do thee no wrong: did I not agree with thee for a penny a day? Lo, there thou hast that is thine[fn-20-P2029_1223516:14-nf] : I will bestow upon this last even as upon thee. Have I not power to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am good?\" Of course no one will contest the point that to distribute recompense according to desert is the special function of the judge; and all the disciples of the Gospel agree that the Only-begotten God is Judge; \"for the Father,\" He saith, \"judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son[fn-20-P2030_1224039:15-nf] .\" But they do not set themselves in opposition[fn-20-P2031_1224107:16-nf] to the Scriptures. For they say that the word \"one\" absolutely points to the Father. For He saith, \"There is none good but one, that is God.\" Will truth then lack vigour to plead her own cause? Surely there are many means easily to convict of deception this quibble also. For He Who said this concerning the Father spake also to the Father that other word, \"All Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine, and I am glorified in them[fn-20-P2032_1224742:17-nf] .\" Now if He says that all that is the Father's is also the Son's, and goodness is one of the attributes pertaining to the Father, either the Son has not all things if He has not this, and they will be saying that the Truth lies, or if it is impious to suspect the very Truth of being carried away into falsehood, then He Who claimed all that is the Father's as His own, thereby asserted that He was not outside of goodness. For He Who has the Father in Himself, and contains all things that belong to the Father, manifestly has His goodness with \"all things.\" Therefore the Son is Good. But \"there is none good,\" he says, \"but one, that is God.\" This is what is alleged by our adversaries: nor do I myself reject the statement. I do not, however, for this cause deny the Godhead of the Son. But he who confesses that the Lord is God, by that very confession assuredly also asserts of Him goodness. For if goodness is a property of God, and if the Lord is God, then by our premises the Son is shown to be God. \"But,\" says our opponent, \"the word `one' excludes the Son from participation in goodness.\" It is easy, however, to show that not even the word \"one\" separates the Father from the Son. For in all other cases, it is true, the term \"one\" carries with it the signification of not being coupled with anything else, but in the case of the Father and the Son \"one\" does not imply isolation. For He says, \"I and the Father are one[fn-20-P2033_1226200:18-nf] .\" If, then, the good is one, and a particular kind of unity is contemplated in the Father and the Son, it follows that the Lord, in predicating goodness of \"one,\" claimed under the term \"one\" the title of \"good\" also for Himself, Who is one with the Father, and not severed from oneness of nature.","title":"Book XI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":45,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_22_book_xi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Not even Marcion himself, the patron of your opinions, supports you in this.

And perhaps I may be pardoned for feeling such emotion. For whose resentment would not be stirred within him at such profanity, when he remembers how the Apostle proclaims that every angelic nature is subject to the Lord, and in witness of his doctrine invokes the sublime utterances of the prophets:-\"When He bringeth the first-begotten into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him,\" and, \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever,\" and, \"Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail[fn-20-P2039_1232013:20-nf] \"? When the Apostle has gone through all this argument to demonstrate the unapproachable majesty of the Only-begotten God, what must I feel when I hear from the adversary of Christ that the Lord of Angels is Himself only an Angel,-and when he does not let such a statement fall by chance, but puts forth his strength to maintain this monstrous invention, so that it may be established that his Lord has no superiority over John and Moses? For the word says concerning them, \"This is he of whom it is written, `Behold I send my angel before thy face[fn-20-P2040_1232658:21-nf] .'\" John therefore is an angel. But the enemy of the Lord, even though he grants his Lord the name of God, yet makes Him out to be on a level with the deity of Moses, since he too was a servant of the God over all, and was constituted a god to the Egyptians[fn-20-P2041_1233084:22-nf] . And yet this phrase, \"over all,\" as has been previously observed, is common to the Son with the Father, the Apostle having expressly ascribed such a title to Him, when he says, \"Of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Who is God over all[fn-20-P2042_1233354:23-nf] .\" But this man degrades the Lord of angels to the rank of an angel, as though he had not heard that the angels are \"ministering spirits,\" and \"a flame of fire[fn-20-P2043_1233531:24-nf] .\" For by the use of these distinctive terms does the Apostle make the difference between the several subjects clear and unmistakable, defining the subordinate nature to be \"spirits\" and \"fire,\" and distinguishing the supreme power by the name of Godhead. And yet, though there are so many that proclaim the glory of the Only-begotten God, against them all Eunomius lifts up his single voice, calling the Christ \"an angel of the God over all,\" defining Him, by thus contrasting Him with the \"God over all,\" to be one of the \"all things,\" and, by giving Him the same name as the angels, trying to establish that He no wise differs from them in nature: for he has often previously said that all those things which share the same name cannot be different in nature. Does the argument, then, still lack its censors, as it concerns a man who proclaims in so many words that the \"Angel\" does not publish His own word, but that of the Existent? For it is by this means that he tries to show that the Word Who was in the beginning, the Word Who was God, is not Himself the Word, but is the Word of some other Word, being its minister and \"angel.\" And who knows not that the only opposite to the \"Existent\" is the nonexistent? so that he who contrasts the Son with the Existent, is clearly playing the Jew, robbing the Christian doctrine of the Person of the Only-begotten. For in saying that He is excluded from the title of the \"Existent,\" he is assuredly trying to establish also that He is outside the pale of existence: for surely if he grants Him existence, he will not quarrel about the sound of the word.","title":"Book XI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":45,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_22_book_xi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"For it is not as if he had but let fall something of the kind just once under some headlong and inconsiderate impulse, and in what followed had striven to retrieve his error: no, he dallies lingeringly with the malignity, striving in his later statements to surpass what had gone before.

When the Apostle has gone through all this argument to demonstrate the unapproachable majesty of the Only-begotten God, what must I feel when I hear from the adversary of Christ that the Lord of Angels is Himself only an Angel,-and when he does not let such a statement fall by chance, but puts forth his strength to maintain this monstrous invention, so that it may be established that his Lord has no superiority over John and Moses? For the word says concerning them, \"This is he of whom it is written, `Behold I send my angel before thy face[fn-20-P2040_1232658:21-nf] .'\" John therefore is an angel. But the enemy of the Lord, even though he grants his Lord the name of God, yet makes Him out to be on a level with the deity of Moses, since he too was a servant of the God over all, and was constituted a god to the Egyptians[fn-20-P2041_1233084:22-nf] . And yet this phrase, \"over all,\" as has been previously observed, is common to the Son with the Father, the Apostle having expressly ascribed such a title to Him, when he says, \"Of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Who is God over all[fn-20-P2042_1233354:23-nf] .\" But this man degrades the Lord of angels to the rank of an angel, as though he had not heard that the angels are \"ministering spirits,\" and \"a flame of fire[fn-20-P2043_1233531:24-nf] .\" For by the use of these distinctive terms does the Apostle make the difference between the several subjects clear and unmistakable, defining the subordinate nature to be \"spirits\" and \"fire,\" and distinguishing the supreme power by the name of Godhead. And yet, though there are so many that proclaim the glory of the Only-begotten God, against them all Eunomius lifts up his single voice, calling the Christ \"an angel of the God over all,\" defining Him, by thus contrasting Him with the \"God over all,\" to be one of the \"all things,\" and, by giving Him the same name as the angels, trying to establish that He no wise differs from them in nature: for he has often previously said that all those things which share the same name cannot be different in nature. Does the argument, then, still lack its censors, as it concerns a man who proclaims in so many words that the \"Angel\" does not publish His own word, but that of the Existent? For it is by this means that he tries to show that the Word Who was in the beginning, the Word Who was God, is not Himself the Word, but is the Word of some other Word, being its minister and \"angel.\" And who knows not that the only opposite to the \"Existent\" is the nonexistent? so that he who contrasts the Son with the Existent, is clearly playing the Jew, robbing the Christian doctrine of the Person of the Only-begotten.

But they are much deceived, who think that we believe in Christ without any proofs concerning Christ. For what are there clearer proofs than those things, which we now see to have been foretold and fulfilled? Wherefore do ye, who think that there are no proofs why ye ought to believe concerning Christ those things which ye have not seen, give heed to what things ye see. The Church herself addresses you out of the mouth of a mother's love: \"I, whom ye view with wonder throughout the whole world, bearing fruit and increasing, was not once such as ye now behold me.\" But, \"In thy Seed shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-33-P3344_1535879:7-nf] When God blessed Abraham, He gave thepromise of me; for throughout all nations in the blessing of Christ am I shed abroad. That Christ is the Seed of Abraham, the order of successive generations bears witness, Shortly to sum up which, Abraham begat Isaac, Isaac begat Jacob, Jacob begat twelve sons, of whom sprung the people Israel. For Jacob himself was called israel. Among these twelve sons he begat Judah, whence the Jews have their name, of whom was born the Virgin Mary, who bore Christ. And, lo, in Christ, that is, in the seed of Abraham, that all the nations are blessed, ye see and are amazed: and do ye still fear to believe in Him, in Whom ye ought rather to have feared not to believe? What? doubt ye, or refuse ye to believe, the travail of a Virgin, whereas ye ought rather to believe that it was fitting that so God should be born Man. For this also receive ye to have been foretold by the Prophet;[fn-33-P3345_1536813:8-nf] \"Behold, a Virgin shall conceive in the womb, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His Name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.\" Ye will not therefore doubt of a Virgin bringing forth, if ye be willing to believe of a God being born; leaving not the governance of the world, and coming unto men in the flesh; unto His Mother bringing fruitfulness, not taking away maidenhood. For thus behoved it that He should be born as Man, albeit[fn-33-P3346_1537304:9-nf] He was ever[fn-33-P3347_1537337:10-nf] God, by which birth He might become a God unto us.

Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.\"[fn-33-P3348_1537676:11-nf] This anointing is spiritual, wherewith God anointed God, the Father, that is, the Son: whence called from the \"Chrism,\" that is, from the anointing, we know Him as Christ. I am the Church, concerning whom it is said unto Him in the same Psalm, and what was future foretold as already done; \"There stood at Thy right hand the Queen, in a vesture of gold, in raiment of divers colors;\" that is, in the mystery of wisdom, \"adorned with divers tongues.\" There it said unto me, \"Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear, and forget thy own people and thy father's house: for the King hath desired thy beauty: seeing that He is the Lord thy God: and the daughters of Tyre shall worship Him with gifts, thy face shall all the rich of the people entreat. All the glory of that King's daughter is within, in fringes of gold, with raiment of divers colors. There shall be brought unto the King the maidens after her; her companions shall be brought unto Thee. They shall be brought with joy and gladness, they shall be brought into the Temple of the King.

She whom the apostle warns against the guile of the serpent by which thou hast been corrupted, that he may present her as a chaste virgin to Christ, her only husband, acknowledges the God of the prophets as the true God, and her own God, So many of His promises have already been fulfilled to her, that she looks confidently for the fulfillment of the rest. Nor can any one say that these prophecies have been forged to suit the present time, for they are found in the books of the Jews. What could be more unlikely than that all nations should be blessed in Abraham's seed, as it was promised? And yet how plainly is this promise now fulfilled! The last promise is made in the following short prophecy: \"Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house: they shall ever praise Thee.\"[fn-16-P1646_916087:25-nf] When trial is past, and death, the last enemy, is destroyed, there will be rest in the constant occupation of praising God, where there shall be no arrivals and no departures. So the prophet says elsewhere: \"Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; celebrate thy God, o Zion: for He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children within thee.\"[fn-16-P1647_916463:26-nf] The gates are shut, so that none can go in or out. The Bridegroom Himself says in the Gospel, that He will not open to the foolish virgins though they knock. This Jerusalem, the holy Church, the bride of Christ, is described fully in the Revelation of John. And that which commends the promises of future bliss to the belief of this chaste virgin is, that now she is in possession of what was foretold of her by the same prophets. For she is thus described: \"Hearken, O daughter, and regard, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house. For the King hath greatly desired thy beauty; and He is thy God. The daughters of Tyre shall worship Him with gifts; the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor. The daughter of the King is all glorious within; her clothing is of wrought gold. The virgins following her shall be brought unto the King: her companions shall be brought unto thee; with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought into the temple of the King. Instead of thy fathers, children shall be born to thee, whom thou shall make princes over all the earth. Thy name shall be remembered to all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.\"[fn-16-P1648_917696:27-nf] Unhappy victim of the serpent's guile, the inward beauty of the daughter of the King is not for thee even to think of. For this purity of mind is that which thou hast lost in opening thine eyes to love and worship the sun and moon. And so by the just judgment of God thou art estranged from the tree of life, which is eternal and internal wisdom; and with thee nothing is called or accounted truth or wisdom but that light which enters the eyes opened to evil, and which in thy impure mind expands and shapes itself into fanciful images. These are thy abominable whoredoms. Still the truth calls on thee to reflect and return. Return to me, and thou shall be cleansed and restored, if thy shame leads thee to repentance.

The apostle declares that to himself, \"less than the least of all saints, was the grace given\" of enlightening all men as to \"what was the fellowship of the mystery, which during the ages had been hid in God, who created all things.\"[fn-80-P8009_2279216:811-nf] The heretic erased the preposition in, and made the clause run thus: (\"what is the fellowship of the mystery) which hath for ages been hidden from the God who created all things.\"[fn-80-P8010_2279419:812-nf] The falsification, however, is flagrantly[fn-80-P8011_2280020:813-nf] absurd. For the apostle goes on to infer (from his own statement): \"in order that unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might become known through the church the manifold wisdom of God.\"[fn-80-P8012_2280238:814-nf] Whose principalities and powers does he mean? If the Creator's, how does it come to pass that such a God as He could have meant His wisdom to be displayed to the principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For surely no principalities could possibly have understood anything without their sovereign Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage, on the ground that He (as their chief) is Himself reckoned among these (principalities), then he would have plainly said that the mystery had been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had created all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was hidden from them, he must needs be understood[fn-80-P8013_2280952:815-nf] as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all things, from His principalities and powers. For \"who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-80-P8014_2281228:816-nf] Caught in this trap, the heretic probably changed the passage, with the view of saying that his god wished to make known to his principalities and powers the fellowship of his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of the Creator, who was a stranger to the superior god,[fn-80-P8015_2281603:817-nf] and far enough removed from him, when even his own servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator, however, the future was well known. Then why was not that also known to Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven, and on His earth? From this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has it)-\"hidden from the God who created all things\"-he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus: \"in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him, and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.\" So palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing. I, on my part, now wish to engage with you in a discussion on the allegorical expressions of the apostle. What figures of speech could the novel god have found in the prophets (fit for himself)? \"He led captivity captive,\" says the apostle.[fn-80-P8016_2282781:818-nf] With what arms? In what conflicts? From the devastation of what Country? From the overthrow of what city? What women, what children, what princes did the Conqueror throw into chains? For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: \"even as Christ is the head of the Church; \"[fn-80-P8036_2285779:838-nf] and again, in like manner: \"He who loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.\"[fn-80-P8037_2285906:839-nf] You see how your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,[fn-80-P8040_2286747:842-nf] to prove that the same God is (the God) of the man[fn-80-P8041_2286810:843-nf] and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one? If there must be two, I mean to follow Him who was the first to teach the lesson. But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":45,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"125","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In the forty-fourth Psalm: \"My heart hath breathed out a good Word.

This alone, indeed, knew the mind of the Lord. For \"who knoweth the things of God, and the things in God, but the Spirit, which is in Him? \"[fn-83-P8384_2368666:165-nf] Now His wisdom is that Spirit. This was His counsellor, the very way of His wisdom and knowledge.[fn-83-P8385_2368786:166-nf] Of this He made all things, making them through It, and making them with It. \"When He prepared the heavens,\" so says (the Scripture[fn-83-P8386_2368938:167-nf] ), \"I was present with Him; and when He strengthened above the winds the lofty clouds, and when He secured the fountains[fn-83-P8387_2369123:168-nf] which are under the heaven, I was present, compacting these things[fn-83-P8388_2369381:169-nf] along with Him. I was He[fn-83-P8389_2369425:170-nf] in whom He took delight; moreover, I daily rejoiced in His presence: for He rejoiced when He had finished the world, and amongst the sons of men did He show forth His pleasure.\"[fn-83-P8390_2369648:171-nf] Now, who would not rather approve of[fn-83-P8391_2369711:172-nf] this as the fountain and origin of all things-of this as, in very deed, the Matter of all Matter, not liable to any end,[fn-83-P8392_2369850:173-nf] not diverse in condition, not restless in motion, not ungraceful in form, but natural, and proper, and duly proportioned, and beautiful, such truly as even God might well have required, who requires His own and not another's? Indeed, as soon as He perceived It to be necessary for His creation of the world, He immediately creates It, and generates It in Himself. \"The Lord,\" says the Scripture, \"possessed[fn-83-P8393_2370341:174-nf] me, the beginning of His ways for the creation of His works. Before the worlds He rounded me; before He made the earth, before the mountains were settled in their places; moreover, before the hills He generated me, and prior to the depths was I begotten.\"[fn-83-P8394_2370621:175-nf] Let Hermogenes then confess that the very Wisdom of God is declared to be born and created, for the especial reason that we should not suppose that there is any other being than God alone who is unbegotten and uncreated. For if that, which from its being inherent in the Lord[fn-83-P8395_2370920:176-nf] was of Him and in Him, was yet not without a beginning,-I mean[fn-83-P8396_2371005:177-nf] His wisdom, which was then born and created, when in the thought of God It began to assume motion[fn-83-P8397_2371120:178-nf] for the arrangement of His creative works,-how much more impossible[fn-83-P8398_2371211:179-nf] is it that anything should have been without a beginning which was extrinsic to the Lord![fn-83-P8399_2371331:180-nf] But if this same Wisdom is the Word of God, in the capacity[fn-84-P8400_2371413:181-nf] of Wisdom, and (as being He) without whom nothing was made, just as also (nothing) was set in order without Wisdom, how can it be that anything, except the Father, should be older, and on this account indeed nobler, than the Son of God, the only-begotten and first-begotten Word? Not to say that[fn-84-P8401_2371723:182-nf] what is unbegotten is stronger than that which is born, and what is not made more powerful than that which is made. Because that which did not require a Maker to give it existence, will be much more elevated in rank than that which had an author to bring it into being. On this principle, then,[fn-84-P8402_2372032:183-nf] if evil is indeed unbegotten, whilst the Son of God is begotten (\"for,\" says God, \"my heart hath emitted my most excellent Word\"[fn-84-P8403_2372177:184-nf] ), I am not quite sure that evil may not be introduced by good, the stronger by the weak, in the same way as the unbegotten is by the begotten.

The time when the kingdom was removed from the tribe of Judah was the time appointed for the coming of Christ our Lord, the true Saviour, who should come not for harm, but for great good. Thus was it prophesied, \"A prince shall not fail from Judah, nor a leader from his loins, till He come for whom it is reserved: He is the desire of nations.\"[fn-22-P2260_1364398:157-nf] Not only the kingdom, but all government, of the Jews had ceased, and also, as prophesied by Daniel, the sacred anointing from which the name Christ or Anointed is derived. Then came He for whom it was reserved, the desire of nations; and the holy of holies was anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows.[fn-22-P2261_1364735:158-nf] Christ was born in the time of the elder Herod, and suffered in the time of Herod the tetrarch. He who thus came to the lost sheep of the house of Israel was typified by Judah when he went to shear his sheep in Thamna, which means, failing. For then the prince had failed from Judah, with all the government and anointing of the Jews, that He might come for whom it was reserved. Judah, we are told, came with his Adullamite shepherd, whose name was Iras; and Adullamite means, a testimony in water. So it was with this testimony that the Lord came, having indeed greater testimony than that of John;[fn-22-P2262_1365373:159-nf] but for the sake of his feeble sheep he made use of the testimony in water. The name Iras, too, means, vision of my brother. So John saw his brother, a brother in the family of Abraham, and from the relationship of Mary and Elisabeth; and the same person he recognised as his Lord and his God, for, as he himself says, he received of His fullness.[fn-22-P2263_1365740:160-nf] On account of this vision, among those born of woman, there has arisen no greater than he;[fn-22-P2264_1365849:161-nf] because, of all who foretold Christ, he alone saw what many righteous men and prophets desired to see and saw not. He saluted Christ from the womb;[fn-22-P2265_1366018:162-nf] he knew Him more certainly from seeing the dove; and therefore, as the Adullamite, he gave testimony by water. The Lord came to shear His sheep, in releasing them from painful burdens, as it is said in praise of the Church in the Song of Songs, that her teeth are like a flock of sheep after shearing.[fn-22-P2266_1366339:163-nf] ","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":45,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Let us consider, however, a little more carefully what is the Word which is in the beginning. I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but tropically. But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term \"Word.\" I wonder at the stupidity of the general run of Christians in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity. The Son of God says in one passage, \"I am the light of the world,\" and in another, \"I am the resurrection,\" and again, \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" It is also written, \"I am the door,\" and we have the saying, \"I am the good shepherd,\" and when the woman of Samaria says, \"We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,\" Jesus answers, \"I that speak unto thee am He.\" Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared Himself in these words[fn-62-P6254_982473:92-nf] to be their Master and Lord: \"You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.\" He also distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says,[fn-62-P6255_982654:93-nf] \"He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? \"and[fn-62-P6256_982806:94-nf] \"Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.\" We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate's question,[fn-62-P6257_982993:95-nf] \"Art Thou the King of the Jews? \"by saying, \"My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence.\" We have also read the words,[fn-62-P6258_983272:96-nf] \"I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman,\" and again, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" Add to these testimonies also the saying,[fn-62-P6259_983437:97-nf] \"I am the bread of life, that came down from heaven and giveth life to the world.\" These texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son of God. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says,[fn-62-P6260_983747:98-nf] \"I am the first and the last, and the living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.\" And again,[fn-62-P6261_983876:99-nf] \"I am the A and the W, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" The careful student of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as where He calls Himself[fn-62-P6262_984111:100-nf] a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,[fn-62-P6263_984170:101-nf] and a light of the Gentiles.[fn-62-P6264_984225:102-nf] Isaiah also says,[fn-62-P6265_984264:103-nf] \"From my mother's womb hath He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.\" And a little farther on: \"And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of Israel. Behold I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" And in Jeremiah too[fn-62-P6266_984857:104-nf] He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: \"I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.\" These and other similar sayings He applies to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets proclaim in advance His coining advent and announce the things concerning Him under various names. Thus John calls Him the Lamb of God, saying,[fn-62-P6267_985471:105-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world,\" and in these words he declares Him as a man,[fn-62-P6268_985601:106-nf] \"This is He about whom I said, that there cometh after me a man who is there before me; for He was before me.\" And in his Catholic Epistle John says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus:[fn-62-P6269_985836:107-nf] \"And if any one sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,\" and he adds that He is a propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a propitiation:[fn-62-P6270_986050:108-nf] \"Whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast sins, in the forbearance of God.\" According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:[fn-62-P6271_986344:109-nf] \"Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: \"He was made to us of God,\" he says, \"wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\" But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest:[fn-62-P6272_986654:110-nf] \"Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.\" And the prophets have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons[fn-62-P6273_986898:111-nf] says, \"Judah, thy brethren shall extol thee; thy hands are on the necks of thine enemies. A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art thou sprung up; thou hast lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him? \"We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. What may be quoted against this view, viz., \"A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved; \"this can better be cleared up on another occasion . But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel, when he says,[fn-62-P6274_987528:112-nf] \"Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted Him. He shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break. and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope.\" That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says:[fn-62-P6275_988040:113-nf] \"That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry,\" etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God:[fn-62-P6276_988248:114-nf] \"I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd.\" For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower:[fn-62-P6277_988483:115-nf] \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of tits root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel slid of might, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as follows:[fn-62-P6278_988887:116-nf] \"The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the comer. It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.\" And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows:[fn-62-P6279_989155:117-nf] \"Have ye never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.\" And Luke writes in Acts:[fn-62-P6280_989407:118-nf] \"This is the stone, which was set at naught of you the builders, which has become the head of the corner.\" And one of the names applied to the Saviour is that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records;-the Word who was in the beginning with God, God the Word. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and ask, What is the Son of God when called the Word? The passage they employ most is that in the Psalms,[fn-62-P6281_990132:119-nf] \"My heart hath produced a good Word; \"and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are they clear about His essence. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said to be \"Word\" can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an essence of His own. We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it suggests slid apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course. To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have to say on the question, how the Son of God is the Word, we must begin with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him. This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression, but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these matters will clear the way for what is coming. And once we have entered upon the theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what diligence we can and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall necessarily understand more about Him not only in His character as the Word, but in His other characters also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":45,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"104","folder":"ANF-10","text":"In addition to these titles we must consider at the outset of our work that of Christ, and we must also consider that of King, and compare these two so as to find out the difference between them. Now it is said in the forty-fourth Psalm,[fn-63-P6321_1005157:138-nf] \"Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity, whence Thou art anointed (Christ) above Thy fellows.\" His loving righteousness and hating iniquity were thus added claims in Him; His anointing was not contemporary with His being nor inherited by Him from the first. Anointing is a symbol of entering on the kingship, and sometimes also on the priesthood; and must we therefore conclude that the kingship of the Son of God is not inherited nor congenital to Him? But how is it conceivable that the First-born of all creation was not a king and became a king afterwards because He loved righteousness, when, moreover, He Himself was righteousness? We cannot fail to see that it is as a man that He is Christ, in respect of His soul, which was human and liable to be troubled and sore vexed, but that He is conceived as king in respect of the divine in Him. I find support for this in the seventy-first Psalm,[fn-63-P6322_1006085:139-nf] which says, \"Give the king Thy judgment, O God, and Thy righteousness to the king's Son, to judge Thy people in righteousness and Thy poor in judgment.\" This Psalm, though addressed to Solomon, is evidently a prophecy of Christ, and it is worth while to ask to what king the prophecy desires judgment to be given by God, and to what king's Son, and what king's righteousness is spoken of. I conceive, then, that what is called the King is the leading nature of the First-born of all creation, to which judgment is given on account of its eminence; and that the man whom He assumed, formed and moulded by that nature, according to righteousness, is the King's Son. I am the more led to think that this is so, because the two beings are here brought together in one sentence, and are spoken of as if they were not two but one. For the Saviour made both one,[fn-63-P6323_1006965:140-nf] that is, He made them according to the prototype of the two which had been made one in Himself before all things. The two I refer to human nature, since each man's soul is mixed with the Holy Spirit, and each of those who are saved is thus made spiritual. Now as there are some to whom Christ is a shepherd, as we said before, because of their meek and composed nature, though they are less guided by reason; so there are those to whom He is a king, those, namely, who are led in their approach to religion rather by the reasonable part of their nature. And among those who are under a king there are differences; some experience his rule in a more mystic and hidden and more divine way, others in a less perfect fashion. I should say that those who, led by reason, apart from all agencies of sense, have beheld incorporeal things, the things which Paul speaks of as \"invisible,\" or \"not seen,\" that they are ruled by the leading nature of the Only-begotten, but that those who have only advanced as far as the reason which is conversant with sensible things, and on account of these glorify their Maker, that these also are governed by the Word, by Christ. No offence need be taken at our distinguishing these notions in the Saviour; we draw the same distinctions in His substance.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":45,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"ANF-10","text":"As, then, from His activity in enlightening the world whose light He is, Christ is named the Light of the World, and as from His making those who sincerely attach themselves to Him put away their deadness and rise again and put on newness of life, He is called the Resurrection, so from an activity of another kind He is called Shepherd and Teacher, King and Chosen Shaft, and Servant, and in addition to these Paraclete and Atonement and Propitiation. And after the same fashion He is also called the Logos,[fn-64-P6405_1035951:185-nf] because He takes away from us all that is irrational, and makes us truly reasonable, so that we do all things, even to eating and drinking, to the glory of God, and discharge by the Logos to the glory of God both the commoner functions of life and those which belong to a more advanced stage. For if, by having part in Him, we are raised up and enlightened, herded also it may be and ruled over, then it is clear that we become in a divine manner reasonable, when He drives away from us what in us is irrational and dead, since He is the Logos (reason) and the Resurrection.Consider, however, whether all men have in some way part in Him in His character as Logos. On this point tile Apostle teaches us that He is to be sought not outside the seeker, and that those find Him in themselves who set their heart on doing so; \"Say not[fn-64-P6406_1036963:186-nf] in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? That is to bring Christ down; or, Who shall descend into the abyss? That is to bring Christ up from the dead. But what saith the Scripture? The Word is very nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart,\" as if Christ Himself were the same thing as the Word said to be sought after. But when the Lord Himself says[fn-64-P6407_1037336:187-nf] \"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin,\" the only sense we can find in His words is that the Logos Himself says that those are not chargeable with sin to whom He (reason) has not fully come, but that those, if they sin, are guilty who, having had part in Him, act contrary to the ideas by which He declares His full presence in us. Only when thus read is the saying true: \"If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin.\" Should the words be applied, as many are of opinion that they should, to the visible Christ, then how is it true that those had no sin to whom He did not come? In that case all who lived before the advent of the Saviour will be free from sin, since Jesus, as seen in flesh, had not yet come. And more-all those to whom He has never been preached will have no sin, and if they have no sin, then it is clear they are not liable to judgment. But the Logos in man, in which we have said that our whole race had part, is spoken of in two senses; first, in that of the filling up of ideas which takes place, prodigies excepted, in every one who passes beyond the age of boyhood, but secondly, in that of the consummation, which takes place only in the perfect. The words, therefore, \"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin, but now they have no cloak for their sin,\" are to be understood in the former sense; but the words,[fn-64-P6408_1038800:188-nf] \"All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not hear them,\" in the latter. For before the consummation of reason comes, there is nothing in man but what is blameworthy; all is imperfect and defective, and can by no means command the obedience of those irrational elements in us which are tropically spoken of as sheep. And perhaps the former meaning is to be recognized in the words \"The Logos was made flesh,\" but the second in \"The Logos was God.\" We must accordingly look at what there is to be seen in human affairs between the saying, \"The Word (reason) was made flesh\" and \"The Word was God.\" When the Word was made flesh can we say that it was to some extent broken up and thinned out, and can we say that it recovered from that point onward till it became again what it was at first, God the Word, the Word with the Father; the Word whose glory John saw, the verily only-begotten, as from the Father. But the Son may also be the Logos (Word), because He reports the secret things of His Father who is intellect in the same way as the Son who is called the Word. For as with us the word is a messenger of those things which tile mind perceives, so the Word of God, knowing the Father, since no created being can approach Him without a guide, reveals the Father whom He knows. For no one knows the Father save the Son,[fn-64-P6409_1040172:189-nf] and he to whomsoever the Son reveals Him, and inasmuch as He is the Word He is the Messenger of Great Counsel,[fn-64-P6410_1040304:190-nf] who has the government upon His shoulders; for He entered on His kingdom by enduring the cross. In the Apocalypse,[fn-64-P6411_1040441:191-nf] moreover, the Faithful and True (the Word), is said to sit on a white horse, the epithets indicating, I consider, the clearness of the voice with which the Word of truth speaks to us when He sojourns among us. This is scarcely the place to show how the word \"horse\" is often used in passages spoken for our encouragement in sacred learning. I only cite two of these: \"A horse is deceitful for safety,\"[fn-64-P6412_1040859:192-nf] and \"Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will rejoice in the name of the Lord our God.\"[fn-64-P6413_1040984:193-nf] Nor must we leave unnoticed a passage in the forty-fourth Psalm,[fn-64-P6414_1041068:194-nf] frequently quoted by many writers as if they understood it: \"My heart hath belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King.\" Suppose it is God the Father who speaks thus; what is His heart, that the good word should appear in accordance with His heart? If, as these writers suppose, the Word (Logos) needs no interpretation, then the heart is to be taken in the natural sense too. But it is quite absurd to suppose God's heart to be a part of Him as ours is of our body. We must remind such writers that as when the hand of God is spoken of, and His arm and His finger, we do not read the words literally but enquire in what sound sense we may take them so as to be worthy of God, so His heart is to be understood of His rational power, by which He disposes all things, and His word of that which announces what is in this heart of His. But who is it that announces the counsel of the Father to those of His creatures who are worthy and who have risen above themselves, who but the Saviour? That \"belched forth\" is not, perhaps, without significance; a hundred other terms might have been employed; \"My heart has produced a good word,\" it might have been said, or \"My heart has spoken a good word.\" But in belching, some wind that was hidden makes its way out to the world, and so it may be that the Father gives out views of truth not continuously, but as it were after the fashion of belching, and the word has the character of the things thus produced, and is called, therefore, the image of the invisible God. We may enter our agreement, therefore, with the ordinary acceptation of these words, and take them to be spoken by the Father. It is not, however, a matter of course, that it is God Himself who announces these things. Why should it not be a prophet? Filled with the Spirit and unable to contain himself, he brings forth a word about his prophecy concerning Christ: \"My heart hath belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King, my pen is the tongue of a ready writer. Excellent in beauty is He beyond the sons of men.\" Then to the Christ Himself: \"Grace is poured out on Thy lips.\" If the Father were the speaker, how could He go on after the words, \"Grace is poured out on thy lips,\" to say, \"Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever,\" and a little further on, \"Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\" Some of those who wish to make the Father the speaker may appeal to the words, \"Hear, O daughter, and behold and incline thine ear, and forget thy people and thy father.\" The prophet, it may be said, could not address the Church in the words, \"Hear, O daughter.\" It is not difficult, however, to show that changes of person occur frequently in the Psalms, so that these words, \"Hear, O daughter,\" might be from the Father, in this passage, though the Psalm as a whole is not. To our discussion of the Word we may here add the passage,[fn-64-P6415_1044005:195-nf] \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens rounded, and all the power of them by the breath of His mouth.\" Some refer this to the Saviour and the Holy Spirit. The passage, however, does not necessarily imply any more than that the heavens were founded by the reason (logos) of God, as when we say that a house is built by the plan (logos) of the architect, or a ship by the plan (logos) of the shipbuilder. In the same way the heavens were founded (made solid) by the Word of God, for they are[fn-64-P6416_1044520:196-nf] of a more divine substance, which on this account is called solid;[fn-64-P6417_1044615:197-nf] it has little fluidity for the most part, nor is it easily melted like other parts of the world, and specially the lower parts. On account of this difference the heavens are said in a special manner to be constituted by the Word of God.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":45,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_125_oration_concerning_simeon_and_anna","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"ANF-06","text":"VI.

For he that is created is also needy; but he that is uncreated stands in need of nothing. God, then, having His own Word internal[fn-16-P1607_450301:18-nf] within His own bowels, begat Him, emitting[fn-16-P1608_450625:19-nf] Him along with His own wisdom before all things. He had this Word as a helper in the things that were created by Him, and by Him He made all things. He is called \"governing principle\" [a0rkh/], because He rules, and is Lord of all things fashioned by Him. He, then, being Spirit of God, and governing principle, and wisdom, and power of the highest, came down upon the prophets, and through them spoke of the creation of the world and of all other things. For the prophets were not when the world came into existence, but the wisdom of God which was in Him, and His holy Word which was always present with Him.

He became also the Son of God, and was begotten when He proceeded forth from Him. Do you then, (you ask, ) grant that the Word is a certain substance, constructed by the Spirit and the communication of Wisdom? Certainly I do. But you will not allow Him to be really a substantive being, by having a substance of His own; in such a way that He may be regarded as an objective thing and a person, and so be able (as being constituted second to God the Father, ) to make two, the Father and the Son, God and the Word. For you will say, what is a word, but a voice and sound of the mouth, and (as the grammarians teach) air when struck against,[fn-104-P10472_2933938:74-nf] intelligible to the ear, but for the rest a sort of void, empty, and incorporeal thing. I, on the contrary, contend that nothing empty and void could have come forth from God, seeing that it is not put forth from that which is empty and void; nor could that possibly be devoid of substance which has proceeded from so great a substance, and has produced such mighty substances: for all things which were made through Him, He Himself (personally) made. How could it be, that He Himself is nothing, without whom nothing was made? How could He who is empty have made things which are solid, and He who is void have made things which are full, and He who is incorporeal have made things which have body? For although a thing may sometimes be made different from him by whom it is made, yet nothing can be made by that which is a void and empty thing. Is that Word of God, then, a void and empty thing, which is called the Son, who Himself is designated God? \"The Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-104-P10473_2934954:75-nf] It is written, \"Thou shalt not take God's name in vain.\"[fn-104-P10474_2935027:76-nf] This for certain is He \"who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\"[fn-104-P10475_2935144:77-nf] In what form of God? Of course he means in some form, not in none. For who will deny that God is a body, although \"God is a Spirit? \"[fn-104-P10476_2935296:78-nf] For Spirit has a bodily substance of its own kind, in its own form.[fn-104-P10477_2935382:79-nf] Now, even if invisible things, whatsoever they be, have both their substance and their form in God, whereby they are visible to God alone, how much more shall that which has been sent forth from His substance not be without substance! Whatever, therefore, was the substance of the Word that I designate a Person, I claim for it the name of Son; and while I recognize the Son, I assert His distinction as second to the Father.[fn-104-P10478_2936047:80-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":45,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"ANF-03","text":"It will be your duty, however, to adduce your proofs out of the Scriptures as plainly as we do, when we prove that He made His Word a Son to Himself. For if He calls Him Son, and if the Son is none other than He who has proceeded from the Father Himself, and if the Word has proceeded from the Father Himself, He will then be the Son, and not Himself from whom He proceeded. For the Father Himself did not proceed from Himself. Now, you who say that the Father is the same as the Son, do really make the same Person both to have sent forth from Himself (and at the same time to have gone out from Himself as) that Being which is God. If it was possible for Him to have done this, He at all events did not do it. You must bring forth the proof which I require of you-one like my own; that is, (you must prove to me) that the Scriptures show the Son and the Father to be the same, just as on our side the Father and the Son are demonstrated to be distinct; I say distinct, but not separate:[fn-105-P10520_2951257:110-nf] for as on my part I produce the words of God Himself, \"My heart hath emitted my most excellent Word,\"[fn-105-P10521_2951389:111-nf] so you in like manner ought to adduce in opposition to me some text where God has said, \"My heart hath emitted Myself as my own most excellent Word,\" in such a sense that He is Himself both the Emitter and the Emitted, both He who sent forth and He who was sent forth, since He is both the Word and God. I bid you also observe,[fn-105-P10522_2951799:112-nf] that on my side I advance the passage where the Father said to the Son, \"Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee.\"[fn-105-P10523_2951934:113-nf] If you want me to believe Him to be both the Father and the Son, show me some other passage where it is declared, \"The Lord said unto Himself, I am my own Son, to-day have I begotten myself; \"or again, \"Before the morning did I beget myself; \"[fn-105-P10524_2952196:114-nf] and likewise, \"I the Lord possessed Myself the beginning of my ways for my own works; before all the hills, too, did I beget myself; \" and whatever other passages are to the same effect. Why, moreover, could God the Lord of all things, have hesitated to speak thus of Himself, if the fact had been so? Was He afraid of not being believed, if He had in so many words declared Himself to be both the Father and the Son? Of one thing He was at any rate afraid-of lying. Of Himself, too, and of His own truth, was He afraid. Believing Him, therefore, to be the true God, I am sure that He declared nothing to exist in any other way than according to His own dispensation and arrangement, and that He had arranged nothing in any other way than according to His own declaration. On your side, however, you must make Him out to be a liar, and an impostor, and a tamperer with His word, if, when He was Himself a Son to Himself, He assigned the part of His Son to be played by another, when all the Scriptures attest the clear existence of, and distinction in (the Persons of) the Trinity, and indeed furnish us with our Rule of faith, that He who speaks; and He of whom He speaks, and to whom He speaks, cannot possibly seem to be One and the Same. So absurd arid misleading a statement would be unworthy of God, that, widen it was Himself to whom He was speaking, He speaks rather to another, and not to His very self. Hear, then, other utterances also of the Father concerning the Son by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Behold my Son, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom I am well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. \"[fn-105-P10525_2953899:115-nf] Hear also what He says to the Son: \"Is it a great thing for Thee, that Thou shouldest be called my Son to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the dispersed of Israel? I have given Thee for a light to the Gentiles, that Thou mayest be their salvation to the end of the earth. \"[fn-105-P10526_2954206:116-nf] Hear now also the Son's utterances respecting the Father: \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach the gospel unto men.\"[fn-105-P10527_2954381:117-nf] He speaks of Himself likewise to the Father in the Psalm: \"Forsake me not until I have declared the might of Thine arm to all the generation that is to come. \"[fn-105-P10528_2954577:118-nf] Also to the same purport in another Psalm: \"O Lord, how are they increased that trouble me!\"[fn-105-P10529_2954691:119-nf] But almost all the Psalms which prophesy of[fn-105-P10530_2954754:120-nf] the person of Christ, represent the Son as conversing with the Father-that is, represent Christ (as speaking) to God. Observe also the Spirit speaking of the Father and the Son, in the character of[fn-105-P10531_2954970:121-nf] a third Person: \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. \"[fn-105-P10532_2955097:122-nf] Likewise in the words of Isaiah: \"Thus saith the Lord to the Lord[fn-105-P10533_2955181:123-nf] mine Anointed. \"[fn-105-P10534_2955258:124-nf] Likewise, in the same prophet, He says to the Father respecting the Son: \"Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We brought a report concerning Him, as if He were a little child, as if He were a root in a dry ground, who had no form nor comeliness.\"[fn-105-P10535_2955570:125-nf] These are a few testimonies out of many; for we do not pretend to bring up all the passages of Scripture, because we have a tolerably large accumulation of them in the various heads of our subject, as we in our several chapters call them in as our witnesses in the fulness of their dignity and authority.[fn-105-P10536_2955899:126-nf] Still, in these few quotations the distinction of Persons in the Trinity is clearly set forth. For there is the Spirit Himself who speaks, and the Father to whom He speaks, and the Son of whom He speaks.[fn-105-P10537_2956160:127-nf] In the same manner, the other passages also establish each one of several Persons in His special character-addressed as they in some cases are to the Father or to the Son respecting the Son, in other cases to the Son or to the Father concerning the Father, and again in other instances to the (Holy) Spirit.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":45,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Well then, you reply, if He was God who spoke, and He was also God who created, at this rate, one God spoke and another created; (and thus) two Gods are declared. If you are so venturesome and harsh, reflect a while; and that you may think the better and more deliberately, listen to the psalm in which Two are described as God: \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of Thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee or made Thee His Christ.\"[fn-105-P10556_2961814:140-nf] Now, since He here speaks to God, and affirms that God is anointed by God, He must have affirmed that Two are God, by reason of the sceptre's royal power. Accordingly, Isaiah also says to the Person of Christ: \"The SabÂµans, men of stature, shall pass over to Thee; and they shall follow after Thee, bound in fetters; and they shall worship Thee, because God is in Thee: for Thou art our God, yet we knew it not; Thou art the God of Israel.\"[fn-105-P10557_2962277:141-nf] For here too, by saying, \"God is in Thee, and \"Thou art God,\" he sets forth Two who were God: (in the former expression in Thee, he means) in Christ, and (in the other he means) the Holy Ghost. That is a still grander statement which you will find expressly made in the Gospel: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-105-P10558_2962669:142-nf] There was One \"who was,\" and there was another \"with whom\" He was. But I find in Scripture the name Lord also applied to them Both: \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.\"[fn-105-P10559_2962876:143-nf] And Isaiah says this: \"Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? \"[fn-105-P10560_2963000:144-nf] Now he would most certainly have said Thine Arm, if he had not wished us to understand that the Father is Lord, and the Son also is Lord. A much more ancient testimony we have also in Genesis: \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.\"[fn-105-P10561_2963315:145-nf] Now, either deny that this is Scripture; or else (let me ask) what sort of man you are, that you do not think words ought to be taken and understood in the sense in which they are written, especially when they are not expressed in allegories and parables, but in determinate and simple declarations? If, indeed, you follow those who did not at the time endure the Lord when showing Himself to be the Son of God, because they would not believe Him to be the Lord, then (I ask you)call to mind along with them the passage where it is written, \"I have said, Ye are gods, and ye are children of the Most High; \"[fn-105-P10562_2963944:146-nf] and again, \"God standeth in the congregation of gods; \"[fn-105-P10563_2964022:147-nf] in order that, if the Scripture has not been afraid to designate as gods human beings, who have become sons of God by faith, you may be sure that the same Scripture has with greater propriety conferred the name of the Lord on the true and one-only Son of God. Very well! you say, I shall challenge you to preach from this day forth (and that, too, on the authority of these same Scriptures) two Gods and two Lords, consistently with your views. God forbid, (is my reply.) For we, who by the grace of God possess an insight into both the times and the occasions of the Sacred Writings, especially we who are followers of the Paraclete, not of human teachers, do indeed definitively declare that Two Beings are God, the Father and the Son, and, with the addition of the Holy Spirit, even Three, according to the principle of the divine economy, which introduces number, in order that the Father may not, as you perversely infer, be Himself believed to have been born and to have suffered, which it is not lawful to believe, forasmuch as it has not been so handed down. That there are, however, two Gods or two Lords, is a statement which at no time proceeds out of our mouth: not as if it were untrue that the Father is God, and the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and each is God; but because in earlier times Two were actually spoken of as God, and two as Lord, that when Christ should come He might be both acknowledged as God and designated as Lord, being the Son of Him who is both God and Lord. Now, if there were found in the Scriptures but one Personality of Him who is God and Lord, Christ would justly enough be inadmissible to the title of God and Lord: for (in the Scriptures) there was declared to be none other than One God and One Lord, and it must have followed that the Father should Himself seem to have come down (to earth), inasmuch as only One God and One Lord was ever read of (in the Scriptures), and His entire Economy would be involved in obscurity, which has been planned and arranged with so clear a foresight in His providential dispensation as matter for our faith. As soon, however, as Christ came, and was recognised by us as the very Being who had from the beginning[fn-105-P10564_2966241:148-nf] caused plurality[fn-105-P10565_2966272:149-nf] (in the Divine Economy), being the second from the Father, and with the Spirit the third, and Himself declaring and manifesting the Father more fully (than He had ever been before), the title of Him who is God and Lord was at once restored to the Unity (of the Divine Nature), even because the Gentiles would have to pass from the multitude of their idols to the One Only God, in order that a difference might be distinctly settled between the worshippers of One God and the votaries of polytheism. For it was only right that Christians should shine in the world as \"children of light,\" adoring and invoking Him who is the One God and Lord as \"the light of the world.\" Besides, if, from that perfect knowledge[fn-105-P10566_2966998:150-nf] which assures us that the title of God and Lord is suitable both to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, we were to invoke a plurality of gods and lords, we should quench our torches, and we should become less courageous to endure the martyr's sufferings, from which an easy escape would everywhere lie open to us, as soon as we swore by a plurality of gods and lords, as sundry heretics do, who hold more gods than One. I will therefore not speak of gods at all, nor of lords, but I shall follow the apostle; so that if the Father and the Son, are alike to be invoked, I shall call the Father \"God,\" and invoke Jesus Christ as \"Lord.\"[fn-105-P10567_2967668:151-nf] But when Christ alone (is mentioned), I shall be able to call Him \"God,\" as the same apostle says: \"Of whom is Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-105-P10568_2967845:152-nf] For I should give the name of\" sun\" even to a sunbeam, considered in itself; but if I were mentioning the sun from which the ray emanates, I certainly should at once withdraw the name of sun from the mere beam. For although I make not two suns, still I shall reckon both the sun and its ray to be as much two things and two forms[fn-105-P10569_2968195:153-nf] of one undivided substance, as God and His Word, as the Father and the Son.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":45,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_40_homily_xxxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"This beauty therefore let us seek, this countenance let us adorn; that God also may \"have pleasure in our beauty,\"[fn-35-P3544_1145678:24-nf] and impart to us of His everlasting blessings, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might forever and ever.

To explain the matter more fully, it will not appear absurd to make use of an illustration, although on a subject of so much difficulty it is not easy to obtain suitable illustrations. However, if we may speak without offence, the metal iron is capable of cold and heat. If, then, a mass of iron be kept constantly in the fire, receiving the heat through all its pores and veins, and the fire being continuous and the iron never removed from it, it become wholly converted into the latter; could we at all say of this, which is by nature a mass of iron, that when placed in the fire, and incessantly burning, it was at any time capable of admitting cold? On the contrary, because it is more consistent with truth, do we not rather say, what we often see happening in furnaces, that it has become wholly fire, seeing nothing but fire is visible in it? And if any one were to attempt to touch or handle it, he would experience the action not of iron, but of fire. In this way, then, that soul which, like an iron in the fire, has been perpetually placed in the Word, and perpetually in the Wisdom, and perpetually in God,[fn-66-P6602_1325503:94-nf] is God in all that it does, feels, and understands, and therefore can be called neither convertible nor mutable, inasmuch as, being incessantly heated, it possessed immutability from its union with the Word of God.

Moses was sent with a rod to effect the redemption of the people; and with this in his hands at the head of the people, he divided the sea. By this he saw the water gushing out of the rock; and when he cast a tree into the waters of Marah, which were bitter, he made them sweet. Jacob, by putting rods into the water-troughs, caused the sheep of his uncle to conceive, so that he should obtain their young. With his rod the same Jacob boasts that he had crossed the river. He said he had seen a ladder, and the Scripture has declared that God stood above it. But that this was not the Father, we have proved from the Scriptures. And Jacob, having poured oil on a stone in the same place, is testified to by the very God who appeared to him, that he had anointed a pillar to the God who appeared to him. And that the stone symbolically proclaimed Christ, we have also proved by many Scriptures; and that the unguent, whether it was of oil, or of stacte,[fn-48-P4818_1047511:339-nf] or of any other compounded sweet balsams, had reference to Him, we have also proved,[fn-48-P4819_1047685:340-nf] inasmuch as the word says: `Therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.'[fn-48-P4820_1047871:341-nf] For indeed all kings and anointed persons obtained from Him their share in the names of kings and anointed: just as He Himself received from the Father the titles of King, and Christ, and Priest, and Angel, and such like other titles which He bears or did bear. Aaron's rod, which blossomed, declared him to be the high priest. Isaiah prophesied that a rod would come forth from the root of Jesse, [and this was] Christ. And David says that the righteous man is `like the tree that is planted by the channels of waters, which should yield its fruit in its season, and whose leaf should not fade.'[fn-48-P4821_1048487:342-nf] Again, the righteous is said to flourish like the palm-tree.

The people found seventy willows and twelve springs after crossing the Jordan.[fn-48-P4822_1048722:343-nf] David affirms that God comforted him with a rod and staff. Elisha, by casting a stick[fn-48-P4823_1048858:344-nf] into the river Jordan, recovered the iron part of the axe with which the sons of the prophets had gone to cut down trees to build the house in which they wished to read and study the law and commandments of God; even as our Christ, by being crucified on the tree, and by purifying [us] with water, has redeemed us, though plunged in the direst offences which we have committed, and has made [us] a house of prayer and adoration.

I would not, therefore, have you distress yourself overmuch about these points, nor expose yourself needlessly either to penance or to condemnation. But there is a matter of real importance, as to which I can neither excuse nor defend you; namely, a statement openly made by you which is not only heathenish but beyond all heathenism and impiety-the statement in the treatise which I have mentioned above,[fn-89-P8909_2295285:32-nf] that God has a mother-in-law. Has anything so profane as this or so impious been said even by any of the heathen poets? It would be a foolish question to ask whether you find anything of the kind in the holy Scriptures. I only ask whether `your' Flaccus or Maro, whether Plautus or Terence, or even whether any writer of Satires among all their unclean and immodest sayings has ever uttered such an outrage against God. No doubt you were led astray by the fact that the girl to whom you addressed the treatise[fn-89-P8910_2295817:33-nf] was called the bride of Christ: and hence you thought that her mother according to the flesh might be called the mother-in-law of God. You did not recollect that such things are said not according to the order of the flesh, but according to the grace of the spirit. For a woman is called the bride of Christ because the word of God is united in a kind of mystic wedlock with the human soul. But if the mother of the girl in question is related to Christ by this spiritual connexion, she herself should be called the bride of Christ, not the mother-in-law of God. As it is, you might as well go on to call the father of the girl God's father-in-law, and her sister his sister-in-law, or to call the girl herself God's daughter-in-law. The fact is, you were so anxious to appear completely possessed of the eloquence of Plautus or of Cicero, that you forgot that the Apostle speaks of the whole church, parents and children, mothers and daughters, brothers and sisters, all together, as one virgin or bride, when he says,[fn-89-P8911_2297118:34-nf] \"I determined this very thing, to present you as a chaste virgin to one man, which is Christ.\" But you boast that you follow not Paul's but Porphyry's Introduction, and, since he wrote his impious and sacrilegious books against Christ and against God, you have fallen, through his introduction, into this abyss of blasphemy.","title":"Book II.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":45,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_48_book_iv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"ANF-04","text":"26. But let it be sufficient for us in all these matters to adapt our understanding to the rule of religion, and so to think of the words of the Holy Spirit as not to deem the language the ornate composition of feeble human eloquence, but to hold, according to the scriptural statement, that\" all the glory of the King is within,\"[fn-73-P7341_1676231:11-nf] and that the treasure of divine meaning is enclosed within the flail vessel of the common letter. And if any curious reader were still to ask an explanation of individual points, let him come and hear, along with ourselves, how the Apostle Paul, seeking to penetrate by help of the Holy Spirit, who searches even the \"deep things\" of God, into the depths of divine wisdom and knowledge, and yet, unable to reach the end, so to speak, and to come to a thorough knowledge, exclaims in despair and amazement, \"Oh the depth of the riches of the knowledge and wisdom of God!\"[fn-73-P7342_1677007:12-nf] Now, that it was from despair of attaining a perfect understanding that he uttered this exclamation, listen to his own words: \"How unsearchable are God's judgments! and His ways, how past finding out! \"[fn-73-P7343_1677228:13-nf] For he did not say that God's judgments were difficult to discover, but that they were altogether inscrutable; nor that it was (simply) difficult to trace out His ways, but that they were altogether past finding out. For however far a man may advance in his investigations, and how great soever the progress that he may make by unremitting study, assisted even by the grace of God, and with his mind enlightened, he will not be able to attain to the end of those things which are the object of his inquiries. Nor can any created mind deem it possible in any way to attain a full comprehension (of things); but after having discovered certain of the objects of its research, it sees again others which have still to be sought out. And even if it should succeed in mastering these, it will see again many others succeeding them which must form the subject of investigation. And on this account, therefore, Solomon, the wisest of men, beholding by his wisdom the nature of things, says, \"I said, I will become wise; and wisdom herself was made far from me, far further than it was; and a profound depth, who shall find? \"[fn-73-P7344_1678365:14-nf] Isaiah also, knowing that the beginnings of things could not be discovered by a mortal nature, and not even by those natures which, although more divine than human, were nevertheless themselves created or formed; knowing then, that by none of these could either the beginning or the end be discovered, says, \"Tell the former things which have been, and we know that ye are gods; or announce what are the last things, and then we shall see that ye are gods.\"[fn-73-P7345_1679015:15-nf] For my Hebrew teacher also used thus to teach, that as the beginning or end of all things could be comprehended by no one, save only our Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, so under the form of a vision Isaiah spake of two seraphim alone, who with two wings cover the countenance of God, and with two His feet, and with two do fly, calling to each other alternately, and saying, \"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of Sabaoth; the whole earth is full of Thy glory.\"[fn-73-P7346_1679510:16-nf] That the seraphim alone have both their wings over the face of God, and over His feet, we venture to declare as meaning that neither the hosts of holy angels, nor the \"holy seats,\" nor the \"dominions,\" nor the \"principalities,\" nor the \"powers,\" can fully understand the beginning of all things, and the limits of the universe. But we are to understand that those \"saints\" whom the Spirit has enrolled, and the \"virtues,\" approach very closely to those very beginnings, and attain to a height which the others cannot reach; and yet whatever it be that these \"virtues\" have learned through revelation from the Son of God and from the Holy Spirit-and they will certainly be able to learn very much, and those of higher rank much more than those of a lower-nevertheless it is impossible for them to comprehend all things, according to the statement, \"The most part of the works of God are hid.\"[fn-73-P7347_1680419:17-nf] And therefore also it is to be desired that every one, according to his strength, should ever stretch out to those things that are before, \"forgetting the things that are behind,\" both to better works and to a clearer apprehension and understanding, through Jesus Christ our Saviour, to whom be glory for ever!","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":45,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_48_book_iv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"ANF-04","text":"31.

For it is impossible to speak of the parts of an incorporeal being, or to make any division of them; but He is in all things, and through all things, and above all things, in the manner in which we have spoken above, i.e., in the manner in which He is understood to be either \"wisdom,\" or the \"word,\" or the \"life,\" or the \"truth,\" by which method of understanding all confinement of a local kind is undoubtedly excluded. The Son of God, then, desiring for the salvation of the human race to appear unto men, and to sojourn among them, assumed not only a human body, as some suppose, but also a soul resembling our souls indeed in nature, but in will and power[fn-73-P7372_1691350:33-nf] resembling Himself, and such as might unfailingly accomplish all the desires and arrangements of the \"word\" and \"wisdom.\" Now, that He had a soul,[fn-73-P7373_1691542:34-nf] is most clearly shown by the Saviour in the Gospels, when He said, \"No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-73-P7374_1691753:35-nf] And again, \"My soul is sorrowful even unto death.\"[fn-73-P7375_1691821:36-nf] And again, \"Now is my soul troubled.\"[fn-73-P7376_1691880:37-nf] For the \"Word\" of God is not to be understood to be a \"sorrowful and troubled\" soul, because with the authority of divinity He says, \"I have power to lay down my life.\" Nor yet do we assert that the Son of God was in that soul as he was in the soul of Paul or Peter and the other saints, in whom Christ is believed to speak as He does in Paul. But regarding all these we are to hold, as Scripture declares, \"No one is clean from filthiness, not even if his life lasted but a single day.\"[fn-73-P7377_1692387:38-nf] But this soul which was in Jesus, before it knew the evil, selected the good; and because He loved righteousness, and hated iniquity, therefore God \"anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His fellows.\"[fn-73-P7378_1692615:39-nf] He is anointed, then, with the oil of gladness when He is united to the \"word\" of God in a stainless union, and by this means alone of all souls was incapable of sin, because it was capable of (receiving) well and fully the Son of God; and therefore also it is one with Him, and is named by His titles, and is called Jesus Christ, by whom all things are said to be made. Of which soul, seeing it had received into itself the whole wisdom of God, and the truth, and the life, I think that the apostle also said this: \"Our life is hidden with Christ in God; but when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory.\"[fn-73-P7379_1693282:40-nf] For what other Christ can be here understood, who is said to be hidden in God, and who is afterwards to appear, except Him who is related to have been anointed with the oil of gladness, i.e., to have been filled with God essentially,[fn-73-P7380_1693541:41-nf] in whom he is now said to be hidden? For on this account is Christ proposed as an example to all believers, because as He always, even before he knew evil at all, selected the good, and loved righteousness, and hated iniquity, and therefore God anointed Him with the oil of gladness; so also ought each one, after a lapse or sin, to cleanse himself from his stains, making Him his example, and, taking Him as the guide of his journey, enter upon the steep way of virtue, that so perchance by this means, as far as possible we may, by imitating Him, be made partakers of the divine nature. according to the words of Scripture: \"He that saith that he believeth in Christ, ought so to walk, as He also walked.\"[fn-73-P7381_1694271:42-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":45,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"116","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"Â§6.

For the Jews, ignorant and untaught in the matter of this very descent of His, made these heretics their successors, seeing that to them it is said, \"Ye know not whence I come, and whither I go: ye judge after the flesh.\" As much they as the Jews, holding that the carnal birth of Christ was the only one, believed that Christ was nothing else than man; not considering this point, that as man could not come from heaven, so as that he might return thither, He who descended thence must be God, seeing that man could not come thence. If Christ is only man, how does He say, \"Ye are from below, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world? \"[fn-102-P10239_3194298:104-nf] But therefore if every man is of this world, and Christ is for that reason in this world, is He only man? God forbid! But consider what He says: \"I am not of this world.\" Does He then speak falsely when He says \"of this world,\" if He is only man? Or if He does not speak falsely, He is not of this world; He is therefore not man only, because He is not of this world. But that it should not be a secret who He was, He declared whence He was: \"I,\" said He, \"am from above,\" that is, from heaven, whence man cannot come, for he was not made in heaven. He is God, therefore, who is from above, and therefore He is not of this world; although, moreover, in a certain manner He is of this word: wherefore Christ is not God only, but man also. As reasonably in the way in which He is not of this world according to the divinity of the Word, so He is of this world according to the frailty of the body that He has taken upon Him. For man is joined with God, and God is linked with man. But on that account this Christ here laid more stress on the one aspect of His sole divinity, because the Jewish blindness contemplated in Christ the aspect alone of the flesh; and thence in the present passage He passed over in silence the frailty of the body, which is of the world, and spoke of His divinity alone, which is not of the world: so that in proportion as they had inclined to believe Him to be only man, in that proportion Christ might draw them to consider His divinity, so as to believe Him to be God, desirous to overcome their incredulity concerning His divinity by omitting in the meantime any mention of His human condition, and by setting before them His divinity alone. If Christ is man only, how does He say, \"I proceeded forth and came from God,\"[fn-102-P10240_3196072:105-nf] when it is evident that man was made by God, and did not proceed forth from Him? But in the way in which as man He proceeded not from God, thus the Word of God proceeded, of whom it is said, \"My heart hath uttered forth a good Word; \"[fn-102-P10241_3196330:106-nf] which, because it is from God, is with reason also with God. And this, too, since it was not uttered without effect, reasonably makes all things: \"For all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-102-P10242_3196565:107-nf] But this Word whereby all things were made (is God). \"And God,\" says he, \"was the Word.\"[fn-102-P10243_3196673:108-nf] Therefore God proceeded from God, in that the Word which proceeded is God, who proceeded forth from God. If Christ is only man, how does He say, \"If any man shall keep my word, he shall not see death for ever? \"[fn-102-P10244_3196904:109-nf] Not to see death for ever! what is this but immortality? But immortality is the associate of divinity, because both the divinity is immortal, and immortality is the fruit of divinity. For every man is mortal; and immortality cannot be from that which is mortal. Therefore from Christ, as a mortal man, immortality cannot arise. \"But,\" says He, \"whosoever keepeth my word, shall not see death for ever; \"therefore the word of Christ affords immortality, and by immortality affords divinity. But although it is not possible to maintain that one who is himself mortal can make another immortal, yet this word of Christ not only sets forth, but affords immortality: certainly He is not man only who gives immortality, which if He were only man He could not give; but by giving divinity by immortality, He proves Himself to be God by offering divinity, which if He were not God He could not give. If Christ was only man, how did He say, \"Before Abraham was, I Am? \"[fn-102-P10245_3197889:110-nf] For no man can be before Him from whom he himself is; nor can it be that any one should have been prior to him of whom he himself has taken his origin. And yet Christ, although He is born of Abraham, says that He is before Abraham. Either, therefore, He says what is not true, and deceives, if He was not before Abraham, seeing that He was of Abraham; or He does not deceive, if He is also God, and was before Abraham. And if this were not so, it follows that, being of Abraham, He could not be before Abraham. If Christ was only man, how does He say, \"And I know them, and my sheep follow me; and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish? \"[fn-102-P10246_3198572:111-nf] And yet, since every man is bound by the laws of mortality, and therefore is unable to keep himself for ever, much more will he be unable to keep another for ever. But Christ promises to give salvation for ever, which if He does not give, He is a deceiver; if He gives, He is God. But He does not deceive, for He gives what He promises. Therefore He is God who proffers eternal salvation, which man, being unable to keep himself for ever, cannot be able to give to another. If Christ is only man, what is that which He says, \"I and the Father are one? \"[fn-102-P10247_3199149:112-nf] For how can it be that \"I and the Father are one,\" if He is not both God and the Son?-who may therefore be called one, seeing that He is of Himself, being both His Son, and being born of Him, being declared to have proceeded from Him, by which He is also God; which when the Jews thought to be hateful, and believed to be blasphemous, for that He had shown Himself in these discourses to be God, and therefore rushed at once to stoning, and set to work passionately to hurl stones, He strongly refuted His adversaries by the example and witness of the Scriptures. \"If,\" said He, \"He called them gods to whom the words of God were given, and the Scriptures cannot be broken, ye say of Him whom the Father sanctified, and sent into this world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God.\"[fn-102-P10248_3199967:113-nf] By which words He did not deny Himself to be God, but rather He confirmed the assertion that He was God. For because, undoubtedly, they are said to be gods unto whom the words of God were given, much more is He God who is found to be superior to all these. And nevertheless He refuted the calumny of blasphemy in a fitting manner with lawful tact.[fn-102-P10249_3200338:114-nf] For He wishes that He should be thus understood to be God, as the Son of God, and He would not wish to be understood to be the Father Himself. Thus He said that He was sent, and showed them that He had manifested many good works from the Father; whence He desired that He should not be understood to be the Father, but the Son. And in the latter portion of His defence He made mention of the Son, not the Father, when He said, \"Ye say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God.\" Thus, as far as pertains to the guilt of blasphemy, He calls Himself the Son, not the Father; but as pertaining to His divinity, by saying, \"I and the Father are one,\" He proved that He was the Son of God. He is God, therefore, but God in such a manner as to be the Son, not the Father.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":45,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"ANF-05","text":"What if Moses pursues this same rule of truth, and delivers to us in the beginning of his sacred writings, this principle by which we may learn that all things were created and rounded by the Son of God, that is, by the Word of God?

For if John says, \"All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made,\"[fn-102-P10264_3208598:123-nf] the prophet David too says, \"I tell my works to the King.\"[fn-102-P10265_3208676:124-nf] Moses, moreover, introduces God commanding that there should be light at the first, that the heaven should be established, that the waters should be gathered into one place, that the dry land should appear, that the fruit should be brought forth according to its seed, that the animals should be produced, that lights should be established in heaven, and stars. He shows that none other was then present to God-by whom these works were commanded that they should be made-than He by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made. And if He is the Word of God-\"for my heart has uttered forth a good Word\"[fn-102-P10266_3209315:125-nf] -He shows that in the beginning the Word was, and that this Word was with the Father, and besides that the Word was God, and that all things were made by Him. Moreover, this \"Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,\"[fn-102-P10267_3209710:126-nf] -to wit, Christ the Son of God; whom both on receiving subsequently as man according to the flesh, and seeing before the foundation of the world to be the Word of God, and God, we reasonably, according to the instruction of the Old and New Testament, believe and hold to be as well God as man, Christ Jesus. What if the same Moses introduces God saying, \"Let us make man after our image and likeness; \"[fn-102-P10268_3210133:127-nf] and below, \"And God made man; in the image of God made He him, male and female made He them? \"[fn-102-P10269_3210248:128-nf] If, as we have already shown, it is the Son of God by whom all things were made, certainly it was the Son of God by whom also man was ordained, on whose account all things were made. Moreover, when God commands that man should be made, He is said to be God who makes man; but the Son of God makes man, that is to say, the Word of God, \"by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.\" And this Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us: therefore Christ is God; therefore man was made by Christ as by the Son of God. But God made man in the image of God; He is therefore God who made man in the image of God; therefore Christ is God: so that with reason neither does the testimony of the Old Testament waver concerning the person of Christ, being supported by the manifestation of the New Testament; nor is the power of the New Testament detracted from, while its truth is resting on the roots of the same Old Testament. Whence they who presume Christ the Son of God and man to be only man, and not God also, do so in opposition to both Old and New Testaments, in that they corrupt the authority and the truth both of the Old and New Testaments. What if the same Moses everywhere introduces God the Father infinite and without end, not as being enclosed in any place, but as one who includes every place; nor as one who is in a place, but rather one in whom every place is, containing all things and embracing all things, so that with reason He can neither descend nor ascend, because He Himself both contains and fills all things, and yet nevertheless introduces God descending to consider the tower which the sons of men were building, asking and saying, \"Come; \"and then, \"Let us go down and there confound their tongues, that each one may not understand the words of his neighbour.\"[fn-102-P10270_3212070:129-nf] Whom do they pretend here to have been the God who descended to that tower, and asking to visit those men at that time? God the Father? Then thus He is enclosed in a place; and how does He embrace all things? Or does He say that it is an angel descending with angels, and saying, \"Come; \"and subsequently, \"Let us go down and there confound their tongues? \"And yet in Deuteronomy we observe that God told these things, and that God said, where it is written, \"When He scattered abroad the children of Adam, He determined the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God.\"[fn-102-P10271_3212684:130-nf] Neither, therefore, did the Father descend, as the subject itself indicates; nor did an angel command these things, as the fact shows. Then it remains that He must have descended, of whom the Apostle Paul says, \"He who descended is the same who ascended above all the heavens, that He might fill all things,\"[fn-102-P10272_3213072:131-nf] that is, the Son of God, the Word of God.

For He was promised by Joel the prophet, but given by Christ. \"In the last days,\" says the prophet, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants and my handmaids.\"[fn-104-P10421_3281470:243-nf] And the Lord said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins ye remit, they shall be remitted; and whose ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-104-P10422_3281643:244-nf] But this Holy Spirit the Lord Christ calls at one time \"the Paraclete,\" at another pronounces to be the \"Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10423_3281790:245-nf] And He is not new in the Gospel, nor yet even newly given; for it was He Himself who accused the people in the prophets, and in the apostles gave them the appeal to the Gentiles. For the former deserved to be accused, because they had contemned the law; and they of the Gentiles who believe deserve to be aided by the defence of the Spirit, because they earnestly desire to attain to the Gospel law. Assuredly in the Spirit there are different kinds of offices, because in the times there is a different order of occasions; and yet, on this account, He who discharges these offices is not different, nor is He another in so acting, but He is one and the same, distributing His offices according to the times, and the occasions and impulses of things. Moreover, the Apostle Paul says, \"Having the same Spirit; as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-104-P10424_3282722:246-nf] He is therefore one and the same Spirit who was in the prophets and apostles, except that in the former He was occasional, in the latter always. But in the former not as being always in them, in the latter as abiding always in them; and in the former distributed with reserve, in the latter all poured out; in the former given sparingly, in the latter liberally bestowed; not yet manifested before the Lord's resurrection, but conferred after the resurrection. For, said He, \"I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Advocate, that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10425_3283345:247-nf] And, \"When He, the Advocate, shall come, whom I shall send unto you from my Father, the Spirit of truth who proceedeth from my Father.\"[fn-104-P10426_3283506:248-nf] And, \"If I go not away, that Advocate shall not come to you; but if I go away, I will send Him to you.\"[fn-104-P10427_3283631:249-nf] And, \"When the Spirit of truth shall come, He will direct you into all the truth.\"[fn-104-P10428_3283735:250-nf] And because the Lord was about to depart to the heavens, He gave the Paraclete out of necessity to the disciples; so as not to leave them in any degree orphans,[fn-104-P10429_3283918:251-nf] which was little desirable, and forsake them without an advocate and some kind of protector. For this is He who strengthened their hearts and minds, who marked out the Gospel sacraments, who was in them the enlightener of divine things; and they being strengthened, feared, for the sake of the Lord's name, neither dungeons nor chains, nay, even trod under foot the very powers of the world and its tortures, since they were henceforth armed and strengthened by the same Spirit, having in themselves the gifts which this same Spirit distributes, and appropriates to the Church, the spouse of Christ, as her ornaments. This is He who places prophets in the Church, instructs teachers, directs tongues, gives powers and healings, does wonderful works, often discrimination of spirits, affords powers of government, suggests counsels, and orders and arranges whatever other gifts there are of charismata; and thus make the Lord's Church everywhere, and in all, perfected and completed. This is He who, after the manner of a dove, when our Lord was baptized, came and abode upon Him, dwelling in Christ full and entire, and not maimed in any measure or portion; but with His whole overflow copiously distributed and sent forth, so that from Him others might receive some enjoyment of His graces: the source of the entire Holy Spirit remaining in Christ, so that from Him might be drawn streams of gifts and works, while the Holy Spirit dwelt affluently in Christ. For truly Isaiah, prophesying this, said: \"And the Spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and piety; and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-104-P10430_3285641:252-nf] This self-same thing also he said in the person of the Lord Himself, in another place, ' \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because He has anointed me, He has sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor.\"[fn-104-P10431_3285866:253-nf] Similarly David: \"Wherefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\"[fn-104-P10432_3285998:254-nf] Of Him the Apostle Paul says: \"For he who hath not the Spirit of Christ is none of His.\"[fn-104-P10433_3286107:255-nf] \"And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"[fn-104-P10434_3286186:256-nf] He it is who effects with water the second birth as a certain seed of divine generation, and a consecration of a heavenly nativity, the pledge of a promised inheritance, and as it were a kind of handwriting of eternal salvation; who can make us God's temple, and fit us for His house; who solicits the divine hearing for us with groanings that cannot be uttered; filling the offices of advocacy, and manifesting the duties of our defence,-an inhabitant given for our bodies and an effector of their holiness. Who, working in us for eternity, can also produce our bodies at the resurrection of immortality, accustoming them to be associated in Himself with heavenly power, and to be allied with the divine eternity of the Holy Spirit. For our bodies are both trained in Him and by Him to advance to immortality, by learning to govern themselves with moderation according to His decrees. For this is He who \"desireth against the flesh,\" because \"the flesh resisteth against the Spirit.\"[fn-104-P10435_3287195:257-nf] This is He who restrains insatiable desires, controls immoderate lusts, quenches unlawful fires, conquers reckless impulses, repels drunkenness, checks avarice, drives away luxurious revellings, links love, binds together affections, keeps down sects, orders the rule of truth, overcomes heretics, turns out the wicked, guards the Gospel, Of this says the same apostle: \"We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God.\"[fn-104-P10436_3287665:258-nf] Concerning Him he exultingly says: \"And I think also that I have the Spirit of God.\"[fn-104-P10437_3287773:259-nf] Of Him he says: \"The Spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets.\"[fn-104-P10438_3287870:260-nf] Of Him also he tells: \"Now the Spirit speaketh plainly, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, doctrines of demons, who speak lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience cauterized.\"[fn-104-P10439_3288127:261-nf] Established in this Spirit, \"none ever calleth Jesus anathema; \"[fn-104-P10440_3288214:262-nf] no one has ever denied Christ to be the Son of God, or has rejected God the Creator; no one utters any words of his own contrary to the Scriptures; no one ordains other and sacrilegious decrees; no one draws up different laws.[fn-104-P10441_3288464:263-nf] Whosoever shall blaspheme against Him, \"hath not forgiveness, not only in this world, but also not in the world to come.\"[fn-104-P10442_3288722:264-nf] This is He who in the apostles gives testimony to Christ; in the martyrs shows forth the constant faithfulness of their religion; in virgins restrains the admirable continency of their sealed chastity; in others, guards the laws of the Lord's doctrine incorrupt and uncontaminated; destroys heretics, corrects the perverse, condemns infidels, makes known pretenders; moreover, rebukes the wicked, keeps the Church uncorrupt and inviolate, in the sanctity of a perpetual virginity and truth.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":45,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_44_oration_xxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XVII.

Caesarius, also styled elsewhere Master of the Offices, enjoyed a similar reputation for high character. But this Homily was pronounced when the people of Antioch were almost free from fear. \"We expected,\" says Chrysostom (No. 1.), \"innumerable horrors, that the property of all was to be plundered; the habitations consumed, together with their inmates; the city snatched away from the midst of the world; and all its relics obliterated, and its soil ploughed up: but, lo! all these things stood only in expectance, and came not actually to pass.\" Next he relates how the monks descended from the mountains to Antioch, that they might appease the judges, while at the same time all the Greek philosophers deserted the city; and in what way also the priests strenuously exerted themselves on behalf of the people. He declares the penalties imposed by the Emperor to be light and easy, and no matter of grief or complaint, though the orchestra and public bath were closed, and the dignity of a metropolis taken away from the city of Antioch. The true dignity of Antioch was, that the disciples of Christ were first called Christians there; that the people of Antioch had brought assistance to the saints at Jerusalem, when struggling with famine; that not magnitude, but piety, is the ornament of cities. Finally, however, he says that some were yet remaining in prison; and that others were sent into exile.

For I would that some one would tell me how they \"crept into the garden enclosed and the fountain sealed,\" of whom Cyprian bears witness that they renounced the world in word and not in deed, and that yet they were within the Church. For if they both are themselves there, and are themselves the bride of Christ, can she then be as she is described \"without spot or wrinkle,\"[fn-38-P3821_2102069:102-nf] and is the fair dove defiled with such a portion of her members?

For they know how to say, \"My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto Thy word.\"[fn-38-P3829_2103749:110-nf] But when \"in anything they be otherwise minded, God shallreveal even this unto them,\"[fn-38-P3830_2103856:111-nf] if they abide in the burning flame of charity, and do not break the bond of peace. But some who are yet carnal, and full of fleshly appetites, are instant in working out their progress; and that they may become fit for heavenly food,they are nourished with the milk of the holy mysteries, they avoid in the fear of God whatever is manifestly corrupt even in the opinion of the world, and they strive most watchfully that they may be less and less delighted with worldly and temporal matters. They observe most constantly the rule of faith which has been sought out with diligence; and if in aught they stray from it, they submit to speedy correction under Catholic authority, although, in Cyprian's words, they be tossed about, by reason of their fleshly appetite, with the various conflicts of phantasies. There are some also who as yet live wickedly, or even lie in heresies or the superstitions of the Gentiles, and yet even then \"the Lord knoweth them that are His.\" For, in that unspeakable foreknowledge of God, many who seem to be without are in reality within, and many who seem to be within yet really are without. Of all those, therefore, who, if I may so say, are inwardly and secretly within, is that \"enclosed garden\" composed, \"the fountain sealed, a well of living water, the orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits.\" The divinely imparted gifts of these are partly peculiar to themselves, as in this world the charity that never faileth, and in the world to come eternal life; partly they are common with evil and perverse men, as all the other things in which consist the holy mysteries.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":45,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_140_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"9. \"Let us love,[fn-45-P4597_2481001:32-nf] because He first loved us.\"[fn-45-P4598_2481046:33-nf] For how should we love, except He had first loved us? By loving we became friends: but He loved us as enemies, that we might be made friends. He first loved us, and gave us the gift of loving Him. We did not yet love Him: by loving we are made beautiful. If a man deformed and ill-featured love a beautiful woman, what shall he do? Or what shall a woman do, if, being deformed and ill-featured and black-complexioned, she love a beautiful man? By loving can she become beautiful? Can he by loving become handsome? He loves a beautiful woman, and when he sees himself in a mirror, he is ashamed to lift up his face to her his lovely one of whom he is enamored. What shall he do that he may be beautiful? Does he wait for good looks to come? Nay rather, by waiting old age is added to him, and makes him uglier. There is nothing then to do, there is no way to advise him, but only that he should restrain himself, and not presume to love unequally: or if perchance he does love her, and wishes to take her to wife, in her let him love chastity, not the face of flesh. But our soul, my brethren, is unlovely by reason of iniquity: by loving God it becomes lovely. What a love must that be that makes the lover beautiful! But God is always lovely, never unlovely, never changeable. Who is always lovely first loved us; and what were we when He loved us but foul and unlovely? But not to leave us foul; no, but to change us, and of unlovely make us lovely. How shall we become lovely? By loving Him who is always lovely. As the love increases in thee, so the loveliness increases: for love is itself the beauty of the soul. \"Let us love, because He first loved us.\" Hear the apostle Paul: \"But God showed His love in us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us:\"[fn-45-P4599_2482839:34-nf] the just for the unjust, the beautiful for the foul.

Again see why it is that He is fair; \"Beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of men:\" because \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-46-P4601_2483240:36-nf] But in that He took flesh, He took upon Him, as it were, thy foulness, i.e. thy mortality, that He might adapt Himself to thee, and become suited to thee, and stir thee up to the love of the beauteousness within. Where then in Scripture do we find Jesus uncomely and deformed, as we have found Him comely and \"beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of men?\" where find we Him also deformed? Ask Esaias: \"And we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness.\"[fn-46-P4602_2483717:37-nf] There now are two flutes which seem to make discordant sounds: howbeit one Spirit breathes into both. By this it is said, \"Beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of men:\" by that it is said in Esaias, \"We saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness.\" By one Spirit are both flutes filled, they make no dissonance. Turn not away thine ears, apply the understanding. Let us ask the apostle Paul, and let him expound to us the unison of the two flutes, Let him sound to us the note, \"Beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of men.-Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\"[fn-46-P4603_2484349:38-nf] Let him sound to us also the note, \"We saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness.-He made Himself of no reputation, taking upon Him the form of a servant, made in the likeness of men, and in fashion found as man.

Today is the glad spring-time to us, and Christ the Sun of righteousness has beamed with clear light around us, and has illumined the minds of the faithful. To-day is Adam made anew,[fn-11-P1143_281985:2-nf] and moves in the choir of angels, having winged his way to heaven. To-day is the whole circle of the earth filled with joy, since the sojourn of the Holy Spirit has been realized to men. To-day the grace of God and the hope of the unseen shine through all wonders transcending imagination, and make the mystery that was kept hid from eternity plainly discernible to us. To-day are woven the chaplets of never-fading virtue. To-day, God, willing to crown the sacred heads of those whose pleasure is to hearken to Him, and who delight in His festivals, invites the lovers of unswerving faith as His called and His heirs; and the heavenly kingdom is urgent to summon those who mind celestial things to join the divine service of the incorporeal choirs. To-day is fulfilled the word of David, \"Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad. The fields shall be joyful, and all the trees of the wood before the Lord, because He cometh.\"[fn-11-P1144_282976:3-nf] David thus made mention of the trees;[fn-11-P1145_283034:4-nf] and the Lord's forerunner also spoke of them as trees[fn-11-P1146_283098:5-nf] \"that should bring forth fruits meet for repentance,\"[fn-11-P1147_283164:6-nf] or rather for the coming of the Lord. But our Lord Jesus Christ promises perpetual gladness to all those who believe on Him. For He says, \"I will see you, and ye shall rejoice; and your joy no man taketh from you.\"[fn-11-P1148_283396:7-nf] To-day is the illustrious and ineffable mystery of Christians, who have willingly[fn-11-P1149_283495:8-nf] set their hope like a seal upon Christ, plainly declared to us. To-day did Gabriel, who stands by God, come to the pure virgin, bearing to her the glad annunciation, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured![fn-11-P1150_283728:9-nf] And she cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be. And the angel immediately proceeded to say, The Lord is with thee: fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favour with God. Behold,[fn-11-P1151_283938:10-nf] thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call[fn-11-P1152_284035:11-nf] His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David, and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever: and of His kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? \"[fn-11-P1153_284393:12-nf] Shall I still remain a virgin? is the honour of virginity not then lost by me? And while she was yet in perplexity as to these things, the angel placed shortly before her the summary of his whole message, and said to the pure virgin, \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\" For what it is, that also shall it be called by all means. Meekly, then, did grace make election of the pure Mary alone out of all generations. For she proved herself prudent truly in all things; neither has any woman been born like her in all generations. She was not like the primeval virgin Eve, who, keeping holiday[fn-11-P1154_285151:13-nf] alone in paradise, with thoughtless mind, unguardedly hearkened to the word of the serpent, the author of all evil, and thus became depraved in the thoughts of her mind;[fn-11-P1155_285337:14-nf] and through her that deceiver, discharging his poison and refusing death with it, brought it into the whole world; and in virtue of this has arisen all the trouble of the saints. But in the holy Virgin alone is the fall of that (first mother) repaired. Yet was not this holy one competent to receive the gift until she had first learned who it was that sent it, and what the gift was, and who it was that conveyed it. While the holy one pondered these things in perplexity with herself, she says to the angel, \"Whence hast thou brought to us the blessing in such wise? Out of what treasure-stores is the pearl of the word despatched to us? Whence has the gift acquired its purpose[fn-11-P1156_286088:15-nf] toward us? From heaven art thou come, yet thou walkest upon earth! Thou dost exhibit the form of man, and (yet) thou art glorious with dazzling light.\"[fn-11-P1157_286290:16-nf] These things the holy one considered with herself, and the archangel solved the difficulty expressed in such reasonings by saying to her: \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. And fear not, Mary; for I am not come to overpower thee with fear, but to repel the subject of fear. Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God. Question not grace by the standard of nature. For grace does not endure to pass under the laws of nature. Thou knowest, O Mary, things kept hid from the patriarchs and prophets. Thou hast learned, O virgin, things which were kept concealed till now from the angels. Thou hast heard, O purest one, things of which even the choir of inspired men[fn-11-P1158_287148:17-nf] was never deemed worthy. Moses, and David, and Isaiah, and Daniel, and all the prophets, prophesied of Him; but the manner they knew not. Yet thou alone, O purest virgin, art now made the recipient of things of which all these were kept in ignorance, and thou dost learn[fn-11-P1159_287434:18-nf] the origin of them. For where the Holy Spirit is, there are all things readily ordered. Where divine grace is present, all things are found possible with God. The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall; overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\" And if He is the Son of God, then is He also God, of one form with the Father, and co-eternal; in Him the Father possesses all manifestation;[fn-11-P1160_287980:19-nf] He is His image in the person, and through His reflection the (Father's) glory shines forth. And as from the ever-flowing fountain the streams proceed, so also from this ever-flowing and ever-living fountain does the light of the world proceed, the perennial and the true, namely Christ our God. For it is of this that the prophets have preached: \"The streams of the river make glad the city of God.\"[fn-11-P1161_288398:20-nf] And not one city only, but all cities; for even as it makes glad one city, so does it also the whole world. Appropriately, therefore, did the angel[fn-11-P1162_288564:21-nf] say to Mary the holy virgin first of all, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee; \"inasmuch as with her was laid up the full treasure of grace. For of all generations she alone has risen as a virgin pure in body and in spirit; and she alone bears Him who bears all things on His word. Nor is it only the beauty of this holy one in body that calls forth our admiration, but also the innate virtue of her soul. Wherefore also the angels addressed her first with the salutation, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured,[fn-11-P1163_289119:22-nf] the Lord is with thee, and no spouse of earth; \"He Himself is with thee who is the Lord of sanctification, the Father of purity, the Author of incorruption, and the Bestower of liberty, the Curator of salvation, and the Steward and Provider of the true peace, who out of the virgin earth made man, and out of man's side formed Eve in addition. Even this Lord is with thee, and on the other hand also is of thee. Come, therefore, beloved brethren, and let us take up the angelic strain, and to the utmost of our ability return the due meed of praise, saying, \"Hail,[fn-11-P1164_289712:23-nf] thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee!\" For it is thine truly to rejoice, seeing that the grace of God, as he knows, has chosen to dwell with thee-the Lord of glory dwelling with the handmaiden; \"He that is fairer than the children of men \"[fn-11-P1165_289986:24-nf] with the fair virgin; He who sanctifies all things with the undefiled. God is with thee, and with thee also is the perfect man in whom dwells the whole fulness of the Godhead. Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the fountain of the light that lightens all who believe upon Him! Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the rising of the rational Sun,[fn-11-P1166_290351:25-nf] and the undefiled flower of Life! Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the mead[fn-11-P1167_290546:26-nf] of sweet savour! Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the ever-blooming vine, that makes glad the souls of those who honour thee? Hail, thou that art highly favoured!-the soil that, all untilled, bears bounteous fruit: for thou hast brought forth in accordance with the law of nature indeed, as it goes with us, and by the set time of practice,[fn-11-P1168_290906:27-nf] and yet in a way beyond nature, or rather above nature, by reason that God the Word from above took His abode in thee, and formed the new Adam in thy holy womb, and inasmuch as the Holy Ghost gave the power of conception to the holy virgin; and the reality of His body was assumed from her body. And just as the pearl[fn-11-P1169_291270:28-nf] comes of the two natures, namely lightning and water, the occult signs of the sea; so also our Lord Jesus Christ proceeds, without fusion and without mutation, from the pure, and chaste, and undefiled, and holy Virgin Mary; perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity, in all things equal to the Father, and in all things consubstantial with us, apart from sin.","title":"The First Homily on the Annunciation to the Holy Virgin Mary.","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":45,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_23_the_first_homily_on_the_annunciation_to_the_holy_virgin_mary_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Most of the holy fathers, and patriarchs, and prophets desired to see Him, and to be eye-witnesses of Him, but did not attaint hereto.

Come, then, ye too, dearly beloved, and let us chant the melody which has been taught us by the inspired harp of David, and say, \"Arise, O Lord, into Thy rest; Thou, and the ark of Thy sanctuary.\"[fn-11-P1171_292546:29-nf] For the holy Virgin is in truth an ark, wrought with gold both within and without, that has received the whole treasury of the sanctuary. \"Arise, O Lord, into Thy rest.\" Arise, O Lord, out of the bosom of the Father, in order that Thou mayest raise up the fallen race of the first-formed man. Setting these things forth,[fn-11-P1172_292901:30-nf] David in prophecy said to the rod that was to spring from himself, and to sprout into the flower of that beauteous fruit, \"Hearken, O daughter, and see, and incline thine ear, and forget thine own people and thy father's house; so shall the King greatly desire thy beauty: for He is the Lord thy God, and thou shalt worship Him.\"[fn-11-P1173_293248:31-nf] Hearken, O daughter, to the things which were prophesied beforetime of thee, in order that thou mayest also behold the things themselves with the eyes of understanding. Hearken to me while I announce things beforehand to thee, and hearken to the archangel who declares expressly to thee the perfect mysteries. Come then, dearly beloved, and let us fall back on the memory of what has gone before us; and let us glorify, and celebrate, and laud, and bless that rod that has sprung so marvellously from Jesse. For Luke, in the inspired Gospel narratives, delivers a testimony not to Joseph only, but also to Mary the mother of God, and gives this account with reference to the very family and house of David: \"For Joseph went up,\" says he, \"from Galilee, unto a city of Judea which is called Bethlehem, to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child, because they were of the house and family of David. And so it was, that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered; and she broughtforth her son, the first-born of the whole creation,[fn-11-P1174_294388:32-nf] and wrapped him in swaddling-clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.\"[fn-11-P1175_294560:33-nf] She wrapped in swaddling-clothes Him who is covered with light as with a garment.[fn-11-P1176_294661:34-nf] She wrapped in swaddling-clothes Him who made every creature. She laid in a manger Him who sits above the cherubim,[fn-11-P1177_294794:35-nf] and is praised by myriads of angels. In the manger set apart for dumb brutes did the Word of God repose, in order that He might impart to men, who are really irrational by free choice, the perceptions of true reason. In the board from which cattle eat was laid the heavenly Bread,[fn-11-P1178_295093:36-nf] in order that He might provide participation in spiritual sustenance for men who live like the beasts of the earth. Nor was there even room for Him in the inn. He found no place, who by His word established heaven and earth; \"for though He was rich, for our sakes He became poor,\"[fn-11-P1179_295402:37-nf] and chose extreme humiliation on behalf of the salvation of our nature, in His inherent goodness toward us. He who fulfilled the whole administration[fn-11-P1180_295573:38-nf] of unutterable mysteries of the economy[fn-11-P1181_295637:39-nf] in heaven in the bosom of the Father, and in the cave in the arms of the mother, reposed in the manger. Angelic choirs encircled Him, singing of glory in heaven and of peace upon earth. In heaven He was seated at the right hand of the Father; and in the manger He rested, as it were, upon the cherubim. Even there was in truth His cherubic throne; there was His royal seat. Holy of the holy, and alone glorious upon the earth, and holier than the holy, was that wherein Christ our God rested. To Him be glory, honour, and power. together with the Father undefiled, and the altogether holy and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of the ages. Amen.

And when Moses the beloved of God was in exile, then it was that he saw that great sight, and being preserved from his persecutors, was sent as a prophet into Egypt, and being made the minister of those mighty wonders and of the Law, he led that great people in the wilderness.

They say then, that the Apostle writes, `Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is above every name; that in the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth[fn-55-P5538_2192769:204-nf] ;' and David, `Wherefore God even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows[fn-55-P5539_2192908:205-nf] .' Then they urge, as something acute: `If He was exalted and received grace, on a `wherefore,' and on a `wherefore' He was anointed, He received a reward of His purpose; but having acted from purpose, He is altogether of an alterable nature.' This is what Eusebius[fn-55-P5540_2193193:206-nf] and Arius have dared to say, nay to write while their partizans do not shrink from conversing about it in full market-place, not seeing how mad an argument they rise. For if He received what He had as a reward of His purpose, and would not have had it, unless He had needed it, and had His work to shew for it, then having gained it from virtue and promotion, with reason had He `therefore' been called Son and God, without being very Son. For what is from another by nature, is a real offspring, as Isaac was to Abraham, and Joseph to Jacob, and the radiance to the sun; but the so called sons from virtue and grace, have but in place of nature a grace by acquisition, and are something else besides[fn-55-P5541_2193939:207-nf] the gift itself; as the men who have received the Spirit by participation, concerning whom Scripture saith, `I begat and exalted children, and they rebelled against Me[fn-55-P5542_2194123:208-nf] .'

If then they suppose that the Saviour was not Lord and King, even before He became man and endured the Cross, but then began to be Lord, let them know that they are openly reviving the statements of the Samosatene. But if, as we have quoted and declared above, He is Lord and King everlasting, seeing that Abraham worships Him as Lord, and Moses says, `Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven[fn-58-P5887_2350797:70-nf] ;' and David in the Psalms, `The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand[fn-58-P5888_2350899:71-nf] ;' and, `Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy Kingdom[fn-58-P5889_2351022:72-nf] ;' and, `Thy Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom[fn-58-P5890_2351086:73-nf] ;' it is plain that even before He became man, He was King and Lord everlasting, being Image and Word of the Father. And the Word being everlasting Lord and King, it is very plain again that Peter said not that the Essence of the Son was made, but spoke of His Lordship over us, which `became' when He became man, and, redeeming all by the Cross, became Lord of all and King. But if they continue the argument on the ground of its being written, `He made,' not willing that `He made' should be taken in the sense of `He manifested,' either from want of apprehension, or from their Christ-opposing purpose, let them attend to another sound exposition of Peter's words. For he who becomes Lord of others, comes into the possession of beings already in existence; but if the Lord is Framer of all and everlasting King, and when He became man, then gained possession of us, here too is a way in which Peter's language evidently does not signify that the Essence of the Word is a work, but the after-subjection of all things, and the Saviour's Lordship which came to be over all.

For had He been a creature, He had not said, `He begets me,' for the creatures are from without, and are works of the Maker; but the Offspring is not from without nor a work, but from the Father, and proper to His Essence. Wherefore they are creatures; this God's Word and Only-begotten Son. For instance, Moses did not say of the creation, `In the beginning He begat,' nor `In the beginning was,' but `In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth[fn-62-P6254_2496239:372-nf] .' Nor did David say in the Psalm, `Thy hands have \"begotten me,\"' but `made me and fashioned me[fn-62-P6255_2496354:373-nf] ,' everywhere applying the word `made' to the creatures. But to the Son contrariwise; for he has not said `I made,' but `I begat[fn-62-P6256_2496504:374-nf] ,' and `He begets me,' and `My heart uttered a good Word[fn-62-P6257_2496579:375-nf] .' And in the instance of the creation, `In the beginning He made;' but in the instance of the Son, `In the beginning was the Word[fn-62-P6258_2496729:376-nf] .' And there is this difference, that the creatures are made upon the beginning, and have a beginning of existence connected with an interval; wherefore also what is said of them, `In the beginning He made,' is as much as saying of them, `From the beginning He made:'-as the Lord, knowing that which He had made, taught, when He silenced the Pharisees, with the words, `He which made them from the beginning, made them male and female[fn-62-P6259_2497182:377-nf] ;' for from some beginning, when they were not yet, were originate things brought into being and created. This too the Holy Spirit has signified in the Psalms, saying, `Thou, Lord, at the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth[fn-62-P6260_2497439:378-nf] ;' and again, `O think upon Thy congregation which Thou hast purchased from the beginning[fn-62-P6261_2497549:379-nf] ;' now it is plain that what takes place at the beginning, has a beginning of creation, and that from some beginning God purchased His congregation. And that `In the beginning He made,' from his saying `made,' means `began to make,' Moses himself shews by saying, after the completion of all things, `And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because that in it He had rested from all His work which God began to make[fn-62-P6262_2497997:380-nf] .' Therefore the creatures began to be made; but the Word of God, not having beginning of being, certainly did not begin to be, nor begin to come to be, but was ever. And the works have their beginning in their making, and their beginning precedes their coming to be; but the Word, not being of things which come to be, rather comes to be Himself the Framer of those which have a beginning. And the being of things originate is measured by their becoming[fn-62-P6263_2498471:381-nf] , and from some beginning does God begin to make them through the Word, that it may be known that they were not before their origination; but the Word has His being, in no other beginning[fn-62-P6264_2498686:382-nf] than the Father, whom[fn-62-P6265_2498739:383-nf] they allow to be without beginning, so that He too exists without beginning? the Father, being His Offspring, not His creature.

And now observe wherein the Lord's gentleness was tempted by His enemies. \"And the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman just taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst, and said to Him, Master, this woman has just been taken in adultery. Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? But this they said, tempting Him, that they might accuse Him.\" Why accuse Him? Had they detected Himself in any misdeed; or was that woman said to have been concerned with Him in any manner? What, then, is the meaning of \"tempting Him, that they might accuse Him\"? We understand, brethren, that a wonderful gentleness shone out pre-eminently in the Lord. They observed that He was very meek, very gentle: for of Him it had been previously foretold, \"Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O most Mighty; in Thy splendor and beauty urge on, march on prosperously, and reign, because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness.\"[fn-14-P1496_941787:2-nf] Accordingly, as a teacher, He brought truth; as a deliverer, He brought gentleness; as a protector, He brought righteousness. That He was to reign on account of these things, the prophet had by the Holy Spirit foretold. When He spoke His truth was acknowledged; when He was not provoked to anger against His enemies, His meekness was praised. Whilst, therefore, in respect of these two,-namely, His truth and meekness,-His enemies were tormented with malice and envy; in respect of the third,-namely, righteousness,-they laid a stumbling-block for Him. In what way? Because the law had commanded the adulterers to be stoned, and surely the law could not command what was unjust: if any man should say other than the law had commanded, he would be detected as unjust. Therefore they said among themselves, \"He is accounted true, he appears to be gentle; an accusation must be sought against him in respect of righteousness. Let us bring before him a woman taken in adultery; let us say to him what is ordered in the law concerning such: if he shall approve her being stoned, he will not show his gentleness; if he consent to let her go, he will not keep righteousness. But, say they, that he may not lose the reputation of gentleness, for which he is become an object of love to the people, without doubt he will say that she must be let go. Hence we find an opportunity of accusing him, and we charge him as being a transgressor of the law: saying to him, Thou art an enemy to the law; thou answerest against Moses, nay, against Him who gave the law through Moses; thou art worthy of death: thou too must be stoned with this woman.\" By these words and sentiments they might possibly be able to inflame envy against Him, to urge accusation, and cause His condemnation to be eagerly demanded. But this against whom? It was perversity against rectitude, falsehood against the truth, the corrupt heart against the upright heart, folly against wisdom. When did such men prepare snares, into which they did not first thrust their own heads? Behold, the Lord in answering them will both keep righteousness, and will not depart from gentleness. He was not taken for whom the snare was laid, but rather they were taken who laid it, because they believed not on Him who could pull them out of the net.","title":"Tractate XXXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":45,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"88","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"59.

Therefore call not the Son a work of good pleasure; nor bring in the doctrine of Valentinus into the Church; but be He the Living Counsel, and Offspring in truth and nature, as the Radiance from the Light.

But if the Word be in the heart, where is will? and if the Son in the Father, where is good pleasure? and if He be Will Himself, how is counsel in Will? it is unseemly; lest the Word come into being in a word, and the Son in a son, and Wisdom in a wisdom, as has been repeatedly[fn-70-P7064_2809327:478-nf] said. For the Son is the Father's All; and nothing was in the Father before the Word; but in the Word is will also, and through Him the objects of will are carried into effect, as holy Scriptures have shewn. And I could wish that the irreligious men, having fallen into such want of reason[fn-70-P7065_2809638:479-nf] as to be considering about will, would now ask their childbearing women no more, whom they used to ask, `Hadst thou a son before conceiving him[fn-70-P7066_2809807:480-nf] ?' but the father, `Do ye become fathers by counsel, or by the natural law of your will?' or `Are your children like your nature and essence[fn-70-P7067_2809966:481-nf] ?' that, even from fathers they may learn shame, from whom they assumed this proposition[fn-70-P7068_2810151:482-nf] about birth, and from whom they hoped to gain knowledge in point. For they will reply to them, `What we beget, is like, not our good pleasure[fn-70-P7069_2810318:483-nf] , but like ourselves; nor become we parents by previous counsel, but to beget is proper to our nature; since we too are images of our fathers.' Either then let them condemn themselves[fn-70-P7070_2810520:484-nf] , and cease asking women about the Son of God, or let them learn from them, that the Son is begotten not by will, but in nature and truth.

Therefore call not the Son a work of good pleasure; nor bring in the doctrine of Valentinus into the Church; but be He the Living Counsel, and Offspring in truth and nature, as the Radiance from the Light. For thus has the Father spoken, `My heart uttered a good Word;' and the Son conformably, `I in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-70-P7063_2809012:477-nf] .' But if the Word be in the heart, where is will? and if the Son in the Father, where is good pleasure? and if He be Will Himself, how is counsel in Will? it is unseemly; lest the Word come into being in a word, and the Son in a son, and Wisdom in a wisdom, as has been repeatedly[fn-70-P7064_2809327:478-nf] said. For the Son is the Father's All; and nothing was in the Father before the Word; but in the Word is will also, and through Him the objects of will are carried into effect, as holy Scriptures have shewn. And I could wish that the irreligious men, having fallen into such want of reason[fn-70-P7065_2809638:479-nf] as to be considering about will, would now ask their childbearing women no more, whom they used to ask, `Hadst thou a son before conceiving him[fn-70-P7066_2809807:480-nf] ?' but the father, `Do ye become fathers by counsel, or by the natural law of your will?' or `Are your children like your nature and essence[fn-70-P7067_2809966:481-nf] ?' that, even from fathers they may learn shame, from whom they assumed this proposition[fn-70-P7068_2810151:482-nf] about birth, and from whom they hoped to gain knowledge in point. For they will reply to them, `What we beget, is like, not our good pleasure[fn-70-P7069_2810318:483-nf] , but like ourselves; nor become we parents by previous counsel, but to beget is proper to our nature; since we too are images of our fathers.' Either then let them condemn themselves[fn-70-P7070_2810520:484-nf] , and cease asking women about the Son of God, or let them learn from them, that the Son is begotten not by will, but in nature and truth.

We, as men, are sinful, He is sinless; we, as men, inherit from Adam both death and delinquency, He received from the Virgin mortal flesh, but no iniquity. In fine, neither because we wish it are we born, nor as long as we wish it do we live, nor in the way that we wish it do we die: but He, before He was born, chose of whom He should be born; at His birth He brought about the adoration of the Magi; He grew as an infant, and showed Himself God by His miracles, and surpassed man in His weakness. Lastly, He chose also the manner of His death, that is, to be hung on the cross, and to fasten the cross itself on the foreheads of believers, so that the Christian may say, \"God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-18-P1841_1157662:20-nf] On the very cross, when He pleased, He made His body be taken down, and departed; in the very sepulchre, as long as it pleased Him, He lay; and, when He pleased, He arose as from a bed. So, then, brethren, in respect to His very form as a servant (for who can speak of that other form as it ought to be spoken of, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"?)-in respect, I say, to His very form as a servant, the difference is great between the glory of Christ and the glory of other men. Of that glory He spoke, when the devil-possessed heard Him say, \"I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.\"","title":"Tractate XLIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":45,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_62_tractate_lvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1. I Have not been unmindful of my debt, and acknowledge that the time of payment has now come. May He give me wherewith to pay, as He gave me cause to incur the debt. For He has given me the love, of which it is said, \"Owe no man anything, but to love one another.\"[fn-24-P2428_1460692:1-nf] May He give also the word, which I feel myself owing to those I love. I put off your expectations till now for this reason, that I might explain as I could how it is we come to Christ along the ground, When we are commanded rather to seek the things which are above, not the things which are upon the earth.[fn-24-P2429_1461017:2-nf] For Christ is sitting above, at the right hand of the Father: but He is assuredly here also; and for that reason said also to Saul, as he was raging on the earth, \"Why persecutest thou me?\"[fn-24-P2430_1461226:3-nf] But the topic on which we were speaking, and which led to our entering on this inquiry, was our Lord's washing His disciples' feet, after the disciples themselves had already been washed, and needed not, save to wash their feet. And we there saw it to be understood that a man is indeed wholly washed in baptism; but while thereafter he liveth in this present world, and with the feet of his human passions treadeth on this earth, that is, in his life-intercourse with others, he contracts enough to call forth the prayer, \"Forgive us our debts.\"[fn-24-P2431_1461788:4-nf] And thus from these also is he cleansed by Him who washed His disciples' feet,[fn-24-P2432_1461884:5-nf] and ceaseth not to make intercession for us.[fn-24-P2433_1461947:6-nf] And here occurred the words of the Church in the Song of Songs, when she saith, \"I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?\" when she wished to go and open to that Being, fairer in form than the sons of men,[fn-24-P2434_1462178:7-nf] who had come to her and knocked, and asked her to open to Him. This gave rise to a question, which we were unwilling to compress into the narrow limits of the time, and therefore deferred till now, in what sense the Church, when on her way to Christ, may be afraid of defiling her feet, which she had washed in the baptism of Christ.","title":"Tractate LVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":45,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_57_homily_xiii","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"ANF-08","text":"\"The chaste woman is adored with the Son of God as with a bridegroom.

But if the baptism of heretics can have the regeneration of the second birth, those who are baptized among them must be counted not heretics, but children of God. For the second birth, which occurs in baptism, begets sons of God. But if the spouse of Christ is one, which is the Catholic Church, it is she herself who alone bears sons of God. For there are not many spouses of Christ, since the apostle says, \"I have espoused you, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ; \"[fn-64-P6425_2064936:21-nf] and, \"Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, for the King hath greatly desired thy beauty; \"[fn-64-P6426_2065097:22-nf] and, \"Come with me, my spouse, from Lebanon; thou shalt come, and shalt pass over from the source of thy faith; \"[fn-64-P6427_2065229:23-nf] and, \"I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse.\"[fn-64-P6428_2065302:24-nf] We see that one person is everywhere set forward, because also the spouse is one. But the synagogue of heretics is not one with us, because the spouse is not an adulteress and a harlot. Whence also she cannot bear children of God; unless, as appears to Stephen, heresy indeed brings them forth and exposes them, while the Church takes them up when exposed, and nourishes those for her own whom she has not born, although she cannot be the mother of strange children. And therefore Christ our Lord, setting forth that His spouse is one, and declaring the sacrament of His unity, says, \"He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.\"[fn-64-P6429_2065989:25-nf] For if Christ is with us, but the heretics are not with us, certainly the heretics are in opposition to Christ; and if we gather with Christ, but the heretics do not gather with us, doubtless they scatter.","title":"Epistle LXXIV.","author":"Cyprian"}]
