{"verses":["A psalm of praise.","Sing joyfully to God, all the earth:  serve ye the Lord with\ngladness.  Come in before his presence with exceeding great joy.","Know ye that the Lord he is God:  he made us, and not we\nourselves.  We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.","Go ye into his gates with praise, into his courts with hymns:  and\ngive glory to him.  Praise ye his name:","For the Lord is sweet, his mercy endureth for ever, and his truth\nto generation and generation."]}
