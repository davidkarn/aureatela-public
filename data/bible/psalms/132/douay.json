{"verses":["A gradual canticle of David.  Behold how good and how pleasant it\nis for brethren to dwell together in unity:","Like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down upon the\nbeard, the beard of Aaron, Which ran down to the skirt of his garment:","As the dew of Hermon, which descendeth upon mount Sion.  For\nthere the Lord hath commanded blessing, and life for evermore."]}
