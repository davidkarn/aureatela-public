Because that deceiver then,-who was a mediator to death for man, and feignedly puts himself forward as to life, under the name of cleansing by sacrilegious rites and sacrifices, by which the proud are led away, -can neither share in our death, nor rise again from his own: he has indeed been able to apply his single death to our double one; but he certainly has not been able to apply a single resurrection, which should be at once a mystery of our renewal, and a type of that waking up which is to be in the end. He then who being alive in the spirit raised again His own flesh that was dead, the true Mediator of life, has cast out him, who is dead in the spirit and the mediator of death, from the spirits of those who believe in Himself, so that he should not reign within, But should assault from without, and yet not prevail. And to him, too, He offered Himself to be tempted, in order that He might be also a mediator to overcome his temptations, not only by succor, but also by example. But when the devil, from the first, although striving through every entrance to creep into His inward parts, was thrust out, having finished all his alluring temptation in the wilderness after the baptism;[fn-9-P923_353883:75-nf] because, being dead in the spirit, he forced no entrance into Him who was alive in the spirit, he betook himself, through eagerness for the death of man in any way whatsoever, to effecting that deathwhich he could, and was permitted to effect it upon that mortal element which the living Mediator had received from us. And where he could do anything, there in every respect he was conquered; and wherein he received outwardly the power of slaying the Lord in the flesh, therein his inward power, by which he held ourselves, was slain. For it was brought to pass that the bonds of many sins in many deaths were loosed, through the one death of One which no sin had preceded. Which death, though not due, the Lord therefore rendered for us, that the death which was due might work us no hurt. For He was not stripped of the flesh by obligation of any authority, but He stripped Himself. For doubtless He who was able not to die, if He would not, did die because He would: and so He made a show of principalities and powers, openly triumphing over them in Himself.[fn-9-P924_354965:76-nf] For whereas by His death the one and most real sacrifice was offered up for us, whatever fault there was, whence principalities and powers held us fast as of right to pay its penalty, He cleansed, abolished, extinguished; and by His own resurrection He also called us whom He predestinated to a new life; and whom He called, them He justified; and whom He justified, them He glorified.[fn-9-P925_355369:77-nf] And so the devil, in that very death of the flesh, lost man, whom he was possessing as by an absolute right, seduced as he was by his own consent, and over whom he ruled, himself impeded by no corruption of flesh and blood, through that frailty of man's mortal body, whence he was both too poor and too weak; he who was proud in proportion as he was, as it were, both richer and stronger, ruling over him who was, as it were, both clothed in rags and full of troubles. For whither he drove the sinner to fall, himself not following, there by following he compelled the Redeemer to descend. And so the Son of God deigned to become our friend in the fellowship of death, to which because he came not, the enemy thought himself to be better and greater than ourselves. For our Redeemer says, \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"[fn-9-P926_356262:78-nf] Wherefore also the devil thought himself superior to the Lord Himself, inasmuch as the Lord in His sufferings yielded to him; for of Him, too, is understood what is read in the Psalm, \"For Thou hast made Him a little lower than the angels:\"[fn-9-P927_356521:79-nf] so that He, being Himself put to death, although innocent, by the unjust one acting against us as it were by just right, might by a most just right overcome him, and so might lead captive the captivity wrought through sin,[fn-9-P928_356762:80-nf] and free us from a captivity that was just on account of sin, by blotting out the handwriting, and redeeming us who were to be justified although sinners, through His own righteous blood unrighteously poured out.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_05_on_the_life_of_st_martin_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Nearly about the same time, Martin was called upon to undertake the episcopate of the church at Tours ;[fn-2-P216_39767:20-nf] but when he could not easily be drawn forth from his monastery, a certain Ruricius, one of the citizens, pretending that his wife was ill, and casting himself down at his knees, prevailed on him to go forth. Multitudes of the citizens having previously been posted by the road on which he traveled, he is thus under a kind of guard escorted to the city.

A few persons, however, and among these some of the bishops, who had been summoned to appoint a chief priest, were impiously offering resistance, asserting forsooth that Martin's person was contemptible, that he was unworthy of the episcopate, that he was a man despicable in countenance, that his clothing was mean, and his hair disgusting. This madness of theirs was ridiculed by the people of Sounder judgment, inasmuch as such objectors only proclaimed the illustrious character of the man, while they sought to slander him.

At length we have arrived at the question of food, and are confronted by our third difficulty. \"All things were created to serve for the use of mortal men.' And as man, a rational animal, in a sense the owner and tenant of the world, is subject to God, and worships his Creator, so all things living were created either for the food of men, or for clothing, or for tilling the earth, or conveying the fruits thereof, or to be the companions of man, and hence, because they are man's[fn-66-P6659_2087831:67-nf] helpers, they have their name jumenta.[fn-66-P6660_2087952:68-nf] `What is man,' says David, `that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him but little lower than the angels, and crownest him with glory and honour. Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thine hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field: the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.' Granted, he says, that the ox was created for ploughing, the horse for riding, the dog for watching, goats for their milk, sheep for their fleeces. What is the use of swine if we may not eat their flesh? of roes, stags, fallow-deer, boars, hares, and such like game? of geese, wild and tame? of wild ducks and[fn-66-P6661_2088738:69-nf] fig-peckers? of woodcocks? of coots? of thrushes? Why do hens run about our houses? If they are not eaten, all these creatures were created by God for nothing. But what need is there of argument when Scripture clearly teaches that every moving creature, like herbs and vegetables, were given to us for food, and the Apostle cries aloud[fn-66-P6662_2089103:70-nf] `All things are clean to the clean, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving,' and[fn-66-P6663_2089247:71-nf] tells us that men will come in the last days, forbidding to marry, and to eat meats, which God created for use? The Lord himself was called by the Pharisees a wine-bibber and a glutton, the friend of publicans and sinners, because he did not decline the invitation of Zacchaeus to dinner, and went to the marriage-feast. But it is a different matter if, as you may foolishly contend, he went to the dinner intending to fast, and after the manner of deceivers said, I eat this, not that; I do not drink the wine which I created out of water. He did not make water, but wine, the type of his blood. After the resurrection he ate a fish and part of a honey-comb, not sesame nuts and service-berries. The apostle, Peter, did not wait like a Jew for the stars to peep, but went upon the house-top to dine at the sixth hour. Paul in the ship broke bread, not dried figs. When Timothy's stomach was out of order, he advised him to drink wine, not perry.

To whom is it applied? The Creator, honouring man in his having been made in His own image, `hath placed' the brute creation `in subjection under his feet;' as great David relating this favour (of God) exclaimed in the Psalms[fn-6-P638_263270:52-nf] : \"He put all things,\" he says, \"under his feet,\" and he mentions by name the creatures so subjected. There is still another meaning of `subjection' in Scripture. Ascribing to God Himself the cause of his success in war, the Psalmist says[fn-6-P639_263531:53-nf] , \"He hath put peoples and nations in subjection under our feet,\" and \"He that putteth peoples in subjection under me.\" This word is often found tires in Scripture, indicating a victory. As for the future subjection of all men to the Only-begotten, and through Him to the Father, in the passage where the Apostle with a profound wisdom speaks of the Mediator between God and man as subject to the Father, implying by that subjection of the Son who shares humanity the actual subjugation of mankind-we will not discuss it now, for it requires a full and thorough examination. But to take only the plain and unambiguous meaning of the word subjection, how can he declare the being of the Spirit to be subject to that of the Son and the Father? As the Son is subject to the Father, according to the thought of the Apostle? But in this view the Spirit is to be ranked with the Son, not below Him, seeing that both Persons are of this lower rank. This was not his meaning? How then? In the way the brute creation is subject to the rational, as in the Psalm? There is then as great a difference as is implied in the subjection of the brute creation, when compared to man. Perhaps he will reject this explanation as well. Then he will have to come to the only remaining one, that the Spirit, at first in the rebellious ranks, was afterwards forced by a superior Force to bend to a Conqueror.","title":"Book I","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":8,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Let us however resume Eunomius' statement in its entirety. \"Having come into being from the only God through the Only-begotten, this Spirit also-\" What proof is there of the statement that \"this Spirit also\" is one of the things that were made by the Only-begotten?

They do this in order to prepare the way of introducing the intellect-and the mind also-at a subsequent time of life, even at the time when intelligence appears in a man. They maintain that the stage of infancy is supported by the soul alone, simply to promote vitality, without any intention of acquiring knowledge also, because not all things have knowledge which possess life. Trees, for instance, to quote Aristotle's example,[fn-27-P2772_936587:147-nf] have vitality, but have not knowledge; and with him agrees every one who gives a share to all animated beings of the animal substance, which, according to our view, exists in man alone as his special property,-not because it is the work of God, which all other creatures are likewise, but because it is the breath of God, which this (human soul) alone is, which we say is born with the full equipment of its proper faculties. Well, let them meet us with the example of the trees: we will accept their challenge, (nor shah we find in it any detriment to our own argument; ) for it is an undoubted fact, that whilst trees are yet but twigs and sprouts, and before they even reach the sapling stage, there is in them their own proper faculty of life, as soon as they spring out of their native beds. But then, as time goes on, the vigour of the tree slowly advances, as it grows and hardens into its woody trunk, until its mature age completes the condition which nature destines for it. Else what resources would trees possess in due course for the inoculation of grafts, and the formation of leaves, and the swelling of their buds, and the graceful shedding of their blossom, and the softening of their sap, were there not in them the quiet growth of the full provision of their nature, and the distribution of this life over all their branches for the accomplishment of their maturity? Trees, therefore, have ability or knowledge; and they derive it from whence they also derive vitality-that is, from the one source of vitality and knowledge which is peculiar to their nature, and that from the infancy which they, too, begin with. For I observe that even the vine, although yet tender and immature, still understands its own natural business, and strives to cling to some support, that, leaning on it, and lacing through it,[fn-27-P2773_938446:148-nf] it may so attain its growth. Indeed, without waiting for the husbandman's training, without an espalier, without a prop, whatever its tendrils catch, it will fondly cling to,[fn-27-P2774_938646:149-nf] and embrace with really greater tenacity and force by its own inclination than by your volition. It longs and hastens to be secure. Take also ivy-plants, never mind how young: I observe their attempts from the very first to grasp, objects above them, and outrunning everything else, to hang on to the highest thing, preferring as they do to spread over walls with their leafy web and woof rather than creep on the ground and be trodden under by every foot that likes to crush them. On the other hand, in the case of such trees as receive injury from contact with a building, how do they hang off as they grow and avoid what injures them! You can see that their branches were naturally meant to take the opposite direction, and can very well understand the vital instincts[fn-27-P2775_939433:150-nf] of such a tree from its avoidance of the wall. It is contented (if it be only a little shrub) with its own insignificant destiny, which it has in its foreseeing instinct thoroughly been aware of from its: infancy, only it still fears even a ruined building. On my side, then, why should I not contend for these wise and sagacious natures of trees? Let them have vitality, as the philosophers permit it; but let them have knowledge too, although the philosophers disavow it. Even the infancy of a log, then, may have an intellect (suitable to it): how much more may that of a human being, whose soul (which may be compared with the nascent sprout of a tree) has been derived from Adam as its root, and has been propagated amongst his posterity by means of woman, to whom it has been entrusted for transmission, and thus has sprouted into life with all its natural apparatus, both of intellect and of sense! I am much mistaken if the human person, even from his infancy, when he saluted life with his infant cries, does not testify to his actual possession of the faculties of sensation and intellect by the fact of his birth, vindicating at one and the same time the use of all his senses-that of seeing by the light, that of hearing by sounds, that of taste by liquids, that of smell by the air, that of touch by the ground. This earliest voice of infancy, then, is the first effort of the senses, and the initial impulse of mental perceptions.[fn-27-P2776_940936:151-nf] There is also the further fact, that some persons understand this plaintive cry of the infant to be an augury of affliction in the prospect of our tearful life, whereby from the very moment of birth (the soul) has to be regarded as endued with prescience, much more with intelligence. Accordingly by this intuition[fn-27-P2777_941272:152-nf] the babe knows his mother, discerns the nurse, and even recognises the waiting-maid; refusing the breast of another woman, and the cradle that is not his own, and longing only for the arms to which he is accustomed. Now from what source does he acquire this discernment of novelty and custom, if not from instinctive knowledge? Holy does it happen that he is irritated and quieted, if not by help of his initial intellect? It would be very strange indeed that infancy were naturally so lively, if it had not mental power; and naturally so capable of impression and affection, if it had no intellect. But (we hold the contrary): for Christ, by \"accepting praise out of the mouth of babes and sucklings,\"[fn-27-P2778_942028:153-nf] has declared that neither childhood nor infancy is without sensibility,[fn-27-P2779_942135:154-nf] -the former of which states, when meeting Him with approving shouts, proved its ability to offer Him testimony;[fn-27-P2780_942263:155-nf] while the other, by being slaughtered, for His sake of course, knew what violence meant.[fn-27-P2781_942374:156-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"105","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Nor must we fail to notice those writers who deprive the soul of the intellect even for a short period of time. They do this in order to prepare the way of introducing the intellect-and the mind also-at a subsequent time of life, even at the time when intelligence appears in a man. They maintain that the stage of infancy is supported by the soul alone, simply to promote vitality, without any intention of acquiring knowledge also, because not all things have knowledge which possess life. Trees, for instance, to quote Aristotle's example,[fn-27-P2772_936587:147-nf] have vitality, but have not knowledge; and with him agrees every one who gives a share to all animated beings of the animal substance, which, according to our view, exists in man alone as his special property,-not because it is the work of God, which all other creatures are likewise, but because it is the breath of God, which this (human soul) alone is, which we say is born with the full equipment of its proper faculties. Well, let them meet us with the example of the trees: we will accept their challenge, (nor shah we find in it any detriment to our own argument; ) for it is an undoubted fact, that whilst trees are yet but twigs and sprouts, and before they even reach the sapling stage, there is in them their own proper faculty of life, as soon as they spring out of their native beds. But then, as time goes on, the vigour of the tree slowly advances, as it grows and hardens into its woody trunk, until its mature age completes the condition which nature destines for it. Else what resources would trees possess in due course for the inoculation of grafts, and the formation of leaves, and the swelling of their buds, and the graceful shedding of their blossom, and the softening of their sap, were there not in them the quiet growth of the full provision of their nature, and the distribution of this life over all their branches for the accomplishment of their maturity? Trees, therefore, have ability or knowledge; and they derive it from whence they also derive vitality-that is, from the one source of vitality and knowledge which is peculiar to their nature, and that from the infancy which they, too, begin with. For I observe that even the vine, although yet tender and immature, still understands its own natural business, and strives to cling to some support, that, leaning on it, and lacing through it,[fn-27-P2773_938446:148-nf] it may so attain its growth. Indeed, without waiting for the husbandman's training, without an espalier, without a prop, whatever its tendrils catch, it will fondly cling to,[fn-27-P2774_938646:149-nf] and embrace with really greater tenacity and force by its own inclination than by your volition. It longs and hastens to be secure. Take also ivy-plants, never mind how young: I observe their attempts from the very first to grasp, objects above them, and outrunning everything else, to hang on to the highest thing, preferring as they do to spread over walls with their leafy web and woof rather than creep on the ground and be trodden under by every foot that likes to crush them. On the other hand, in the case of such trees as receive injury from contact with a building, how do they hang off as they grow and avoid what injures them! You can see that their branches were naturally meant to take the opposite direction, and can very well understand the vital instincts[fn-27-P2775_939433:150-nf] of such a tree from its avoidance of the wall. It is contented (if it be only a little shrub) with its own insignificant destiny, which it has in its foreseeing instinct thoroughly been aware of from its: infancy, only it still fears even a ruined building. On my side, then, why should I not contend for these wise and sagacious natures of trees? Let them have vitality, as the philosophers permit it; but let them have knowledge too, although the philosophers disavow it. Even the infancy of a log, then, may have an intellect (suitable to it): how much more may that of a human being, whose soul (which may be compared with the nascent sprout of a tree) has been derived from Adam as its root, and has been propagated amongst his posterity by means of woman, to whom it has been entrusted for transmission, and thus has sprouted into life with all its natural apparatus, both of intellect and of sense!

If I were arguing with heathens, I should dwell more at length on this point; although with heretics too the discussion does not stand on very different grounds. Inasmuch as ye yourselves have now come to the belief that God moved about[fn-47-P4710_1501759:357-nf] in the form and all other circumstances of man's nature,[fn-47-P4711_1501835:358-nf] you will of course no longer require to be convinced that God conformed Himself to humanity, but feel yourselves bound by your own faith. For if the God (in whom ye believe, ) even from His higher condition, prostrated the supreme dignity of His majesty to such a lowliness as to undergo death, even the death of the cross, why can you not suppose that some humiliations[fn-47-P4712_1502226:359-nf] are becoming to our God also, only more tolerable than Jewish contumelies, and crosses,[fn-47-P4713_1502335:360-nf] and sepulchres? Are these the humiliations which henceforth are to raise a prejudice against Christ (the subject as He is of human passions[fn-47-P4714_1502493:361-nf] ) being a partaker of that Godhead[fn-47-P4715_1502581:362-nf] against which you make the participation in human qualities a reproach? Now we believe that Christ did ever act in the name of God the Father; that He actually[fn-47-P4716_1502758:363-nf] from the beginning held intercourse with (men); actually[fn-47-P4717_1502829:364-nf] communed with[fn-47-P4718_1502857:365-nf] patriarchs and prophets; was the Son of the Creator; was His Word; whom God made His Son[fn-47-P4719_1502965:366-nf] by emitting Him from His own self,[fn-47-P4720_1503245:367-nf] and thenceforth set Him over every dispensation and (administration of) His will,[fn-47-P4721_1503360:368-nf] making Him a little lower than the angels, as is written in David.[fn-47-P4722_1503445:369-nf] In which lowering of His condition He received from the Father a dispensation in those very respects which you blame as human; from the very beginning learning,[fn-47-P4723_1503626:370-nf] even then, (that state of a) man which He was destined in the end to become.[fn-47-P4724_1503751:371-nf] It is He who descends, He who interrogates, He who demands, He who swears. With regard, however, to the Father, the very gospel which is common to us will testify that He was never visible, according to the word of Christ: \"No man knoweth the Father, save the Son.\"[fn-47-P4725_1505662:372-nf] For even in the Old Testament He had declared, \"No man shall see me, and live.\"[fn-47-P4726_1505763:373-nf] He means that the Father is invisible, in whose authority and in whose name was He God who appeared as the Son of God. But with us[fn-47-P4727_1505917:374-nf] Christ is received in the person of Christ, because even in this manner is He our God. Whatever attributes therefore you require as worthy of God, must be found in the Father, who is invisible and unapproachable, and placid, and (so to speak) the God of the philosophers; whereas those qualities which you censure as unworthy must be supposed to be in the Son, who has been seen, and heard, and encountered, the Witness and Servant of the Father, uniting in Himself man and God, God in mighty deeds, in weak ones man, in order that He may give to man as much as He takes from God. What in your esteem is the entire disgrace of my God, Is in fact the sacrament of man's salvation God held converse with man, that man might learn to act as God. God dealt on equal terms[fn-47-P4728_1506823:375-nf] with man, that man might be able to deal on equal terms with God. God was found little, that man might become very great. You who disdain such a God, I hardly know whether you ex fide believe that God was crucified. How great, then, is your perversity in respect of the two characters of the Creator! You designate Him as Judge, and reprobate as Cruelty that severity of the Judge which only acts in accord with the merits of cases. You require God to be very good, and yet despise as meanness that gentleness of His which accorded with His kindness, (and) held lowly converse in proportion to the mediocrity of man's estate. He pleases you not, whether great or little, neither as your judge nor as your friend! What if the same features should be discovered in your God? That He too is a judge, we have already shown in the proper section:[fn-47-P4729_1507689:376-nf] that from being a judge He must needs be severe; and from being severe He must also be cruel, if indeed cruel.[fn-47-P4730_1507853:377-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Our heretic will now have the fullest opportunity of learning the clue[fn-48-P4875_1543072:89-nf] of his errors along with the Jew himself, from whom he has borrowed his guidance in this discussion.

Accordingly, to this day they deny that their Christ has come, because He has not appeared in majesty, while they ignore the fact that He was to come also in lowliness.","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_11_homily_iii_on_the_firmament_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"8. \"And God called the firmament heaven.\"[fn-21-P2179_650803:45-nf] The nature of right belongs to another, and the firmament only shares it on account of its resemblance to heaven.

Who would have given such a commandment as this, but He who feeds the ravens and clothes[fn-60-P6074_1825696:776-nf] the flowers of the field? Who anciently enjoined for the treading ox an unmuzzled mouth,[fn-60-P6075_1825800:777-nf] that he might be at liberty to gather his fodder from his labour, on the principle that the worker is worthy of his hire?[fn-60-P6076_1825946:778-nf] Marcion may expunge such precepts, but no matter, provided the sense of them survives. But when He charges them to shake off the dust of their feet against such as should refuse to receive them, He also bids that this be done as a witness. Now no one bears witness except in a case which is decided by judicial process; and whoever orders inhuman conduct to be submitted to the trial by testimony,[fn-60-P6077_1826366:779-nf] does really threaten as a judge. Again, that it was no new god which recommended[fn-60-P6078_1826477:780-nf] by Christ, was dearly attested by the opinion of all men, because some maintained to Herod that Jesus was the Christ; others, that He was John; some, that He was Elias; and others, that He was one of the old prophetess.[fn-60-P6079_1826714:781-nf] Now, whosoever of all these He might have been, He certainly was not raised up for the purpose of announcing another god after His resurrection. He feeds the multitude in the desert place;[fn-60-P6080_1826925:782-nf] this, you must know[fn-60-P6081_1826968:783-nf] was after the manner of the Old Testament.[fn-60-P6082_1827028:784-nf] Or else,[fn-60-P6083_1827062:785-nf] if there was not the same grandeur, it follows that He is now inferior to the Creator. For He, not for one day, but during forty years, not on the inferior aliment of bread and fish, but with the manna of heaven, supported the lives[fn-60-P6084_1827307:786-nf] of not five thousand, but of six hundred thousand human beings. However, such was the greatness of His miracle, that He willed the slender supply of food, not only to be enough, but even to prove superabundant;[fn-60-P6085_1827537:787-nf] and herein He followed the ancient precedent. For in like manner, during the famine in Elijah's time, the scanty and final meal of the widow of Sarepta was multiplied[fn-60-P6086_1827722:788-nf] by the blessing of the prophet throughout the period of the famine. You have the third book of the Kings.[fn-60-P6087_1827850:789-nf] If you also turn to the fourth book, you will discover all this conduct[fn-60-P6088_1827949:790-nf] of Christ pursued by that man of God, who ordered ten[fn-60-P6089_1828019:791-nf] barley loaves which had been given him to be distributed among the people; and when his servitor, after contrasting the large number of the persons with the small supply of the food, answered, \"What, shall I set this before a hundred men? \"he said again, \"Give them, and they shall eat: for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof, according to the word of the Lord.\"[fn-60-P6090_1828600:792-nf] O Christ, even in Thy novelties Thou art old! Accordingly, when Peter, who had been an eye-witness of the miracle, and had compared it with the ancient precedents, and had discovered in them prophetic intimations of what should one day come to pass, answered (as the mouthpiece of them all) the Lord's inquiry, \"Whom say ye that I am? \"[fn-60-P6091_1828963:793-nf] in the words, \"Thou art the Christ,\" he could not but have perceived that He was that Christ, beside whom he knew of none else in the Scriptures, and whom he was now surveying[fn-60-P6092_1829159:794-nf] in His wonderful deeds. This conclusion He even Himself confirms by thus far bearing with it, nay, even enjoining silence respecting it.[fn-60-P6093_1829315:795-nf] For if Peter was unable to acknowledge Him to be any other than the Creator's Christ, while He commanded them \"to tell no man that saying,\" surely[fn-60-P6094_1829482:796-nf] He was unwilling to have the conclusion promulged which Peter had drawn. No doubt of that,[fn-60-P6095_1829588:797-nf] you say; but as Peter's conclusion was a wrong one, therefore He was unwilling to have a lie disseminated. It was, however, a different reason which He assigned for the silence, even because \"the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and scribes, and priests, and be slain, and be raised again the third day.\"[fn-60-P6096_1829940:798-nf] Now, inasmuch as these sufferings were actually foretold for the Creator's Christ (as we shall fully show in the proper place[fn-60-P6097_1830086:799-nf] ), so by this application of them to His own case[fn-60-P6098_1830172:800-nf] does He prove that it is He Himself of whom they were predicted. At all events, even if they had not been predicted, the reason which He alleged for imposing silence (on the disciples) was such as made it clear enough that Peter had made no mistake, that reason being the necessity of His undergoing these sufferings. \"Whosoever,\" says He, \"will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.\"[fn-60-P6099_1830638:801-nf] Surely[fn-61-P6100_1830665:802-nf] it is the Son of man[fn-61-P6101_1830700:803-nf] who uttered this sentence. Look carefully, then, along with the king of Babylon, into his burning fiery furnace, and there you will discover one \"like the Son of man\" (for He was not yet really Son of man, because not yet born of man), even as early as then[fn-61-P6102_1831007:804-nf] appointing issues such as these. He saved the lives of the three brethren,[fn-61-P6103_1831099:805-nf] who had agreed to lose them for God's sake; but He destroyed those of the Chaldµans, when they had preferred to save them by the means of their idolatry. Where is that novelty, which you pretend[fn-61-P6104_1831319:806-nf] in a doctrine which possesses these ancient proofs? But all the predictions have been fulfilled[fn-61-P6105_1831428:807-nf] concerning martyrdoms which were to happen, and were to receive the recompenses of their reward from God. \"See,\" says Isaiah, \"how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are taken away, and no man considereth.\"[fn-61-P6106_1831692:808-nf] When does this more frequently happen than in the persecution of His saints? This, indeed, is no ordinary matter,[fn-61-P6107_1831827:809-nf] no common casualty of the law of nature; but it is that illustrious devotion, that fighting for the faith, wherein whosoever loses his life for God saves it, so that you may here again recognize the Judge who recompenses the evil gain of life with its destruction, and the good loss thereof with its salvation. It is, however, a jealous God whom He here presents to me one who returns evil for evil. \"For whosoever,\" says He, \"shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.\"[fn-61-P6108_1832497:810-nf] Now to none but my Christ can be assigned the occasion[fn-61-P6109_1832572:811-nf] of such a shame as this. His whole course[fn-61-P6110_1832640:812-nf] was so exposed to shame as to open a way for even the taunts of heretics, declaiming[fn-61-P6111_1832738:813-nf] with all the bitterness in their power against the utter disgrace[fn-61-P6112_1832825:814-nf] of His birth and bringing-up, and the unworthiness of His very flesh.[fn-61-P6113_1832914:815-nf] But how can that Christ of yours be liable to a shame, which it is impossible for him to experience? Since he was never condensed[fn-61-P6114_1833511:816-nf] into human flesh in the womb of a woman, although a virgin; never grew from human seed, although only after the law of corporeal substance, from the fluids[fn-61-P6115_1833699:817-nf] of a woman; was never deemed flesh before shaped in the womb; never called f£tus[fn-61-P6116_1833806:818-nf] after such shaping; was never delivered from a ten months' writhing in the womb;[fn-61-P6117_1834077:819-nf] was never shed forth upon the ground, amidst the sudden pains of parturition, with the unclean issue which flows at such a time through the sewerage of the body, forthwith to inaugurate the light[fn-61-P6118_1834725:820-nf] of life with tears, and with that primal wound which severs the child from her who bears him;[fn-61-P6119_1834860:821-nf] never received the copious ablution, nor the meditation of salt and honey;[fn-61-P6120_1835064:822-nf] nor did he initiate a shroud with swaddling clothes;[fn-61-P6121_1835306:823-nf] nor afterwards did he ever wallow[fn-61-P6122_1835395:824-nf] in his own uncleanness, in his mother's lap; nibbling at her breast; long an infant; gradually[fn-61-P6123_1835524:825-nf] a boy; by slow degrees[fn-61-P6124_1835559:826-nf] a man.[fn-61-P6125_1835580:827-nf] But he was revealed[fn-61-P6126_1835618:828-nf] from heaven, full-grown at once, at once complete; immediately Christ; simply spirit, and power, and god. But as withal he was not true, because not visible; therefore he was no object to be ashamed of from the curse of the cross, the real endurance[fn-61-P6127_1835924:829-nf] of which he escaped, because wanting in bodily substance. Never, therefore, could he have said, \"Whosoever shall be ashamed of me.\" But as for our Christ, He could do no otherwise than make such a declaration;[fn-61-P6128_1836151:830-nf] \"made\" by the Father \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-61-P6129_1836234:831-nf] \"a worm and no man, a reproach of men, and despised of the people; \"[fn-61-P6130_1836323:832-nf] seeing that it was His will that \"with His stripes we should be healed,\"[fn-61-P6131_1836416:833-nf] that by His humiliation our salvation should be established. And justly did He humble Himself[fn-61-P6132_1836531:834-nf] for His own creature man, for the image and likeness of Himself, and not of another, in order that man, since he had not felt ashamed when bowing down to a stone or a stock, might with similar courage give satisfaction to God for the shamelessness of his idolatry, by displaying an equal degree of shamelessness in his faith, in not being ashamed of Christ. Now, Marcion, which of these courses is better suited to your Christ, in respect of a meritorious shame?[fn-61-P6133_1837014:835-nf] Plainly, you ought yourself to blush with shame for having given him a fictitious existence.[fn-61-P6134_1837138:836-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"63.

Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new rifle (of Laodicean),[fn-79-P7953_2264695:758-nf] as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the ancient prophets,[fn-80-P8003_2277951:808-nf] since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets.

Wherefore observe that these are the very things which the Lord wished to teach to the Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection of the flesh. For this was the opinion of the Sadducees. Whence it was that, having contrived the parable about the woman and the seven brethren, that they might cast doubt upon the resurrection of the flesh, \"There came to Him,\"[fn-57-P5799_1754282:30-nf] it is said, \"the Sadducees also, who say that there is no resurrection.\" Christ, then, if there had been no resurrection of the flesh, but the soul only were saved, would have agreed, with their opinion as a right and excellent one. But as it was, He answered and said, \"In the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven,\"[fn-58-P5800_1754675:31-nf] not on account of having no flesh, but of not marrying nor being married, but being henceforth incorruptible. And He speaks of our being near the angels in this respect, that as the angels in heaven, so we also in paradise, spend our time no more in marriage-feasts or other festivities. but in seeing God and cultivating life, under the direction of Christ. For He did not say \"they shall be angels,\" but like angels, in being, for instance, crowned, as it is written, with glory and honour; differing a little from the angels,[fn-58-P5801_1755225:32-nf] while near to being angels. Just as if He had said. while observing the fair order of the sky, and the stillness of the night, and everything illumined by the heavenly light of the moon, \"the moon shines like the sun.\" We should not then say that He asserted that the moon was absolutely the sun, but like the sun. As also that which is not gold, but approaching the nature of gold, is said not to be gold, but to be like gold. But if it were gold, it would be said to be, and not to be like, gold. But since it is not gold, but approaching to the nature of it, and has the appearance of it, it is said to be like gold; so also when He says that the saints shall. in the resurrection be like the angels, we do not understand Him to assert that they will then be actually angels, but approaching to the condition of angels. So that it is most unreasonable to say, \"Since Christ declared that the saints in the resurrection appear as angels, therefore their bodies do not rise,\" although the very words employed give a clear proof of the real state of the case. For the term \"resurrection\" is not applied to that which has not fallen, but to that which has fallen and rises again; as when the prophet says, \"I will also raise up again the tabernacle of David which has fallen down.\"[fn-58-P5802_1756524:33-nf] Now the much-desired tabernacle of the soul is fallen, and sunk down into \"the dust of the earth.\"[fn-58-P5803_1756641:34-nf] For it is not that which is not dead, but that which is dead, that is laid down. But it is the flesh which dies; the soul is immortal. So, then, if the soul be immortal, and the body be the corpse, those who say that there is a resurrection, but not of the flesh, deny any resurrection; because it is not that which remains standing, but that which has fallen[fn-58-P5804_1757019:35-nf] and been laid down, that is set up; according to that which is written, \"Does not he who fills rise again, and he who turns aside return? \"[fn-58-P5805_1757217:36-nf] ","title":"From the Discourse on the Resurrection.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":8,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_37_address_of_tatian_to_the_greeks_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"ANF-02","text":"But further, it becomes us now to seek for what we once had, but have lost, to unite the soul with the Holy Spirit, and to strive after union with God.

Man is not, as the croaking philosophers say, merely a rational animal, capable of understanding and knowledge; for, according to them, even irrational creatures appear possessed of understanding and knowledge. But man alone is the image and likeness of God; and I mean by man, not one who performs actions similar to those of animals, but one who has advanced far beyond mere humanity-to God Himself. This question we have discussed more minutely in the treatise concerning animals. But the principal point to be spoken of now is, what is intended by the image and likeness of God. That which cannot be compared is no other than abstract being; but that which is compared is no other than that which is like. The perfect God is without flesh; but man is flesh. The bond of the flesh is the soul;[fn-12-P1215_336246:45-nf] that which encloses the soul is the flesh. Such is the nature of man's constitution; and, if it be like a temple, God is pleased to dwell in it by the spirit, His representative; but, if it be not such a habitation, man excels the wild beasts in articulate language only,-in other respects his manner of life is like theirs, as one who is not a likeness of God.

On this account the nature of the demons has no place for repentance; for they are the reflection of matter and of wickedness.

Man's salvation was the motive, the restoration of that which had perished. Man had perished; his recovery had become necessary. No such cause, however, existed for Christ's taking on Him the nature of angels. For although there is assigned to angels also perdition in \"the fire prepared for the devil and his angels,\"[fn-94-P9483_2603487:201-nf] yet a restoration is never promised to them. No charge about the salvation of angels did Christ ever receive from the Father; and that which the Father neither promised nor commanded, Christ could not have undertaken. For what object, therefore, did He bear the angelic nature, if it were not (that He might have it) as a powerful helper[fn-94-P9484_2603847:202-nf] wherewithal to execute the salvation of man? The Son of God, in sooth, was not competent alone to deliver man, whom a solitary and single serpent had overthrown! There is, then, no longer but one God, but one Saviour, if there be two to contrive salvation, and one of them in need of the other. But was it His object indeed to deliver man by an angel? Why, then, come down to do that which He was about to expedite with an angel's help? If by an angel's aid, why come Himself also? If He meant to do all by Himself, why have an angel too? He has been, it is true, called \"the Angel of great counsel,\" that is, a messenger, by a term expressive of official function, not of nature. For He had to announce to the world the mighty purpose of the Father, even that which ordained the restoration of man. But He is not on this account to be regarded as an angel, as a Gabriel or a Michael. For the Lord of the Vineyard sends even His Son to the labourers require fruit, as well as His servants. Yet the Son will not therefore be counted as one of the servants because He undertook the office of a servant. I may, then, more easily say, if such an expression is to be hazarded,[fn-94-P9485_2605039:203-nf] that the Son is actually an angel, that is, a messenger, from the Father, than that there is an angel in the Son. Forasmuch, however, as it has been declared concerning the Son Himself, Thou hast made Him a little lower than the angels\"[fn-94-P9486_2605293:204-nf] how will it appear that He put on the nature of angels if He was made lower than the angels, having become man, with flesh and soul as the Son of man? As \"the Spirit[fn-94-P9487_2605479:205-nf] of God.\" however, and \"the Power of the Highest,\"[fn-94-P9488_2605633:206-nf] can He be regarded as lower than the angels,-He who is verily God, and the Son of God? Well, but as bearing human nature, He is so far made inferior to the angels; but as bearing angelic nature, He to the same degree loses that inferiority. This opinion will be very suitable for Ebion,[fn-94-P9489_2605939:207-nf] who holds Jesus to be a mere man, and nothing more than a descendant of David, and not also the Son of God; although He is, to be sure,[fn-94-P9490_2606091:208-nf] in one respect more glorious than the prophets, inasmuch as he declares that there was an angel in Him, just as there was in Zechariah.

Why, moreover, should it be born, not of corruptible [seed], but of incorruptible? Why, again, since His flesh has both risen and returned to heaven, is not ours, being like His, also taken up at once? Or else, why does not His flesh, since it is like ours, return in like manner to the ground, and suffer dissolution? Such objections even the heathen used constantly to bandy about.[fn-95-P9507_2609313:222-nf] Was the Son of God reduced to such a depth of degradation Again, if He rose again as a precedent for our hope, how is it that nothing like it has been thought desirable (to happen) to ourselves?[fn-95-P9508_2609551:223-nf] Such views are not improper for heathens and they are fit and natural for the heretics too. For, indeed, what difference is there between them, except it be that the heathen, in not believing, do believe; while the heretics, in believing, do not believe? Then, again, they read: \"Thou madest Him a little less than angels; \"[fn-95-P9509_2609971:224-nf] and they deny the lower nature of that Christ who declares Himself to be, \"not a man, but a worm; \"[fn-95-P9510_2610097:225-nf] who also had \"no form nor comeliness, but His form was ignoble, despised more than all men, a man in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of weakness.\"[fn-95-P9511_2610275:226-nf] Here they discover a human being mingled with a divine one and so they deny the manhood. They believe that He died, and maintain that a being which has died was born of an incorruptible substance;[fn-95-P9512_2610499:227-nf] as if, forsooth, corruptibility[fn-95-P9513_2610555:228-nf] were something else than death!

This heaven the Father willed to be His own throne; while He made the Son to be \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-107-P10761_3019593:315-nf] by sending Him down to the earth, but meaning at the same time to \"crown Him with glory and honour,\"[fn-107-P10762_3019714:316-nf] even by taking Him back to heaven. This He now made good to Him when He said: \"I have both glorified Thee, and will glorify Thee again.\" The Son offers His request from earth, the Father gives His promise from heaven. Why, then, do you make liars of both the Father and the Son? If either the Father spake from heaven to the Son when He Himself was the Son on earth, or the Son prayed to the Father when He was Himself the Son in heaven, how happens it that the Son made a request of His own very self, by asking it of the Father, since the Son was the Father? Or, on the other hand, how is it that the Father made a promise to Himself, by making it to the Son, since the Father was the Son? Were we even to maintain that they are two separate gods, as you are so fond of throwing out against us, it would be a more tolerable assertion than the maintenance of so versatile and changeful a God as yours! Therefore it was that in the passage before us the Lord declared to the people present: \"Not on my own account has this voice addressed me, but for your sakes,\"[fn-107-P10763_3020795:317-nf] that these likewise may believe both in the Father and in the Son, severally, in their own names and persons and positions. \"Then again, Jesus exclaims, and says, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me; \"[fn-107-P10764_3021052:318-nf] because it is through the Son that men believe in the Father, while the Father also is the authority whence springs belief in the Son. \"And he that seeth me, seeth Him that sent me.\"[fn-107-P10765_3021256:319-nf] How so? Even because, (as He afterwards declares, ) \"I have not spoken from myself, but the Father which sent me: He hath given me a commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.\"[fn-107-P10766_3021462:320-nf] For \"the Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know when I ought to speak\"[fn-107-P10767_3021584:321-nf] the word which I actually speak. \"Even as the Father hath said unto me, so do I speak.\"[fn-107-P10768_3021690:322-nf] Now, in what way these things were said to Him, the evangelist and beloved disciple John knew better than Praxeas; and therefore he adds concerning i his own meaning: \"Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God, and was going to God.\"[fn-107-P10769_3022035:323-nf] Praxeas, however, would have it that it was the Father who proceeded forth from Himself, and had returned to Himself; so that what the devil put into the heart of Judas was the betrayal, not of the Son, but of the Father Himself. But for the matter of that, things have not turned out well either for the devil or the heretic; because, even in the Son's case, the treason which the devil wrought against Him contributed nothing to his advantage. It was, then, the Son of God, who was in the Son of man, that was betrayed, as the Scripture says afterwards: \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.\"[fn-107-P10770_3022679:324-nf] Who is here meant by \"God? \"Certainly not the Father, but the Word of the Father, who was in the Son of man-that is in the flesh, in which Jesus had been already glorified by the divine power and word. \"And God,\" says He, \"shall also glorify Him in Himself; \"[fn-107-P10771_3022955:325-nf] that is to say, the Father shall glorify the Son, because He has Him within Himself; and even though prostrated to the earth, and put to death, He would soon glorify Him by His resurrection, and making Him conqueror over death.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_35_oration_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"23.

Now here again the true answer, whatever it may be, can be clear to those only who, like Paul, have been instructed in the mysteries of Paradise; but our answer is as follows. When the Sadducees once argued against the doctrine of the resurrection, and brought forward, to establish their own opinion, that woman of many marriages, who had been wife to seven brethren, and thereupon inquired whose wife she will be after the resurrection, our Lord answered their argument so as not only to instruct the Sadducees, but also to reveal to all that come after them the mystery of the resurrection-life: \"for in the resurrection,\" He says, \"they neither marry, nor are given in marriage neither can they die any more, for they are equal to the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection[fn-32-P3235_2132831:76-nf] .\" Now the resurrection promises us nothing else than the restoration of the fallen to their ancient state; for the grace we look for is a certain return to the first life, bringing back again to Paradise him who was cast out from it. If then the life of those restored is closely related to that of the angels, it is clear that the life before the transgression was a kind of angelic life, and hence also our return to the ancient condition of our life is compared to the angels. Yet while, as has been said, there is no marriage among them, the armies of the angels are in countless myriads; for so Daniel declared in his visions: so, in the same way, if there had not come upon us as the result of sin a change for the worse, and removal from equality with the angels, neither should we have needed marriage that we might multiply but whatever the mode of increase in the angelic nature is (unspeakable and inconceivable by human conjectures, except that it assuredly exists), it would have operated also in the case of men, who were \"made a little lower than the angels[fn-32-P3236_2133939:77-nf] ,\" to increase mankind to the measure determined by its Maker.","title":"On the Making of Man","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":8,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"ANF-04","text":"6. Having discussed these points regarding the nature of the world to the best of our ability, it does not seem out of place to inquire what is the meaning of the term world, which in holy Scripture is shown frequently to have different significations. For what we call in Latin mundus, is termed in Greek ko/smoj, and ko/smoj signifies not only a world, but also an ornament. Finally, in Isaiah, where the language of reproof is directed to the chief daughters of Sion, and where he says, \"Instead of an ornament of a golden head, thou wilt have baldness on account of thy works,\"[fn-65-P6506_1270290:20-nf] he employs the same term to denote ornament as to denote the world, viz., ko/smoj. For the plan of the world is said to be contained in the clothing of the high priest, as we find in the Wisdom of Solomon, where he says, \"For in the long garment was the whole world.\"[fn-65-P6507_1270745:21-nf] That earth of ours, with its inhabitants, is also termed the world, as when Scripture says, \"The whole world lieth in wickedness.\"[fn-65-P6508_1270936:22-nf] Clement indeed, a disciple of the apostles, makes mention of those whom the Greeks called 'Anti/xqonej, and other parts of the earth, to which no one of our people can approach, nor can any one of those who are there cross over to us, which he also termed worlds, saying, \"The ocean is impassable to men; and those are words which are on the other side of it, which are governed by these same arrangements of the ruling God.\"[fn-65-P6509_1271381:23-nf] That universe which is bounded by heaven and earth is also called a world, as Paul declares: \"For the fashion of this world will pass away.\"[fn-65-P6510_1271605:24-nf] Our Lord and Saviour also points out a certain other world besides this visible one, which it would indeed be difficult to describe and make known. He says, \"I am not of this world.\"[fn-65-P6511_1271809:25-nf] For, as if He were of a certain other world, He says, \"I am not of this world.\" Now, of this world we have said beforehand, that the explanation was difficult; and for this reason, that there might not be afforded to any an occasion of entertaining the supposition that we maintain the existence of certain images which the Greeks call \"ideas: \"for it is certainly alien to our (writers) to speak of an incorporeal world existing in the imagination alone, or in the fleeting. world of thoughts; and how they can assert either that the Saviour comes from thence, or that the saints will go thither, I do not see. There is no doubt, however, that something more illustrious and excellent than this present world is pointed out by the Saviour, at which He incites and encourages believers to aim. But whether that world to which He desires to allude be far separated and divided from this either by situation, or nature, or glory; or whether it be superior in glory and quality, but confined within the limits of this world (which seems to me more probable), is nevertheless uncertain, and in my opinion an unsuitable subject for human thought. But from what Clement seems to indicate when he says, \"The ocean is impassable to men, and those worlds which are behind it,\" speaking in the plural number of the worlds which are behind it, which he intimates are administered and governed by the same providence of the Most High God, he appears to throw out to us some germs of that view by which the whole universe of existing things, celestial and super-celestial, earthly and infernal, is generally called one perfect world, within which, or by which, other worlds, if any there are, must be supposed to be contained. For which reason he wished the globe of the sun or moon, and of the other bodies called planets, to be each termed worlds. Nay, even that pre-eminent globe itself which they call the non-wandering (a0planh=), they nevertheless desire to have properly called world. Finally, they summon the book of Baruch the prophet to bear witness to this assertion, because in it the seven worlds or heavens are more clearly pointed out. Nevertheless, above that sphere which they call non-wandering (a0planh=), they will have another sphere to exist, which they say, exactly as our heaven contains all things which are under it, comprehends by its immense size and indescribable extent the spaces of all the spheres together within its more magnificent circumference; so that all things are within it, as this earth of oursis under heaven. And this also is believed to be called in the holy Scriptures the good land, and the land of the living, having its own heaven, which is higher, and in which the names of the saints are said to be written, or to have been written, by the Saviour; by which heaven that earth is confined and shut in, which the Saviour in the Gospel promises to the meek and merciful. For they would have this earth of ours, which formerly was named \"Dry,\" to have derived its appellation from the name of that earth, as this heaven also was named firmament from the title of that heaven. But we have treated at greater length of such opinions in the place where we had to inquire into the meaning of the declaration, that in the beginning \"God made the heavens and the earth.\" For another heaven and another earth are shown to exist besides that \"firmanent\" which is said to have been made after the second day, or that \"dry land\" which was afterwards called \"earth.\" Certainly, what some say of this world, that it is corruptible because it was made, and yet is not corrupted, because the will of God, who made it and holds it together lest corruption should rule over it, is stronger and more powerful than corruption, may more correctly be supposed of that world which we have called above a \"non-wandering \"sphere, since by the will of God it is not at all subject to corruption, for the reason that it has not admired any causes of corruption, seeing it is the world of the saints and of the thoroughly purified, and not of the wicked, like that world of ours. We must see, moreover, lest perhaps it is with reference to this that the apostle says, \"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are unseen are eternal. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.\"[fn-65-P6512_1276338:26-nf] And when he says elsewhere, \"Because I shall see the heavens, the works of Thy fingers,\"[fn-65-P6513_1276452:27-nf] and when God said, regarding all things visible, by the mouth of His prophet, \"My hand has formed all these things,\"[fn-65-P6514_1276587:28-nf] He declares that that eternal house in the heavens which He promises to His saints was not made with hands, pointing out, doubtless, the difference of creation in things which are seen and in those which are not seen. For the same thing is not to be understood by the expressions, \"those things which are not seen,\" and \"those things which are invisible.\" For those things which are invisible are not only not seen, but do not even possess the property of visibility, being what the Greeks call a0sw/mata, i.e., incorporeal; whereas those of which Paul says, \"They are not seen,\" possess indeed the property of being seen, but, as he explains, are not yet beheld by those to whom they are promised.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":8,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_47_on_repentance_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But if they acted as men who had any part in God, and thereby in reason also, they would first weigh well the importance of repentance, and would never apply it in such a way as to make it a ground for convicting themselves of perverse self-amendment. In short, they would regulate the limit of their repentance, because they would reach (a limit) in sinning too-by fearing God, I mean. But where there is no fear, in like manner there is no amendment; where there is no amendment, repentance is of necessity vain, for it lacks the fruit for which God sowed it; that is, man's salvation. For God-after so many and so great sins of human temerity, begun by the first of the race, Adam, after the condemnation of man, together with the dowry of the world[fn-112-P11274_3193850:5-nf] after his ejection from paradise and subjection to death-when He had hasted back to His own mercy, did from that time onward inaugurate repentance in His own self, by rescinding the sentence of His first wrath, engaging to grant pardon to His own work and image.[fn-112-P11275_3194195:6-nf] And so He gathered together a people for Himself, and fostered them with many liberal distributions of His bounty, and, after so often finding them most ungrateful, ever exhorted them to repentance and sent out the voices of the universal company of the prophets to prophesy. By and by, promising freely the grace which in the last times He was intending to pour as a flood of light on the universal world[fn-112-P11276_3194615:7-nf] through His Spirit, He bade the baptism of repentance lead the way, with the view of first preparing,[fn-112-P11277_3194727:8-nf] by means of the sign and seal of repentance, them whom He was calling, through grace, to (inherit) the promise surely made to Abraham. John holds not his peace, saying, \"Enter upon repentance, for now shall salvation approach the nations\"[fn-112-P11278_3194981:9-nf] -the Lord, that is, bringing salvation according to God's promise. To Him John, as His harbinger, directed the repentance (which he preached), whose province was the purging of men's minds, that whatever defilement inveterate error had imparted, whatever contamination in the heart of man ignorance had engendered, that repentance should sweep and scrape away, and cast out of doors, and thus prepare the home of the heart, by making it clean, for the Holy Spirit, who was about to supervene, that He might with pleasure introduce Himself there-into, together with His celestial blessings. Of these blessings the title is briefly one the salvation of man-the abolition of former sins being the preliminary step. This[fn-112-P11279_3195751:10-nf] is the (final) cause of repentance, this her work, in taking in hand the business of divine mercy. What is profitable to man does service to God. The rule of repentance, however, which we learn when we know the Lord, retains a definite form,-viz., that no violent hands so to speak, be ever laid on good deeds or thoughts.[fn-112-P11280_3196102:11-nf] For God, never giving His sanction to the reprobation of good deeds, inasmuch as they are His own (of which, being the author, He must necessarily be the defender too), is in like manner the acceptor of them, and if the acceptor, likewise the rewarder. Let, then, the ingratitude of men see to it,[fn-112-P11281_3196434:12-nf] if it attaches repentance even to good works; let their gratitude see to it too, if the desire of earning it be the incentive to well-doing: earthly and mortal are they each. For how small is your gain if you do good to a grateful man! or your loss if to an ungrateful! A good deed has God as its debtor, just as an evil has too; for a judge is rewarder of every cause. Well, since, God as Judge presides over the exacting and maintaining[fn-112-P11282_3196887:13-nf] of justice, which to Him is most dear; and since it is with an eye to justice that He appoints all the sum of His discipline, is there room for doubting that, just as in all our acts universally, so also in the case of repentance, justice must be rendered to God?-which duty can indeed only be fulfilled on the condition that repentance be brought to bear only on sins. Further, no deed but an evil one deserves to be called sin, nor does any one err by well-doing. But if he does not err, why does he invade (the province of) repentance, the private ground of such as do err? Why does he impose on his goodness a duty proper to wickedness?

Blessed therefore are we who have been circumcised the second time with knives of stone. For your first circumcision was and is performed by iron instruments, for you remain hard-hearted; but our circumcision, which is the second, having been instituted after yours, circumcises us from idolatry and from absolutely every kind of wickedness by sharp stones, i.e., by the words [preached] by the apostles of the corner-stone cut out without hands.

What is this that has happened to me, O friends, and initiates, and fellow-lovers of the truth? I was running to lay hold on God, and thus I went up into the Mount, and drew aside the curtain of the Cloud, and entered away from matter and material things, and as far as I could I withdrew within myself. And then when I looked up, I scarce saw the back parts of God;[fn-42-P4244_1302199:13-nf] although I was sheltered by the Rock, the Word that was made flesh for us. And when I looked a little closer, I saw, not the First and unmingled Nature, known to Itself-to the Trinity, I mean; not That which abideth within the first[fn-42-P4245_1302455:14-nf] veil, and is hidden by the Cherubim; but only that Nature, which at last even reaches to us. And that is, as far as I can learn, the Majesty, or as holy David calls it, the Glory[fn-42-P4246_1302778:15-nf] which is manifested among the creatures, which It has produced and governs. For these are the Back Parts of God, which He leaves behind Him, as tokens of Himself[fn-42-P4247_1302958:16-nf] like the shadows and reflection of the sun in the water, which shew the sun to our weak eyes, because we cannot look at the sun himself, for by his unmixed light he is too strong for our power of perception. In this way then shalt thou discourse of God; even wert thou a Moses and a god to Pharaoh;[fn-42-P4248_1303414:17-nf] even wert thou caught up like Paul to the Third Heaven,[fn-42-P4249_1303488:18-nf] and hadst heard unspeakable words; even wert thou raised above them both, and exalted to Angelic or Archangelic place and dignity. For though a thing be all heavenly, or above heaven, and far higher in nature and nearer to God than we, yet it is farther distant from God, and from the complete comprehension of His Nature, than it is lifted above our complex and lowly and earthward sinking composition. IV. Therefore we must begin again thus. It is difficult to conceive God but to define Him in words is an impossibility, as one of the Greek teachers of Divinity[fn-42-P4250_1304073:19-nf] taught, not unskilfully, as it appears to me; with the intention that he might be thought to have apprehended Him; in that he says it is a hard thing to do; and yet may escape being convicted of ignorance because of the impossibility of giving expression to the apprehension, But in my opinion it is impossible to express Him, and yet more impossible to conceive Him. For that which may be conceived may perhaps be made clear by language, if not fairly well, at any rate imperfectly, to any one who is not quite deprived of his hearing, or slothful of understanding. But to comprehend the whole of so great a Subject as this is quite impossible and impracticable, not merely to the utterly careless and ignorant, but even to those who are highly exalted, and who love God, and in like manner to every created nature; seeing that the darkness of this world and the thick covering of the flesh is an obstacle to the full understanding of the truth. I do not know whether it is the same with the higher natures and purer Intelligences[fn-42-P4251_1305129:20-nf] which because of their nearness to God, and because they are illumined with all His Light, may possibly see, if not the whole, at any rate more perfectly and distinctly than we do; some perhaps more, some less than others, in proportion to their rank.","title":"Oration XXVIII.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":8,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_43_oration_xxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"V.

For that which has been conceived by God's rival, of course is not friendly to God's things. The discord of things is the same as the discord of their authors. Further, since God is best, the devil on the contrary worst, of beings, by their own very diversity they testify that neither works for[fn-122-P12245_3425434:38-nf] the other; so that anything of good can no more seem to be effected for us by the Evil One, than anything of evil by the Good. Therefore I detect the nativity of impatience in the devil himself, at that very time when he impatiently bore that the Lord God subjected the universal works which He had made to His own image, that is, to man.[fn-122-P12246_3425876:39-nf] For if he had endured (that), he would not have grieved; nor would he have envied man if he had not grieved. Accordingly he deceived him, because he had envied him; but he had envied because he had grieved: he had grieved because, of course, he had not patiently borne. What that angel of perdition[fn-122-P12247_3426199:40-nf] first was-malicious or impatient-I scorn to inquire: since manifest it is that either impatience took its rise together with malice, or else malice from impatience; that subsequently they conspired between themselves; and that they grew up indivisible in one paternal bosom. But, however, having been instructed, by his own experiment, what an aid unto sinning was that which he had been the first to feel, and by means of which he had entered on his course of delinquency, he called the same to his assistance for the thrusting of man into crime. The woman,[fn-122-P12248_3426916:41-nf] immediately on being met by him-I may say so without rashness-was, through his very speech with her, breathed on by a spirit infected with impatience: so certain is it that she would never have sinned at all, if she had honoured the divine edict by maintaining her patience to the end. What (of the fact) that she endured not to have been met alone; but in the presence of Adam, not yet her husband, not yet bound to lend her his ears,[fn-122-P12249_3427387:42-nf] she is impatient of keeping silence, and makes him the transmitter of that which she had imbibed from the Evil One? Therefore another human being, too, perishes through the impatience of the one; presently, too, perishes of himself, through his own impatience committed in each respect, both in regard of God's premonition and in regard of the devil's cheatery; not enduring to observe the former nor to refute the latter. Hence, whence (the origin) of delinquency, arose the first origin of judgment; hence, whence man was induced to offend, God began to be wroth. Whence (came)the first indignation in God, thence (came) His first patience; who, content at that time with malediction only, refrained in the devil's case from the instant infliction[fn-122-P12250_3428185:43-nf] of punishment. Else what crime, before this guilt of impatience, is imputed to man? Innocent he was, and in intimate friendship with God, and the husbandman[fn-122-P12251_3428355:44-nf] of paradise. But when once he succumbed to impatience, he quite ceased to be of sweet savour[fn-122-P12252_3428475:45-nf] to God; he quite ceased to be able to endure things celestial. Thenceforward, a creature[fn-122-P12253_3428605:46-nf] given to earth, and ejected from the sight of God, he begins to be easily turned by impatience unto every use offensive to God. For straightway that impatience conceived of the devil's seed, produced, in the fecundity of malice, anger as her son; and when brought forth, trained him in her own arts. For that very thing which had immersed Adam and Eve in death, taught their son, too, to begin with murder. It would be idle for me to ascribe this to impatience, if Cain, that first homicide and first fratricide, had borne with equanimity and not impatiently the refusal by the Lord of his own oblations-if he is not wroth with his own brother-if, finally, he took away no one's life. Since, then, he could neither have killed unless he had been wroth, nor have been wroth unless he had been impatient, he demonstrates that what he did through wrath must be referred to that by which wrath was suggested during this cradle-time of impatience, then (in a certain sense) in her infancy. But how great presently were her augmentations! And no wonder, If she has been the first delinquent, it is a consequence that, because she has been the first, therefore she is the only parent stem,[fn-122-P12254_3429799:47-nf] too, to every delinquency, pouring down from her own fount various veins of crimes.[fn-122-P12255_3430075:48-nf] Of murder we have spoken; but, being from the very beginning the outcome of anger,[fn-122-P12256_3430217:49-nf] whatever causes besides it shortly found for itself it lays collectively on the account of impatience, as to its own origin. For whether from private enmities, or for the sake of prey, any one perpetrates that wickedness,[fn-122-P12257_3430508:50-nf] the earlier step is his becoming impatient of[fn-122-P12258_3430572:51-nf] either the hatred or the avarice. Whatever compels a man, it is not possible that without impatience of itself it can be perfected in deed. Who ever committed adultery without impatience of lust? Moreover, if in females the sale of their modesty is forced by the price, of course it is by impatience of contemning gain[fn-122-P12259_3430921:52-nf] that this sale is regulated.[fn-122-P12260_3431003:53-nf] These (I mention) as the principal delinquencies in the sight of the Lord,[fn-122-P12261_3431147:54-nf] for, to speak compendiously, every sin is ascribable to impatience. \"Evil\" is \"impatience of good.\" None immodest is not impatient of modesty; dishonest of honesty; impious of piety;[fn-122-P12262_3431387:55-nf] unquiet of quietness. In order that each individual may become evil he will be unable to persevere[fn-122-P12263_3431523:56-nf] in being good. How, therefore, can such a hydra of delinquencies fail to offend the Lord, the Disapprover of evils? Is it not manifest that it was through impatience that Israel himself also always failed in his duty toward God, from that time when,[fn-122-P12264_3431794:57-nf] forgetful of the heavenly arm whereby he had been drawn out of his Egyptian affliction, he demands from Aaron \"gods[fn-122-P12265_3431972:58-nf] as his guides; \"when he pours down for an idol the contributions of his gold: for the so necessary delays of Moses, while he met with God, he had borne with impatience. After the edible rain of the manna, after the watery following[fn-122-P12266_3432242:59-nf] of the rock, they despair of the Lord in not enduring a three-days' thirst;[fn-122-P12267_3432421:60-nf] for this also is laid to their charge by the Lord as impatience. And-not to rove through individual cases-there was no instance in which it was not by failing in duty through impatience that they perished. How, moreover, did they lay hands on the prophets, except through impatience of hearing them? on the Lord moreover Himself, through impatience likewise of seeing Him?

The same is the case with self-restraint and licentiousness. To restrain one's self from doing good is the work of vice; but to keep from wrong is the beginning of salvation. So the Sabbath, by abstinence from evils, seems to indicate self-restraint. And what, I ask, is it in which man differs from beasts, and the angels of God, on the other hand, are wiser than he? \"Thou madest him a little lower than the angels.\"[fn-66-P6625_2016054:3-nf] For some do not interpret this Scripture of the Lord, although He also bore flesh, but of the perfect man and the gnostic, inferior in comparison with the angels in time, and by reason of the vesture [of the body].

For to live is common to the mortal nature, that is to man, with that to which has been vouchsafed immortality; as also the faculty of contemplation and of self-restraint, one of the two being more excellent.

He is like, it appears to me, the Centaur, a Thessalian figment, compounded of a rational and irrational part, of soul and body. Well, the body tills the ground, and hastes to it; but the soul is raised to God: trained in the true philosophy, it speeds to its kindred above, turning away from the lusts of the body, and besides these, from toil and fear, although we have shown that patience and fear belong to the good man. For if \"by the law is the knowledge of sin,\"[fn-66-P6629_2017872:7-nf] as those allege who disparage the law, and \"till the law sin was in the world; \"[fn-66-P6630_2017970:8-nf] yet \"without the law sin was dead,\"[fn-66-P6631_2018023:9-nf] we oppose them. For when you take away the cause of fear, sin, you have taken away fear; and much more, punishment, when you have taken away that which gives rise to lust. \"For the law is not made for the just man,\"[fn-66-P6632_2018257:10-nf] says the Scripture. Well, then, says Heraclitus, \"They would not have known the name of Justice if these things had not been.\" And Socrates says, \"that the law was not made for the sake of the good.\" But the cavillers did not know even this, as the apostle says, \"that he who loveth his brother worketh not evil; \"for this, \"Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal; and if there be any other commandment, it is comprehended in the word, Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-66-P6633_2018789:11-nf] So also is it said, \"Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-66-P6634_2018932:12-nf] And \"if he that loveth his neighbour worketh no evil,\" and if \"every commandment is comprehended in this, the loving our neighbour,\" the commandments, by menacing with fear, work love, not hatred. Wherefore the law is productive of the emotion of fear. \"So that the law is holy,\" and in truth \"spiritual,\"[fn-66-P6635_2019255:13-nf] according to the apostle. We must, then, as is fit, in investigating the nature of the body and the essence of the soul, apprehend the end of each, and not regard death as an evil. \"For when ye were the servants of sin,\" says the apostle, \"ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things in which ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now, being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"[fn-66-P6636_2019884:14-nf] The assertion, then, may be hazarded, that it has been shown that death is the fellowship of the soul in a state of sin with the body; and life the separation from sin. And many are the stakes and ditches of lust which impede us, and the pits of wrath and anger which must be overleaped, and all the machinations we must avoid of those who plot against us,-who would no longer see the knowledge of God \"through a glass.\"","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":8,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_48_sermon_xxxi_lxxxi_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1. The divine lessons, which we have just heard as they were being read, warn us to gather in a stock of virtues, to fortify a Christian heart, against the offences which were predicted to come, and this from the mercy of the Lord. \"For what is man,\" saith Scripture, \"saving that Thou art mindful of him? \"[fn-43-P4381_1859076:1-nf] \"Woe unto the world because of offences,\"[fn-43-P4382_1859134:2-nf] saith the Lord; the Truth says so; He alarmeth and warneth us, He would not have us to be off our guard; for surely He would not make us desperate. Against this \"woe,\" against this evil, that is, which is to be feared, and dreaded, and guarded against, Scripture counsels, and exhorts, and instructs us in that place, where it is said, \"Great praise have they who love Thy law, and nothing is an offence to them.\"[fn-43-P4383_1859567:3-nf] He hath shown us an enemy to be guarded against, but He hath not omitted to show us also a wall of defence. Thou wast thinking, as thou heardest, \"Woe unto the world because of offences,\" whither thou mightest go beyond the world, that thou mightest not be exposed to offences. Therefore to avoid offences, whither wilt thou go beyond the world, unless thou fly to Him who made the world? And how shall we be able to fly to Him who made the world, unless we give ear to His law which is preached everywhere? And to give ear to it is but a small matter, unless we love it. For divine Scripture in making thee secure against offences doth not say, \"Great peace have they who\" hear \"Thy law. For not the hearers of the law are just before God.[fn-43-P4384_1860326:4-nf] But\" because\" the doers of the law shall be justified,\" and, \"faith worketh by love: \"[fn-43-P4385_1860429:5-nf] it saith, \"Great peace have they who love Thy law, and nothing is an offence to them.\" To this sentiment also agrees the passage which we have chanted in course; \"But the meek shall inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.\"[fn-43-P4386_1860701:6-nf] Because, \"great peace have they who love Thy law.\" For these\" meek \"ones are they who \"love the law of God.\" For, \"Blessed is the man whom Thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of Thy law, that Thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the sinner.\"[fn-43-P4387_1861017:7-nf] How diverse seem those words of Scripture, yet into one meaning do they so flow and meet together, that whatsoever out of that most rich fountain thou canst hear, so that thou acquiesce therein, and art in loving harmony with the truth, thou will be at once filled with peace; glowing with love, and fortified against offences.","title":"Sermon XXXI.

For sometimes days, and things, and men, and times are de- noted in holy Scripture in no other fashion. As in this case where God declares that Israel shall serve the Egyptians for four hundred years, and says to Abraham: \"Know thou that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not theirs, and they shall bring them under bondage and afflict them four hundred years.\"[fn-74-P7422_2723383:43-nf] Whereas if you take into account the whole time after that God spoke, they are more than four hundred: but if you only reckon the time in which they were in slavery, they are less. And in giving this period indeed, unless you understand it in this way, we must think that the Word of God lied (and away with such a thought from Christian minds!). But since from the time of the Divine utterance, the whole period of their lives amounted to more than four hundred years, and their bondage endured for not nearly four hundred, you must understand that the part is to be taken for the whole, or the whole for the part. There is also a similar way of representing days and nights, where, when in the case of either division of time one day is meant, either period is shown by a portion of a single period. And indeed in this way the difficulty about the time of ourLord's Passion is cleared up: for whereas the Lord prophesied that after the model of the prophet Jonah, the Son of man would be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth,[fn-74-P7423_2724451:44-nf] and whereas after the sixth day of the week on which He was crucified, He was only in hell[fn-74-P7424_2724561:45-nf] for one day and two nights, how can we show the truth of the Divine words? Surely by the trope of Synecdoche, i.e., because to the day on which He was crucified the previous night belongs, and to the night on which He rose again, the coming day; and so when there is added the night which preceded the day belonging to it, and the day which followed the night belonging to it, we see thatthere is nothing lacking to the whole period of time, which is made up of its portions. Theholy Scriptures abound in such instances of ways of speaking: but it would take too longto relate them all. For so when the Psalm says, \"What is a man that Thou art mindfulof Him,\"[fn-74-P7425_2725239:46-nf] from the hart we understand thewhole, as while only one man is mentioned the whole human race is meant. So also where Ahab sinned we are told that the people sinned. Where - though all are mentioned, a part is to be understood from the whole. John also the Lord's forerunner says: \"After me cometh a man who is preferred before me for He was before me.\"[fn-74-P7426_2725613:47-nf] How then does He mean that He would come after Him, whom He shows to be before Him? For if this is understood of a man who was afterwards born, how was he before him? But if it is taken of the Word how is it, \"a man cometh after me?\" Except that in the one Lord Jesus Christ is shown both the posteriority of the manhood and the precedence of the Godhead. And so the result is that one and the same Lord was before him and came after him: for according to the flesh He was posterior in time to John; and according to His Deity was before all men. And so he, when he named that man, denoted both the manhood and the Word, for as the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God was complete in both manhood and Divinity[fn-74-P7427_2726332:48-nf] in mentioning one of these natures in Him hedenoted the whole person. And what need is there of anything further? I think that the day would fail me if I were to try to collect or to tell everything that could be said on this subject. And what we have already said is enough, at any rate on this part of the subject, both for the exposition of the Creed, and for the requirements of our case, and for the limits of our book.","title":"Book VI.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_77_sermon_lx_cx_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"2.

There is hope then, for the children, that is, even until the day of judgment come. Man ascribes much to himself. Yet what is man? A righteous man is something great. But yet a righteous man is righteous only by the grace of God. \"For what is man, save that thou art mindful of him?\"[fn-55-P5544_2350186:5-nf] Wouldest thou see what man is? \"All men are liars.\"[fn-55-P5545_2350254:6-nf] We have chanted, \"Arise, Lord; let not man prevail.\"[fn-55-P5546_2350324:7-nf] What is, \"let not man prevail\"? Were not the Apostles men? Were not Martyrs men? The Lord Jesus Himself, without ceasing to be God, vouchsafed to be Man. What then is, \"Arise, Lord; let not man prevail\"? If \"all men are liars; arise,\" Truth, \"let not\" falsehood \"prevail.\" If man then would be anything good, it must not be of anything of his own.

I am astonished at your requiring exactitude in Scripture, and arguing that there is something forced in the diction of the interpretation which gives the meaning of the original, but does not exactly render what is meant by the Hebrew word. Yet I must not carelessly pass by the question started by an enquiring mind. At the creation of the world, birds of the air and the fishes of the sea had the same origin;[fn-47-P4752_1475470:38-nf] for both kinds were produced from the water.[fn-47-P4753_1475533:39-nf] The reason is that both have the same characteristics. The latter swim in the water, the former in the air. They are therefore mentioned together. The form of expression is not used without distinction, but of all that lives in the water it is used very properly. The birds of the air and the fishes of the sea are subject to man; and not they alone, but all that passes through the paths of the sea. For every water-creature is not a fish, as for instance the sea monsters, whales, sharks, dolphins, seals, even sea-horses, sea-dogs, saw-fish, sword-fish, and sea-cows; and, if you like, sea nettles, cockles and all hard-shelled creatures of whom none are fish, and all pass through the paths of the sea; so that there are three kinds, birds of the air, fishes of the sea, and all water-creatures which are distinct from fish, and pass through the paths of the sea.","title":"Letter CLXXXVIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":8,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_26_letter_viii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"5. And again, \"My Father is greater than I.\"[fn-26-P2688_903728:34-nf] This passage is also employed by the ungrateful creatures, the brood of the evil one. I believe that even from this passage the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father is set forth. For I know that comparisons may properly be made between things which are of the same nature. We speak of angel as greater than angel, of man as juster than man, of bird as fleeter than bird. If then comparisons are made between things of the same species, and the Father by comparison is said to be greater than the Son, then the Son is of the same substance as the Father. But there is another sense underlying the expression. In what is it extraordinary that He who \"is the Word and was made flesh\"[fn-26-P2689_904436:35-nf] confesses His Father to be greater than Himself, when He was seen in glory inferior to the angels, and in form to men? For \"Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-26-P2690_904629:36-nf] and again \"Who was made a little lower thanthe angels,\"[fn-26-P2691_904703:37-nf] and \"we saw Him and He had neither form nor comeliness, his form was deficient beyond all men.\"[fn-26-P2692_904816:38-nf] All this He endured on account of His abundant loving kindness towards His work, that He might save the lost sheep and bring it home when He had saved it, and bring back safe and sound to his own land the man who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and so fell among thieves.[fn-26-P2693_905118:39-nf] Will the heretic cast in His teeth the manger out of which he in his unreasonableness was fed by the Word of reason? Will he, because the carpenter's son had no bed to lie on, complain of His being poor? This is why the Son is less than the Father; for your sakes He was made dead to free you from death and make you sharer in heavenly life.
