{"verses":["A gradual canticle.  Blessed are all they that fear the Lord:\nthat walk in his ways.","For thou shalt eat the labours of thy hands:  blessed art thou,\nand it shall be well with thee.","Thy wife as a fruitful vine, on the sides of thy house.  Thy\nchildren as olive plants, round about thy table.","Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.","May the Lord bless thee out of Sion:  and mayst thou see the good\nthings of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.","And mayst thou see thy children's children, peace upon Israel."]}
