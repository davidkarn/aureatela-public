{"verses":["Alleluia, of Aggeus and Zacharias.","Praise the Lord, O my soul, in my life I will praise the Lord:  I\nwill sing to my God as long as I shall be.  Put not your trust in\nprinces:","In the children of men, in whom there is no salvation.","His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return into his earth:\nin that day all their thoughts shall perish.","Blessed is he who hath the God of Jacob for his helper, whose\nhope is in the Lord his God:","Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in\nthem.","Who keepeth truth for ever:  who executeth judgment for them that\nsuffer wrong:  who giveth food to the hungry.  The Lord looseth them that\nare fettered:","The Lord enlighteneth the blind.  The Lord lifteth up them that\nare cast down:  the Lord loveth the just.","The Lord keepeth the strangers, he will support the fatherless\nand the widow:  and the ways of sinners he will destroy.","The Lord shall reign for ever:  thy God, O Sion, unto generation\nand generation."]}
