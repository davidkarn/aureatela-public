{"verses":["To the end, a psalm of David.  The canticle of Jeremias and\nEzechiel to the people of the captivity, when they began to go out.","A hymn, O God, becometh thee in Sion:  and a vow shall be paid to\nthee in Jerusalem.","O hear my prayer:  all flesh shall come to thee.","The words of the wicked have prevailed over us:  and thou wilt\npardon our transgressions.","Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken to thee:  he shall\ndwell in thy courts.  We shall be filled with the good things of thy\nhouse; holy is thy temple,","Wonderful in justice.  Hear us, O God our saviour, who art the\nhope of all the ends of the earth, and in the sea afar off.","Thou who preparest the mountains by thy strength, being girded\nwith power:","Who troublest the depth of the sea, the noise of its waves.  The\nGentiles shall be troubled,","And they that dwell in the uttermost borders shall be afraid at\nthy signs:  thou shalt make the outgoings of the morning and of the\nevening to be joyful.","Thou hast visited the earth, and hast plentifully watered it;\nthou hast many ways enriched it.  The river of God is filled with water,\nthou hast prepared their food:  for so is its preparation.","Fill up plentifully the streams thereof, multiply its fruits; it\nshall spring up and rejoice in its showers.","Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of thy goodness:  and thy\nfields shall be filled with plenty.","The beautiful places of the wilderness shall grow fat:  and the\nhills shall be girded about with joy,","The rams of the flock are clothed, and the vales shall abound\nwith corn:  they shall shout, yea they shall sing a hymn."]}
