{"verses":["A psalm of David while he was in the desert of Edom.","O God, my God, to thee do I watch at break of day.  For thee my\nsoul hath thirsted; for thee my flesh, O how many ways!","In a desert land, and where there is no way, and no water:  so in\nthe sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy power and thy glory.","For thy mercy is better than lives:  thee my lips will praise.","Thus will I bless thee all my life long:  and in thy name I will\nlift up my hands.","Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness:  and my mouth\nshall praise thee with joyful lips.","If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee in\nthe morning:","Because thou hast been my helper.  And I will rejoice under the\ncovert of thy wings:","My soul hath stuck close to thee:  thy right hand hath received\nme.","But they have fought my soul in vain, they shall go into the\nlower parts of the earth:","They shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall\nbe the portions of foxes.","But the king shall rejoice in God, all they shall be praised\nthat swear by him:  because the mouth is stopped of them that speak\nwicked things."]}
