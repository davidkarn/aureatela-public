In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear\nme speedily.","For my days are vanished like smoke, and my bones are grown dry\nlike fuel for the fire.","I am smitten as grass, and my heart is withered:  because I\nforgot to eat my bread.","Through the voice of my groaning, my bone hath cleaved to my\nflesh.","I am become like to a pelican of the wilderness:  I am like a\nnight raven in the house.","I have watched, and am become as a sparrow all alone on the\nhousetop.","All the day long my enemies reproached me:  and they that praised\nme did swear against me.","For I did eat ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with\nweeping.","Because of thy anger and indignation:  for having lifted me up\nthou hast thrown me down.","My days have declined like a shadow, and I am withered like\ngrass.","But thou, O Lord, endurest for ever:  and thy memorial to all\ngenerations.","Thou shalt arise and have mercy on Sion:  for it is time to have\nmercy on it, for the time is come.","For the stones thereof have pleased thy servants:  and they\nshall have pity on the earth thereof.","All the Gentiles shall fear thy name, O Lord, and all the kings\nof the earth thy glory.","For the Lord hath built up Sion:  and he shall be seen in his\nglory.","He hath had regard to the prayer of the humble:  and he hath not\ndespised their petition.","Let these things be written unto another generation:  and the\npeople that shall be created shall praise the Lord:","Because he hath looked forth from his high sanctuary:  from\nheaven the Lord hath looked upon the earth.","That he might hear the groans of them that are in fetters:  that\nhe might release the children of the slain:","That they may declare the name of the Lord in Sion:  and his\npraise in Jerusalem;","When the people assemble together, and kings, to serve the\nLord.","He answered him in the way of his strength:  Declare unto me the\nfewness of my days.","Call me not away in the midst of my days:  thy years are unto\ngeneration and generation.","In the beginning, O Lord, thou foundedst the earth:  and the\nheavens are the works of thy hands.","They shall perish but thou remainest:  and all of them shall\ngrow old like a garment:  And as a vesture thou shalt change them, and\nthey shall be changed.","But thou art always the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.","The children of thy servants shall continue and their seed\nshall be directed for ever."]}
