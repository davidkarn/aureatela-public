{"verses":["Unto the end.  A psalm for David.","In thy strength, O Lord, the king shall joy; and in thy salvation\nhe shall rejoice exceedingly.","Thou hast given him his heart's desire:  and hast not withholden\nfrom him the will of his lips.","For thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness:  thou\nhast set on his head a crown of precious stones.","He asked life of thee:  and thou hast given him length of days for\never and ever.","His glory is great in thy salvation:  glory and great beauty shalt\nthou lay upon him.","For thou shalt give him to be a blessing for ever and ever:  thou\nshalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance.","For the king hopeth in the Lord:  and through the mercy of the\nmost High he shall not be moved.","Let thy hand be found by all thy enemies:  let thy right hand find\nout all them that hate thee.","Thou shalt make them as an oven of fire, in the time of thy\nanger:  the Lord shall trouble them in his wrath, and fire shall devour\nthem.","Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth:  and their seed\nfrom among the children of men.","For they have intended evils against thee:  they have devised\ncounsels which they have not been able to establish.","For thou shalt make them turn their back:  in thy remnants thou\nshalt prepare their face.","Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy own strength:  we will sing and\npraise thy power."]}
