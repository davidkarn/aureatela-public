If all the members of my body were to be converted into tongues, and if each of my limbs were to be gifted with a human voice, I could still do no justice to the virtues of the holy and venerable Paula. Noble in family, she was nobler still in holiness; rich formerly in this world's goods, she is now more distinguished by the poverty that she has embraced for Christ. Of the stock of the Gracchi and descended from the Scipios, the heir and representative of that Paulus whose name she bore, the true and legitimate daughter of that Martia Papyria who was mother to Africanus, she yet preferred Bethlehem to Rome, and left her palace glittering with gold to dwell in a mud cabin. We do not grieve that we have lost this perfect woman; rather we thank God that we have had her, nay that we have her still. For \"all live unto\" God,[fn-38-P3845_1040663:2730-nf] and they who return unto the Lord are still to be reckoned members of his family. We have lost her, it is true, but the heavenly mansions have gained her; for as long as she was in the body she was absent from the Lord[fn-38-P3846_1040904:2731-nf] and would constantly complain with tears:-\"Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar; my soul hath been this long time a pilgrim.\"[fn-38-P3847_1041086:2732-nf] It was no wonder that she sobbed out that even she was in darkness (for this is the meaning of the word Kedar) seeing that, according to the apostle, \"the world lieth in the evil one;\"[fn-38-P3848_1041337:2733-nf] and that, \"as its darkness is, so is its light;\"[fn-38-P3849_1041409:2734-nf] and that \"the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.\"[fn-38-P3850_1041524:2735-nf] She would frequently exclaim: \"I am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers were,\"[fn-38-P3851_1041642:2736-nf] and again, I desire \"to depart and to be with Christ.\"[fn-38-P3852_1041721:2737-nf] As often too as she was troubled with bodily weakness (brought on by incredible abstinence and by redoubled fastings), she would be heard to say: \"I keep under my body and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway;\"[fn-38-P3853_1042029:2738-nf] and \"It is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine;\"[fn-38-P3854_1042110:2739-nf] and \"I humbled my soul with fasting;\"[fn-38-P3855_1042171:2740-nf] and \"thou wilt make all\" my \"bed in\" my \"sickness;\"[fn-38-P3856_1042246:2741-nf] and \"Thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer.\"[fn-38-P3857_1042351:2742-nf] And when the pain which she bore with such wonderful patience darted through her, as if she saw the heavens opened[fn-38-P3858_1042489:2743-nf] she would say \"Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away and be at rest.\"[fn-38-P3859_1042607:2744-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":41,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_13_book_v_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"18.

But as for me, I do not place my hopes in one who died for me in appearance, but in reality. For that which is false is quite abhorrent to the truth. Mary then did truly conceive a body which had God inhabiting it. And God the Word was truly born of the Virgin, having clothed Himself with a body of like passions with our own. He who forms all men in the womb, was Himself really in the womb, and made for Himself a body of the seed of the Virgin, but without any intercourse of man. He was carried in the womb, even as we are, for the usual period of time; and was really born, as we also are; and was in reality nourished with milk, and partook of common meat and drink, even as we do. And when He had lived among men for thirty years, He was baptized by John, really and not in appearance; and when He had preached the Gospel three years, and done signs and wonders, He who was Himself the Judge was judged by the Jews, falsely so called, and by Pilate the governor; was scourged, was smitten on the cheek, was spit upon; He wore a crown of thorns and a purple robe; He was condemned: He was crucified in reality, and not in appearance, not in imagination, not in deceit. He really died, and was buried, and rose from the dead, even as He prayed in a certain place, saying, \"But do Thou, O Lord, raise me up again, and I shall recompense them.\"[fn-17-P1752_299637:75-nf] And the Father, who always hears Him,[fn-17-P1753_299693:76-nf] answered and said, \"Arise, O God, and judge the earth; for Thou shall receive all the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-17-P1754_299835:77-nf] The Father, therefore, who raised Him up, will also raise us up through Him, apart from whom no one will attain to true life.

In consequence of this sinfulness, the law of God is erased out of their hearts; and therefore, when, the sin being healed, it is written there, the prescriptions of the law are done \"by nature,\"-not that by nature grace is denied, but rather by grace nature is repaired. For \"by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men; in which all have sinned;\"[fn-16-P1640_748785:240-nf] wherefore \"there is no difference: they all come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace.\"[fn-16-P1641_748918:241-nf] By this grace there is written on the renewed inner man that righteousness which sin had blotted out; and this mercy comes upon the human race through our Lord Jesus Christ. \"For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.\"[fn-16-P1642_749200:242-nf] ","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":41,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":54,"source_paragraph":"175","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Do we then by grace make void free will? God forbid! Nay, rather we establish free will.

Accordingly, as the law is not made void, but is established through faith, since faith procures grace whereby the law is fulfilled; so free will is not made void through grace, but is established, since grace cures the will whereby righteousness is freely loved. Now all the stages which I have here connected together in their successive links, have severally their proper voices in the sacred Scriptures. The law says: \"Thou shall not covet.\"[fn-16-P1699_764800:284-nf] Faith says: \"Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.\"[fn-17-P1700_764879:285-nf] Grace says: \"Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.\"[fn-17-P1701_764989:286-nf] Health says: \"O Lord my God, I cried unto Thee, and Thou hast healed me.\"[fn-17-P1702_765082:287-nf] Free will says: \"I will freely sacrifice unto Thee.\"[fn-17-P1703_765154:288-nf] Love of righteousness says: \"Transgressors told me pleasant tales, but not according to Thy law, O Lord.\"[fn-17-P1704_765279:289-nf] How is it then that miserable men dare to be proud, either of their free will, before they are freed, or of their own strength, if they have been freed?

But \"where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"[fn-17-P1705_765604:290-nf] If, therefore, they are the slaves of sin, why do they boast of free will?

That cross, however, shall certainly never be made of none effect; rather shall such wisdom be subverted. Now, after we shall have demonstrated this, it may be that God's mercy may visit him, so that he may be sorry that he ever said these things: \"We have,\" he says, \"first of all to discuss the position which is maintained, that our nature has been weakened and changed by sin. I think,\" continues he, \"that before all other things we have to inquire what sin is, - some substance, or wholly a name without substance, whereby is expressed not a thing, not an existence, not some sort of a body, but the doing of a wrongful deed.\" He then adds: \"I suppose that this is the case; and if so,\" he asks, \"how could that which lacks all substance have possibly weakened or changed human nature?\" Observe, I beg of you, how in his ignorance he struggles to overthrow the most salutary words of the remedial Scriptures: \"I said, O Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.\"[fn-20-P2006_848426:53-nf] Now, how can a thing be healed, if it is not wounded nor hurt, nor weakened and corrupted? But, as there is here something to be healed, whence did it receive its injury? You hear [the Psalmist] confessing the fact; what need is there of discussion? He says: \"Heal my soul.\" Ask him how that which he wants to be healed became injured, and then listen to his following words: \"Because I have sinned against Thee.\" Let him, however, put a question, and ask what he deemed a suitable inquiry, and say: \"0 you who exclaim, Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee! pray tell me what sin is? Some substance, or wholly a name without substance, whereby is expressed, not a thing, not an existence, not some sort of a body, but merely the doing of a wrongful deed?\" Then the other returns for answer: \"It is even as you say; sin is not some substance; but under its name there is merely expressed the doing of a wrongful deed.\" But he rejoins: \"Then why cry out, Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee? How could that have possibly corrupted your soul which lacks all substance?\" Then would the other, worn out with the anguish of his wound, in order to avoid being diverted from prayer by the discussion, briefly answer and say: \"Go from me, I beseech you; rather discuss the point, if you can, with Him who said: 'They that are whole need no physician, but they that are sick; I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners,'\"[fn-20-P2007_849879:54-nf] - in which words, of course, He designated the righteous as the whole, and sinners as the sick.","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":41,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":59,"source_paragraph":"202","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"Inasmuch,\" says he, \"as not to sin is ours, we are able to sin and to avoid sin.\" What, then, if another should say: \"Inasmuch as not to wish for unhappiness is ours, we are able both to wish for it and not to wish for it?\" And yet we are positively unable to wish for it. For who could possibly wish to be unhappy, even though he wishes for something else from which unhappiness will ensue to him against his will? Then again, inasmuch as, in an infinitely greater degree, it is God's not to sin, shall we therefore venture to say that He is able both to sin and to avoid sin?

It might, however, be more plainly expressed in some such way as this: \"Inasmuch as to be able to avoid sin is not of us, then, whether we wish it or do not wish it, we are able to avoid sin!\" He does not say, \"Whether we wish it or do not wish it, we do not sin,\"-for we undoubtedly do sin, if we wish; - but yet he asserts that, whether we will or not, we have the capacity of not sinning, - a capacity which he declares to be inherent in our nature.

In the case of the saintly poor the mind has blessed exercises, since you give to one who receives with a blush, and when he has received is grieved, that while sowing spiritual things he must reap your carnal things.

For in the 41st Psalm also it is shown much more clearly, where in the person of the Mediator, in the usual way, things are narrated as if past which were prophesied as yet to come, since these things which were yet to come were in the predestination and foreknowledge of God as if they were done, because they were certain. He says, \"Mine enemies speak evil of me; When shall he die, and his name perish? And if he came in to see me, his heart spake vain things: he gathered iniquity to himself.

And wouldest thou know certainly, that the Cross is a glory to Jesus? Hear His own words, not mine. Judas had become ungrateful to the Master of the house, and was about to betray Him. Having but just now gone forth from the table, and drunk His cup of blessing, in return for that drought of salvation he sought to shed righteous blood. He who did eat of His bread, was lifting up his heel against Him[fn-16-P1630_449072:23-nf] ; his hands were but lately receiving the blessed gifts[fn-16-P1631_449145:24-nf] , and presently for the wages of betrayal he was plotting His death.

He came therefore of His own set purpose to His passion, rejoicing in His noble deed, smiling at the crown, cheered by the salvation of mankind; not ashamed of the Cross, for it was to save the world.

As Cain's sacrifice of the fruit of the ground is rejected, while Abel's sacrifice of his sheep and the fat thereof is accepted. so the faith of the New Testament praising God in the harmless service of grace is preferred to the earthly observances of the Old Testament. For though the Jews were right in practising these things, they were guilty of unbelief in not distinguishing the time of the New Testament when Christ came, from the time of the Old Testament. God said to Cain, \"If thou offerest well, yet if thou dividest not well, thou hast sinned.\"[fn-14-P1409_748774:24-nf] If Cain had obeyed God when He said, \"Be content, for to thee shall be its reference, and thou shalt rule over it,\" he would have referred his sin to himself, by taking the blame of it, and confessing it to God; and so assisted by supplies of grace, he would have ruled over his sin, instead of acting as the servant of sin in killing his innocent brother. So also the Jews, of whom all these things are a figure, if they had been content, instead of being turbulent, and had acknowledged the time of salvation through the pardon of sins by grace, and heard Christ saying, \"They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance;\"[fn-14-P1410_749487:25-nf] and, \"Every one that committeth sin is the servant of sin;\" and, \"If the Son make you free, ye shall be free indeed,\"[fn-14-P1411_749628:26-nf] -they would in confession have referred their sin to themselves, saying to the Physician, as it is written in the Psalm, \"I said, Lord, be merciful to me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.\"[fn-14-P1412_749852:27-nf] And being made free by the hope of grace, they would have ruled over sin as long as it continued in their mortal body. But now, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and wishing to establish a righteousness of their own, proud of the works of the law, instead of being humbled on account of their sins, they have not been content; and in subjection to sin reigning in their mortal body, so as to make them obey it in the lusts thereof, they have stumbled on the stone of stumbling, and have been inflamed with hatred against him whose works they grieved to see accepted by God. The man who was born blind, and had been made to see, said to them, \"We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man serve Him, and do His will, him He heareth;\"[fn-14-P1413_750615:28-nf] as if he had said, God regardeth not the sacrifice of Cain, but he regards the sacrifice of Abel.

For He Himself, by His own manifested presence, \"judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son;\"[fn-40-P4066_2224896:176-nf] for as the Son was judged as a man, He shall also judge in human form. For it is none but He of whom God speaks by Isaiah under the name of Jacob and Israel, of whose seed Christ took a body, as it is written, \"Jacob is my servant, I will uphold Him; Israel is mine elect, my Spirit has assumed Him: I have put my Spirit upon Him; He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor cease, neither shall His voice be heard without. A bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall He not quench: but in truth shall He bring forth judgment.

The Holy Spirit was given to Him, and was manifested, as the evangelist testifies, in the form of a dove.[fn-40-P4068_2226033:178-nf] He brought forth judgment to the Gentiles, because He predicted what was hidden from them. In His meekness He did not cry, nor did He cease to proclaim the truth. But His voice was not heard, nor is it heard, without, because He is not obeyed by those who are outside of His body. And the Jews themselves, who persecuted Him, He did not break, though as a bruised reed they had lost their integrity, and as smoking flax their light was quenched; for He spared them, having come to be judged and not yet to judge. He brought forth judgment in truth, declaring that they should be punished did they persist in their wickedness. His face shone on the Mount,[fn-40-P4069_2226707:179-nf] His fame in the world. He is not broken nor over come, because neither in Himself nor in His Church has persecution prevailed to annihilate Him.

For this is the last judgment, which He will set in the earth when He comes from heaven. And it is in Him, too, we already see the concluding expression of the prophecy fulfilled: \"In His name shall the nations hope.\" And by this fulfillment, which no one can deny, men are encouraged to believe in that which is most impudently denied. For who could have hoped for that which even those who do not yet believe in Christ now see fulfilled among us, and which is so undeniable that they can but gnash their teeth and pine away? Who, I say, could have hoped that the nations would hope in the name of Christ, when He was arrested, bound, scourged, mocked, crucified, when even the disciples themselves had lost the hope which they had begun to have in Him? The hope which was then entertained scarcely by the one thief on the cross, is now cherished by nations everywhere on the earth, who are marked with the sign of the cross on which He died that they may not die eternally.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":41,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_118_treatise_viii_on_works_and_alms_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"ANF-05","text":"5.

For the same thing was by another prophet thus foretold, \"The Lord,\" saith he, \"shall prevail against them, and shall utterly destroy all the gods of the nations of the earth: and all the isles of the nations shall worship Him, each man from his place.\"[fn-33-P3366_1547083:27-nf] Whereas the one says, \"Unto Thee all nations shall come;\" this the other says, \"They shall worship Him, each man from his place.\" Therefore they shall come unto Him, not departing from their own place, because believing in Him they shall find Him in their hearts. Ye saw not what was foretold and fulfilled concerning the ascension of Christ; \"Be Thou exalted above the Heavens, O God;\"[fn-33-P3367_1547489:28-nf] but ye see what follows immediately after, \"And above all the earth Thy Glory.\" Those things concerning Christ already done and past, all of them ye have not seen; but these things present in His Church ye deny not that ye see. Both things we point out to you as foretold; but the fulfillment of both we are therefore unable to point out for you to see, because we cannot bring back into sight things past.","title":"Concerning Faith of Things Not Seen","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":41,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"131","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In like manner does He also know the very time it behoved Him to suffer, since the law prefigures His passion. Accordingly, of all the festal days of the Jews He chose the passover.[fn-69-P6944_2020517:1587-nf] In this Moses had declared that there was a sacred mystery:[fn-69-P6945_2020600:1588-nf] \"It is the Lord's passover.\"[fn-69-P6946_2020651:1589-nf] How earnestly, therefore, does He manifest the bent of His soul: \"With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.\"[fn-69-P6947_2020816:1590-nf] What a destroyer of the law was this, who actually longed to keep its passover! Could it be that He was so fond of Jewish lamb?[fn-69-P6948_2020969:1591-nf] But was it not because He had to be \"led like a lamb to the slaughter; and because, as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so was He not to open His mouth,\"[fn-69-P6949_2021232:1592-nf] that He so profoundly wished to accomplish the symbol of His own redeeming blood? He might also have been betrayed by any stranger, did I not find that even here too He fulfilled a Psalm: \"He who did eat bread with me hath lifted up[fn-69-P6950_2021488:1593-nf] his heel against me.\"[fn-69-P6951_2021561:1594-nf] And without a price might He have been betrayed. For what need of a traitor was there in the case of one who offered Himself to the people openly, and might quite as easily have been captured by force as taken by treachery? This might no doubt have been well enough for another Christ, but would not have been suitable in One who was accomplishing prophecies. For it was written, \"The righteous one did they sell for silver.\"[fn-69-P6952_2022008:1595-nf] The very amount and the destination[fn-69-P6953_2022066:1596-nf] of the money, which on Judas' remorse was recalled from its first purpose of a fee,[fn-69-P6954_2022167:1597-nf] and appropriated to the purchase of a potter's field, as narrated in the Gospel of Matthew, were clearly foretold by Jeremiah:[fn-69-P6955_2022313:1598-nf] \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued[fn-69-P6956_2023536:1599-nf] and gave them for the potter's field.\" When He so earnestly expressed His desire to eat the passover, He considered it His own feast; for it would have been unworthy of God to desire to partake of what was not His own. Then, having taken the bread and given it to His disciples, He made it His own body, by saying, \"This is my body,\"[fn-69-P6957_2024134:1600-nf] that is, the figure of my body. A figure, however, there could not have been, unless there were first a veritable body.[fn-69-P6958_2024319:1601-nf] An empty thing, or phantom, is incapable of a figure. If, however, (as Marcion might say, ) He pretended the bread was His body, because He lacked the truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for us. It would contribute very well to the support of Marcion's theory of a phantom body,[fn-69-P6959_2024703:1602-nf] that bread should have been crucified!But why call His body bread, and not rather (some other edible thing, say) a melon,[fn-69-P6960_2024876:1603-nf] which Marcion must have had in lieu of a heart! He did not understand how ancient was this figure of the body of Christ, who said Himself by Jeremiah: \"I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter, and I knew not that[fn-69-P6961_2025229:1604-nf] they devised a device against me, saying, Let us cast the tree upon His bread,\"[fn-69-P6962_2025396:1605-nf] which means, of course, the cross upon His body. And thus, casting light, as He always did, upon the ancient prophecies,[fn-69-P6963_2025681:1606-nf] He declared plainly enough what He meant by the bread, when He called the bread His own body. He likewise, when mentioning the cup and making the new testament to be sealed \"in His blood,\"[fn-69-P6964_2026008:1607-nf] affirms the reality of His body. For no blood can belong to a body which is not a body of flesh. If any sort of body were presented to our view, which is not one of flesh, not being fleshly, it would not possess blood. Thus, from the evidence of the flesh, we get a proof of the body, and a proof of the flesh from the evidence of the blood. In order, however, that you may discover how anciently wine is used as a figure for blood, turn to Isaiah, who asks, \"Who is this that cometh from Edom, from Bosor with garments dyed in red, so glorious in His apparel, in the greatness of his might? Why are thy garments red, and thy raiment as his who cometh from the treading of the full winepress? \"[fn-69-P6965_2026727:1608-nf] The prophetic Spirit contemplates the Lord as if He were already on His way to His passion, clad in His fleshly nature; and as He was to suffer therein, He represents the bleeding condition of His flesh under the metaphor of garments dyed in red, as if reddened in the treading and crushing process of the wine-press, from which the labourers descend reddened with the wine-juice, like men stained in blood. Much more clearly still does the book of Genesis foretell this, when (in the blessing of Judah, out of whose tribe Christ was to come according to the flesh) it even then delineated Christ in the person of that patriarch,[fn-69-P6966_2027407:1609-nf] saying, \"He washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes\"[fn-69-P6967_2027506:1610-nf] -in His garments and clothes the prophecy pointed out his flesh, and His blood in the wine. Thus did He now consecrate His blood in wine, who then (by the patriarch) used the figure of wine to describe His blood.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":41,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_31_on_continence_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"18. All we therefore, who believe in the Living and True God, Whose Nature, being in the highest sense good and incapable of change, neither doth any evil, nor suffers any evil, from Whom is every good, even that which admits of decrease, and Who admits not at all of decrease in His own Good, Which is Himself, when we hear the Apostle saying, \"Walk in the Spirit, and perform ye not the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: For these are opposed one to another, that ye do not what ye would.\"[fn-36-P3649_1722658:58-nf] Far be it from us to believe, what the madness of the Manichees believes, that there are here shown two natures or principles contrary one to another at strife, the one nature of good, the other of evil. Altogether these two are both good; both the Spirit is a good, and the flesh a good: and man, who is composed of both, one ruling, the other obeying, is assuredly a good, but a good capable of change, which yet could not be made save by a Good incapable of change, by Whom was created every good, whether small or great; but how small soever, yet made by What is Great; and how great soever, yet no way to be compared with the greatness of the Maker. But in this nature of man, that is good, and well formed and ordered by One That is Good, there is now war, since there is not yet health. Let the sickness be healed, there is peace. But that sickness fault hath deserved, not nature hath had. And this fault indeed through the layer of regeneration the grace of God hath already remitted unto the faithful; but under the hands of the same Physician nature as yet striveth with its sickness. But in such a conflict victory will be entire soundness; and that, soundness not for a time, but for ever: wherein not only this sickness is to come to an end, but also none to arise after it. Wherefore the just man addresseth his soul and saith, \"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His returns: Who becometh propitious to all thy iniquities, Who healeth all thy sicknesses.\"[fn-36-P3650_1724162:59-nf] He becometh propitious to our iniquities, when He pardons sins: He heals sicknesses when He restrains evil desires. He becometh propitious unto iniquities by the grant of forgiveness: He heals sicknesses, by the grant of continence. The one was done in Baptism to persons confessing; the other is done in the strife to persons contending; wherein through His help we are to overcome our disease. Even now the one is done, when we are heard, saying, \"Forgive us our debts;\"[fn-36-P3651_1724656:60-nf] but the other, when we are heard, saying, \"Lead us not into temptation. For every one is tempted,\" saith the Apostle James, \"being drawn away and enticed by his own lust.\"[fn-36-P3652_1724851:61-nf] And against this fault there is sought the help of medicine from Him, Who can heal all such sicknesses, not by the removal of a nature that is alien from us, but in the renewal of our own nature. Whence also the above-mentioned Apostle saith not, \"Every one is tempted\" by lust, but added, \"by his own:\" that he who hears this may understand, how he ought to cry, \"I said, Lord, have mercy upon me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.\"[fn-36-P3653_1725315:62-nf] For it would not have needed healing, had it not corrupted[fn-36-P3654_1725391:63-nf] itself by sinning, so that its own flesh should lust against it, that is, itself should be opposed to itself, on that side, wherein in the flesh it was made sick.","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":41,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"305","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Isaiah: \"Cry aloud,\" saith He, \"and spare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet; tell my people their sins, and the house of Jacob their wickednesses.

They ask of me now a righteous judgment, and desire to approach to God, saying, What! because we have fasted, and Thou hast not seen: we have humiliated our souls, and Thou hast not known. For in the days of fasting are found your own wills; for either ye torment those who are subjected to you, or ye fast for strifes and judgments, or ye strike your neighbours with fists.

Even as thou hast, my son, so do: if thou hast abundant substance, give the more alms therefrom; if thou hast little, communicate even of that little. And do not fear when thou givest alms: thou layest up for thyself a good reward against the day of need; because alms delivereth from death, and does not suffer to go into darkness.

Daniel also was persecuted as Jesus was persecuted. Daniel was persecuted by the\nChaldeans, the congregation of heathen men; Jesus also the Jews, the congregain of wicked men,\npersecuted.

Daniel they\ncast into the pit of lions, and he was delivered and came up out of its midst uninjured; and Jesus\nthey sent down into the pit of the abode of the dead, and He ascended, and death had not dominion\nover him.

But, if it does not weary you, let the point out as briefly as possible, specific references to prophecy in the Gospels, that those who are being instructed in the first elements of the faith may have these testimonies written on their hearts, test any doubt concerning the things which they believe should at any time take them by surprise. We are told in the Gospel that Judas, one of Christ's friends and associates at table, betrayed Him. Let the show you how this is foretold in the Psalms: \"He who hath eaten My bread hath lifted up his heel against Me:\"[fn-97-P9733_2736731:50-nf] and in another place; \"My friends and My neighbours drew near and set themselves against Me:\"[fn-97-P9734_2736842:51-nf] and again; \"His words were made softer than oil and yet be they very darts.\"[fn-97-P9735_2736938:52-nf] What then is meant by his words were made soft? \"Judas came to Jesus and said unto Him, Hail, Master, and kissed Him.\"[fn-97-P9736_2737074:53-nf] Thus through the soft blandishment of a kiss he implanted the execrable dart of betrayal. On which the Lord said to him, \"Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?\"[fn-97-P9737_2737268:54-nf] You observe that He was appraised by the traitor's covetousness at thirty pieces of silver. Of this also the Prophet speaks, \"And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price, or if not, forbear;\" and presently, \"I received from them,\" he says, \"thirty pieces of silver, and I cast them into the house of the Lord, into the foundry.\"[fn-97-P9738_2737630:55-nf] Is not this what is written in the Gospels, that Judas, \"repenting of what he had done, brought back the money, and threw it down in the temple and departed?\"[fn-97-P9739_2737827:56-nf] Well did He call it His price, as though blaming and upbraiding. For He had done so many good works among them, He had given sight to the blind, feet to the lame, the power of walking to the palsied, life also to the dead; for all these good works they paid Him death as His price, appraised at thirty pieces of silver. It is related also in the Gospels that He was bound.

Or if one should wish to have it, he might think of stealing it from another's house. Charity is praised to you; if it please you, have it, possess it: no need that ye should rob any man, no need that ye should think of buying it; it is to be had freely, without cost.

But perhaps this is demanded of us, whether the fact that the temple was forty and six years in building may not have in it some mystery. There are, indeed, many things that may be said of this matter; but what may briefly be said, and easily understood, that we say meanwhile. Brethren, we have said yesterday, if I mistake not, that Adam was one man, and is yet the whole human race. For thus we said, if you remember. He was broken, as it were, in pieces; and, being scattered, is now being gathered together, and, as it were, conjoined into one by a spiritual fellowship and concord. And \"the poor that groan,\" as one man, is that same Adam, but in Christ he is being renewed: because an Adam is come without sin, to destroy the sin of Adam in His own flesh, and that Adam might renew to himself the image of God. Of Adam then is Christ's flesh: of Adam the temple which the Jews destroyed, and the Lord raised up in three days. For He raised His own flesh: see, that He was thus God equal with the Father. My brethren, the apostle says, \"Who raised Him from the dead.\" Of whom says he this? Of the Father. \"He became,\" saith he, \"obedient unto death, even the death of the cross; wherefore also God raised Him from the dead, and gave Him a name which is above every name.\"[fn-6-P687_331080:26-nf] He who was raised and exalted is the Lord. Who raised Him? The Father, to whom He said in the psalms, \"Raise me up and I will requite them.\"[fn-6-P688_331239:27-nf] Hence, the Father raised Him up. Did He not raise Himself? And doeth the Father anything without the Word? What doeth the Father without His only One? For, hear that He also was God. \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\" Did He say, Destroy the temple, which in three days the Father will raise up?

Seek in the Father and Son a separation, thou findest none; no, not if thou hast mounted high; no, not even if thou hast reached something above thy mind. For if thou turnest about among the things which thy wandering mind makes for itself, thou talkest with thine own imaginations, not with the Word of God; thine own imaginations deceive thee. Mount also beyond the body, and understand the mind; mount also beyond the mind, and understand God. Thou reachest not unto God, unless thou hast passed beyond the mind; how much less thou reachest unto God, if thou hast tarried in the flesh! They who think of the flesh, how far are they from understanding what God is!-since they would not be there even if they knew the mind. Man recedes far from God when his thoughts are of the flesh; and there is a great difference between flesh and mind, yet a greater between mind and God. If thou art occupied with the mind, thou art in the midway: if thou directest thy attention beneath, there is the body; if above, there is God. Lift thyself up from the body, pass beyond even thyself.

The five porches in which the infirm folk lay signify the Law, which was first given to the Jews and to the people of Israel by Moses the servant of God. For this Moses the minister of the Law wrote five books. In relation therefore to the number of the books which he wrote, the five porches figured the Law. But because the Law was not given to heal the infirm, but to discover and to manifest them; for so saith the Apostle, \"For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the Law; But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe;\"[fn-59-P5945_2516913:2-nf] therefore in those porches the sick folk lay, but were not cured. For what saith he? \"If there had been a law given which could have given life.\" Therefore those porches which figured the Law could not cure the sick. Some one will say to me, \"Why then was it given?\" The Apostle Paul hath himself explained: \"Scripture,\" saith he, \"hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\" For these folk who were sick, thought themselves to be whole. They received the Law, which they were not able to fulfil; they learnt in what disease they were, and they implored the Physician's aid; they wished to be cured because they came to know they were in distress, which they would not have known if they had not been unable to fulfil the Law which had been given. For man thought himself innocent, and from this very pride of false innocence became more mad. To tame this pride then and to lay it bare, the Law was given; not to deliver the sick, but to convince the proud. Attend then, Beloved; to this end was the Law given, to discover diseases, not to take them away. And so then those sick folk who might have been sick in their own houses with greater privacy, if those five porches had not existed, were in those porches set forth to the eyes of all men, but were not by the porches cured. The Law therefore was useful to discover sins, because that man being made more abundantly guilty by the transgression of the Law, might, having tamed his pride, implore the help of Him That pitieth. Attend to the Apostle; \"The Law entered that sin might abound; but where sin abounded, grace hath much more abounded.\"[fn-59-P5946_2518600:3-nf] What is, \"The Law entered that sin might abound \"? As in another place he saith, \"For where there is no law, there is no transgression.\"[fn-59-P5947_2518752:4-nf] Man may be called a sinner before the Law, a transgressor he cannot. But when he hath sinned, after that he hath received the Law, he is found not only a sinner, but a transgressor. Forasmuch then as to sin is added transgression, therefore \"hath sin abounded.\" And when sin abounds, human pride learns at length to submit itself, and to confess to God, and to say \"I am weak\" To say to those words of the Psalm which none but the humbled soul saith, \"I said, Lord, be merciful unto me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.\"[fn-59-P5948_2519302:5-nf] Let the weak soul then say this that is at least convinced by transgression, and not cured, but manifested by the Law. Hear too Paul himself showing thee, both that the Law is good, and yet that nothing but the grace of Christ delivereth from sin. For the Law can prohibit and command; apply the medicine, that that which doth not allow a man to fulfil the Law, may be cured, it cannot, but grace only doeth that. For the Apostle saith, \"For I delight in the Law of Godafter the inner man.\"[fn-59-P5949_2519808:6-nf] That is, I see now that what the Law blames is evil, and what the Law commands is good. \"For I delight in the Law of God after the inner man. I see another law in my members resisting the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity in the law of sin.\" This derived from the punishment of sin, from the propagation of death, from the condemnation of Adam, \"resists the law of the mind, and brings it into captivity in the law of sin which is in the members.\" He was convinced; he received the Law, that he might be convinced: see now what profit it was to him that he was convinced. Hear the following words,\" \"Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"[fn-59-P5950_2520561:7-nf] ","title":"Sermon LXXV. [CXXV.
