{"verses":["Unto the end, understanding for the sons of Core.","As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; so my soul\npanteth after thee, O God.","My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God; when shall I\ncome and appear before the face of God?","My tears have been my bread day and night, whilst it is said to\nme daily:  Where is thy God?","These things I remembered, and poured out my soul in me:  for I\nshall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even to the\nhouse of God:  With the voice of joy and praise; the noise of one\nfeasting.","Why art thou sad, O my soul?  and why dost thou trouble me?  Hope\nin God, for I will still give praise to him:  the salvation of my\ncountenance,","And my God.  My soul is troubled within my self:  therefore will I\nremember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim, from the little\nhill.","Deep calleth on deep, at the noise of thy flood-gates.  All thy\nheights and thy billows have passed over me.","In the daytime the Lord hath commanded his mercy; and a canticle\nto him in the night.  With me is prayer to the God of my life.","I will say to God:  Thou art my support.  Why hast thou forgotten\nme?  and why go I mourning, whilst my enemy afflicteth me?","Whilst my bones are broken, my enemies who trouble me have\nreproached me; Whilst they say to me day by day:  Where is thy God?","Why art thou cast down, O my soul?  and why dost thou disquiet\nme?  Hope thou in God, for I will still give praise to him:  the\nsalvation of my countenance, and my God."]}
