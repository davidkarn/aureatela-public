{"verses":["A gradual canticle.  They that trust in the Lord shall be as\nmount Sion:  he shall not be moved for ever that dwelleth","In Jerusalem.  Mountains are round about it:  so the Lord is round\nabout his people from henceforth now and for ever.","For the Lord will not leave the rod of sinners upon the lot of\nthe just:  that the just may not stretch forth their hands to iniquity.","Do good, O Lord, to those that are good, and to the upright of\nheart.","But such as turn aside into bonds, the Lord shall lead out with\nthe workers of iniquity:  peace upon Israel."]}
