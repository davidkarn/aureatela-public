{"verses":["I have cried to thee, O Lord, hear me:  hearken to my voice, when\nI cry to thee.","Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight; the lifting\nup of my hands, as evening sacrifice.","Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth:  and a door round about my\nlips.","Incline not my heart to evil words; to make excuses in sins.\nWith men that work iniquity:  and I will not communicate with the\nchoicest of them.","The just man shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me:\nbut let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head.  For my prayer shall\nstill be against the things with which they are well pleased:","Their judges falling upon the rock have been swallowed up.  They\nshall hear my words, for they have prevailed:","As when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground:\nOur bones are scattered by the side of hell.","But to thee, O Lord, Lord, are my eyes:  in thee have I put my\ntrust, take not away my soul.","Keep me from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from\nthe stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity.","The wicked shall fall in his net:  I am alone until I pass."]}
