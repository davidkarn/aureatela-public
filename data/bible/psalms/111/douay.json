{"verses":["Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord:  he shall delight\nexceedingly in his commandments.","His seed shall be mighty upon earth:  the generation of the\nrighteous shall be blessed.","Glory and wealth shall be in his house:  and his justice\nremaineth for ever and ever.","To the righteous a light is risen up in darkness:  he is\nmerciful, and compassionate and just.","Acceptable is the man that sheweth mercy and lendeth:  he shall\norder his words with judgment:","Because he shall not be moved for ever.","The just shall be in everlasting remembrance:  he shall not fear\nthe evil hearing.  His heart is ready to hope in the Lord:","His heart is strengthened, he shall not be moved until he look\nover his enemies.","He hath distributed, he hath given to the poor:  his justice\nremaineth for ever and ever:  his horn shall be exalted in glory.","The wicked shall see, and shall be angry, he shall gnash with\nhis teeth and pine away:  the desire of the wicked shall perish."]}
