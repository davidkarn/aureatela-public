{"verses":["Unto the end, for Idithun himself, a canticle of David.","I said:  I will take heed to my ways:  that I sin not with my\ntongue.  I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against\nme.","I was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things:\nand my sorrow was renewed.","My heart grew hot within me:  and in my meditation a fire shall\nflame out.","I spoke with my tongue:  O Lord, make me know my end.  And what is\nthe number of my days:  that I may know what is wanting to me.","Behold thou hast made my days measurable.  and my substance is as\nnothing before thee.  And indeed all things are vanity:  every man\nliving.","Surely man passeth as an image:  yea, and he is disquieted in\nvain.  He storeth up:  and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these\nthings.","And now what is my hope?  is it not the Lord?  and my substance is\nwith thee.","Deliver thou me from all my iniquities:  thou hast made me a\nreproach to the fool.","I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done\nit.","Remove thy scourges from me.  The strength of thy hand hath made\nme faint in rebukes:","Thou hast corrected man for iniquity.  And thou hast made his\nsoul to waste away like a spider:  surely in vain is any man disquieted.","Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication:  give ear to my\ntears.  Be no silent:  for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as\nall my fathers were.","O forgive me, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, and be\nno more."]}
