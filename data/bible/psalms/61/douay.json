{"verses":["Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of David.","Shall not my soul be subject to God?  for from him is my\nsalvation.","For he is my God and my saviour:  he is my protector, I shall be\nmoved no more.","How long do you rush in upon a man?  you all kill, as if you were\nthrusting down a leaning wall, and a tottering fence.","But they have thought to cast away my price; I ran in thirst:\nthey blessed with their mouth, but cursed with their heart.","But be thou, O my soul, subject to God:  for from him is my\npatience.","For he is my God and my saviour:  he is my helper, I shall not be\nmoved.","In God is my salvation and my glory:  he is the God of my help,\nand my hope is in God.","Trust in him, all ye congregation of people:  pour out your hearts\nbefore him.  God is our helper for ever.","But vain are the sons of men, the sons of men are liars in the\nbalances:  that by vanity they may together deceive.","Trust not in iniquity, and cover not robberies:  if riches\nabound, set not your heart upon them.","God hath spoken once, these two things have I heard, that power\nbelongeth to God,","And mercy to thee, O Lord; for thou wilt render to every man\naccording to his works."]}
