{"verses":["And God remembered Noe, and all the living creatures, and all the\ncattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the\nearth, and the waters were abated:","The fountains also of the deep, and the floodgates of heaven, were\nshut up, and the rain from heaven was restrained.","And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming:  and\nthey began to be abated after a hundred and fifty days.","And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seven and twentieth\nday of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia.","And the waters were going and decreasing until the tenth month:\nfor in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the\nmountains appeared.","And after that forty days were passed, Noe opening the window of\nthe ark, which he had made, sent forth a raven:","Which went forth and did not return, till the waters were dried up\nupon the earth.","He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters had now\nceased upon the face of the earth.","But she not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him\ninto the ark:  for the waters were upon the whole earth:  and he put\nforth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.","And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the\ndove out of the ark.","And she came to him in the evening carrying a bough of an olive\ntree, with green leaves, in her mouth.  Noe therefore understood that\nthe waters were ceased upon the earth.","And he stayed yet other seven days:  and he sent forth the dove,\nwhich returned not any more unto him.","Therefore in the six hundredth and first year, the first month,\nthe first day of the month, the waters were lessened upon the earth,\nand Noe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and saw that the face\nof the earth was dried.","In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month,\nthe earth was dried.","And God spoke to Noe, saying:","Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons and the wives of\nthy sons with thee.","All living things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in\nfowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth,\nbring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth:  increase and multiply\nupon it.","So Noe went out, he and his sons:  his wife, and the wives of his\nsons with him.","And all living things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep\nupon the earth, according to their kinds went out of the ark.","And Noe built an altar unto the Lord:  and taking of all cattle\nand fowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon the altar.","And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said:  I will no more\ncurse the earth for the sake of man:  for the imagination and thought of\nman's heart are prone to evil from his youth:  therefore I will no more\ndestroy every living soul as I have done.","All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat,\nsummer and winter, night and day, shall not cease."]}
