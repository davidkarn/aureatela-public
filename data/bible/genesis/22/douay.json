Behold, saith he, fire and wood:  where is the victim for the\nholocaust?","And Abraham said:  God will provide himself a victim for an\nholocaust, my son.  So they went on together.","And they came to the place which God had shewn him, where he\nbuilt an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it; and when he had\nbound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.","And he put forth his hand, and took the sword, to sacrifice his\nson.","And behold, an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him,\nsaying:  Abraham, Abraham.
