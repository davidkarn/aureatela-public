{"verses":["And Joseph commanded the steward of his house, saying:  Fill their\nsacks with corn, as much as they can hold:  and put the money of every\none in the top of his sack.","And in the mouth of the younger's sack put my silver cup, and the\nprice which he gave for the wheat.  And it was so done.","And when the morning arose, they were sent away with their asses.","And when they were now departed out of the city, and had gone\nforward a little way:  Joseph sending for the steward of his house,\nsaid:  Arise, and pursue after the men:  and when thou hast overtaken\nthem, say to them:  Why have you returned evil for good?","The cup which you have stolen, is that in which my lord drinketh,\nand in which he is wont to divine:  you have done a very evil thing.","He did as he had commanded him.  And having overtaken them, he\nspoke to them the same words.","And they answered:  Why doth our lord speak so, as though thy\nservants had committed so heinous a fact?","The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back\nto thee from the land of Chanaan:  how then should it be that we should\nsteal out of thy lord's house, gold or silver?","With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou\nseekest, let him die, and we will be the bondmen of my lord.","And he said to them:  Let it be according to your sentence:  with\nwhomsoever it shall be found, let him be my servant, and you shall be\nblameless.","Then they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and\nevery man opened his sack.","Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest, and ending\nat the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin's sack.","Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again,\nreturned into the town.","And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph (for he\nwas not yet gone out of the place) and they all together fell down\nbefore him on the ground.","And he said to them:  Why would you do so?  know you not that\nthere is no one like me in the science of divining.","And Juda said to him:  What shall we answer my lord?  or what\nshall we say, or be able justly to allege?  God hath found out the\niniquity of thy servants:  behold, we are all bondmen to my lord, both\nwe, and he with whom the cup was found.","Joseph answered:  God forbid that I should do so:  he that stole\nthe cup, he shall be my bondman:  and go you away free to your father.","Then Juda coming nearer, said boldly:  I beseech thee, my lord,\nlet thy servant speak a word in thy ears, and be not angry with thy\nservant:  for after Pharao thou art.","My lord.  Thou didst ask thy servants the first time:  Have you a\nfather or a brother.","And we answered thee, my lord:  We have a father an old man, and\na young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother\nis dead; and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him\ntenderly.","And thou saidst to thy servants:  Bring him hither to me, and I\nwill set my eyes on him.","We suggested to my lord:  The boy cannot leave his father:  for if\nhe leave him, he will die.","And thou saidst to thy servants:  Except your youngest brother\ncome with you, you shall see my face no more.","Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father, we\ntold him all that my lord had said.","And our father said:  Go again, and buy us a little wheat.","And we said to him:  We cannot go:  if our youngest brother go\ndown with us, we will set out together:  otherwise, without him we dare\nnot see the man's face.","Whereunto he answered:  You know that my wife bore me two.","One went out, and you said:  A beast devoured him; and hitherto\nhe appeareth not.","If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way, you\nwill bring down my grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.","Therefore, if I shall go to thy servant, our father, and the boy\nbe wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him,)","And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy\nservants shall bring down his grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.","Let me be thy proper servant, who took him into my trust, and\npromised, saying:  If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin\nagainst my father for ever.","Therefore I, thy servant, will stay instead of the boy in the\nservice of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.","For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I be a\nwitness of the calamity that will oppress my father."]}
