If\" it is shameful for a woman to be shaven or shorn,\" of course it is so for a virgin. (Hence let the world, the rival of God, see to it, if it asserts that close-cut hair is graceful to a virgin in like manner as that flowing hair is to a boy.) To her, then, to whom it is equally unbecoming to be shaven or shorn, it is equally becoming to be covered. If\" the woman is the glory of the man,\" how much more the virgin, who is a glory withal to herself! If \"the woman is of the man,\" and \"for the sake of the man,\" that rib of Adam[fn-6-P607_138350:27-nf] was first a virgin. If \"the woman ought to have power upon the head,\"[fn-6-P608_138439:28-nf] all the more justly ought the virgin, to whom pertains the essence of the cause (assigned for this assertion). For if (it is) on account of the angels-those, to wit, whom we read of as having fallen from God and heaven on account of concupiscence after females-who can presume that it was bodies already defiled, and relics of human lust, which such angels yearned after, so as not rather to have been inflamed for virgins, whose bloom pleads an excuse for human lust likewise? For thus does Scripture withal suggest: \"And it came to pass,\" it says, \"when men had begun to grow more numerous upon the earth, there were withal daughters born them; but the sons of God, having descried the daughters of men, that they were fair, took to themselves wives of all whom they elected.\"[fn-6-P609_139238:29-nf] For here the Greek name of women does seem to have the sense \"wives,\" inasmuch as mention is made of marriage. When, then, it says \"the daughters of men,\" it manifestly purports virgins, who would be still reckoned as belonging to their parents-for wedded women are called their husbands'-whereas it could have said \"the wives of men: \"in like manner not naming the angels adulterers, but husbands, while they take unwedded\" daughters of men,\" who it has above said were \"born,\" thus also signifying their virginity: first,\"born; \"but here, wedded to angels. Anything else I know not that they were except \"born\" and subsequently wedded. So perilous a face, then, ought to be shaded, which has cast stumbling-stones even so far as heaven: that, when standing in the presence of God, at whose bar it stands accused of the driving of the angels from their (native) confines, it may blush before the other angels as well; and may repress that former evil liberty of its head,-(a liberty) now to be exhibited not even before human eyes. But even if they were females already contaminated whom those angels had desired, so much the more \"on account of the angels\" would it have been the duty of virgins to be veiled, as it would have been the more possible for virgins to have been the cause of the angels' sinning. If, moreover, the apostle further adds the prejudgment of \"nature,\" that redundancy of locks is an honour to a woman, because hair serves for a covering,[fn-6-P610_140723:30-nf] of course it is most of all to a virgin that this is a distinction; for their very adornment properly consists in this, that, by being massed together upon the crown, it wholly covers the very citadel of the head with an encirclement of hair.","title":"III.

So likewise Adam, while still intact, is surnamed in Genesis man:[fn-6-P615_141834:32-nf] \"She shall be called,\" says he, \"woman, because she hath been taken from her own man.\" Thus was Adam a man before nuptial intercourse, in like manner as Eve a woman. On either side the apostle has made his sentence apply with sufficient plainness to the universal species of each sex; and briefly and fully, with so well-appointed a definition, he says, \" Every woman.\" What is \"every,\" but of every class, of every order, of every condition, of every dignity, of every age?-if, (as is the case), \"every\" means total and entire, and in none of its parts defective. But the virgin is withal a part of the woman. Equally, too, with regard to not veiling the man, he says \"every.\" Behold two diverse names, Man and woman-\"every one\" in each case: two laws, mutually distinctive; on the one hand (a law) of veiling, on the other (a law) of baring. Therefore, if the fact that it is said \"every man\" makes it plain that the name of man is common even to him who is not yet a man, a stripling male; (if), moreover, since the name is common according to nature, the law of not veiling him who among men is a virgin is common too according to discipline: why is it that it is not consequently prejudged that, woman being named, every woman-virgin is similarly comprised in the fellowship of the name, so as to be comprised too in the community of the law? If a virgin is not a woman, neither is a stripling a man. If the virgin is not covered on the plea that she is not a woman, let the stripling be covered on the plea that he is not a man. Let identity of virginity, share equality of indulgence. As virgins are not compelled to be veiled, so let boys not be bidden to be unveiled. Why do we partly acknowledge the definition of the apostle, as absolute with regard to \"every man,\" without entering upon disquisitions as to why he has not withal named the boy; but partly prevaricate, though it is equally absolute with regard to \"every woman? \"\"If any,\" he says, \"is contentious, we have not such a custom, nor (has) the Church of God.\"[fn-6-P616_143890:33-nf] He shows that there had been some contention about this point; for the extinction whereof he uses the whole compendiousness (of language): not naming the virgin, on the one hand, in order to show that there is to be no doubt about her veiling; and, on the other hand, naming \"every woman,\" whereas he would have named the virgin (had the question been confined to her). So, too, did the Corinthians themselves understand him. In fact, at this day the Corinthians do veil their virgins. What the apostles taught, their disciples approve.","title":"III.

For withal the founders of the race, Adam and Eve, so long as they were without intelligence, went \"naked; \"but after they tasted of \"the tree of recognition,\" they were first sensible of nothing more than of their cause for shame. Thus they each marked their intelligence of their own sex by a covering.[fn-6-P632_150722:38-nf] But even if it is \"on account of the angels\" that she is to be veiled,[fn-6-P633_150844:39-nf] doubtless the age from which the law of the veil will come into operation will be that from which \"the daughters of men\" were able to invite concupiscence of their persons, and to experience marriage. For a virgin ceases to be a virgin from the time that it becomes possible for her not to be one. And accordingly, among Israel, it is unlawful to deliver one to a husband except after the attestation by blood of her maturity;[fn-6-P634_151296:40-nf] thus, before this indication, the nature is unripe. Therefore if she is a virgin so long as she is unripe, she ceases to be a virgin when she is perceived to be ripe; and, as not-virgin, is now subject to the law, just as she is to marriage. And the betrothed indeed have the example of Rebecca, who, when she was being conducted-herself still unknown-to an unknown betrothed, as soon as she learned that he whom she had sighted from afar was the man, awaited not the grasp of the hand, nor the meeting of the kiss, nor the interchange of salutation; but confessing what she had felt-namely, that she had been (already) wedded in spirit-denied herself to be a virgin by then and there veiling herself.[fn-6-P635_152026:41-nf] Oh woman already belonging to Christ's discipline! For she showed that marriage likewise, as fornication is, is transacted by gaze and mind; only that a Rebecca likewise some do still veil. With regard to the rest, however (that is, those who are not betrothed), let the procrastination of their parents, arising from straitened means or scrupulosity, look (to them); let the vow of continence itself look (to them). In no respect does (such procrastination) pertain to an age which is already running its own assigned course, and paying its own dues to maturity. Another secret mother, Nature, and another hidden father, Time, have wedded their daughter to their own laws. Behold that virgin-daughter of yours already wedded-her soul by expectancy, her flesh by transformation-for whom you are preparing a second husband! Already her voice is changed, her limbs fully formed, her \"shame\" everywhere clothing itself, the months paying their tributes; and do you deny her to be a woman whom you assert to be undergoing womanly experiences? If the contact of a man makes a woman, let there be no covering except after actual experience of marriage. Nay, but even among the heathens (the betrothed) are led veiled to the husband. But if it is at betrothal that they are veiled, because (then) both in body and in spirit they have mingled with a male, through the kiss and the fight hands, through which means they first in spirit unsealed their modesty, through the common pledge of conscience whereby they mutually plighted their whole confusion; how much more will time veil them?-(time) without which espoused they cannot be; and by whose urgency, without espousals, they cease to be virgins. Time even the heathens observe, that, in obedience to the law of nature, they may render their own fights to the (different) ages. For their females they despatch to their businesses from (the age of) twelve years, but the male from two years later; decreeing puberty (to consist) in years, not in espousals or nuptials. \"Housewife\" one is called, albeit a virgin, and \"house-father,\" albeit a stripling.

Elohim the father, seeing these things, sends forth Baruch, the third angel among his own, to succour the spirit that is in all men.[fn-13-P1361_379755:271-nf] Baruch then coming, stood in the midst of the angels of Edem, that is, in the midst of paradise-for paradise is the angels, in the midst of whom he stood,-and issued to the man the following injunction: \"Of every tree that is in paradise thou mayest freely eat, but thou mayest not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,\"[fn-13-P1362_380156:272-nf] which is Naas. Now the meaning is, that he should obey the rest of the eleven angels of Edem, for the eleven possess passions, but are not guilty of transgression. Naas, however, has committed sin, for he went in unto Eve, deceiving her, and debauched her; and (such an act as) this is a violation of law. He, however, likewise went in unto Adam, and had unnatural intercourse with him; and this is itself also a piece of turpitude, whence have arisen adultery and sodomy.","title":"Book V.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_10_book_vi_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"ANF-05","text":"When, therefore, Moses has spoken of \"the six days in which God made heaven and earth, and rested on the seventh from all His works,\"[fn-14-P1448_406713:14-nf] Simon, in a manner already specified, giving (these and other passages of Scripture) a different application (from the one intended by the holy writers), deifies himself.

Of one position which he strives to maintain I hardly know whether it calls for my tears or my laughter. This wonderful doctor presumes to teach that the devil will once more be what he at one time was, that he will return to his former dignity and rise again to the kingdom of heaven. Oh horror! that a man should be so frantic and foolish as to hold that John the Baptist, Peter, the apostle and evangelist John, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the rest of the prophets, are made co-heirs of the devil in the kingdom of heaven! I pass over his idle explanation of the coats of skins,[fn-18-P1818_442819:1265-nf] and say nothing of the efforts and arguments he has used to induce us to believe that these coats of skins represent human bodies. Among many other things, he says this: \"Was God a tanner or a saddler, that He should prepare the hides of animals, and should stitch from them coats of skins for Adam and Eve?\" \"It is clear,\" he goes on, \"that he is speaking of human bodies.\" If this is so, how is it that before the coats of skins, and the disobedience, and the fall from paradise, Adam speaks not in an allegory, but literally, thus: \"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh;\"[fn-18-P1819_443446:1266-nf] or what is the ground of the divine narrative, \"And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman\"[fn-18-P1820_443724:1267-nf] for him? Or what bodies can Adam and Eve have covered with fig-leaves after eating of the forbidden tree?[fn-18-P1821_443865:1268-nf] Who can patiently listen to the perilous arguments of Origen when he denies the resurrection of this flesh, as he most clearly does in his book of explanations of the first psalm and in many other places? Or who can tolerate him when he gives us a paradise in the third heaven, and transfers that which the Scripture mentions from earth to the heavenly places, and when he explains allegorically all the trees which are mentioned in Genesis, saying in effect that the trees are angelic potencies, a sense which the true drift of the passage does not admit? For the divine Scripture has not said, \"God put down Adam and Eve upon the earth,\" but \"He drove them out of the paradise, and made them dwell over against the paradise.\"[fn-18-P1822_444615:1269-nf] He does not say \"under the paradise.\" \"He placed ...cherubims and a flaming sword ...to keep the way of[fn-18-P1823_444743:1270-nf] the tree of life.\"[fn-18-P1824_444782:1271-nf] He says nothing about an ascent to it. \"And a river went out of Eden.\"[fn-18-P1825_444876:1272-nf] He does not say \"went down from Eden.\" \"It was parted and became into four heads.

Thus Pythagoras visited the prophets of Memphis; and Plato, besides visiting Egypt and Archytas of Tarentum, most carefully explored that part of the coast of Italy which was formerly called Great Greece. In this way the influential Athenian master with whose lessons the schools[fn-19-P1997_497357:1397-nf] of the Academy resounded became at once a pilgrim and a pupil choosing modestly to learn what others had to teach rather than over confidently to propound views of his own. Indeed his pursuit of learning-which seemed to fly before him all the world over-finally led to his capture by pirates who sold him into slavery to a cruel tyrant.[fn-19-P1998_497713:1398-nf] Thus he became a prisoner, a bond-man, and a slave; yet, as he was always a philosopher, he was greater still than the man who purchased him. Again we read that certain noblemen journeyed from the most remote parts of Spain and Gaul to visit Titus Livius,[fn-19-P1999_498001:1399-nf] and listen to his eloquence which flowed like a fountain of milk. Thus the fame of an individual had more power to draw men to Rome than the attractions of the city itself; and the age displayed an unheard of and noteworthy portent in the shape of men who, entering the great city, bestowed their attention not upon it but upon something else. Apollonius[fn-20-P2000_498386:1400-nf] too was a traveller-the one I mean who is called the sorcerer[fn-20-P2001_498555:1401-nf] by ordinary people and the philosopher by such as follow Pythagoras. He entered Persia, traversed the Caucasus and made his way through the Albanians, the Scythians, the Massagetae, and the richest districts of India. At last, after crossing that wide river the Pison,[fn-20-P2002_498840:1402-nf] he came to the Brahmans. There he saw Hiarcas[fn-20-P2003_498908:1403-nf] sitting upon his golden throne and drinking from his Tantalus-fountain, and heard him instructing a few disciples upon the nature, motions, and orbits of the heavenly bodies. After this he travelled among the Elamites, the Babylonians, the Chaldeans, the Medes, the Assyrians, the Parthians, the Syrians, the Phenicians, the Arabians, and the Philistines.[fn-20-P2004_499294:1404-nf] Then returning to Alexandria he made his way to Ethiopia to see the gymnosophists and the famous table of the sun spread in the sands of the desert.[fn-20-P2005_499480:1405-nf] Everywhere he found something to learn, and as he was always going to new places, he became constantly wiser and better.

His destruction is thus described in the book of Psalms: \"Thou didst endow the sea with virtue through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters: thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces.\"[fn-28-P2889_765053:2061-nf] For this reason adders and scorpions haunt dry places[fn-28-P2890_765139:2062-nf] and whenever they come near water behave as if rabid or insane.[fn-28-P2891_765228:2063-nf] As wood sweetens Marah so that seventy palm-trees are watered by its streams, so the cross makes the waters of the law lifegiving to the seventy who are Christ's apostles.[fn-28-P2892_765444:2064-nf] It is Abraham and Isaac who dig wells, the Philistines who try to prevent them.[fn-28-P2893_765561:2065-nf] Beersheba too, the city of the oath,[fn-28-P2894_765637:2066-nf] and [Gihon], the scene of Solomon's coronation,[fn-28-P2895_765708:2067-nf] derive their names from springs. It is beside a well that Eliezer finds Rebekah.[fn-28-P2896_765833:2068-nf] Rachel too is a drawer of water and wins a kiss thereby[fn-28-P2897_765928:2069-nf] from the supplanter[fn-28-P2898_765987:2070-nf] Jacob. When the daughters of the priests of Midian are in a strait to reach the well, Moses opens a way for them and delivers them from outrage.[fn-28-P2899_766157:2071-nf] The Lord's forerunner at Salem (a name which means peace or perfection) makes ready the people for Christ with spring-water.[fn-29-P2900_766319:2072-nf] The Saviour Himself does not preach the kingdom of heaven until by His baptismal immersion He has cleansed the Jordan.[fn-29-P2901_766461:2073-nf] Water is the matter of His first miracle[fn-29-P2902_766542:2074-nf] and it is from a well that the Samaritan woman is bidden to slake her thirst.[fn-29-P2903_766699:2075-nf] To Nicodemus He secretly says:-\"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.\"[fn-29-P2904_766857:2076-nf] As His earthly course began with water, so it ended with it. His side is pierced by the spear, and blood and water flow forth, twin emblems of baptism and of martyrdom.[fn-29-P2905_767048:2077-nf] After His resurrection also, when sending His apostles to the Gentiles, He commands them to baptize these in the mystery of the Trinity.[fn-29-P2906_767263:2078-nf] The Jewish people repenting of their misdoing are sent forthwith by Peter to be baptized.[fn-29-P2907_767380:2079-nf] Before Sion travails she brings forth children, and a nation is born at once.[fn-29-P2908_767480:2080-nf] Paul the persecutor of the church, that ravening wolf out of Benjamin,[fn-29-P2909_767588:2081-nf] bows his head before Ananias one of Christ's sheep, and only recovers his sight when he applies the remedy of baptism.[fn-29-P2910_767731:2082-nf] By the reading of the prophet the eunuch of Candace the queen of Ethiopia is made ready for the baptism of Christ.[fn-29-P2911_767901:2083-nf] Though it is against nature the Ethiopian does change his skin and the leopard his spots.[fn-29-P2912_768018:2084-nf] Those who have received only John's baptism and have no knowledge of the Holy Spirit are baptized again, lest any should suppose that water unsanctified thereby could suffice for the salvation of either Jew or Gentile.[fn-29-P2913_768261:2085-nf] \"The voice of the Lord isupon the waters ...The Lord is uponmany waters ...the Lord maketh the flood to inhabit it.\"[fn-29-P2914_768398:2086-nf] His \"teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which came up from the washing; whereof everyone bear twins, and none is barren among them.\"[fn-29-P2915_768625:2087-nf] If none is barren among them, all of them must have udders filled with milk and be able to say with the apostle: \"Ye are my little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you;\"[fn-29-P2916_768853:2088-nf] and \"I have fed you with milk and not with meat.\"[fn-29-P2917_768925:2089-nf] And it is to the grace of baptism that the prophecy of Micah refers: \"He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us: he will subdue our iniquities, and will cast all our sins[fn-29-P2918_769130:2090-nf] into the depths of the sea.\"[fn-29-P2919_769207:2091-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1273","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"12.

Then there arose in men affections common to the brutes which are productive of shame, and which made man ashamed of his own nakedness.[fn-4-P407_354750:70-nf] Then also, by a certain disease which was conceived in men from a suddenly injected and pestilential corruption, it was brought about that they lost that stability of life in which they were created, and, by reason of the mutations which they experienced in the stages of life, issued at last in death. However many were the years they lived in their subsequent life, yet they began to die on the day when they received the law of death, because they kept verging towards old age. For that possesses not even a moment's stability, but glides away without intermission, which by constant change perceptibly advances to an end which does not produce perfection, but utter exhaustion. Thus, then, was fulfilled what God had spoken: \"In the day that ye eat thereof, yeshall surely die.\"[fn-4-P408_355552:71-nf] As a consequence, then, of this disobedience of the flesh and this law of sin and death, whoever is born of the flesh has need of spiritual regeneration-not only that he may reach the kingdom of God, but also that he may be freed from the damnation of sin. Hence men are on the one hand born in the flesh liable to sin and death from the first Adam, and on the other hand are born again in baptism associated with the righteousness and eternal life of the second Adam; even as it is written in the book of Ecclesiasticus: \"Of the woman came the beginning of sin, and through her we all die.\"[fn-4-P409_356162:72-nf] Now whether it be said of the woman or of Adam, both statements pertain to the first man; since (as we know) the woman is of the man, and the two are one flesh.

Let us look at what the Lord said to him in answer to his inquiry; for of course, as He deigns to answer the question, How can these things be? He will in fact tell us how spiritual regeneration can come to a man who springs from carnal generation. After noticing briefly the ignorance of one who assumed a superiority over others as a teacher, and having blamed the unbelief of all such, for not accepting His witness to the truth, He went on to inquire and wonder whether, as He had told them about earthly things and they had not believed they would believe heavenly things. He nevertheless pursues the subject, and gives an answer such as others should believe-though these refuse-to the question that he was asked, How these things can be? \"No man,\" says He, \"hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\"[fn-6-P666_438537:212-nf] Thus, He says, shall come the spiritual birth,-men, from being earthly, shall become heavenly; and this they can only obtain by being made members of me; so that he may ascend who descended, since no one ascends who did not descend. All, therefore, who have to be changed and raised must meet together in a union with Christ, so that the Christ who descended may ascend, reckoning His body (that is to say, His Church) as nothing else than Himself, because it is of Christ and the Church that this is most truly understood: \"And they twain shall be one flesh;\"[fn-6-P667_439119:213-nf] concerning which very subject He expressly said Himself, \"So then they are no more twain, but one flesh.\"[fn-6-P668_439245:214-nf] To ascend, therefore, they would be wholly unable, since 0\"no man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.\"[fn-6-P669_439433:215-nf] For although it was on earth that He was made the Son of man, yet He did not deem it unworthy of that divinity, in which, although remaining in heaven, He came down to earth, to designate it by the name of the Son of man, as He dignified His flesh with the name of Son of God: that they might not be regarded as if they were two Christs,-the one God, the other man,[fn-6-P670_439820:216-nf] -but one and the same God and man,-God, because \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;\"[fn-6-P671_440037:217-nf] and man, inasmuch as \"the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\"[fn-6-P672_440122:218-nf] By this means-by the difference between His divinity and His humiliation-He remained in heaven as Son of God, and as Son of man walked on earth; whilst, by that unity of His person which made His two natures one Christ, He both walked as Son of God on earth, and at the same time as the very Son of man remained in heaven. Faith, therefore, in more credible things arises from thebelief of such things as are more incredible. For if His divine nature, though a far more distant object, and more sublime in its incomparable diversity, had ability so to take upon itself the nature of man on our account as to become one Person, and whilst appearing as Son of man on earth in the weakness of the flesh, was able to remain all the while in heaven in the divinity which partook of the flesh, how much easier for our faith is it to suppose that other men, who are His faithful saints, become one Christ with the Man Christ, so that, when all ascend by His grace and fellowship, the one Christ Himself ascends to heaven who came down from heaven? It is in this sense that the apostle says, \"As we have many members in one body, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so likewise is Christ.\"[fn-6-P673_441345:219-nf] He did not say, \"So also is Christ's\" -meaning Christ's body, or Christ's members-but his words are, \"So likewise is Christ,\" thus calling the head and body one Christ.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":69,"source_paragraph":"206","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Yes, let us consider that darkness of their rational intellect, by reason of which they are even completely ignorant of God, whose sacraments they actually struggle against, while being baptized.

In the first place He was made an unction, and being inseparably present was with the very flesh of the Lord, according to that which is written, \"Upon whom thou shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, the same is\"[fn-15-P1582_391636:349-nf] \"my beloved Son;\"[fn-15-P1583_391740:350-nf] and \"Jesus of Nazareth\" whom \"God anointed with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-15-P1584_391993:351-nf] After this every operation was wrought with the co-operation of the Spirit.

And these no one will gainsay;-no one, at all events, who is even moderately versed in the institutions of the Church. For were we to attempt to reject such customs as have no written authority, on the ground that the importance they possess is small, we should unintentionally injure the Gospel in its very vitals; or, rather, should make our public definition a mere phrase and nothing more.[fn-18-P1859_486470:564-nf] For instance, to take the first and most general example, who is thence who has taught us in writing to sign with the sign of the cross those who have trusted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ? What writing has taught us to turn to the East at the prayer? Which of the saints has left us in writing the words of tim invocation at the displaying[fn-18-P1860_491290:565-nf] of the bread of the Eucharist and the cup of blessing? For we are not, as is well known, content with what the apostle or the Gospel has recorded, but both in preface and conclusion we add other words as being of great importance to the validity of the ministry, and these we derive from unwritten teaching. Moreover we bless the water of baptism andthe oil of the chrism, and besides this the catechumen who is being baptized. On what written authority do we do this? Is not our authority silent and mystical tradition? Nay, by what written word is the anointing of oil[fn-18-P1861_492104:566-nf] itself taught? And whence comes the custom of baptizing thrice?[fn-18-P1862_492340:567-nf] And as to the other customs of baptism from what Scripture do we derive the renunciation of Satan and his angels? Does not this come from that unpublished and secret teaching which oar fathers guarded in a silence out of the reach of curious meddling and inquisitive investigation? Well had they learnt the lesson that the awful dignity of the mysteries is best preserved by silence. What the uninitiated are not even allowed: to look at was hardly likely to be publiclyparaded about in written documents. What was the meaning of the mighty Moses in not making all the parts of the tabernacle open to every one? The profane he stationed without the sacred barriers; the first courts he conceded to the purer; the Levites alone he judged worthy of being servants of the Deity; sacrifices and burnt offerings and the rest of the priestly functions he allotted to the priests; one chosen out of all he admitted to the shrine, and even this one not always but on only one day in the year, and of this one day a time was fixed for his entry so that he might gaze on the Holy of Holies amazed at the strangeness and novelty of the sight. Moses was wise enough to know that contempt stretches to the trite and to the obvious, while a keen interest is naturally associated with the unusual and the unfamiliar. In the same manner the Apostles and Fathers who laid down laws for the Church from the beginning thus guarded the awful dignity of the mysteries in secrecy and silence, for what is bruited abroad random among the common folk is no mystery at all. This is the reason for our tradition of unwritten precepts and practices, that the knowledge of our dogmas may not become neglected and contemned by the multitude through familiarity. \"Dogma\" and \"Kerugma\" are two distinct things; the former is observed in silence; the latter is proclaimed to all the world. One form of this silence is the obscurity employed in Scripture, which makes the meaning of \"dogmas\" difficult to be understood for the very advantage of the reader: Thus we all look to the East[fn-18-P1863_496971:568-nf] at our prayers, but few of us know that we are seeking our own old country,[fn-18-P1864_497282:569-nf] Paradise, which God planted in Eden in the East.[fn-18-P1865_497529:570-nf] We pray standing,[fn-18-P1866_497603:571-nf] on the first day of the week, but we do not all know the reason. On the day of the resurrection (or \"standing again\" Grk. a0na/stasij we remind ourselves of the grace given to us by standing at prayer, not only because we rose with Christ,[fn-18-P1867_497868:572-nf] and are bound to \"seek those things which are above,\"[fn-18-P1868_497941:573-nf] but because the day seems to us to be in some sense an image of the age which we expect, wherefore, though it is the beginning of days, it is not called by Moses first, but one.[fn-18-P1869_498455:574-nf] For he says \"There was evening, and therewas morning, one day,\" as though the same day often recurred. Now \"one and \"eighth\" are the same, in itself distinctly indicating that really \"one\" and \"eighth\" of which the Psalmist makes mention in certain titles of the Psalms, the state which follows after this present time, the day which knows no waning or eventide, and no successor, that age which endeth not or groweth old.[fn-18-P1870_498922:575-nf] Of necessity, then, the church teaches her own foster children to offer their prayers on that day standing, to the end that through continual reminder of the endless life we may not neglect to make provision for our removal thither. Moreover all Pentecost is a reminder of the resurrection expected in the age to come. For that one and first day, if seven times multiplied by seven, completes the seven weeks of the holy Pentecost; for, beginning at the first, Pentecost ends with the same, making fifty revolutions through the like intervening days. And so it is a likeness of eternity, beginning as it does and ending, as in a circling course, at the same point. On this day the rules of the church have educated us to prefer the upright attitude of prayer, for by their plain reminder they, as It were, make our mind to dwell no longer in the present but in the future. Moreover every time we fall upon our knees and rise from off them we shew by the very deed that by our sin we fell down to earth, and by the loving kindness of our Creator were called hack to heaven.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":2,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_15_v_on_exhortation_to_chastity_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"ANF-04","text":"For the laying down[fn-9-P984_244879:21-nf] of the law of once marrying, the very origin of the human race is our authority; witnessing as it emphatically does what God constituted in the beginning for a type to be examined with care by posterity.

The Lord had threatened that, on the day they ate the forbidden fruit, they should surely die.[fn-9-P974_537628:144-nf] Now, inasmuch as they had received the permission of using for food every tree that grew in Paradise, among which God had planted the tree of life, but had been forbidden to partake of one only tree, which He called the tree of knowledge of good and evil, to signify by this name the consequence of their discovering whether what good they would experience if they kept the prohibition, or what evil if they transgressed it: they are no doubt rightly considered to have abstained from the forbidden food previous to the malignant persuasion of the devil, and to have used all which had been allowed them, and therefore, among all the others, and before all the others, the tree of life. For what could be more absurd than to suppose that they partook of the fruit of other trees, but not of that which had been equally with others granted to them, and which, by its especial virtue, prevented even their animal bodies from undergoing change through the decay of age, and from aging into death, applying this benefit from its own body to the man's body, and in a mystery demonstrating what is conferred by wisdom (which it symbolized) on the rational soul, even that, quickened by its fruit, it should not be changed into the decay and death of iniquity? For of her it is rightly said, \"She is a tree of life to them that lay hold of her.\"[fn-9-P975_538987:145-nf] Just as the one tree was for the bodilyParadise, the other is for the spiritual; the oneaffording a vigour to the senses of the outward man, the other to those of the inner man, such as will abide without any change for the worse through time. They therefore served God, since that dutiful obedience was committed to them, by which alone God can be worshipped. And it was not possible more suitably to intimate the inherent importance of obedience, or its sole sufficiency securely to keep the rational creature under the Creator, than by forbidding a tree which was not in itself evil. For God forbid that the Creator of good things, who made all things, \"and behold they were very good,\"[fn-9-P976_539699:146-nf] should plant anything evil amidst the fertility of even that material Paradise. Still, however, in order that he might show man, to whom submission to such a Master would be very useful, how much good belonged simply to obedience (and this was all that He had demanded of His servant, and this would be of advantage not so much for the lordship of the Master as for the profit of the servant), they were forbidden the use of a tree, which, if it had not been for the prohibition, they might have used without suffering any evil result whatever; and from this circumstance it may be clearly understood, that whatever evil they brought on themselves because they made use of it in spite of the prohibition, the tree did not produce from any noxious or pernicious quality in its fruit, but entirely on account of their violated obedience.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_10_book_v_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"190","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"\"Therefore also they disagree among themselves, maintaining an inconsistent opinion.[fn-30-P3099_1434693:196-nf] For Apelles,[fn-31-P3100_1436093:197-nf] one of the herd, priding himself on his manner of life[fn-31-P3101_1438041:198-nf] and his age, acknowledges one principle,[fn-31-P3102_1438367:199-nf] but says that the prophecies[fn-31-P3103_1440246:200-nf] are from an opposing spirit, being led to this view by the responses of a maiden by name Philumene,[fn-31-P3104_1441206:201-nf] who was possessed by a demon.","title":"Book V.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_10_book_v_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"190","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"\"Therefore also they disagree among themselves, maintaining an inconsistent opinion.[fn-30-P3099_1434693:196-nf] For Apelles,[fn-31-P3100_1436093:197-nf] one of the herd, priding himself on his manner of life[fn-31-P3101_1438041:198-nf] and his age, acknowledges one principle,[fn-31-P3102_1438367:199-nf] but says that the prophecies[fn-31-P3103_1440246:200-nf] are from an opposing spirit, being led to this view by the responses of a maiden by name Philumene,[fn-31-P3104_1441206:201-nf] who was possessed by a demon.","title":"Book V.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_10_book_v_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"199","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"9 But this Apelles wrote many things, an impious manner, of the law of Moses, blaspheming the divine words in many of his works, being, as it seemed, very zealous for their refutation and overthrow?[fn-31-P3131_1452220:219-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_17_vi_on_monogamy_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-04","text":"So far as regards the non-destruction of the will of God, and the restruction of the law of \"the beginning.\" But another reason, too, conspires; nay, not another, but (one)which imposed the law of \"the beginning,\" and moved the will of God to prohibit divorce: the fact that (he)who shall have dismissed his wife, except on the ground of adultery, makes her commit adultery; and (he) who shall have married a (woman) dismissed by her husband, of course commits adultery.[fn-11-P1183_310098:78-nf] A divorced woman cannot even marry legitimately; and if she commit any such act without the name of marriage, does it not fall under the category of adultery, in that adultery is crime in the way of marriage? Such is God's verdict, within straiter limits than men's, that universally, whether through marriage or promiscuously, the admission of a second man (to intercourse) is pronounced adultery by Him. For let us see what marriage is in the eye of God; and thus we shall learn what adultery equally is. Marriage is (this): when God joins \"two into one flesh; \"or else, finding (them already) joined in the same flesh, has given His seal to the conjunction. Adultery is (this): when, the two having been-in whatsoever way-disjoined, other-nay, rather alien-flesh is mingled (with either): flesh concerning which it cannot be affirmed, \"This is flesh out of my flesh, and this bone out of my bones.\"[fn-11-P1184_311022:79-nf] For this, once for all done and pronounced, as from the beginning, so now too, cannot apply to \"other\" flesh. Accordingly, it will be without cause that you will say that God wills not a divorced woman to be joined to another man \"while her husband liveth,\" as if He do will it \"when he is dead; \"[fn-11-P1185_311363:80-nf] whereas if she is not bound to him when dead, no more is she when living. \"Alike when divorce dissevers marriage as when death does, she will not be bound to him by whom the binding medium has been broken off.\" To whom, then, will she be bound? In the eye of God, it matters nought whether she marry during her life or after his death. For it is not against him that she sins, but against herself. \"Any sin which a man may have committed is external to the body; but ] (he) who commits adultery sins against his own body.\" But-as we have previously laid down above-whoever shall intermingle with himself \"other\" flesh, over and above that pristine flesh which God either conjoined into two or else found (already) conjoined, commits adultery. And the reason why He has abolished divorce, which \"was not from the beginning,\" is, thatHe may strengthen that which \"was from the beginning\"-the permanent conjunction, (namely), of \"two into one flesh: \"for fear that necessity or opportunity for a third union of flesh may make an irruption (into His dominion); permitting divorce to no cause but one-if, (that is), the (evil) against which precaution is taken chance to have occurred beforehand. So true, moreover, is it that divorce \"was not from the beginning,\" that among the Romans it is not till after the six hundredth year from the building of the city that this kind of \"hard-heartedness\"[fn-11-P1186_312782:81-nf] is set down as having been committed. But they indulge in promiscuous adulteries, even without divorcing (their partners): to us, even if we do divorce them, even marriage will not be lawful.","title":"VI.

First of all, he says, God declares that[fn-61-P6158_1846979:20-nf] \"therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\" And lest we should say that this is a quotation from the Old Testament, he asserts that it has been[fn-61-P6159_1847215:21-nf] confirmed by the Lord in the Gospel-\"What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder\": and he immediately adds,[fn-61-P6160_1847353:22-nf] \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\" He next repeats the names of Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah, and tells us that they all had wives and in accordance with the will of God begot sons, as though there could be any table of descent or any history of mankind without wives and children. \"There,\" says he, \"is Enoch, who walked with God and was carried up to heaven. There is Noah, the only person who, except his wife, and his sons and their wives, was saved at the deluge, although there must have been many persons not of marriageable age, and therefore presumably virgins. Again, after the deluge, when the human race started as it were anew, men and women were paired together and a fresh blessing was pronounced on procreation, [fn-61-P6161_1848172:23-nf] \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\" Moreover, free permission was given to eat flesh,[fn-61-P6162_1848293:24-nf] \"Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.\" He then flies off to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom the first had three wives, the second one, the third four, Leah, Rachel, Billah, and Zilpah, and he declares that Abraham by his faith merited the blessing which he received in begetting his son. Sarah, typifying the Church, when it had ceased to be with her after the manner of women, exchanged the curse of barrenness for the blessing of child-bearing. We are informed that Rebekah went like a prophet to inquire of the Lord, and was told,[fn-61-P6163_1848904:25-nf] \"Two nations and two peoples are in thy womb.\" that Jacob served for his wife, and that when Rachel, thinking it was in the power of her husband to give her children, said,[fn-61-P6164_1849096:26-nf] \"Give me children, or else I die,\" he replied,[fn-61-P6165_1849161:27-nf] \"Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\" so well aware was he that the fruit of marriage cometh from the Lord and not from the husband. We next learn that Joseph, a holy man of spotless chastity, and all the patriarchs, had wives, and that God blessed them all alike through the lips of Moses. Judah also and Thamar are brought upon the scene, and he censures Onan, slain by the Lord, because he, grudging to raise up seed to his brother, marred the marriage rite. He refers to Moses and the leprosy of Miriam, who, because she chided her brother on account of his wife, was stricken by the avenging hand of God. He praises Samson, I may even say extravagantly panegyrizes the uxorious Nazarite. Deborah also and Barak are mentioned, because, although they had not the benefit of virginity, they were victorious over the iron chariots of Sisera and Jabin. He brings forward Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, and extols her for arming herself with the[fn-61-P6166_1850165:28-nf] stake. He says there was no difference between Jephthah and his virgin daughter, who was sacrificed to the Lord: nay, of the two, he prefers the faith of the father to that of the daughter who met death with grief and tears. He then comes to Samuel, another Nazarite of the Lord, who from infancy was brought up in the tabernacle and was clad in a linen ephod, or, as the words are rendered, in linen vestments: he, too, we are told, begot sons without a stain upon his priestly purity. He places Boaz and his wife Ruth side by side in his repository, and traces the descent of Jesse and David from them. He then points out how David himself, for the price of two hundred foreskins and at the peril of his life, was bedded with the king's daughter. What shall I say of Solomon, whom he includes in the list of husbands, and represents as a type of the Saviour, maintaining that of him it was written,[fn-61-P6167_1851098:29-nf] \"Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son\"? And[fn-61-P6168_1851202:30-nf] \"To him shall be given of the gold of Sheba, and men shall pray for him continually.\" Then all at once he makes a jump to Elijah and Elisha, and tells us as a great secret that the spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha. Why he mentioned this he does not say. It can hardly be that he thinks Elijah and Elisha, like the rest, were married men. The next step is to Hezekiah, upon whose praises he dwells, and yet (I wonder why) forgets to mention that he said,[fn-61-P6169_1851677:31-nf] \"Henceforth I will beget children.\" He relates that Josiah, a righteous man, in whose time the book of Deuteronomy was found in the temple, was instructed by Huldah, wife of Shallum. Daniel also and the three youths are classed by him with the married. Suddenly he betakes himself to the Gospel, and adduces Zachariah and Elizabeth, Peter and his father-in-law, and the rest of the Apostles. His inference is thus expressed: \"If they idly urge in defence of themselves the plea that the world in its early stage needed to be replenished, let them listen to the words of Paul,[fn-61-P6170_1852281:32-nf] `I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children.' And[fn-61-P6171_1852371:33-nf] `Marriage is honourable and the bed undefiled.' And[fn-61-P6172_1852463:34-nf] `A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.' And[fn-61-P6173_1852636:35-nf] `Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: but she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.' Surely we shall hear no more of the famous Apostolic utterance,[fn-61-P6174_1852925:36-nf] `And they who have wives as though they had them not.' It can hardly be that you will say the reason why he wished them to be married was that some widows had already turned back after Satan: as though virgins never fell and their fall was not more ruinous. All this makes it clear that in forbidding to marry, and to eat food which God created for use, you have consciences seared as with a hot iron, and are followers of the Manichaeans.\" Then comes much more which it would be unprofitable to discuss. At last he dashes into rhetoric and apostrophizes virginity thus: \"I do you no wrong, Virgin: you have chosen a life of chastity on account of the present distress: you determined on the course in order to be holy in body and spirit: be not proud: you and your married sisters are members of the same Church.\"","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_12_book_vii_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"144","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"7 And what other water could purify the water which purifies everything?

For unless He had given it to all by no means would He have habitually permitted even proselytes out of the nations to have access to it. But-as is congruous with the goodness of God, and with His equity, as the Fashioner of mankind-He gave to all nations the selfsame law, which at definite and stated times He enjoined should be observed, when He willed, and through whom He willed, and as He willed. For in the beginning of the world He gave to Adam himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of the tree planted in the midst of paradise; but that, if they did contrariwise, by death they were to die.[fn-20-P2047_698574:16-nf] Which law had continued enough for them, had it been kept. For in this law given to Adam we recognise in embryo[fn-20-P2048_698720:17-nf] all the precepts which afterwards sprouted forth when given through Moses; that is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart and out of thy whole soul; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;[fn-20-P2049_698941:18-nf] Thou shalt not kill; Thou shall not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; False witness thou shall not utter; Honour thy father and mother; and, That which is another's, shall thou not covet. For the primordial law was given to Adam and Eve in paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of God. In short, if they had loved the Lord their God, they would not have contravened His precept; if they had habitually loved their neighbour-that is, themselves[fn-20-P2050_699548:19-nf] -they would not have believed the persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed murder upon themselves,[fn-20-P2051_699698:20-nf] by falling[fn-20-P2052_699740:21-nf] from immortality, by contravening God's precept; from theft also they would have abstained, if they had not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had been anxious to skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their God; nor would they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating devil, by believing him that they would be \"like God; \"and thus they would not have offended God either, as their Father, who had fashioned them from clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if they had not coveted another's, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit. Therefore, in this general and primordial law of God, the observance of which, in the case of the tree's fruit, He had sanctioned, we recognise enclosed all the precepts specially of the posterior Law, which germinated when disclosed at their proper times. For the subsequent superinduction of a law is the work of the same Being who had before premised a precept; since it is His province withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to form, righteous creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it? if He advances who begins? In short, before the Law of Moses,[fn-20-P2053_701005:22-nf] written in stone-tables, I contend that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood naturally, and by the fathers was habitually kept. For whence was Noah \"found righteous,\"[fn-20-P2054_701248:23-nf] if in his case the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was Abraham accounted \"a friend of God,\"[fn-20-P2055_701408:24-nf] if not on the ground of equity and righteousness, (in the observance) of a natural law? Whence was Melchizedek named \"priest of the most high God,\"[fn-20-P2056_701591:25-nf] if, before the priesthood of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer sacrifices to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from Egypt, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years. In fact, it was after Abraham's \"four hundred and thirty years\"[fn-20-P2057_702033:26-nf] that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses' Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as \"the law was given through Moses\"[fn-20-P2058_702739:27-nf] at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered \"friends of God.\" For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges? At all events, in settling him in paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise. Therefore, since God originated Adam uncircumcised, and inobservant of the Sabbath, consequently his offspring also, Abel, offering Him sacrifices, uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was by Him commended; while He accepted[fn-20-P2059_703780:28-nf] what he was offering in simplicity of heart, and reprobated the sacrifice of his brother Cain, who was not rightly dividing what he was offering.[fn-20-P2060_703955:29-nf] Noah also, uncircumcised-yes, and inobservant of the Sabbath-God freed from the deluge.[fn-20-P2061_704104:30-nf] For Enoch, too, most righteous man, uncircumcised and in-observant of the Sabbath, He translated from this world;[fn-20-P2062_704259:31-nf] who did not first taste[fn-20-P2063_704320:32-nf] death, in order that, being a candidate for eternal life,[fn-20-P2064_704418:33-nf] he might by this time show us that we also may, without the burden of the law of Moses, please God. Melchizedek also, \"the priest of the most high God,\" uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was chosen to the priesthood of God.[fn-20-P2065_704730:34-nf] Lot, withal, the brother[fn-20-P2066_704771:35-nf] of Abraham, proves that it was for the merits of righteousness, without observance of the law, that he was freed from the conflagration of the Sodomites.[fn-20-P2067_704969:36-nf] ","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_10_homily_ii_the_earth_was_invisible_and_unfinished_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Such is the idea that they make for themselves of the divine work.

Accordingly they do not seem to me to advance a probable opinion, who lay it down that a trinity of the image of God in three persons, so far as regards human nature, can so be discovered as to be completed in the marriage of male and female and in their offspring; in that the man himself, as it were, indicates the person of the Father, but that which has so proceeded from him as to be born, that of the Son; and so the third person as of the Spirit, is, they say, the woman, who has so proceeded from the man as not herself to be either son or daughter,[fn-15-P1516_741983:3-nf] although it was by her conception that the offspring was born. For the Lord hath said of the Holy Spirit that He proceedeth from the Father,[fn-15-P1517_742140:4-nf] and yet he is not a son. In this erroneous opinion, then, the only point probably alleged, and indeed sufficiently shown according to the faith of the Holy Scripture, is this,-in the account of the original creation of the woman,-that what so comes into existence from some person as to make another person, cannot in every case be called a son; since the person of the woman came into existence from the person of the man, and yet she is not called his daughter. All the rest of this opinion is in truth so absurd, nay indeed so false, that it is most easy to refute it. For I pass over such a thing, as to think the Holy Spirit to be the mother of the Son of God, and the wife of the Father; since perhaps it may be answered that these things offend us in carnal things, because we think of bodily conceptions and births. Although these very things themselves are most chastely thought of by the pure, to whom all things are pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, of whom both the mind and conscience are polluted, nothing is pure;[fn-15-P1518_743194:5-nf] so that even Christ, born of a virgin according to the flesh, is a stumbling-block to some of them. But yet in the case of those supreme spiritual things, after the likeness of which those kinds of the inferior creature also are made although most remotely, and where there is nothing that can be injured and nothing corruptible, nothing born in time, nothing formed from that which is formless, or whatever like expressions there may be; yet they ought not to disturb the sober prudence of any one, lest in avoiding empty disgust he run into pernicious error. Let him accustom himself so to find in corporeal things the traces of things spiritual, that when he begins to ascend upwards from thence, under the guidance of reason,in order to attain to the unchangeable truth itself through which these things were made, he may not draw with himself to things above what he despises in things below. For no one ever blushed to choose for himself wisdom as a wife, because the name of wife puts into a man's thoughts the corruptible connection which consists in begetting children; or because in truth wisdom itself is a woman in sex, since it is expressed in both Greek and Latin tongues by a word of the feminine gender.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_18_book_xii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"8. And since the case stands thus, if we are to accept the same image of the Trinity, as not in one, but in three human beings, father and mother and son, then the man was not made after the image of God before a wife was made for him, and before they procreated a son; because there was not yet a trinity. Will any one say there was already a trinity, because, although not yet in their proper form, yet in their original nature, both the woman was already in the side of the man, and the son in the loins of his father? Why then, when Scripture had said, \"God made man after the image of God,\" did it go on to say, \"God created him; male and female created He them: and God blessed them\"?[fn-15-P1529_749809:11-nf] (Or if it is to be so divided, \"And God created man,\" so that thereupon is to be added, \"in the image of God created He him,\" and then subjoined in the third place, \"male and female created He them;\" for some have feared to say, He made him male and female, lest something monstrous, as it were; should be understood, as are those whom they call hermaphrodites, although even so both might be understood not falsely in the singular number, on account of that which is said, \"Two in one flesh.\") Why then, as I began by saying, in regard to the nature of man made after the image of God, does Scripture specify nothing except male and female? Certainly, in order to complete the image of the Trinity, it ought to have added also son, although still placed in the loins of his father, as the woman was in his side. Or was it perhaps that the woman also had been already made, and that Scripture had combined in a short and comprehensive statement, that of which it was going to explain afterwards more carefully, how it was done; and that therefore a son could not be mentioned, because no son was yet born? As if the Holy Spirit could not have comprehended this, too, in that brief statement, while about to narrate the birth of the son afterwards in its own place; as it narrated afterwards in its own place, that the woman was taken from the side of the man,[fn-15-P1530_751190:12-nf] and yet has not omitted here to name her.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_18_book_xii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"20. Nor does it escape me, that some who before us were eminent defenders of the Catholic faith and expounders of the word of God, while they looked for these two things in one human being, whose entire soul they perceived to be a sort of excellent paradise, asserted that the man was the mind, but that the woman was the bodily sense. And according to this distribution, by which the man is assumed to be the mind, but the woman the bodily sense, all things seem aptly to agree together if they are handled with due attention: unless that it is written, that in all the beasts and flying things there was not found for man an helpmate like to himself; and then the woman was made out of his side[fn-15-P1581_772968:37-nf] And on this account I, for my part, have not thought that the bodily sense should be taken for the woman, which we see to be common to ourselves and to the beasts; but I have desired to find something which the beasts had not; and I have rather thought the bodily sense should be understood to be the serpent, whom we read to have been more subtle than all beasts of the field.[fn-15-P1582_773367:38-nf] For in those natural good things which we see are common to ourselves and to the irrational animals, the sense excels by a kind of living power; not the sense of which it is written in the epistle addressed to the Hebrews, where we read, that \"strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil;\"[fn-15-P1583_773774:39-nf] for these \"senses\" belong to the rational nature and pertain to the understanding; but that sense which is divided into five parts in the body, through which corporeal species and motion is perceived not only by ourselves, but also by the beasts.21.

Their object in such a malignant perversion of the true doctrine, is to show that the less exalted statements, which our Lord utters in tits humanity, are to be thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show their blasphemy to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual acknowledgment of the Lord. For this reason it is that Eunomius says, \"He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man made up of soul and body.\" But, after searching through all the inspired and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came \"to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-12-P1204_656584:193-nf] .\" Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster of our nature bad its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was twofold, death correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the deprivation of the twofold life that operates in him who is thus mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body into its kindred elements: but \"the soul that sinneth,\" he saith, \"it shall die[fn-12-P1205_657543:194-nf] .\" Now sin is nothing else than alienation from God, Who is the true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived many hundred years after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, \"In the day that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die[fn-12-P1206_657814:195-nf] .\" For by the fact of his alienation from the true life, the sentence of death was ratified against him that self-same day: and after this, at a much later time, there followed also the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this cause that He might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries home on His shoulders the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may make the man of God complete, united to the deity in body and in soul. And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now the soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the result of being ill-advised: and this He sanctifies by union with Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy along with the first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the destruction of the enemies of the Lord, said, \"They are dead which sought the young Child's life[fn-12-P1207_658887:196-nf] ,\" (or \"soul\"): and the Lord says to the Jews, \"Ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth[fn-12-P1208_659073:197-nf] .\" Now by \"Man\" is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is composed of both, soul and body. And again, He says to them, \"Are ye angry at Me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day[fn-12-P1209_659388:198-nf] ?\" And what He meant by \"every whit whole,\" He showed in the other Gospels, when He said to the man who was let down on a couch in the midst, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee,\" which is a healing of the soul, and, \"Arise and walk[fn-12-P1210_659636:199-nf] ,\" which has regard to the body: and in the Gospel of S. John, by liberating the soul also from its own malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, \"Thou art made whole, sin no more[fn-12-P1211_659932:200-nf] ,\" thou, that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul and in body. For so too does S. Paul speak, \"for to make in Himself of twain one new man[fn-12-P1212_660105:201-nf] .\" And so too He foretells that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul from His body, saying, \"No man taketh\" my soul \"from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again[fn-12-P1213_660370:202-nf] .\" Yea, the prophet David also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with foresight of Him, \"Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption[fn-12-P1214_660678:203-nf] ,\" while the Apostle Peter thus expounds the saying, that \"His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption.\" For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh and in the flesh and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at all times what It was by nature, and so continuing for ever. But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter said, \"This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ[fn-12-P1215_661720:204-nf] ;\" and we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them through His body. But it would be superfluous to encumber our argument by entering into every detail.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_21_viii_on_fasting_in_opposition_to_the_psychics_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Adam had received from God the law of not tasting \"of the tree of recognition of good and evil,\" with the doom of death to ensue upon tasting.[fn-17-P1729_506282:18-nf] However, even (Adam) himself at that time, reverting to the condition of a Psychic after the spiritual ecstasy in which he had prophetically interpreted that \"great sacrament\"[fn-17-P1730_506484:19-nf] with reference to Christ and the Church, and no longer being \"capable of the things which were the Spirit's,\"[fn-17-P1731_506638:20-nf] yielded more readily to his belly than to God, heeded the meat rather than the mandate, and sold salvation for his gullet!

He ate, in short, and perished; saved (as he would) else (have been), if he had preferred to fast from one little tree: so that, even from this early date, animal faith may recognise its own seed, deducing from thence onward its appetite for carnalities and rejection of spiritualities. I hold, therefore, that from the very beginning the murderous gullet was to be punished with the torments and penalties of hunger. Even if God had enjoined no preceptive fasts, still, by pointing out the source whence Adam was slain, He who had demonstrated the offence had left to; my intelligence the remedies for the offence. Unbidden, I would, in such ways and at such times as I might have been able, have habitually accounted food as poison, and taken the antidote, hunger; through which to purge the primordial cause of death-a cause transmitted to me also, concurrently with my very generation; certain that God willed that whereof He nilled the contrary, and confident enough that the care of continence will be pleasing to Him by whom I should have understood that the crime of incontinence had been condemned. Further: since He Himself both commands fasting, and calls \"a soul[fn-17-P1732_507961:21-nf] wholly shattered \"-properly, of course, by straits of diet-\" a sacrifice; \"who will any longer doubt that of all dietary macerations the rationale has been this, that by a renewed interdiction of food and observation of precept the primordial sin might now be expiated, in order that man may make God satisfaction through the self-same causative material through which he had offended, that is, through interdiction of food; and thus, in emulous wise, hunger might rekindle, just as satiety had extinguished, salvation, contemning for the sake of one unlawful more lawful (gratifications)?","title":"VIII.

For its own will was the originator of its evil, as God was the originator of its motions towards good, both in making it when it was not, and in remaking it when it had fallen and perished. But though we suppose that God meant only this death, and that the words, \"In the day ye eat of it ye shall die the death,\" should be understood as meaning, \"In the day ye desert me in disobedience, I will desert you in justice,\" yet assuredly in this death the other deaths also were threatened, which were its inevitable consequence. For in the first stirring of the disobedient motion which was felt in the flesh of the disobedient soul, and which caused our first parents to cover their shame, one death indeed is experienced, that, namely, which occurs when God forsakes the soul. (This was intimated by the words He uttered, when the man, stupefied by fear, had hid himself, \"Adam, where art thou?\"[fn-21-P2189_1249528:19-nf] -words which He used not in ignorance of inquiry, but warning him to consider where he was, since God was not with him.) But when the soul itself forsook the body, corrupted and decayed with age, the other death was experienced of which God had spoken in pronouncing man's sentence, \"Earth thou art, and unto earth shall thou return.\"[fn-21-P2190_1249881:20-nf] And of these two deaths that first death of the whole man is composed. And this first death is finally followed by the second, unless man be freed by grace. For the body would not return to the earth from which it was made, save only by the death proper to itself, which occurs when it is forsaken of the soul, its life. And therefore it is agreed among all Christians who truthfully hold the catholic faith, that we are subject to the death of the body, not by the law of nature, by which God ordained no death for man, but by His righteous infliction on account of sin; for God, taking vengeance on sin, said to the man, in whom we all then were, \"Dust thou art, and unto dust shall thou return.\"","title":"Book XIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Would to God that no \"heresies had been ever necessary, in order that they which are; approved may be made manifest!\"[fn-25-P2590_855153:19-nf] We should then be never required to try our strength in contests about the soul with philosophers, those patriarchs of heretics, as they may be fairly called.[fn-25-P2591_855331:20-nf] The apostle, so far back as his own time, foresaw, indeed, that philosophy would do violent injury to the truth.[fn-25-P2592_855492:21-nf] This admonition about false philosophy he was induced to offer after he had been at Athens, had become acquainted with that loquacious city,[fn-25-P2593_855650:22-nf] and had there had a taste of its huckstering wiseacres and talkers. In like manner is the treatment of the soul according to the sophistical doctrines of men which \"mix their wine with water.\"[fn-25-P2594_855891:23-nf] Some of them deny the immortality of the soul; others affirm that it is immortal, and something more. Some raise disputes about its substance; others about its form; others, again, respecting each of its several faculties. One school of philosophers derives its state from various sources, while another ascribes its departure to different destinations. The various schools reflect the character of their masters, according as they have received their impressions from the dignity[fn-25-P2595_856389:24-nf] of Plato, or the vigour[fn-25-P2596_856425:25-nf] of Zeno, or the equanimity[fn-25-P2597_856517:26-nf] of Aristotle, or the stupidity[fn-25-P2598_856560:27-nf] of Epicurus, or the sadness[fn-25-P2599_856601:28-nf] of Heraclitus, or the madness[fn-26-P2600_856644:29-nf] of Empedocles. The fault, I suppose, of the divine doctrine lies in its springing from Judµa[fn-26-P2601_856749:30-nf] rather than from Greece. Christ made a mistake, too, in sending forth fishermen to preach, rather than the sophist. Whatever noxious vapours, accordingly, exhaled from philosophy, obscure the clear and wholesome atmosphere of truth, it will be for Christians to clear away, both by shattering to pieces the arguments which are drawn from the principles of things-I mean those of the philosophers-and by opposing to them the maxims of heavenly wisdom-that is, such as are revealed by the Lord; in order that both the pitfalls wherewith philosophy captivates the heathen may be removed, and the means employed by heresy to shake the faith of Christians may be repressed. We have already decided one point in our controversy with Hermogenes, as we said at the beginning of this treatise, when we claimed the soul to be formed by the breathing[fn-26-P2602_857606:31-nf] of God, and not out of matter. We relied even there on the clear direction of the inspired statement which informs us how that \"the Lord God breathed on man's face the breath of life, so that man became a living soul\"[fn-26-P2603_857836:32-nf] -by that inspiration of God, of course. On this point, therefore, nothing further need be investigated or advanced by us. It has its own treatise,[fn-26-P2604_858000:33-nf] and its own heretic. I shall regard it as my introduction to the other branches of the subject.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But the nature of my present inquiry obliges me to call the soul spirit or breath, because to breathe is ascribed to another substance. We, however, claim this (operation) for the soul, which we acknowledge to be an indivisible simple substance, and therefore we must call it spirit in a definitive sense-not because of its condition, but of its action; not in respect of its nature, but of its operation; because it respires, and not because it is spirit in any especial sense.[fn-26-P2671_891545:73-nf] For to blow or breathe is to respire. So that we are driven to describe, by (the term which indicates this respiration-that is to say) spirit-the soul which we hold to be, by the propriety of its action, breath. Moreover, we properly and especially insist on calling it breath (or spirit), in opposition to Hermogenes, who derives the soul from matter instead of from the afflatus or breath of God. He, to be sure, goes flatly against the testimony of Scripture, and with this view converts breath into spirit, because he cannot believe that the (creature on which was breathed the) Spirit of God fell into sin, and then into condemnation; and therefore he would conclude that the soul came from matter rather than from the Spirit or breath of God. For this reason, we on our side even from that passage, maintain the soul to be breath and not the spirit, in the scriptural and distinctive sense of the spirit; and here it is with regret that we apply the term spirit at all in the lower sense, in consequence of the identical action of respiring and breathing. In that passage, the only question is about the natural substance; to respire being an act of nature. I would not tarry a moment longer on this point, were it not for those heretics who introduce into the soul some spiritual germ which passes my comprehension: (they make it to have been) conferred upon the soul by the secret liberality of her mother Sophia (Wisdom), without the knowledge of the Creator.[fn-26-P2672_893054:74-nf] But (Holy) Scripture, which has a better knowledge of the soul's Maker, or rather God, has told us nothing more than that God breathed on man's face the breath of life, and that man became a living soul, by means of which he was both to live and breathe; at the same time making a sufficiently clear distinction between the spirit and the soul,[fn-26-P2673_893449:75-nf] in such passages as the following, wherein God Himself declares: \"My Spirit went forth from me, and I made the breath of each. And the breath of my Spirit became soul.\"[fn-26-P2674_893725:76-nf] And again: \"He giveth breath unto the people that are on the earth, and Spirit to them that walk thereon.\"[fn-26-P2675_893876:77-nf] First of all there comes the (natural) soul, that is to say, the breath, to the people that are on the earth,-in other words, to those who act carnally in the flesh; then afterwards comes the Spirit to those who walk thereon,-that is, who subdue the works of the flesh; because the apostle also says, that \"that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, (or in possession of the natural soul, ) and afterward that which is spiritual.\"[fn-26-P2676_894348:78-nf] For, inasmuch as Adam straightway predicted that \"great mystery of Christ and the church,\"[fn-26-P2677_894459:79-nf] when he said, \"This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they two shall become one flesh,\"[fn-26-P2678_894673:80-nf] he experienced the influence of the Spirit. For there fell upon him that ecstasy, which is the Holy Ghost's operative virtue of prophecy. And even the evil spirit too is an influence which comes upon a man. Indeed, the Spirit of God not more really \"turned Saul into another man,\"[fn-26-P2679_894976:81-nf] that is to say, into a prophet, when \"people said one to another, What is this which is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? \"[fn-26-P2680_895142:82-nf] than did the evil spirit afterwards turn him into another man-in other words, into an apostate. Judas likewise was for a long time reckoned among the elect (apostles), and was even appointed to the office of their treasurer; he was not yet the traitor, although he was become fraudulent; but afterwards the devil entered into him. Consequently, as the spirit neither of God nor of the devil is naturally planted with a man's soul at his birth, this soul must evidently exist apart and alone, previous to the accession to it of either spirit: if thus apart and alone, it must also be simple and un-compounded as regards its substance; and therefore it cannot respire from any other cause than from the actual condition of its own substance.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now, if the soul possessed this uniform and simple nature from the beginning in Adam, previous to so many mental dispositions (being developed out of it), it is not rendered multiform by suck various development, nor by the triple[fn-27-P2795_947098:164-nf] form predicated of it in \"the Valentinian trinity\" (that we may still keep the condemnation of that heresy in view), for not even this nature is discoverable in Adam. What had he that was spiritual? Is it because he prophetically declared \"the great mystery of Christ and the church? \"[fn-27-P2796_947493:165-nf] \"This is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman. Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and he shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.\"[fn-27-P2797_947708:166-nf] But this (gift of prophecy) only came on him afterwards, when God infused into him the ecstasy, or spiritual quality, in which prophecy consists. If, again, the evil of sin was developed in him, this must not be accounted as a natural disposition: it was rather produced by the instigation of the (old) serpent as far from being incidental to his nature as it was from being material in him, for we have already excluded belief in \"Matter.\"[fn-27-P2798_948173:167-nf] Now, if neither the spiritual element, nor what the heretics call the material element, was properly inherent in him (since, if he had been created out of matter, the germ of evil must have been an integral part of his constitution), it remains that the one only original element of his nature was what is called the animal (the principle of vitality, the soul), which we maintain to be simple and uniform in its condition. Concerning this, it remains for us to inquire whether, as being called natural, it ought to be deemed subject to change. (The heretics whom we have referred to) deny that nature is susceptible of any change,[fn-27-P2799_948836:168-nf] in order that they may be able to establish and settle their threefold theory, or \"trinity,\" in all its characteristics as to the several natures, because \"a good tree cannot produce evil fruit, nor a corrupt tree good fruit; and nobody gathers figs of thorns, nor grapes of brambles.\"[fn-28-P2800_949154:169-nf] If so, then \"God will not be able any longer to raise up from the stones children unto Abraham; nor to make a generation of vipers bring forth fruits of repentance.\"[fn-28-P2801_949344:170-nf] And if so, the apostle too was in error when he said in his epistle, \"Ye were at one time darkness, (but now are ye light in the Lord: )\"[fn-28-P2802_949505:171-nf] and, \"We also were by nature children of wrath; \"[fn-28-P2803_949573:172-nf] and, \"Such were some of you, but ye are washed.\"[fn-28-P2804_949641:173-nf] The statements, however, of holy Scripture will never be discordant with truth. A corrupt tree will never yield good fruit, unless the better nature be grafted into it; nor will a good tree produce evil fruit, except by the same process of cultivation. Stones also will become children of Abraham, if educated in Abraham's faith; and a generation of vipers will bring forth the fruits of penitence, if they reject the poison of their malignant nature. This will be the power of the grace of God, more potent indeed than nature, exercising its sway over the faculty that underlies itself within us-even the freedom of our will, which is described as au0tecou/sioj (of independent authority); and inasmuch as this faculty is itself also natural and mutable, in whatsoever direction it turns, it inclines of its own nature. Now, that there does exist within us naturally this independent authority (to\\ au0tecou/sion), we have already shown in opposition both to Marcion[fn-28-P2805_950631:174-nf] and to Hermogenes.[fn-28-P2806_950688:175-nf] if, then, the natural condition has to be submitted to a definition, it must be determined to be twofold-there being the category of the born and the unborn, the made and not-made. Now that which has received its constitution by being made or by being born, is by nature capable of being changed, for it can be both born again and re-made; whereas that which is not-made and unborn will remain for ever immoveable. Since, however, this state is suited to God alone, as the only Being who is unborn and not-made (and therefore immortal and unchangeable), it is absolutely certain that the nature of all other existences which are born and created is subject to modification and change; so that if the threefold state is to be ascribed to the soul, it must be supposed to arise from the mutability of its accidental circumstances, and not from the appointment of nature.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"119","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now there is no end to the uncertainty and irregularity of human opinion, until we come to the limits which God has prescribed. I shall at last retire within our own lines and firmly hold my ground there, for the purpose of proving to the Christian (the soundness of) my answers to the Philosophers and the Physicians. Brother (in Christ), on your own foundation[fn-28-P2844_975058:198-nf] build up your faith. Consider the wombs of the most sainted women instinct with the life within them, and their babes which not only breathed therein, but were even endowed with prophetic intuition. See how the bowels of Rebecca are disquieted,[fn-28-P2845_975329:199-nf] though her child-bearing is as yet remote, and there is no impulse of (vital) air. Behold, a twin offspring chafes within the mother's womb, although she has no sign as yet of the twofold nation. Possibly we might have regarded as a prodigy the contention of this infant progeny, which struggled before it lived, which had animosity previous to animation, if it had simply disturbed the mother by its restlessness within her. But when her womb opens, and the number of her offspring is seen, and their presaged condition known, we have presented to us a proof not merely of the (separate) souls of the infants, but of their hostile struggles too. He who was the first to be born was threatened with detention by him who was anticipated in birth, who was not yet fully brought forth, but whose hand only had been born. Now if he actually imbibed life, and received his soul, in Platonic style, at his first breath; or else, after the Stoic rule, had the earliest taste of animation on touching the frosty air; what was the other about, who was so eagerly looked for, who was still detained within the womb, and was trying to detain (the other) outside? I suppose he had not yet breathed when he seized his brother's heel;[fn-28-P2846_976575:200-nf] and was still warm with his mother's warmth, when he so strongly wished to be the first to quit the womb. What an infant! so emulous, so strong, and already so contentious; and all this, I suppose, because even now full of life! Consider, again, those extraordinary conceptions, which were more wonderful still, of the barren woman and the virgin: these women would only be able to produce imperfect offspring against the course of nature, from the very fact that one of them was too old to bear seed, and the other was pure from the contact of man. If there was to be bearing at all in the case, it was only fitting that they should be born without a soul, (as the philosopher would say, ) who had been irregularly conceived. However, even these have life, each of them in his mother's womb. Elizabeth exults with joy, (for) John had leaped in her womb;[fn-28-P2847_977451:201-nf] Mary magnifies the Lord, (for) Christ had instigated her within.[fn-28-P2848_977538:202-nf] The mothers recognise each their own offspring, being moreover each recognised by their infants, which were therefore of course alive, and were not souls merely, but spirits also. Accordingly you read the word of God which was spoken to Jeremiah, \"Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee.\"[fn-28-P2849_977854:203-nf] Since God forms us in the womb, He also breathes upon us, as He also did at the first creation, when \"the Lord God formed man, and breathed into him the breath of life.\"[fn-28-P2850_978042:204-nf] Nor could God have known man in the womb, except in his entire nature: \"And before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee.\"[fn-28-P2851_978199:205-nf] Well, was it then a dead body at that early stage? Certainly not.

For as Adam and Eve felt that they must cover their nakedness after their knowledge of good and evil so we profess to have the same discernment of good and evil from the time that we experience the same sensation of shame. Now from the before-mentioned age (of fourteen years) sex is suffused and clothed with an especial sensibility, and concupiscence employs the ministry of the eye, and communicates its pleasure to another, and understands the natural relations between male and female, and wears the fig-tree apron to cover the shame which it still excites, and drives man out of the paradise of innocence and chastity, and in its wild pruriency falls upon sins and unnatural incentives to delinquency; for its impulse has by this time surpassed the appointment of nature, and springs from its vicious abuse. But the strictly natural concupiscence is simply confined to the desire of those aliments which God at the beginning conferred upon than. \"Of every tree of the garden\" He says, \"ye shall freely eat; \"[fn-29-P2943_1037321:261-nf] and then again to the generation which followed next after the flood He enlarged the grant: \"Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; behold, as the green herb have I given you all these things,\"[fn-29-P2944_1037550:262-nf] -where He has regard rather to the body than to the soul, although it be in the interest of the soul also. For we must remove all occasion from the caviller, who, because the soul apparently wants ailments, would insist on the soul's being from this circumstance deemed mortal, since it is sustained by meat and drink and after a time loses its rigour when they are withheld, and on their complete removal ultimately droops and dies. Now the point we must keep in view is not merely which particular faculty it is which desires these (aliments), but also for what end; and even if it be for its own sake, still the question remains, Why this desire, and when felt, and how long? Then again there is the consideration, that it is one thing to desire by natural instinct, and another thing to desire through necessity; one thing to desire as a property of being, another thing to desire for a special object. The soul, therefore, will desire meat and drink-for itself indeed, because of a special necessity; for the flesh, however, from the nature of its properties. For the flesh is no doubt the house of the soul, and the soul is the temporary inhabitant of the flesh. The desire, then, of the lodger will arise from the temporary cause and the special necessity which his very designation suggests,-with a view to benefit and improve the place of his temporary abode, while sojourning in it; not with the view, certainly, of being himself the foundation of the house, or himself its walls, or himself its support and roof, but simply and solely with the view of being accommodated and housed, since he could not receive such accommodation except in a sound and well-built house. (Now, applying this imagery to the soul, ) if it be not provided with this accommodation, it will not be in its power to quit its dwelling-place, and for want of fit and proper resources, to depart safe and sound, in possession, too, of its own supports, and the aliments which belong to its own proper condition,-namely immortality, rationality, sensibility, intelligence, and freedom of the will.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":45,"source_paragraph":"153","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Let us therefore first discuss the question of sleep, and afterwards in what way the soul encounters[fn-29-P2969_1049628:272-nf] death. Now sleep is certainly not a supernatural thing, as some philosophers will have it be, when they suppose it to be the result of causes which appear to be above nature. The Stoics affirm sleep to be \"a temporary suspension of the activity of the senses; \"[fn-29-P2970_1049907:273-nf] the Epicureans define it as an intermission of the animal spirit; Anaxagoras and Xenophanes as a weariness of the same; Empedocles and Parmenides as a cooling down thereof; Strato as a separation of the (soul's) connatural spirit; Democritus as the soul's indigence; Aristotle as the interruption[fn-29-P2971_1050232:274-nf] of the heat around the heart. As for myself, I can safely say that i have never slept in such a way as to discover even a single one of these conditions. Indeed, we cannot possibly believe that sleep is a weariness; it is rather the opposite, for it undoubtedly removes weariness, and a person is refreshed by sleep instead of being fatigued. Besides, sleep is not always the result of fatigue; and even when it is, the fatigue continues no longer. Nor can I allow that sleep is a cooling or decaying of the animal heat, for our bodies derive warmth from sleep in such a way that the regular dispersion of the food by means of sleep could not so easily go on if there were too much heat to accelerate it unduly, or cold to retard it, if sleep had the alleged refrigerating influence. There is also the further fact that perspiration indicates an over-heated digestion; and digestion is predicated of us as a process of concoction, which is an operation concerned with heat and not with cold. In like manner, the immortality of the soul precludes belief in the theory that sleep is an intermission of the animal spirit, or an indigence of the spirit, or a separation of the (soul's) connatural spirit. The soul perishes if it undergoes diminution or intermission. Our only resource, indeed, is to agree with the Stoics, by determining the soul to be a temporary suspension of the activity of the senses, procuring rest for the body only, not for the soul also. For the soul, as being always in motion, and always active, never succumbs to rest,-a condition which is alien to immortality: for nothing immortal admits, any end to its operation; but sleep is an end of operation. It is indeed on the body, which is subject to mortality, and on the body alone, that sleep graciously bestows[fn-29-P2972_1052049:275-nf] a cessation from work. He, therefore, who shall doubt whether sleep is a natural function, has the dialectical experts calling in question the whole difference between things natural and supernatural-so that what things he supposed to be beyond nature he may, (if he likes, ) be safe in assigning to nature, which indeed has made such a disposition of things, that they may seemingly be accounted as beyond it; and so, of course, all things are natural or none are natural, (as occasion requires.) With us (Christians), however, only that can receive a hearing which is suggested by contemplating God, the Author of all the things which we are now discussing. For we believe that nature, if it is anything, is a reasonable work of God. Now reason presides over sleep; for sleep is so fit for man, so useful, so necessary, that were it not for it, nota soul could provide agency for recruiting the body, for restoring its energies, for ensuring its health, for supplying suspension from work and remedy against labour, and for the legitimate enjoyment of which day departs, and night provides an ordinance by taking from all objects their very colour. Since, then, sleep is indispensable to our life, and health, and succour, there can be nothing pertaining to it which is not reasonable, and which is not natural. Hence it is that physicians banish beyond the gateway of nature everything which is contrary to what is vital healthful, and helpful to nature; for those maladies which are inimical to sleep-maladies of the mind and of the stomach-they have decided to be contrariant to nature, and by such decision have determined as its corollary that sleep is perfectly natural. Moreover, when they declare that sleep is not natural in the lethargic state, they derive their conclusion from the fact that it is natural when it is in its due and regular exercise. For every natural state is impaired either by defect or by excess, whilst it is maintained by its proper measure and amount. That, therefore, will be natural in its condition which may be rendered non-natural by defect or by excess. Well, now, what if you were to remove eating and drinking from the conditions of nature? if in them lies the chief incentive to sleep. It is certain that, from the very beginning of his nature, man was impressed with these instincts (of sleep).[fn-29-P2973_1054407:276-nf] If you receive your instruction from God, (you will find) that the fountain of the human race, Adam, had a taste of drowsiness before having a draught of repose; slept before he laboured, or even before he ate, nay, even before he spoke; in Order that men may see that sleep is a natural feature and function, and one which has actually precedence over all the natural faculties. From this primary instance also we are led to trace even then the image of death in sleep. For as Adam was a figure of Christ, Adam's sleep shadowed out the death of Christ, who was to sleep a mortal slumber, that from the wound inflicted on His side might, in like manner (as Eve was formed), be typified the church, the true mother of the living. This is why sleep is so salutary, so rational, and is actually formed into the model of that death which is general and common to the race of man. God, indeed, has willed (and it may be said in passing that He has, generally, in His dispensations brought nothing to pass without such types and shadows) to set before us, in a manner more fully and completely than Plato's example, by daily recurrence the outlines of man's state, especially concerning the beginning and the termination thereof; thus stretching out the hand to help our faith more readily by types and parables, not in words only, but also in things. He accordingly sets before your view the human body stricken by the friendly power of slumber, prostrated by the kindly necessity of repose immoveable in position, just as it lay previous to life, and just as it will lie after life is past: there it lies as an attestation of its form when first moulded, and of its condition when at last buried-awaiting the soul in both stages, in the former previous to its bestowal, in the latter after its recent withdrawal. Meanwhile the soul is circumstanced in such a manner as to seem to be elsewhere active, learning to bear future absence by a dissembling of its presence for the moment. We shall soon know the case of Hermotimus. But yet it dreams in the interval. Whence then its dreams? The fact is, it cannot rest or be idle altogether, nor does it confine to the still hours of sleep the nature of its immortality. It proves itself to possess a constant motion; it travels over land and sea, it trades, it is excited, it labours, it plays, it grieves, it rejoices, it follows pursuits lawful and unlawful; it shows what very great power it has even without the body, how well equipped it is with members of its own, although betraying at the same time the need it has of impressing on some body its activity again. Accordingly, when the body shakes off its slumber, it asserts before your eye the resurrection of the dead by its own resumption of its natural functions. Such, therefore, must be both the natural reason and the reasonable nature of sleep. If you only regard it as the image of death, you initiate faith, you nourish hope, you learn both how to die and how to live, you learn watchfulness, even while you sleep.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":47,"source_paragraph":"157","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We are bound to expound at this point what is the opinion of Christians respecting dreams, as incidents of sleep, and as no slight or trifling excitements of the soul, which we have declared to be always occupied and active owing to its perpetual movement, which again is a proof and evidence of its divine quality and immortality. When, therefore, rest accrues to human bodies, it being their own especial comfort, the soul, disdaining a repose which is not natural to it, never rests; and since it receives no help from the limbs of the body, it uses its own. Imagine a gladiator without his instruments or arms, and a charioteer without his team, but still gesticulating the entire course and exertion of their respective employments: there is the fight, there is the struggle; but the effort is a vain one. Nevertheless the whole procedure seems to be gone through, although it evidently has not been really effected. There is the act, but not the effect. This power we call ecstasy, in which the sensuous soul stands out of itself, in a way which even resembles madness.[fn-29-P2980_1061043:277-nf] Thus in the very beginning sleep was inaugurated by ecstasy: \"And God sent an ecstasy upon Adam, and he slept.\"[fn-29-P2981_1061258:278-nf] The sleep came on his body to cause it to rest, but the ecstasy fell on his soul to remove rest: from that very circumstance it still happens ordinarily (and from the order results the nature of the case) that sleep is combined with ecstasy. In fact, with what real feeling, and anxiety, and suffering do we experience joy, and sorrow, and alarm in our dreams! Whereas we should not be moved by any such emotions, by what would be the merest fantasies of course, if when we dream we were masters of ourselves, (unaffected by ecstasy.) In these dreams, indeed, good actions are useless, and crimes harmless; for we shall no more be condemned for visionary acts of sin, than we shall be crowned for imaginary martyrdom. But how, you will ask, can the soul remember its dreams, when it is said to be without any mastery over its own operations? This memory must be an especial gift of the ecstatic condition of which we are treating, since it arises not from any failure of healthy action, but entirely from natural process; nor does it expel mental function-it withdraws it for a time. It is one thing to shake, it is another thing to move; one thing to destroy, another thing to agitate. That, therefore, which memory supplies betokens soundness of mind; and that which a sound mind ecstatically experiences whilst the memory remains unchecked, is a kind of madness. We are accordingly not said to be mad, but to dream, in that state; to be in the full possession also of our mental faculties,[fn-29-P2982_1062772:279-nf] if we are at any time. For although the power to exercise these faculties[fn-29-P2983_1062864:280-nf] may be dimmed in us, it is still not extinguished; except that it may seem to be itself absent at the very time that the ecstasy is energizing in us in its special manner, in such wise as to bring before us images of a sound mind and of wisdom, even as it does those of aberration.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_111_discourse_ii_theophila_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Let us begin with Genesis, that we may give its place of antiquity and supremacy to this scripture.

If, however, he should teach that the immortal being of the soul also is sown along with the mortal body, he will not be believed; for the Almighty alone breathes into man the undying and undecaying part, as also it is He alone who is Creator of the invisible and indestructible. For, He says, He \"breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\"[fn-49-P4941_1491140:13-nf] And those artificers who, to the destruction of men, make images in human form, not perceiving and knowing their own Maker, are blamed by the Word, which says, in the Book of Wisdom, a book full of all virtue,[fn-49-P4942_1491367:14-nf] \"his heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and his life of less value than clay; forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and Him that inspired into him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit; \"[fn-49-P4943_1491710:15-nf] that is, God, the Maker of all men; therefore, also, according to the apostle, He \"will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.\"[fn-49-P4944_1491893:16-nf] And now, although this subject be scarcely completed, yet there are others which remain to be discussed. For when one thoroughly examines and understands those things which happen to man according to his nature, he will know not to despise the procreation of children, although he applauds chastity, and prefers it in honour. For although honey be sweeter and more pleasant than other things, we are not for that reason to consider other things bitter which are mixed up in the natural sweetness of fruits. And, in support of these statements, I will bring forward a trustworthy witness, namely, Paul, who says, \"So then he that giveth her[fn-49-P4945_1492552:17-nf] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth bet ter.\"[fn-49-P4946_1492760:18-nf] Now the word, in setting forth that which is better and sweeter, did not intend to take away the inferior, but arranges so as to assign to each its own proper use and advantage. For there are some to whom it is not given to attain virginity; and there are others whom He no longer wills to be excited by procreations to lust, and to be defiled, but henceforth to meditate and to keep the mind upon the transformation of the body to the likeness of angels, when they \"neither marry nor are given in marriage,\"[fn-49-P4947_1493290:19-nf] according to the infallible words of the Lord; since it is not given to all to attain that undefiled state of being a eunuch for the sake of the kingdom of heaven,[fn-49-P4948_1493475:20-nf] but manifestly to those only who are able to preserve the ever-blooming and unfading flower of virginity. For it is the custom of the prophetic Word to compare the Church to a flower covered and variegated meadow, adorned and crowned not only with the flowers of virginity, but also with those of child-bearing and of continence; for it is written, \"Upon thy[fn-49-P4949_1493854:21-nf] right hand did stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.\"[fn-49-P4950_1493966:22-nf] ","title":"Discourse II.-Theophila.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_112_discourse_iii_thaleia_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-06","text":"You seem to me, O Theophila, to excel all in action and in speech, and to be second to none in wisdom. For there is no one who will find fault with your discourse, however contentious and contradictory he may be. Yet, while everything else seems rightly spoken, one thing, my friend, distresses and troubles me, considering that that wise and most spiritual man-I mean Paul-would not vainly refer to Christ and the Church the union of the first man and woman,[fn-49-P4961_1494996:2-nf] if the Scripture meant nothing higher than what is conveyed by the mere words and the history; for if we are to take the Scripture as a bare representation wholly referring to the union of man and woman, for what reason should the apostle, calling these things to remembrance, and guiding us, as I opine, into the way of the Spirit, allegorize the history of Adam and Eve as having a reference to Christ and the Church? For the passage in Genesis reads thus: \"And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\"[fn-49-P4962_1495740:3-nf] But the apostle considering this passage, by no means, as I said, intends to take it according to its mere natural sense, as referring to the union of man and woman, as you do; for you, explaining the passage in too natural a sense, laid down that the Spirit is speaking only of conception and births; that the bone taken from the bones was made another man, and that living creatures coming together swell like trees at the time of conception. But he, more spiritually referring the passage to Christ, thus teaches: \"He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church: for we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

But the fact that there is no moral inequality or discord[fn-49-P4995_1506448:18-nf] may again be considered briefly from the beginning. For he speaks well who says that that is in its own nature good and righteous and holy, by participation of which other things become good, and that wisdom is in connection with[fn-49-P4996_1506691:19-nf] God, and that, on the other hand, sin is unholy and unrighteous and evil. For life and death, corruption and incorruption, are two things in the highest degree opposed to each other. For life is a moral equality, but corruption an inequality; and righteousness and prudence a harmony, but unrighteousness and folly a discord. Now, man being between these is neither righteousness itself, nor unrighteousness; but being placed midway between incorruption and corruption, to whichever of these he may incline is said to partake of the nature of that which has laid hold of him. Now, when he inclines to corruption, he becomes corrupt and mortal, and when to incorruption, he becomes incorrupt and immortal. For, being placed midway between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of the Fruit of which he tasted,[fn-49-P4997_1507688:20-nf] he was changed into the nature of the latter, himself being neither the tree of life nor that of corruption; but having been shown forth as mortal, from his participation in and presence with corruption, and, again, as incorrupt and immortal by connection with and participation in life; as Paul also taught, saying, \"Corruption shall not inherit incorruption, nor death life,\"[fn-49-P4998_1508083:21-nf] rightly defining corruption and death to be that which corrupts and kills, and not that which is corrupted and dies; and incorruption and life that which gives life and immortality, and not that which receives life and immortality. And thus man is neither a discord and an inequality, nor an equality and a harmony. But when he received discord, which is transgression and sin, he became discordant and unseemly; but when he received harmony, that is righteousness, he became a harmonious and seemly organ, in order that the Lord, the Incorruption which conquered death, might harmonize the resurrection with the flesh, not suffering it again to be inherited by corruption.

Whence it was that the apostle directly referred to Christ the words which had been spoken of Adam.

For in this way, too, the command, \"Increase and multiply,\"[fn-50-P5005_1510292:24-nf] is duly fulfilled, the Church increasing daily in greatness and beauty and multitude, by the union and communion of the Word who now still comes down to us and falls into a trance by the memorial of His passion; for otherwise the Church could not conceive believers, and give them new birth by the laver of regeneration, unless Christ, emptying Himself for their sake, that He might be contained by them, as I said, through the recapitulation of His passion, should die again, coming down from heaven, and being \"joined to His wife,\" the Church, should provide for a certain power being taken from His own side, so that all who are built up in Him should grow up, even those who are born again by the laver, receiving of His bones and of His flesh, that is, of His holiness and of His glory. For he who says that the bones and flesh of Wisdom are understanding and virtue, says most rightly; and that the side[fn-50-P5006_1511220:25-nf] is the Spirit of truth, the Paraclete, of whom the illuminated[fn-50-P5007_1511293:26-nf] receiving are fitly born again to incorruption.

For He may fitly be called the side[fn-50-P5009_1511955:28-nf] of the Word, even the sevenfold Spirit of truth, according to the prophet;[fn-50-P5010_1512040:29-nf] of whom God taking, in the trance of Christ, that is, after His incarnation and passion, prepares a help-meet for Him[fn-50-P5011_1512175:30-nf] -I mean the souls which are betrothed and given in marriage to Him. For it is frequently the case that the Scriptures thus call the assembly and mass of believers by the name of the Church, the more perfect in their progress being led up to be the one person and body of the Church. For those who are the better, and who embrace the truth more clearly, being delivered from the evils of the flesh, become, on account of their perfect purification and faith, a church and help-meet of Christ, betrothed and given in marriage to Him as a virgin, according to the apostle,[fn-50-P5012_1512763:31-nf] so that receiving the pure and genuine seed of His doctrine, they may co-operate with Him, helping in preaching for the salvation of others. And those who are still imperfect and beginning their lessons, are born to salvation, and shaped, as by mothers, by those who are more perfect, until they are brought forth and regenerated unto the greatness and beauty of virtue; and so these, in their turn making progress, having become a church, assist in labouring for the birth and nurture of other children, accomplishing in the receptacle of the soul, as in a womb, the blameless will of the Word.","title":"Discourse III.-Thaleia.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_112_discourse_iii_thaleia_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Now Paul, when summoning all persons to sanctification and purity, in this way referred that which had been spoken concerning the first man and Eve in a secondary sense to Christ and the Church, in order to silence the ignorant, now deprived of all excuse.

As regards the passage from Paul's epistle which teaches, in opposition to your heresy, that the Son of God was born of the seed of David, it is found in all manuscripts both new and old of all Churches, and in all languages. So the profession which Faustus makes of believing the apostle is hypocritical. Instead of saying, \"Assuredly I believe,\" he should have said, Assuredly I do not believe, as he would have said if he had not wished to deceive people. What part of his belief does he get from the apostle? Not the first man, of whom the apostle says that he is of the earth, earthy; and again, \"The first man Adam was made a living soul.\" Faustus' First Man is neither of the earth, earthy, nor made a living soul, but of the substance of God, and the same in essence as God; and this being is said to have mixed up with the race of darkness his members, or vesture, or weapons, that is, the five elements, which also are part of the substance of God, so that they became subject to confinement and pollution. Nor does Faustus get from Paul his Second Man, of whom Paul says that He is from heaven, and that He is the last Adam, and a quickening spirit; and also that He was born of the seed of David after the flesh, that He was made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law.[fn-13-P1343_712133:5-nf] Of Him Paul says to Timothy: \"Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead, according to my gospel.\"[fn-13-P1344_712282:6-nf] And this resurrection he quotes as an example of our resurrection: \"I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures.\" And a little further on he draws an inference from this doctrine: \"Now, if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?\"[fn-13-P1345_712774:7-nf] Our professed believer in Paul believes nothing of all this. He denies that Jesus was born of the seed of David, that He was made of a woman (by the word woman is not meant a wife in the common sense of the word, but merely one of the female sex, as in the book of Genesis, where it is said that God made a woman before she was brought to Adam[fn-13-P1346_713142:8-nf] ); he denies His death, His burial, and His resurrection. He holds that Christ had not a mortal body, and therefore could not really die; and that the marks of His wounds which He showed to His disciples when He appeared to them alive after His resurrection, which Paul also mentions,[fn-13-P1347_713443:9-nf] were not real. He denies, too, that our mortal body will be raised again, changed into a spiritual body; as Paul teaches: \"It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.\" To illustrate this distinction between the natural and the spiritual body, the apostle adds what I have quoted already about the first and the last Adam. Then he goes on: \"But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\" And to explain what he means by flesh and blood, that it is not the bodily substance, but corruption, which will not enter into the resurrection of the just, he immediately says, \"Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption.\" And in case any one should still suppose that it is not what is buried that is to rise again, but that it is as if one garment were laid aside and a better taken instead, he proceeds to show distinctly that the same body will be changed for the better, as the garments of Christ on the mount were not displaced, but transfigured: \"Behold, I show you a mystery; we shall not all be changed, but we shall all rise.\"[fn-13-P1348_714540:10-nf] Then he shows who are to be changed: \"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be changed.\" And if it should be said that it is not as regards our mortal and corruptible body, but as regards our soul, that we are to be changed, it should be observed that the apostle is not speaking of the soul, but of the body, as is evident from the question he starts with: \"But some one will say, How are the dead raised, and with what body do they come?\" So also, in the conclusion of his argument, he leaves no doubt of what he is speaking: \"This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-13-P1349_715270:11-nf] Faustus denies this; and the God whom Paul declares to be \"immortal, incorruptible, to whom alone is glory and honor,\"[fn-13-P1350_715412:12-nf] he makes corruptible. For in this monstrous and horrible fiction of theirs, the substance and nature of God was in danger of being wholly corrupted by the race of darkness, and to save the rest part actually was corrupted. And to crown all this, he tries to deceive the ignorant who are not learned in the sacred Scriptures, by making this profession: I assuredly believe the Apostle Paul; when he ought to have said, I assuredly do not believe.","title":"Book XI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_20_dialogue_ii_the_unconfounded_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Orth.-He says that man is composed of three parts, of a body, a vital soul, and further of a reasonable soul, which he terms mind.

Of His future coming the ancient saints, in the revelation of the Spirit, had knowledge, and prophesied.

Now, to meet this objection, we must explain the nature[fn-44-P4422_1428760:123-nf] of the soul. We must at the outset hold fast the meaning of the Greek scripture, which has afflatus, not spirit.[fn-44-P4423_1428890:124-nf] Some interpreters of the Greek, without reflecting on the difference of the words, and careless about their exact meaning, put spirit for afflatus; they thus afford to heretics an opportunity of tarnishing[fn-44-P4424_1429349:125-nf] the Spirit of God, that is to say, God Himself, with default. And now comes the question. Afflatus, observe then, is less than spirit, although it comes from spirit; it is the spirit's gentle breeze,[fn-44-P4425_1429568:126-nf] but it is not the spirit. Now a breeze is rarer than the wind; and although it proceeds from wind, yet a breeze is not the wind. One may call a breeze the image of the spirit. In the same manner, man is the image of God, that is, of spirit; for God is spirit. Afflatus is therefore the image of the spirit. Now the image is not in any case equal to the very thing.[fn-44-P4426_1429949:127-nf] It is one thing to be like the reality, and another thing to be the reality itself. So, although the afflatus is the image of the spirit, it is yet not possible to compare the image of God in such a way, that, because the reality-that is, the spirit, or in other words, the Divine Being-is faultless, therefore the afflatus also, that is to say, the image, ought not by any possibility to have done wrong. In this respect will the image be less than the reality, and the afflatus inferior to the spirit, in that, while it possesses beyond doubt the true lineaments of divinity, such as an immortal soul, freedom and its own mastery over itself, foreknowledge in a great degree,[fn-44-P4427_1430644:128-nf] reasonableness, capacity of understanding and knowledge, it is even in these respects an image still, and never amounts to the actual power of Deity, nor to absolute exemption from fault,-a property which is only conceded to God, that is, to the reality, and which is simply incompatible with an image. An image, although it may express all the lineaments of the reality, is yet wanting in its intrinsic power; it is destitute of motion. In like manner, the soul, the image of the spirit, is unable to express the simple power thereof, that is to say, its happy exemption from sinning.[fn-44-P4428_1431248:129-nf] Were it otherwise,[fn-44-P4429_1431302:130-nf] it would not be soul, but spirit; not man, who received a soul, but God. Besides, to take another view of the matter,[fn-44-P4430_1431436:131-nf] not everything which pertains to God will be regarded as God, so that you would not maintain that His afflatus was God, that is, exempt from fault, because it is the breath of God. And in an act of your own, such as blowing into a flute, you would not thereby make the flute human, although it was your own human breath which you breathed into it, precisely as God breathed of His own Spirit, In fact,[fn-44-P4431_1431861:132-nf] the Scripture, by expressly saying[fn-44-P4432_1431912:133-nf] that God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, and that man became thereby a living soul, not a life-giving spirit, has distinguished that soul from the condition of the Creator. The work must necessarily be distinct from the workman, and it is inferior to him. The pitcher will not be the potter, although made by the potter; nor in like manner, will the afflatus, because made by the spirit, be on that account the spirit. The soul has often been called by the same name as the breath. You should also take care that no descent be made from the breath to a still lower quality. So you have granted (you say) the infirmity of the soul, which you denied before! Undoubtedly, when you demand for it an equality with God, that is, a freedom from fault, I contend that it is infirm. But when the comparison is challenged with an angel, I am compelled to maintain that the head over all things is the stronger of the two, to whom the angels are ministers,[fn-44-P4433_1432895:134-nf] who is destined to be the judge of angels,[fn-44-P4434_1432957:135-nf] if he shall stand fast in the law of God-an obedience which he refused at first. Now this disobedience[fn-44-P4435_1433081:136-nf] it was possible for the afflatus of God to commit: it was possible, but it was not proper. The possibility lay in its slenderness of nature, as being the breath and not the spirit; the impropriety, however, arose from its power of will, as being free, and not a slave. It was furthermore assisted by the warning against committing sin under the threat of incurring death, which was meant to be a support for its slender nature, and a direction for its liberty of choice. So that the soul can no longer appear to have sinned, because it has an affinity with God, that is to say, through the afflatus, but rather through that which was an addition to its nature, that is, through its free-will, which was indeed given to it by God in accordance with His purpose and reason, but recklessly employed[fn-44-P4436_1433944:137-nf] by man according as he chose. This, then, being the case, the entire course[fn-44-P4437_1434037:138-nf] of God's action is purged from all imputation to evil. For the liberty of the will will not retort its own wrong on Him by whom it was bestowed, but on him by whom it was improperly used. What is the evil, then, which you want to impute to the Creator? If it is man's sin, it will not be God's fault, because it is man's doing; nor is that Being to be regarded as the author of the sin, who turns out to be its forbidder, nay, its condemner. If death is the evil, death will not give the reproach of being its own author to Him who threatened it, but to him who despised it. For by his contempt he introduced it, which assuredly[fn-44-P4438_1434685:139-nf] would not have appeared had man not despised it.","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_29_book_ii_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"ANF-03","text":"It is now high time that I should, in order to meet all[fn-46-P4672_1493034:325-nf] objections of this kind, proceed to the explanation and clearing up[fn-46-P4673_1493128:326-nf] of the other trifles,[fn-46-P4674_1493168:327-nf] weak points, and inconsistencies, as you deemed them. God calls out to Adam,[fn-46-P4675_1493266:328-nf] Where art thou? as if ignorant where he was; and when he alleged that the shame of his nakedness was the cause (of his hiding himself), He inquired whether he had eaten of the tree, as if He were in doubt. By no means;[fn-46-P4676_1493508:329-nf] God was neither uncertain about the commission of the sin, nor ignorant of Adam's whereabouts. It was certainly proper to summon the offender, who was concealing himself from the consciousness of his sin, and to bring him forth into the presence of his Lord, not merely by the calling out of his name, but with a home-thrust blow[fn-46-P4677_1493852:330-nf] at the sin which he had at that moment committed. For the question ought not to be read in a merely interrogative tone, Where art thou, Adam? but with an impressive and earnest voice, and with an air of imputation, Oh, Adam, where art thou?-as much as to intimate: thou art no longer here, thou art in perdition-so that the voice is the utterance of One who is at once rebuking and sorrowing.[fn-46-P4678_1494266:331-nf] But of course some part of paradise had escaped the eye of Him who holds the universe in His hand as if it were a bird's nest, and to whom heaven is a throne and earth a footstool; so that He could not see, before He summoned him forth, where Adam was, both while lurking and when eating of the forbidden fruit! The wolf or the paltry thief escapes not the notice of the keeper of your vineyard or your garden! And God, I suppose, with His keener vision,[fn-46-P4679_1494737:332-nf] from on high was unable to miss the sight of[fn-46-P4680_1494802:333-nf] aught which lay beneath Him! Foolish heretic, who treat with scorn[fn-46-P4681_1494888:334-nf] so fine an argument of God's greatness and man's instruction! God put the question with an appearance of uncertainty, in order that even here He might prove man to be the subject of a free will in the alternative of either a denial or a confession, and give to him the opportunity of freely acknowledging his transgression, and, so far,[fn-46-P4682_1495238:335-nf] of lightening it.[fn-46-P4683_1495276:336-nf] In like manner He inquires of Cain where his brother was, just as if He had not yet heard the blood of Abel crying from the ground, in order that he too might have the opportunity from the same power of the will of spontaneously denying, and to this degree aggravating, his crime; and that thus there might be supplied to us examples of confessing sins rather than of denying them: so that even then was initiated the evangelic doctrine, \"By thy words[fn-46-P4684_1495746:337-nf] thou shall be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\"[fn-46-P4685_1495859:338-nf] Now, although Adam was by reason of his condition under law[fn-46-P4686_1495941:339-nf] subject to death, yet was hope preserved to him by the Lord's saying, \"Behold, Adam is become as one of us; \"[fn-46-P4687_1496080:340-nf] that is, in consequence of the future taking of the man into the divine nature. Then what follows? \"And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, (and eat), and live for ever.\" Inserting thus the particle of present time, \"And now,\" He shows that He had made for a time, and at present, a prolongation of man's life. Therefore He did not actually[fn-46-P4688_1496493:341-nf] curse Adam and Eve, for they were candidates for restoration, and they had been relieved[fn-46-P4689_1496635:342-nf] by confession. Cain, however, He not only cursed; but when he wished to atone for his sin by death, He even prohibited his dying, so that he had to bear the load of this prohibition in addition to his crime. This, then, will prove to be the ignorance of our God, which was simulated on this account, that delinquent man should not be unaware of what he ought to do. Coming down to the case of Sodom and Gomorrha, he says: \"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\"[fn-46-P4690_1497214:343-nf] Well, was He in this instance also uncertain through ignorance, and desiring to know? Or was this a necessary tone of utterance, as expressive of a minatory and not a dubious sense, under the colour of an inquiry? If you make merry at God's \"going down,\" as if He could not except by the descent have accomplished His judgment, take care that you do not strike your own God with as hard a blow.

The Prophet Solomon teaches us what this tree of Life is in his exhortation concerning Wisdom: She is a tree of life to all them that lay hold upon her, and lean upon her[fn-24-P2453_1566253:13-nf] .

And this tree is planted beside the rills of water in the domain of the Kingdom of God, that is, of course, in Paradise, and in the place where the stream as it issues forth is divided into four heads. For he does not say, Behind the rills of water, but, Beside the rills of water, at the place where first the heads receive each their flow of waters.

When, therefore, it is alleged that marriage is now one thing, but might have been another had no one sinned, this is not predicated of its nature, but of a certain quality which has undergone a change for the worse. Just as a man is said to be different, though he is actually the same individual, when he has changed his manner of life either for the better or the worse; for as a righteous man he is one thing, and as a sinful man another, though the man himself be really the same individual. In like manner, marriage without shameful lust is one thing, and marriage with shameful lust is another. When, however, a woman is lawfully united to her husband in accordance with the true constitution of wedlock, and fidelity to what is due to the flesh is kept free from the sin of adultery, and so children are lawfully begotten, it is actually the very same marriage which God instituted at first, although by his primeval inducement to sin, the devil inflicted a heavy wound, not, indeed, on marriage itself, but on man and woman by whom marriage is made, by his prevailing on them to disobey God,-a sin which is requited in the course of the divine judgment by the reciprocal disobedience of man's own members.

As far as the order or method of statement here adopted is concerned, we ought to understand that it in no way affects the truth of the subject itself, whether the question regarding the permission to write a bill of divorcement given by the said Moses, by whom also it is recorded that God made male and female to be one flesh,[fn-20-P2045_839761:456-nf] was addressed by these Pharisees to the Lord at the time when He was forbidding the separation of husband and wife, and confirming His declaration on that subject by the authority of the law; or whether the said question was conveyed in the reply which the same persons returned to the Lord, at the time when He asked them about what Moses had commanded them. For His intention was not to offer them any reason for the permission which Moses thus granted them until they had first mentioned the matter themselves; which intention on His part is what is indicated by the inquiry which Mark has introduced. On the other hand, their desire was to use the authority of Moses in commanding the giving of a bill of divorcement, for the purpose of stopping His mouth, so to speak, in the matter of forbidding, as they believed He undoubtedly would do, a man to put away his wife. For they had approached Him with the view of saying what would tempt Him. And this desire of theirs is what is indicated by Matthew, when, instead of stating how they were interrogated first themselves, he represents them as having of their own accord put the question about the precept of Moses, in order that they might thereby, as it were, convict the Lord of doing what was wrong in prohibiting the putting away of wives. Wherefore, since the mind of the speakers, in the service of which the words ought to stand, has been exhibited by both evangelists, it is no matter how the modes of narration adopted by the two may differ, provided neither of them fails to give a correct representation of the subject itself.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_23_book_i_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"18.

But do not imagine that this was because of their high rank: God forbid! it was because of their piety. For that the Scripture mentions their dignified stations, is to show the greatness of their piety; since it is more wonderful when a person being in a position of wealth and power is such as these were. What makes the praise of the former is, his undertaking so long a journey, and this when there was no (festival) season to require it,[fn-9-P953_863129:2-nf] and his reading on his road, and while riding in his chariot, and his beseeching Philip, and numberless other points: and the great praise of the latter is, that he makes alms and prayers, and is a just man, holding such a command. The reason why the writer describes the man so fully, is, that none may say that the Scripture history relates falsehoods: \"Cornelius,\" he says, \"a centurion of the band called the Italian band.\" (v. 1.) A \"band,\" speira, is what we now call a \"numerous.\"[fn-9-P954_864028:3-nf] \"A devout man,\" he says, \"and one that feared God with all his house\" (v. 2): that you may not imagine that it is because of his high station that these things are done.-When Paul was to be brought over, there is no angel, but the Lord Himself: and He does not send him to some great one, but to a very ordinary person:[fn-9-P955_864617:4-nf] but here, on the contrary, He brings the chief Apostle (to these Gentiles), not sends them to him: herein condescending to their weakness, and knowing how such persons need to be treated. As indeed on many occasions we find Christ Himself hasting (to such), as being more infirm. Or (it may be) because (Cornelius) was not able himself to leave his home. But here again is a high commendation of alms, just as was there given by means of Tabitha. \"A devout man,\" it says, \"and one that feared God with all his house.\" Let us hear this, whoever of us neglect them of our own house, whereas this man was careful of his soldiers also. \"And that gave alms,\" it says, \"to all the people.\" Both his doctrines and his life were right. \"He saw in a vision evidently, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.\" (v. 3.) Why does he see the angel? This also was in order to the full assurance of Peter, or rather, not of him, but of the others, the weaker ones. \"At the ninth hour,\" when he was released from his cares and was at quiet, when he was engaged in prayers and compunction. \"And when he looked on him, he was afraid.\" (v. 4.) Observe how what the angel speaks he does not speak immediately, but first rouses and elevates his mind. At the sight, there was fear, but a fear in moderation, just so far as served to fix his attention. Then also the words relieved him of his fear. The fear roused him: the praise mitigated what was unpleasant in the fear. \"Thy prayers,\" saith he, \"and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter. (v. 5.) Lest they should come to a different person, he designates the man not only by his surname, but by the place. \"And the same,\" saith he, \"is lodging with one Simon a tanner, who hath his house by the seaside.\" (v. 6.) Do you mark how the Apostles, for love of solitude and quiet, affected the retired quarters of the cities? \"With one Simon a tanner:\" how then if it chanced that there was another? Behold, there is another token, his dwelling by the seaside. All three tokens could not possibly coincide (elsewhere). He does not tell him for what purpose, that he may not take off the intense desire, but he leaves him to an eager and longing expectation of what he shall hear. \"And[fn-9-P956_867590:5-nf] when the Angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.\" (v. 7, 8.) Do you see, that it is not without purpose that the writer says this? (it shows) that those also \"who waited on him continually\" were such as he. \"And when he had declared the whole matter unto them:\" observe the unassuming character of the man: for he does not say, Call Peter to me: but, in order also to induce him to come, he declared the whole matter:-this was so ordered by Providence;-for he did not choose to use the authority of his rank to fetch Peter to him; therefore \"he declared the matter;\" such was the moderation of the man: and yet no great notion was to be formed of one lodging with a tanner. \"And on the morrow, as they journeyed, and drew nigh to the city\" (v. 9.)-observe how the Spirit connects the times: no sooner than this, and no later, He Causes this to take place-\" Peter about the sixth hour went up upon the housetop to pray:\" that is, privately and quietly, as in an upper chamber. \"And he became very hungry, and would have eaten; but while they made ready, there fell upon him a trance.\" (v. 10.) What means this expression,[fn-9-P957_869034:6-nf] ekstasij, \"trance?\" Rather, there was presented to him a kind of spiritual view (qewria): the soul, so to say, was caused to be out of the body (ecesth). \"And saw heaven opened, and, knit at the four corners, a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.\" (v. 11-16.) What is this? It is a symbol of the whole world. The[fn-9-P958_872580:7-nf] man was uncircumcised: and -for he had nothing in common with the Jews-they would all accuse him as a transgressor: \"thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them: (ch. xi. 3).\" this[fn-9-P959_874271:8-nf] was a thing altogether offensive to them: observe then what is providentially managed. He himself also says, \"I have never eaten:\" not being himself afraid-far be the thought from us-but it is so contrived by the Spirit, in order that he may have it to say in answer to those accusing him, that he did object: for it was altogether necessary for them to observe the Law. He was in the act of being sent to the Gentiles: therefore that these also may not accuse him, see how many things are contrived (by the Providence of God). For, that it may not seem to be a mere fancy, \"this was done thrice. I[fn-9-P960_875843:9-nf] said,\" saith he, \"Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten aught common or unclean.-And the voice came unto him, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.\" (ch. xi. 8, with x. 14.) It seems indeed to be spoken to him, but the whole is meant for the Jews. For if the teacher is rebuked, much more these.[fn-9-P961_877128:10-nf] The earth then, this is what the linen sheet denotes, and the wild beasts in it, are they of the Gentiles, and the command, \"Kill and eat,\" denotes that he must go to them also; and that this thing is thrice done, denotes baptism. \"What God hath cleansed,\" saith it, \"call not thou common.\" Great daring! Wherefore[fn-9-P962_879292:11-nf] did he object? That none may say that God was proving him, as in the case of Abraham, this is why he says, \"Not so, Lord,\" etc. not gainsaying-just as to Philip also He said, \"How many loaves have ye?\" Not to learn, but tempting, or \"proving him.\"[fn-9-P963_881091:12-nf] And yet it was the same (Lord) that had discoursed above (in the Law) concerning things clean and unclean. But in that sheet were also all the four-footed beasts of the earth:\" the clean with the unclean. And[fn-9-P964_882302:13-nf] for all this, he knew not what it meant. \"Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, and called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. But while Peter,\" it says, \"doubted in himself\" (v. 17, 18), the men come at the right moment to solve his doubt: just as (the Lord) suffered Joseph first to be perturbed in mind, and then sends the Angel: for the soul with ease accepts the solution, when it has first been in perplexity. His perplexity neither lasts long (when it did occur), nor (did it occur) before this, but just at the moment when they \"asked whether he were lodging there. While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.\" (supra, p. 142, and 145, note 7; v. 19, 20.) And this again is a plea for Peter in answer to the disciples, that he did doubt, and was instructed to doubt nothing. \"For I,\" saith He, \"have sent them.\" Great is the authority of the Spirit! What God doth, this the Spirit is said to do. Not so the Angel, but having first said, \"Thy prayers and thine alms have ascended, for a memorial before God,\" to show that he is sent from thence, then he adds, \"And now send men,\" etc.: the Spirit not so, but, \"For I have sent them. Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.\" (v. 21, 22.) They speak his praises, so as to persuade him that an Angel has in fact appeared unto him. \"Then called he them in,\"[fn-9-P965_885560:14-nf] (b) that they may suffer no harm, \"and lodged them:\" thenceforth he without scruple takes his meals with them. \"And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Caesarea accompanied him.

The[fn-9-P958_872580:7-nf] man was uncircumcised: and -for he had nothing in common with the Jews-they would all accuse him as a transgressor: \"thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them: (ch. xi. 3).\" this[fn-9-P959_874271:8-nf] was a thing altogether offensive to them: observe then what is providentially managed. He himself also says, \"I have never eaten:\" not being himself afraid-far be the thought from us-but it is so contrived by the Spirit, in order that he may have it to say in answer to those accusing him, that he did object: for it was altogether necessary for them to observe the Law. He was in the act of being sent to the Gentiles: therefore that these also may not accuse him, see how many things are contrived (by the Providence of God). For, that it may not seem to be a mere fancy, \"this was done thrice. I[fn-9-P960_875843:9-nf] said,\" saith he, \"Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten aught common or unclean.-And the voice came unto him, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.\" (ch. xi. 8, with x. 14.) It seems indeed to be spoken to him, but the whole is meant for the Jews. For if the teacher is rebuked, much more these.[fn-9-P961_877128:10-nf] The earth then, this is what the linen sheet denotes, and the wild beasts in it, are they of the Gentiles, and the command, \"Kill and eat,\" denotes that he must go to them also; and that this thing is thrice done, denotes baptism. \"What God hath cleansed,\" saith it, \"call not thou common.\" Great daring! Wherefore[fn-9-P962_879292:11-nf] did he object? That none may say that God was proving him, as in the case of Abraham, this is why he says, \"Not so, Lord,\" etc. not gainsaying-just as to Philip also He said, \"How many loaves have ye?\" Not to learn, but tempting, or \"proving him.\"[fn-9-P963_881091:12-nf] And yet it was the same (Lord) that had discoursed above (in the Law) concerning things clean and unclean. But in that sheet were also all the four-footed beasts of the earth:\" the clean with the unclean. And[fn-9-P964_882302:13-nf] for all this, he knew not what it meant. \"Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, and called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. But while Peter,\" it says, \"doubted in himself\" (v. 17, 18), the men come at the right moment to solve his doubt: just as (the Lord) suffered Joseph first to be perturbed in mind, and then sends the Angel: for the soul with ease accepts the solution, when it has first been in perplexity. His perplexity neither lasts long (when it did occur), nor (did it occur) before this, but just at the moment when they \"asked whether he were lodging there. While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee. Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.\" (supra, p. 142, and 145, note 7; v. 19, 20.) And this again is a plea for Peter in answer to the disciples, that he did doubt, and was instructed to doubt nothing. \"For I,\" saith He, \"have sent them.\" Great is the authority of the Spirit! What God doth, this the Spirit is said to do. Not so the Angel, but having first said, \"Thy prayers and thine alms have ascended, for a memorial before God,\" to show that he is sent from thence, then he adds, \"And now send men,\" etc.: the Spirit not so, but, \"For I have sent them. Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.\" (v. 21, 22.) They speak his praises, so as to persuade him that an Angel has in fact appeared unto him. \"Then called he them in,\"[fn-9-P965_885560:14-nf] (b) that they may suffer no harm, \"and lodged them:\" thenceforth he without scruple takes his meals with them. \"And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Caesarea accompanied him. And the morrow after, they entered into Caesarea.\" (v. 23, 24.)

We can hardly doubt, I think. that in this passage of Job the Holy Ghost is signified. The question discussed was concerning wisdom, whence it comes to men: \"It cometh not from number of years; but the Spirit is in mortals, and the inspiration of the Almighty is that which teaches.\"[fn-45-P4528_1729828:23-nf] By this repetition of terms it may be quite understood that he did not speak of man's own spirit in the clause, \"The Spirit is in mortals.\" He wanted to show whence men have wisdom,-that it is not from their own selves; so by using a duplicate expression he explains his idea; \"The inspiration of the Almighty is that which teaches.\" Similarly, in another passage of the same book, he says, \"The understanding of my lips shall meditate purity. The divine Spirit is that which formed me, and the breath of the Almighty is that which teacheth me.\"[fn-45-P4529_1730396:24-nf] Here, likewise, what he calls adspiratio, or \"inspiration,\" is in Greek <\\i>\\pnoh<\\|i>\\, the same word which is translated flatus, \"breath,\" in the passage quoted from the prophet. Therefore, although it is rash to deny that the passage, \"Who giveth breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk over it,\" has reference to the soul or spirit of man,-although the Holy Ghost may with greater credibility be understood as referred to in the passage: yet I ask on what ground anybody can boldly determine that the prophet meant in these words to intimate that the soul or spirit whereby our nature possesses vitality [is not given to us by God through the process of propagation?][fn-45-P4530_1731265:25-nf] Of course if the prophet had very plainly said, \"Who giveth soul to the people upon earth,\" it still would remain to be asked whether God Himself gives it from an origin in the preceding generation, just as He gives the body out of such prior material, and that not only to men or cattle, but also to the seed of corn, or to any other body whatever. just as it pleases Him; or whether He bestows it by inbreathing as a new gift to each individual, as the first man received it from Him?","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_31_book_i_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"95","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"He goes on to remark: \"But the apostle, by saying, `And He Himself giveth life and spirit to all,' and then by adding the words, `And hath made the whole race of men of one blood,'[fn-45-P4572_1750489:40-nf] has referred this soul and spirit to the Creator in respect of their origin, and the body to propagation.\" Now, certainly any one who does not wish to deny at random the propagation of souls, before ascertaining clearly whether the opinion is correct or not, has ground for understanding, from the apostle's words, that he meant the expression, of one blood, to be equivalent to of one man, by the figure of speech which understands the whole from its part. Well, then, if it be allowable for this man to take the whole from a part in the passage, \"And man became a living soul,\"[fn-45-P4573_1751089:41-nf] as if the spirit also was understood to be implied, about which the Scripture there said nothing, why is it not allowable to others to attribute an equally comprehensive sense to the expression, of one blood, so that the soul and spirit may be considered as included in it, on the ground that the human being who is signified by the term \"blood\" consists not of body alone, but also of soul and spirit? For just as the controversialist who maintains the propagation of souls, ought not, on the one hand, to press this man too hard, because the Scripture says concerning the first man, \"In whom all have i sinned\"[fn-45-P4574_1751719:42-nf] (for the expression is not, In whom the flesh of all has sinned, but \"all,\" that is, \"allmen,\" seeing that man is not flesh only);-as, I repeat, he ought not to be too hard pressed himself, because it happens to be written \"all men,\" in such a way that they might be understood simply in respect of the flesh; so, on the other hand, he ought not to bear too hard on those who hold the propagation of souls, on the ground of the phrase, \"The whole race of men of one blood,\" as if this passage proved that flesh alone was transmitted by propagation. For if it is true, as they[fn-45-P4575_1752312:43-nf] assert, that soul does not descend from soul, but flesh only from flesh, then the expression, \"of one blood,\" does not signify the entire human being, on the principle of a part for the whole, but merely the flesh of one person alone; while that other expression, \"In whom all have sinned,\" must be so understood as to indicate merely the flesh of all men, which has been handed on from the first man, the Scripture signifying a part by the whole. If, on the other hand, it is true that the entire human being is propagated of each man, himself also entire, consisting of body, soul, and spirit, then the passage, \"In whom all have sinned,\" must be taken in its proper literal sense; and the other phrase, \"of one blood,\" is used metaphorically, the whole being signified by a part, that is to say, the whole man who consists of soul and flesh; or rather (as this person is fond of putting it) of soul, and spirit, and flesh. For both modes of expression the Holy Scriptures are in the habit of employing, putting both a part for the whole and the whole for a part. A part, for instance, implies the whole, in the place where it is said, \"Unto Thee shall all flesh come;\"[fn-45-P4576_1753557:44-nf] the whole man being understood by the term flesh. And the whole sometimes implies a part, as when it is said that Christ was buried, whereas it was only His flesh that was buried. Now as regards the statement which is made in the apostle's testimony, to the effect that \"He giveth life and spirit to all,\" I suppose that nobody, after the foregoing discussion, will be moved by it. No doubt \"He giveth;\" the fact is not in dispute; our question is, How does He give it? By fresh inbreathing in every instance, or by propagation? For with perfect propriety is He said to give the substance of the flesh to the human being, though at the same time it is not denied that He gives it by means of propagation.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_31_book_i_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Let us now look at the quotation from Genesis, where the woman was created out of the side of the man, and was brought to him, and he said: \"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.\" Our opponent thinks that \"Adam ought to have said, 'Soul of my soul, or spirit of my spirit,' if this, too, had been derived from him.\" But, in fact, they who maintain the opinion of the propagation of souls feel that they possess a more impregnable defence of their position in the fact that in the Scripture narrative which informs us that God took a rib out of the man's side and formed it into a woman, it is not added that He breathed into her face the breath of life; for this reason, as they say, because she had already been ensouled[fn-45-P4580_1755084:45-nf] from the man.

So likewise, if it had been said, \"soul of my soul,\" the flesh would not be denied, of course, which evidently had been taken out of the man. Constantly does Holy Scripture indicate the whole by a part, and a part by the whole. For certainly, if in the passage which this man has quoted as his proof it had been said that the human race had been made, not \"of one blood,\" but \"of one man,\" it could not have prejudiced the opinion of those who deny the propagation of souls, although man is not soul alone, nor only flesh, but both. For they would have their answer ready to this effect, that the Scripture here might have meant to indicate a part by the whole, that is to say, the flesh only by the entire human being. In like manner, they who maintain the propagation of souls contend that in the passage where it is said, \"of one blood,\" the human being is implied by the term \"blood,\" on the principle of the whole being expressed by a part. For just as the one party seems to be assisted by the expression, \"of one blood,\" instead of the phrase, \"of one man,\" so the other side evidently gets countenance from the statement being so plainly written, \"By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all sinned,\"[fn-47-P4708_1821635:34-nf] instead of its being said, \"in whom the flesh of all sinned.\" Similarly, as one party seems to receive assistance from the fact that Scripture says, \"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,\" on the ground that a part covers the whole; so, again, the other side derives some advantage from what is written in the immediate sequel of the passage, \"She shall be called woman, because she was taken out of her husband.\" For,according to their contention, the latter clauseshould have run, \"Because her flesh was takenout of her husband,\" if it was not true that the entire woman, soul and all, but only her flesh, was taken out of man. The fact, however, of the whole matter is simply this, that after hearing both sides, anybody whose judgment is free from party prejudice sees at once that loose quotation is unavailing in this controversy; for against one party, which maintains the opinion of the propagation of souls, those passages must not be adduced which mention only a part, inasmuch as the Scripture might mean by the part to imply the whole in all such passages; as, for instance, when we read, \"The Word was made flesh,\"[fn-47-P4709_1822795:35-nf] we of course understand not the flesh only, but the entire human being; nor against the other party, who deny this doctrine of the soul's propagation, is it of any avail to quote those passages which do not mention a part of the human being, but the whole; because in these the Scripture might possibly mean to imply a part by the whole; as we confess that Christ was buried, whereas it was only His flesh that was laid in the sepulchre. We therefore say, that on such grounds there is no ground on the one hand for rashly constructing, nor on the other hand for, with equal rashness, demolishing the theory of propagation; but we add this advice, that other passages be duly looked out, such as admit of no ambiguity.[fn-47-P4710_1823531:36-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_122_from_the_discourse_on_the_resurrection_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-06","text":"II.

Read a compendious interpretation of some apostolic words from the same discourse. Let us see, then, what it is that we have endeavoured to say respecting the apostle. For this saying of his, \"I was alive without the law once,\"[fn-58-P5856_1773244:60-nf] refers to the life which was lived in paradise before the law, not without a body, but with a body, by our first parents, as we have shown above; for we lived without concupiscence, being altogether ignorant of its assaults. For not to have a law according to which we ought to live, nor a power of establishing what manner of life we ought to adopt, so that we might justly be approved or blamed, is considered to exempt a person from accusation. Because one cannot lust after those things from which he is not restrained, and even if he lusted after them, he would not be blamed. For lust is not directed to things which are before us, and subject to our power, but to those which are before us, and not in our power. For how should one care for a thing which is neither forbidden nor necessary to him? And for this reason it is said, \"I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.\"[fn-58-P5857_1774171:61-nf] For when (our first parents) heard, \"Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shall not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die,\"[fn-58-P5858_1774358:62-nf] then they conceived lust, and gathered it. Therefore was it said, I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet; \"nor would they have desired to eat, except it had been said, \"Thou shalt not eat of it.\" For it was thence that sin took occasion to deceive me. For when the law was given, the devil had it in his power to work lust in me; \"for without the law, sin was dead; \"[fn-58-P5859_1774773:63-nf] which means \"when the law was not given, sin could not be committed.\" But I was alive and blameless before the law, having no commandment in accordance with which it was necessary to live; \"but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.

Read a compendious interpretation of some apostolic words from the same discourse. Let us see, then, what it is that we have endeavoured to say respecting the apostle. For this saying of his, \"I was alive without the law once,\"[fn-58-P5856_1773244:60-nf] refers to the life which was lived in paradise before the law, not without a body, but with a body, by our first parents, as we have shown above; for we lived without concupiscence, being altogether ignorant of its assaults. For not to have a law according to which we ought to live, nor a power of establishing what manner of life we ought to adopt, so that we might justly be approved or blamed, is considered to exempt a person from accusation. Because one cannot lust after those things from which he is not restrained, and even if he lusted after them, he would not be blamed. For lust is not directed to things which are before us, and subject to our power, but to those which are before us, and not in our power. For how should one care for a thing which is neither forbidden nor necessary to him? And for this reason it is said, \"I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.\"[fn-58-P5857_1774171:61-nf] For when (our first parents) heard, \"Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shall not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die,\"[fn-58-P5858_1774358:62-nf] then they conceived lust, and gathered it. Therefore was it said, I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet; \"nor would they have desired to eat, except it had been said, \"Thou shalt not eat of it.\" For it was thence that sin took occasion to deceive me. For when the law was given, the devil had it in his power to work lust in me; \"for without the law, sin was dead; \"[fn-58-P5859_1774773:63-nf] which means \"when the law was not given, sin could not be committed.\" But I was alive and blameless before the law, having no commandment in accordance with which it was necessary to live; \"but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.

For you have not merely aspersed with your censure those who are affected with the same ignorance as I am myself labouring under, that is to say, concerning the origin of the human soul (although I am not indeed absolutely ignorant even on this point, for I know that God breathed into the face of the first man, and that \"man then became a living soul,\"[fn-48-P4831_1891415:2-nf] -a truth, however, which I could never have known by myself, unless I had read of it in the Scripture); but you asked in so many words, \"What difference is there between a man and a brute beast, if he knows not how to discuss and determine his own quality and nature?\" And you seem to have entertained your opinion so distinctly, as to have thought that a man ought to be able to discuss and determine the facts of his own entire quality and nature so clearly, that nothing concerning himself should escape his observation. Now, if this is really the truth of the matter, I must now compare you to \"the cattle,\" if you cannot tell me the precise number of the hairs of your head. But if, however far we may advance in this life, you allow us to be ignorant of sundry facts appertaining to our nature,I then want to know how far your concession extends, lest, perchance, it may include the very point we are now raising, that we do not by any means know the origin of our soul; although we know,-a thing which belongs to faith,- beyond all doubt, that the soul is a gift to man from God, and that it still is not of the same nature as God Himself. Do you, moreover, think that each person's ignorance of his own nature must be exactly on the same level as your ignorance of it? Must everybody's knowledge, too, of the subject be equal to what you have been able to attain to? So that if he is so unfortunate as to possess a slightly larger amount of ignorance than yourself, you must compare him with cattle; and on the same principle, if any one shall be ever so little wiser than yourself on this subject, he will have the pleasure of comparing you with equal justice to the aforesaid cattle. I must therefore request you to tell me, to what extent you permit us to be ignorant of our nature so as to save our distance from the formidable cattle; and I beg you besides duly to reflect, whether he is not further removed from cattle who knows his ignorance of any part of the subject, than he is who thinks he knows what in fact he knows not. The entire nature of man is certainly spirit, soul, and body; therefore, whoever would alienate the body from man's nature, is unwise. Those medical men, however, who are called anatomists have investigated with careful scrutiny, by dissecting processes, even living men, so far as men have been able to retain any life in the hands of the examiners; their researches have penetrated limbs, veins, nerves, bones, marrow, the internal vitals; and all to discover the nature of the body. But none of these men have ever thought of comparing us with the cattle, because of our ignorance of their subject. But perhaps you will say that it is those who are ignorant of the nature of the soul, not of the body, who are to be compared with the brute beasts. Then you ought not to have expressed yourself at starting in the way you have done. Your words are not, \"For what difference is there between a man and cattle, if he is ignorant of the nature and quality of the soul;\" but you say, \"if he knows not how to discuss and determine his own nature and quality.\" Of course our quality and our nature must be taken account of together with the body, but at the same time the investigation of the several elements of which we are composed is conducted in each case separately. For my own part, indeed, if I wished to display how far it was in my power to treat scientifically and intelligently the entire field of man's nature, I should have to fill many volumes; not to mention how many topics there are which I must confess my ignorance of.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_19_sermon_ii_lii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"10.

Now, it will first by necessary to show what previous reason there was for the Son of God's being born of a virgin. He who was going to consecrate a new order of birth, must Himself be born after a novel fashion, concerning which Isaiah foretold how that the Lord Himself would give the sign. What, then, is the sign? \"Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.\"[fn-95-P9534_2616751:243-nf] Accordingly, a virgin did conceive and bear \"Emmanuel, God with us.\"[fn-95-P9535_2616841:244-nf] This is the new nativity; a man is born in God. And in this man God was born, taking the flesh of an ancient race, without the help, however, of the ancient seed, in order that He might reform it with a new seed, that is, in a spiritual manner, and cleanse it by the re-moral of all its ancient stains. But the whole of this new birth was prefigured, as was the case in all other instances, in ancient type, the Lord being born as man by a dispensation in which a virgin was the medium. The earth was still in a virgin state, reduced as yet by no human labour, with no seed as yet cast into its furrows, when, as we are told, God made man out of it into a living soul.[fn-95-P9536_2617530:245-nf] As, then, the first Adam is thus introduced to us, it is a just inference that the second Adam likewise, as the apostle has told us, was formed by God into a quickening spirit out of the ground,-in other words, out of a flesh which was unstained as yet by any human generation. But that I may lose no opportunity of supporting my argument from the name of Adam, why is Christ called Adam by the apostle, unless it be that, as man, He was of that earthly origin? And even reason here maintains the same conclusion, because it was by just the contrary[fn-95-P9537_2618099:246-nf] operation that God recovered His own image and likeness, of which He had been robbed by the devil. For it was while Eve was yet a virgin, that the ensnaring word had crept into her ear which was to build the edifice of death. Into a virgin's soul, in like manner, must be introduced that Word of God which was to raise the fabric of life; so that what had been reduced to ruin by this sex, might by the selfsame sex be recovered to salvation. As Eve had believed the serpent, so Mary believed the angel.[fn-95-P9538_2618618:247-nf] The delinquency which the one occasioned by believing, the other by believing effaced. But (it will be said) Eve did not at the devil's word conceive in her womb. Well, she at all events conceived; for the devil's word afterwards became as seed to her that she should conceive as an outcast, and bring forth in sorrow. Indeed she gave birth to a fratricidal devil; whilst Mary, on the contrary, bare one who was one day to secure salvation to Israel, His own brother after the flesh, and the murderer of Himself. God therefore sent down into the virgin's womb His Word, as the good Brother, who should blot out the memory of the evil brother. Hence it was necessary that Christ should come forth for the salvation of man, in that condition of flesh into which man had entered ever since his condemnation.

Indeed, the truth about the image could never have been maintained if the beauty reflected in that image had been in the slightest degree opposed[fn-27-P2751_1876176:68-nf] to the Archetypal Beauty. Passion was introduced afterwards, subsequent to man's first organization; and it was in this way. Being the image and the likeness, as has been said, of the Power which rules all things, man kept also in the matter of a Free-Will this likeness to Him whose Will is over all. He was enslaved to no outward necessity whatever; his feeling towards that which pleased him depended only on his own private judgment; he was free to choose whatever he liked; and so he was a free agent, though circumvented with cunning, when he drew upon himself that disaster which now overwhelms humanity. He became himself the discoverer of evil, but he did not therein discover what God had made; for God did not make death. Man became, in fact, himself the fabricator, to a certain extent, and the craftsman of evil. All who have the faculty of sight may enjoy equally the sunlight; and any one can if he likes put this enjoyment from him by shutting his eyes: in that case it is not that the sun retires and produces that darkness, but the man himself puts a barrier between his eye and the sunshine; the faculty of vision cannot indeed, even in the closing of the eyes, remain inactive[fn-27-P2752_1877419:69-nf] , and so this operative sight necessarily becomes an operative darkness[fn-27-P2753_1877504:70-nf] rising up in the man from his own free act in ceasing to see. Again, a man in building a house for himself may omit to make in it any way of entrance for the light; he will necessarily be in darkness, though he cuts himself off from the light voluntarily. So the first man on the earth, or rather he who generated evil in man, had for choice the Good and the Beautiful lying all around him in the very nature of things; yet he wilfully cut out a new way for himself against this nature, and in the act of turning away from virtue, which was his own free act, he created the usage of evil. For, be it observed, there is no such thing in the world as evil irrespective of a will, and discoverable in a substance apart from that. Every creature of God is good, and nothing of His \"to be rejected\"; all that God made was \"very good[fn-27-P2754_1878356:71-nf] .\" But the habit of sinning entered as we have described, and with fatal quickness, into the life of man; and from that small beginning spread into this infinitude of evil. Then that godly beauty of the soul which was an imitation of the Archetypal Beauty, like fine steel blackened[fn-27-P2755_1878669:72-nf] with the vicious rust, preserved no longer the glory of its familiar essence, but was disfigured with the ugliness of sin. This thing so great and precious[fn-27-P2756_1878843:73-nf] , as the Scripture calls him, this being man, has fallen from his proud birthright. As those who have slipped and fallen heavily into mud, and have all their features so besmeared with it, that their nearest friends do not recognize them, so this creature has fallen into the mire of sin and lost the blessing of being an image of the imperishable Deity; he has clothed himself instead with a perishable and foul resemblance to something else; and this Reason counsels him to put away again by washing it off in the cleansing water of this calling[fn-27-P2757_1879651:74-nf] . The earthly envelopment once removed, the soul's beauty will again appear. Now the putting off of a strange accretion is equivalent to the return to that which is familiar and natural; yet such a return cannot be but by again becoming that which in the beginning we were created. In fact this likeness to the divine is not our work at all; it is not the achievement of any faculty of man; it is the great gift of God bestowed upon our nature at the very moment of our birth; human efforts can only go so far as to clear away the filth of sin, and so cause the buried beauty of the soul to shine forth again. This truth is, I think, taught in the Gospel, when our Lord says, to those who can hear what Wisdom speaks beneath a mystery, that \"the Kingdom of God is within you[fn-27-P2758_1880490:75-nf] .\" That word[fn-27-P2759_1880526:76-nf] points out the fact that the Divine good is not something apart from our nature, and is not removed far away from those who have the will to seek it; it is in fact within each of us, ignored indeed, and unnoticed while it is stifled beneath the cares and pleasures of life, but found again whenever we can turn our power of conscious thinking towards it. If further confirmation of what we say is required, I think it will be found in what is suggested by our Lord in the searching for the Lost Drachma[fn-27-P2760_1881122:77-nf] . The thought, there, is that the widowed soul reaps no benefit from the other virtues (called drachmas in the Parable) being all of them found safe, if that one other is not amongst them. The Parable therefore suggests that a candle should first be lit, signifying doubtless our reason which throws light on hidden principles; then that in one's own house, that is, within oneself, we should search for that lost coin; and by that coin the Parable doubtless hints at the image of our King, not yet hopelessly lost, but hidden beneath the dirt; and by this last we must understand the impurities of the flesh, which, being swept and purged away by carefulness of life, leave clear to the view the object of our search. Then it is meant that the soul herself who finds this rejoices over it, and with her the neighbours, whom she calls in to share with her in this delight. Verily, all those powers which are the housemates of the soul, and which the Parable names her neighbours for this occasion[fn-27-P2761_1882139:78-nf] , when so be that the image of the mighty King is revealed in all its brightness at last (that image which the Fashioner of each individual heart of us has stamped upon this our Drachma[fn-27-P2762_1882335:79-nf] ), will then be converted to that divine delight and festivity, and will gaze upon the ineffable beauty of the recovered one. \"Rejoice with me,\" she says, \"because I have found the Drachma which I had lost.\" The neighbours, that is, the soul's familiar powers, both the reasoning and the appetitive, the affections of grief and of anger, and all the rest that are discerned in her, at that joyful feast which celebrates the finding of the heavenly Drachma are well called her friends also; and it is meet that they should all rejoice in the Lord when they all look towards the Beautiful and the Good, and do everything for the glory of God, no longer instruments of sin[fn-27-P2763_1883036:80-nf] . If, then, such is the lesson of this Finding of the lost, viz. that we should restore the divine image from the foulness which the flesh wraps round it to its primitive state, let us become that which the First Man was at the moment when he first breathed. And what was that? Destitute he was then of his covering of dead skins, but he could gaze without shrinking upon God's countenance. He did not yet judge of what was lovely by taste or sight; he found in the Lord alone all that was sweet; and he used the helpmeet given him only for this delight, as Scripture signifies when it said that \"he knew her not[fn-27-P2764_1883667:81-nf] \" till he was driven forth from the garden, and till she, for the sin which she was decoyed into committing, was sentenced to the pangs of childbirth. We, then, who in our first ancestor were thus ejected, are allowed to return to our earliest state of blessedness by the very same stages by which we lost Paradise. What are they? Pleasure, craftily offered, began the Fall, and there followed after pleasure shame, and fear, even to remain longer in the sight of their Creator, so that they hid themselves in leaves and shade; and after that they covered themselves with the skins of dead animals; and then were sent forth into this pestilential and exacting land where, as the compensation for having to die, marriage was instituted[fn-27-P2765_1884419:82-nf] . Now if we are destined \"to depart hence, and be with Christ[fn-27-P2766_1884500:83-nf] ,\" we must begin at the end of the route of departure (which ties nearest to ourselves); just as those who have travelled far from their friends at home, when they turn to reach again the place from which they started, first leave that district which they reached at the end of their outward journey. Marriage, then, is the last stage of our separation from the life that was led in Paradise; marriage therefore, as our discourse has been suggesting, is the first thing to be left; it is the first station as it were for our departure to Christ. Next, we must retire from all anxious toil upon the land, such as man was bound to after his sin. Next we must divest ourselves of those coverings of our nakedness, the coats of skins, namely the wisdom of the flesh; we must renounce all shameful things done in secret[fn-27-P2767_1885336:84-nf] , and be covered no longer with the fig-leaves of this bitter world; then, when we have torn off the coatings of this life's perishable leaves, we must stand again in the sight of our Creator; and repelling all the illusion of taste and sight, take for our guide God's commandment only, instead of the venom-spitting serpent. That commandment was, to touch nothing but what was Good, and to leave what was evil untasted; because impatience to remain any longer in ignorance of evil would be but the beginning of the long train of actual evil. For this reason it was forbidden to our first parents to grasp the knowledge of the opposite to the good, as well as that of the good itself; they were to keep themselves from \"the knowledge of good and evil[fn-27-P2768_1886106:85-nf] ,\" and to enjoy the Good in its purity, unmixed with one particle of evil: and to enjoy that, is in my judgment nothing else than to be ever with God, and to feel ceaselessly and continually this delight, unalloyed by aught that could tear us away from it. One might even be bold to say that this might be found the way by which a man could be again caught up into Paradise out of this world which lieth in the Evil, into that Paradise where Paul was when he saw the unspeakable sights which it is not lawful for a man to talk of[fn-27-P2769_1886654:86-nf] .","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_36_book_i_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But now let us see what follows. \"They say also,\" he says, \"that those marriages which are now celebrated were not appointed by God, and this is to be read in Augustin's book,[fn-50-P5070_1998261:18-nf] against which I replied in four books.

On that point, with God's assistance, I must contend with him as far as the matter shall seem to demand. Now, therefore, I reply that marriage was ordained by God both then, when it was said, \"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh,\"[fn-50-P5071_1998944:19-nf] and now, wherefore it is written, \"A woman is joined to a man by the Lord.\"[fn-50-P5072_1999038:20-nf] For nothing else is even now done than that a man cleave to his wife, and they become two in one flesh.

And to the testimony of the law on the occasion mentioned, He added, \"What, therefore, God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\"[fn-50-P5073_1999455:21-nf] The Apostle Paul also applied this witness of the law when he admonished husbands that their wives should be loved by theme.[fn-50-P5074_1999602:22-nf] Away, then, with the notion that in my book that man should read anything opposed to these divine testimonies! But either by not understanding, or rather by calumniating, he seeks to twist what he reads into another meaning. But I wrote my book, against which he mentions that he replied in four books, after the condemnation of Pelagius and Coelestius. And this, I have thought, must be said, because that man avers that my words had been taken up by his enemies in hostility to the truth, lest any one should think that these new heretics were condemned as enemies of the grace of Christ on account of this book of mine.

Augustin replied: The Apostle Paul certainly uses the expression the inner man for the spirit of the mind, and the outer man for the body and for this mortal life; but we nowhere find him making these two different men, but one, which is all made by God, both the inner and the outer. However, it is made in the image of God only as regards the inner, which, besides being immaterial, is rational, and is not possessed by the lower animals. God, then, did not make one man after His own image, and another man not after that image; but the one man, which includes both the inner and the outer, He made after His own image, not as regards the possession of a body and of mortal life, but as regards the rational mind with the power of knowing God, and with the superiority as compared with all irrational creatures which the possession of reason implies. Faustus allows that the inner man is made by God, when, as he says, it is renewed in the knowledge of God after the image of Him that created him. I readily admit this on the apostle's authority. Why does not Faustus admit on the same authority that \"God has placed the members every one in the body, as it has pleased Him\"?[fn-23-P2350_1423689:9-nf] Here we learn from the same apostle that God is the framer of the outer man too. Why does Faustus take only what he thinks to be in his own favor, while he leaves out or rejects what upsets the follies of the Manichaeans? Moreover, in treating of the earthy and the heavenly man, and making the distinction between the mortal and the immortal, between that which we are in Adam and that which we shall be in Christ, the apostle quotes the declaration of the law regarding the earthy or natural body, referring to the very book and the very passage where it is written that God made the earthy man too. Speaking of the manner in which the dead shall rise again, and of the body with which they shall come, after using the similitude of the seeds of corn, that they are sown bare grain, and that God gives them a body as it pleases Him, and to every seed his own body,-thus, by the way, overthrowing the error of the Manichaeans, who say that grains and plants, and all roots and shoots, are created by the race of darkness, and not by God, who, according to them, instead of exerting power in the production of these objects, is Himself subject to confinement in them,-he goes on, after this refutation of Manichaean impieties, to describe the different kinds of flesh. \"All flesh,\" he says, \"is not the same flesh.\" Then he speaks of celestial and terrestrial bodies, and then of the change of our body by which it will become spiritual and heavenly. \"It is sown,\" he says, \"in dishonor, it shall rise in glory; it is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power; it is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body.\" Then, in order to show the origin of the animal body, he says, \"There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body; as it is written, The first man, Adam, was made a living soul.\"[fn-23-P2351_1425513:10-nf] Now this is written in Genesis,[fn-23-P2352_1425568:11-nf] where it is related how God made man, and animated the body which He had formed of the earth. By the old man the apostle simply means the old life, which is a life in sin, and is after the manner of Adam, of whom it is said, \"By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, in that all have sinned.\"[fn-23-P2353_1425928:12-nf] Thus the whole of this man, both the inner and the outer part, has become old because of sin, and liable to the punishment of mortality. There is, however, a restoration of the inner man, when it is renewed after the image of its Creator, in the putting off of unrighteousness-that is, the old man, and putting on righteousness-that is, the new man. But when that which is sown a natural body shall rise a spiritual body, the outer man too shall attain the dignity of a celestial character; so that all that has been created may be created anew, and all that has been made be remade by the Creator and Maker Himself. This is briefly explained in the words: \"The body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead will also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit dwelling in you.\"[fn-23-P2354_1426867:13-nf] No one instructed in the Catholic doctrine but knows that it is in the body that some are male and some female, not in the spirit of the mind, in which we are renewed after the image of God. But elsewhere the apostle teaches that God is the Maker of both; for he says, \"Neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord; for as the woman is of the man, so is the man by the woman; but all things are of God.\"[fn-23-P2355_1427331:14-nf] The only reply given to this, by the perverse stupidity of those who are alienated from the life of God by the ignorance which is in them, on account of the blindness of their heart, is, that whatever pleases them in the apostolic writings is true, and whatever displeases them is false. This is the insanity of the Manichaeans, who will be wise if they cease to be Manichaeans. As it is, if they are asked whether it is He that remakes and renews the inner man (which they acknowledge to be renewed after the image of God, and they themselves quote the passage in support of this; and, according to Faustus, God makes man when the inner man is renewed in the image of God), they will answer, yes. And if we then go on to ask when God made what He now renews, they must devise some subterfuge to prevent the exposure of their absurdities. For, according to them, the inner man is not formed or created or originated by God, but is part of His own substance sent against His enemies; and instead of becoming old by sin, it is through necessity captured and damaged by the enemy. Not to repeat all the nonsense they talk, the first man they speak of is not the man of the earth earthy that the apostle speaks of,[fn-23-P2356_1428566:15-nf] but an invention proceeding from their own magazine of untruths. Faustus, though he chooses man as a subject for discussion, says not a word of this first man; for he is afraid that his opponents in the discussion might come to know something about him.","title":"Book XXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_41_the_epistle_of_barnabas","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Further,[fn-33-P3388_576345:211-nf] also, it is written concerning the Sabbath in the Decalogue which [the Lord] spoke, face to face, to Moses on Mount Sinai, \"And sanctify ye the Sabbath of the Lord with clean hands and a pure heart.\"[fn-33-P3389_576616:212-nf] And He says in another place, \"If my sons keep the Sabbath, then will I cause my mercy to rest upon them.\"[fn-33-P3390_576754:213-nf] The Sabbath is mentioned at the beginning of the creation [thus]: \"And God made in six days the works of His hands, and made an end on the seventh day, and rested on it, and sanctified it.\"[fn-33-P3391_576970:214-nf] Attend, my children, to the meaning of this expression, \"He finished in six days.\" This implieth that the Lord will finish all things in six thousand years, for a day is[fn-33-P3392_577246:215-nf] with Him a thousand years.

Now, when God handled the clay for the express purpose of the growth of flesh out of it afterwards, it was for the flesh that He took all the trouble. But I want you, moreover, to know at what time and in what manner the flesh flourished into beauty out of its clay. For it cannot be, as some will have it, that those \"coats of skins\"[fn-97-P9749_2676172:49-nf] which Adam and Eve put on when they were stripped of paradise, were really themselves the forming of the flesh out of clay,[fn-97-P9750_2676315:50-nf] because long before that Adam had already recognised the flesh which was in the woman as the propagation of his own substance (\"This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh \"[fn-97-P9751_2676523:51-nf] ), and the very taking of the woman out of the man was supplemented with flesh; but it ought, I should suppose, to have been made good with clay, if Adam was still clay. The clay, therefore, was obliterated and absorbed into flesh. When did this happen? At the time that man became a living soul by the inbreathing of God-by the breath indeed which was capable of hardening clay into another substance, as into some earthenware, so now into flesh. In the same way the potter, too, has it in his power, by tempering the blast of his fire, to modify his clayey material into a stiffer one, and to mould one form after another more beautiful than the original substance, and now possessing both a kind and name of its own. For although the Scripture says, \"Shall the clay say to the potter? \"[fn-97-P9752_2677331:52-nf] that is, Shall man contend with God? although the apostle speaks of \"earthen vessels\"[fn-97-P9753_2677435:53-nf] he refers to man, who was originally clay. And the vessel is the flesh, because this was made of clay by the breath of the divine afflatus; and it was afterwards clothed with \"the coats of skins,\" that is, with the cutaneous covering which was placed over it. So truly is this the fact, that if you withdraw the skin, you lay bare the flesh. Thus, that which becomes a spoil when stripped off, was a vestment as long as it remained laid over. Hence the apostle, when he call circumcision \"a putting off (or spoliation) of the flesh,\"[fn-97-P9754_2677988:54-nf] affirmed the skin to be a coat or tunic. Now this being the case, you have both the clay made glorious by the hand of God, and the flesh more glorious still by His breathing upon it, by virtue of which the flesh not only laid aside its clayey rudiments, but also took on itself the ornaments of the soul. You surely are not more careful than God, that you indeed should refuse to mount the gems of Scythia and India and the pearls of the Red Sea in lead, or brass, or iron, or even in silver, but should set them in the most precious and most highly-wrought gold; or, again, that you should provide for your finest wines and most costly unguents the most fitting vessels; or, on the same principle, should find for your swords of finished temper scabbards of equal worth; whilst God must consign to some vilest sheath the shadow of His own soul, the breath of His own Spirit, the operation of His own mouth, and by so ignominious a consignment secure, of course, its condemnation. Well, then, has He placed, or rather inserted and commingled, it with the flesh? Yes; and so intimate is the union, that it may be deemed to be uncertain whether the flesh bears about the soul, or the soul the flesh; or whether the flesh acts as apparitor to the soul, or the soul to the flesh. It is, However, more credible that the soul has service rendered to it,[fn-97-P9755_2679355:55-nf] and has the mastery,[fn-97-P9756_2679389:56-nf] as being more proximate in character to God.[fn-97-P9757_2679449:57-nf] This circumstance even redounds to the glory of the flesh, inasmuch as it both contains an essence nearest to God's, and renders itself a partake of (the soul's) actual sovereignty. For what enjoyment of nature is there, what produce of the world, what relish of the elements, which is not imparted to the soul by means of the body? How can it be otherwise? Is it not by its means that the soul is supported by the entire apparatus of the senses-the sight, the hearing, the taste, the smell, the touch? Is it not by its means that it has a sprinkling of the divine power, there being nothing which it does not effect by its faculty of speech, even when it is only tacitly indicated? And speech is the result of a fleshly organ. The arts come through the flesh; through the flesh also effect is given to the mind's pursuits and powers; all work, too, and business and offices of life, are accomplished by the flesh; and so utterly, are the living acts of the soul the work of the flesh, that for the soul to cease to do living acts, would be nothing else than sundering itself from the flesh. So also the very act of dying is a function of the flesh, even as the process of life is. Now, if all things are subject to the soul through the flesh, their subjection is equally due to the flesh. That which is the means and agent of your enjoyment, must needs be also the partaker and sharer of your enjoyment. So that the flesh, which is accounted the minister and servant of the soul, turns out to be also its associate and co-heir. And if all this in temporal things, why not also in things eternal?","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":55,"source_paragraph":"173","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Some, however, contend that the soul is \"the natural (or animate) body, \"[fn-102-P10242_2860825:404-nf] with the view of withdrawing the flesh from all connection with the risen body. Now, since it is a clear and fixed point that the body which is to rise again is that which was sown in death, they must be challenged to an examination of the very fact itself. Else let them show that the soul was sown after death; in a word, that it underwent death,-that is, was demolished, dismembered, dissolved in the ground, nothing of which was ever decreed against it by God: let them display to our view its corruptibility and dishonour (as well as) its weakness, that it may also accrue to it to rise again in incorruption, and in glory, and in power.[fn-102-P10243_2861721:405-nf] Now in the ease of Lazarus, (which we may take as) the palmary instance of a resurrection, the flesh lay prostrate in weakness, the flesh was almost putrid in the dishonour of its decay, the flesh stank in corruption, and yet it was as flesh that Lazarus rose again-with his soul, no doubt. But that soul was incorrupt; nobody had wrapped it in its linen swathes; nobody had deposited it in a grave; nobody had yet perceived it \"stink; \"nobody for four days had seen it \"sown.\" Well, now, this entire condition, this whole end of Lazarus, the flesh indeed of all men is still experiencing, but the soul of no one. That substance, therefore, to which the apostle's whole description manifestly refers, of which he clearly speaks, must be both the natural (or animate) body when it is sown, and the spiritual body when it is raised again. For in order that you may understand it in this sense, he points to this same conclusion, when in like manner, on the authority of the same passage of Scripture, he displays to us \"the first man Adam as made a living soul.\"[fn-102-P10244_2862808:406-nf] Now since Adam was the first man, since also the flesh was man prior to the soul[fn-102-P10245_2862929:407-nf] it undoubtedly follows that it was the flesh that became the living soul. Moreover, since it was a bodily substance that assumed this condition, it was of course the natural (or animate) body that became the living soul. By what designation would they have it called, except that which it became through the soul, except that which it was not previous to the soul, except that which it can never be after the soul, but through its resurrection? For after it has recovered the soul, it once more becomes the natural (or animate) body, in order that it may become a spiritual body. For it only resumes in the resurrection the condition which it once had. There is therefore by no means the same good reason why the soul should be called the natural (or animate) body, which the flesh has for bearing that designation. The flesh, in fact, was a body before it was an animate body. When the flesh was joined by the soul,[fn-102-P10246_2863906:408-nf] it then became the natural (or animate) body. Now, although the soul is a corporeal substance,[fn-102-P10247_2864017:409-nf] yet, as it is not an animated body, but rather an animating one, it cannot be called the animate (or natural) body, nor can it become that thing which it produces. It is indeed when the soul accrues to something else that it makes that thing animate; but unless it so accrues, how will it ever produce animation? As therefore the flesh was at first an animate (or natural) body on receiving the soul, so at last will it become a spiritual body when invested with the spirit. Now the apostle, by severally adducing this order in Adam and in Christ, fairly distinguishes between the two states, in the very essentials of their difference. And when he calls Christ \"the last Adam,\"[fn-102-P10248_2864797:410-nf] you may from this circumstance discover how strenuously he labours to establish throughout his teaching the resurrection of the flesh, not of the soul. Thus, then, the first man Adam was flesh, not soul, and only afterwards became a living soul; and the last Adam, Christ, was Adam only because He was man, and only man as being flesh, not as being soul. Accordingly the apostle goes on to say: \"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual,\"[fn-102-P10249_2865329:411-nf] as in the case of the two Adams. Now, do you not suppose that he is distinguishing between the natural body and the spiritual body in the same flesh, after having already drawn the distinction therein in the two Adams, that is, in the first man and in the last? For from which substance is it that Christ and Adam have a parity with each other? No doubt it is from their flesh, although it may be from their soul also. It is, however, in respect of the flesh that they are both man; for the flesh was man prior to the saul. It was actually from it that they were able to take rank, so as to be deemed-one the first, and the other the last man, or Adam. Besides, things which are different in character are only incapable of being arranged in the same order when their diversity is one of substance; for when it is a diversity either in respect of place, or of time, or of condition, they probably do admit of classification together. Here, however, they are called first and last, from the substance of their (common) flesh, just as afterwards again the first man (is said to be) of the earth, and the second of heaven;[fn-102-P10250_2866471:412-nf] but although He is \"of heaven\" in respect of the spirit, He is yet man according to the flesh. Now since it is the flesh, and not the soul, that makes an order (or classification together) in the two Adams compatible, so that the distinction is drawn between them of \"the first man becoming a living soul, and the last a quickening spirit,\"[fn-102-P10251_2866828:413-nf] so in like manner this distinction between them has already suggested the conclusion that the distinction is due to the flesh; so that it is of the flesh that these words speak: \"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual.\"[fn-102-P10252_2867137:414-nf] And thus, too, the same flesh must be understood in a preceding passage: \"That which is sown is the natural body, and that which rises again is the spiritual body; because that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural: since the first Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam a quickening spirit.\"[fn-102-P10253_2867471:415-nf] It is all about man, and all about the flesh because about man.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_42_book_ii","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"167","folder":"ANF-02","text":"God having thus completed the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and all that are in them, on the sixth day, rested on the seventh day from all His works which He made.

As to the rest of the plants, indeed, the world contained plants like them; but the two trees,-the tree of life and the tree of knowledge,-the rest of the earth possessed not, but only Paradise. And that Paradise is earth, and is planted on the earth, the Scripture states, saying:[fn-16-P1682_484435:51-nf] \"And the Lord God planted Paradise in Eden eastwards, and placed man there; and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.\" By the expressions, therefore, \"out of the ground,\" and \"eastwards,\" the holy writing clearly teaches us that Paradise is under this heaven, under which the east and the earth are.

And this is the meaning of the expression, that \"men have no excuse for their sin,\" viz., that, from the time the divine word or reason has begun to show them internally the difference between good and evil, they ought to avoid and guard against that which is wicked: \"For to him who knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.\"[fn-63-P6357_1167486:77-nf] Moreover, that all men are not without communion with God, is taught in the Gospel thus, by the Saviour's words: \"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation; neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! but the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-63-P6358_1167752:78-nf] But here we must see whether this does not bear the same meaning with the expression in Genesis: \"And He breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\"[fn-63-P6359_1167955:79-nf] For if this be understood as applying generally to all men, then all men have a share in God.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-04","text":"3.

The order of our arrangement now requires us, after the discussion of the preceding subjects, to institute a general inquiry regarding the soul;[fn-66-P6634_1339677:114-nf] and, beginning with points of inferior importance, to ascend to those that are of greater. Now, that there are souls[fn-66-P6635_1339808:115-nf] in all living things, even in those which live in the waters, is, I suppose, doubted by no one. For the general opinion of all men maintains this; and confirmation from the authority of holy Scripture is added, when it is said that \"God made great whales, and every living creature[fn-66-P6636_1340105:116-nf] that moveth which the waters brought forth after their kind.\"[fn-66-P6637_1340193:117-nf] It is confirmed also from the common intelligence of reason, by those who lay down in certain words a definition of soul. For soul is defined as follows: a substance fantastikh/ and o9rmhtikh/, which may be rendered into Latin, although not so appropriately, sensibilis et mobilis.[fn-66-P6638_1340518:118-nf] This certainly may be said appropriately of all living beings, even of those which abide in the waters; and of winged creatures too, this same definition of anima may be shown to hold good. Scripture also has added its authority to a second opinion, when it says, \"Ye shall not eat the blood, because the life[fn-66-P6639_1340990:119-nf] of all flesh is its blood; and ye shall not eat the life with the flesh; \"[fn-66-P6640_1341080:120-nf] in which it intimates most clearly that the blood of every animal is its life. And if any one now were to ask how it can be said with respect to bees, wasps, and ants, and those other things which are in the waters, oysters and cockles, and all others which are without blood, and are most clearly shown to be living things, that the \"life of all flesh is the blood,\" we must answer, that in living things of that sort the force which is exerted in other animals by the power of red blood is exerted in them by that liquid which is within them, although it be of a different colour; for colour is a thing of no importance, provided the substance be endowed with life.[fn-66-P6641_1341813:121-nf] That beasts of burden or cattle of smaller size are endowed with souls,[fn-66-P6642_1341901:122-nf] there is, by general assent, no doubt whatever. The opinion of holy Scripture, however, is manifest, when God says, \"Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, four-footed beasts, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind.\"[fn-66-P6643_1342182:123-nf] And now with respect to man, although no one entertains any doubt, or needs to inquire, yet holy Scripture declares that \"God breathed into his countenance the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\"[fn-66-P6644_1342433:124-nf] It remains that we inquire respecting the angelic order whether they also have souls, or are souls; and also respecting the other divine and celestial powers, as well as those of an opposite kind. We nowhere, indeed, find any authority in holy Scripture for asserting that either the angels, or any other divine spirits that are ministers of God, either possess souls or are called souls, and yet they are felt by very many persons to be endowed with life. But with regard to God, we find it written as follows: \"And I will put My soul upon that soul which has eaten blood, and I will root him out from among his people; \"[fn-66-P6645_1343092:125-nf] and also in another passage, \"Your new moons, and sabbaths, and great days, I will not accept; your fasts, and holidays, and festal days, My soul hateth.\"[fn-66-P6646_1343449:126-nf] And in the Psalms 22, regarding Christ-for it is certain, as the Gospel bears witness, that this Psalm is spoken of Him-the following words occur: \"O Lord, be not far from helping me; look to my defence: O God, deliver my soul from the sword, and my beloved one from the hand of the dog; \"[fn-66-P6647_1343762:127-nf] although there are also many other testimonies respecting the soul of Christ when He tabernacled in the flesh.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_39_the_great_catechism","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"136","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"What other objection is alleged by our adversaries? This; that (to take the preferable view[fn-40-P4010_2653990:80-nf] ) it was altogether needless that that transcendent Being should submit to the experience of death, but He might independently of this, through the superabundance of His power, have wrought with ease His purpose; still, if for some ineffable reason or other it was absolutely necessary that so it should be, at least He ought not to have been subjected to the contumely of such an ignominious kind of death. What death, they ask, could be more ignominious than that by crucifixion? What answer can we make to this? Why, that the death is rendered necessary by the birth, and that He Who had determined once for all to share the nature of man must pass through all the peculiar conditions of that nature. Seeing, then, that the life of man is determined between two boundaries, had He, after having passed the one, not touched the other that follows, His proposed design would have remained only half fulfilled, from His not having touched that second condition of our nature. Perhaps, however, one who exactly understands the mystery would be justified rather in saying that, instead of the death occurring in consequence of the birth, the birth on the contrary was accepted by Him for the sake of the death; for He Who lives for ever did not sink down into the conditions of a bodily birth from any need to live, but to call us back from death to life. Since, then, there was needed a lifting up from death for the whole of our nature, He stretches forth a hand as it were to prostrate man, and stooping down to our dead corpse He came so far within the grasp of death as to touch a state of deadness, and then in His own body to bestow on our nature the principle of the resurrection, raising as He did by His power along with Himself the whole man. For since from no other source than from the concrete lump of our nature[fn-40-P4011_2655833:81-nf] had come that flesh, which was the receptacle of the Godhead and in the resurrection was raised up together with that Godhead, therefore just in the same way as, in the instance of this body of ours, the operation of one of the organs of sense is felt at once by the whole system, as one with that member, so also the resurrection principle of this Member, as though the whole of mankind was a single living being, passes through the entire race, being imparted from the Member to the whole by virtue of the continuity and oneness of the nature. What, then, is there beyond the bounds of probability in what this Revelation teaches us; viz. that He Who stands upright stoops to one who has fallen, in order to lift him up from his prostrate condition? And as to the Cross, whether it possesses some other and deeper meaning, those who are skilled in mysticism may explain; but, however that may be, the traditional teaching which has reached us is as follows. Since all things in the Gospel, both deeds and words, have a sublime and heavenly meaning, and there is nothing in it which is not such, that is, which does not exhibit a complete mingling of the human with the Divine, where the utterance exerted and the deeds enacted are human but the secret sense represents the Divine, it would follow that in this particular as well as in the rest we must not regard only the one element and overlook the other; but in the fact of this death we must contemplate the human feature, while in the manner of it we must be anxious to find the Divine[fn-40-P4012_2657657:82-nf] . For since it is the property of the Godhead to pervade all things, and to extend itself through the length and breadth of the substance of existence in every part-for nothing would continue to be if it remained not within the existent; and that which is this existent properly and primarily is the Divine Being, Whose existence in the world the continuance of all things that are forces us to believe in,-this is the very thing we learn from the figure of the Cross; it is divided into four parts, so that there are the projections, four in number, from the central point where the whole converges upon itself; because He Who at the hour of His pre-arranged death was stretched upon it is He Who binds together all things into Himself, and by Himself brings to one harmonious agreement the diverse natures of actual existences. For in these existences there is the idea either of something above, or of something below, or else the thought passes to the confines sideways. If, therefore, you take into your consideration the system of things above the heavens or of things below the earth, or of things at the boundaries of the universe on either side, everywhere the presence of Deity anticipates your thought as the sole observable power that in every part of existing things holds in a state of being all those things. Now whether we ought to call this Existence Deity, or Mind, or Power, or Wisdom, or any other lofty term which might be better able to express Him Who is above all, our argument has no quarrel with the appellation or name or form of phrase used. Since, then, all creation looks to Him, and is about and around Him, and through Him is coherent with itself, things above being through Him conjoined to things below and things lateral to themselves, it was right that not by hearing only we should be conducted to the full understanding of the Deity, but that sight also should be our teacher in these sublime subjects for thought; and it is from sight that the mighty Paul starts when he initiates[fn-40-P4013_2660444:83-nf] the people of Ephesus in the mysteries, and imbues them through his instructions with the power of knowing what is that \"depth and height and breadth and length.\" In fact he designates each projection of the Cross by its proper appellation. The upper part he calls height, the lower depth, and the side extensions breadth and length; and in another passage[fn-40-P4014_2660820:84-nf] he makes his thought still clearer to the Philippians, to whom be says, \"that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.\" In that passage he includes in one appellation the centre and projecting arms[fn-40-P4015_2661112:85-nf] , calling \"things in earth\" all that is in the middle between things in heaven and things under the earth. Such is the lesson we learn in regard to the mystery of the Cross. And the subsequent events which the narrative contains follow so appropriately that, as even unbelievers must admit, there is nothing in them adverse to the proper conceptions of the Deity. That He did not abide in death, that the wounds which His body had received from the iron of the nails and spear offered no impediment to His rising again, that after His resurrection He showed Himself as He pleased to His disciples, that when He wished to be present with them He was in their midst without being seen, as needing no entrance through open doors, and that He strengthened the disciples by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and that He promised to be amongst them, and that no partition wall should intervene between them and Him, and that to the sight He ascended to Heaven while to the mind He was everywhere; all these, and whatever like facts the history of Him comprises, need no assistance from arguments to show that they are signs of deity and of a sublime and supereminent power. With regard to them therefore I do not deem it necessary to go into any detail, inasmuch as their description of itself shows the supernatural character. But since the dispensation of the washing (whether we choose to call it baptism, or illumination, or regeneration; for we make the name no subject of controversy) is a part of our revealed doctrines, it may be as well to enter on a short discussion of this as well.

Here they find it to be the name of the sex, not a class of the sex: if, that is, God gave to Eve, when she had not yet known a man, the surname \"woman\" and \"female\"[fn-119-P11946_3335110:116-nf] -(\"female,\" whereby the sex generally; \"woman,\" hereby a class of the sex, is marked).[fn-119-P11947_3335285:117-nf] So, since at that time the as yet unwedded Eve was called by the word \"woman,\" that word has been made common even to a virgin.[fn-119-P11948_3335569:118-nf] Nor is it wonderful that the apostle-guided, of course, by the same Spirit by whom, as all the divine Scripture, so that book Genesis, was drawn up-has used the selfsame word in writing \"women,\" which, by the example of Eve unwedded, is applicable too to a \"virgin.\" In fact, all the other passages are in consonance herewith. For even by this very fact, that he has not named \"virgins\" (as he does in another place[fn-119-P11949_3336175:119-nf] where he is teaching touching marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made touching every woman, and touching the whole sex; and that there is no distinction made between a \"virgin\" and any other, while he does not name her at all. For he who elsewhere-namely, where the difference requires-remembers to make the distinction, (moreover, he makes it by designating each species by their appropriate names, ) wishes, where he makes no distinction (while he does not name each), no difference to be understood. What of the fact that in the Greek speech, in which the apostle wrote his letters, it is usual to say, \"women\" rather than \"females; \"that is, gunai=kaj (gunaikas) rather than qhlei/aj (theleias)? Therefore if that word,[fn-119-P11950_3336952:120-nf] which by interpretation represents what \"female\" (femina) represents,[fn-119-P11951_3337036:121-nf] is frequently used instead of the name of the sex[fn-119-P11952_3337467:122-nf] he has named the sex in saying gunai=ka; but in the sex even the virgin is embraced. But, withal, the declaration is plain: \"Every woman,\" saith he, \"praying and prophesying with head uncovered,[fn-119-P11953_3337678:123-nf] dishonoureth her own head.\"[fn-119-P11954_3337729:124-nf] What is \"every woman, but woman of every age, of every rank, of every condition? By saying\" every\" he excepts nought of womanhood, just as he excepts nought of manhood either from not being covered; for just so he says, \"Every man.\"[fn-119-P11955_3337983:125-nf] As, then, in the masculine sex, under the name of\" man\" even the\" youth\" is forbidden to be veiled; so, too, in the feminine, under the name of \"woman,\" even the \"virgin\" is bidden to be veiled. Equally in each sex let the younger age follow the discipline of the elder; or else let the male \"virgins,\"[fn-119-P11956_3338307:126-nf] too, be veiled, if the female virgins withal are not veiled, because they are not mentioned by name. Let \"man\" and \"youth\" be different, if \"woman\" and \"virgin\" are different. For indeed it is \"on account of the angels\"[fn-119-P11957_3338591:127-nf] that he saith women must be veiled, because on account of \"the daughters of men\" angels revolted from God.[fn-119-P11958_3338720:128-nf] Who then, would contend that \"women\" alone-that is,[fn-119-P11959_3339001:129-nf] such as were already wedded and had lost their virginity-were the objects of angelic concupiscence, unless \"virgins\" are incapable of excelling in beauty and finding lovers? Nay, let us see whether it were not virgins alone whom they lusted after; since Scriptures saith \"the daughters of men; \"[fn-119-P11960_3339369:130-nf] inasmuch as it might have named \"wives of men,\" or \"females,\" indifferently.[fn-119-P11961_3339465:131-nf] Likewise, in that it saith, \"And they took them to themselves for wives,\"[fn-119-P11962_3339657:132-nf] it does so on this ground, that, of course, such are \"received for wives\" as are devoid of that title. But it would have expressed itself differently concerning such as were not thus devoid. And so (they who are named) are devoid as much of widowhood as of virginity. So completely has Paul by naming the sex generally, mingled \"daughters\" and species together in the genus.

Here they find it to be the name of the sex, not a class of the sex: if, that is, God gave to Eve, when she had not yet known a man, the surname \"woman\" and \"female\"[fn-119-P11946_3335110:116-nf] -(\"female,\" whereby the sex generally; \"woman,\" hereby a class of the sex, is marked).[fn-119-P11947_3335285:117-nf] So, since at that time the as yet unwedded Eve was called by the word \"woman,\" that word has been made common even to a virgin.[fn-119-P11948_3335569:118-nf] Nor is it wonderful that the apostle-guided, of course, by the same Spirit by whom, as all the divine Scripture, so that book Genesis, was drawn up-has used the selfsame word in writing \"women,\" which, by the example of Eve unwedded, is applicable too to a \"virgin.\" In fact, all the other passages are in consonance herewith. For even by this very fact, that he has not named \"virgins\" (as he does in another place[fn-119-P11949_3336175:119-nf] where he is teaching touching marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made touching every woman, and touching the whole sex; and that there is no distinction made between a \"virgin\" and any other, while he does not name her at all. For he who elsewhere-namely, where the difference requires-remembers to make the distinction, (moreover, he makes it by designating each species by their appropriate names, ) wishes, where he makes no distinction (while he does not name each), no difference to be understood. What of the fact that in the Greek speech, in which the apostle wrote his letters, it is usual to say, \"women\" rather than \"females; \"that is, gunai=kaj (gunaikas) rather than qhlei/aj (theleias)? Therefore if that word,[fn-119-P11950_3336952:120-nf] which by interpretation represents what \"female\" (femina) represents,[fn-119-P11951_3337036:121-nf] is frequently used instead of the name of the sex[fn-119-P11952_3337467:122-nf] he has named the sex in saying gunai=ka; but in the sex even the virgin is embraced. But, withal, the declaration is plain: \"Every woman,\" saith he, \"praying and prophesying with head uncovered,[fn-119-P11953_3337678:123-nf] dishonoureth her own head.\"[fn-119-P11954_3337729:124-nf] What is \"every woman, but woman of every age, of every rank, of every condition? By saying\" every\" he excepts nought of womanhood, just as he excepts nought of manhood either from not being covered; for just so he says, \"Every man.\"[fn-119-P11955_3337983:125-nf] As, then, in the masculine sex, under the name of\" man\" even the\" youth\" is forbidden to be veiled; so, too, in the feminine, under the name of \"woman,\" even the \"virgin\" is bidden to be veiled. Equally in each sex let the younger age follow the discipline of the elder; or else let the male \"virgins,\"[fn-119-P11956_3338307:126-nf] too, be veiled, if the female virgins withal are not veiled, because they are not mentioned by name. Let \"man\" and \"youth\" be different, if \"woman\" and \"virgin\" are different. For indeed it is \"on account of the angels\"[fn-119-P11957_3338591:127-nf] that he saith women must be veiled, because on account of \"the daughters of men\" angels revolted from God.[fn-119-P11958_3338720:128-nf] Who then, would contend that \"women\" alone-that is,[fn-119-P11959_3339001:129-nf] such as were already wedded and had lost their virginity-were the objects of angelic concupiscence, unless \"virgins\" are incapable of excelling in beauty and finding lovers? Nay, let us see whether it were not virgins alone whom they lusted after; since Scriptures saith \"the daughters of men; \"[fn-119-P11960_3339369:130-nf] inasmuch as it might have named \"wives of men,\" or \"females,\" indifferently.[fn-119-P11961_3339465:131-nf] Likewise, in that it saith, \"And they took them to themselves for wives,\"[fn-119-P11962_3339657:132-nf] it does so on this ground, that, of course, such are \"received for wives\" as are devoid of that title. But it would have expressed itself differently concerning such as were not thus devoid. And so (they who are named) are devoid as much of widowhood as of virginity. So completely has Paul by naming the sex generally, mingled \"daughters\" and species together in the genus. Again, while he says that \"nature herself,\"[fn-119-P11963_3340095:133-nf] which has assigned hair as a tegument and ornament to women, \"teaches that veiling is the duty of females,\" has not the same tegument and the same honour of the head been assigned also to virgins?

For that which has been conceived by God's rival, of course is not friendly to God's things. The discord of things is the same as the discord of their authors. Further, since God is best, the devil on the contrary worst, of beings, by their own very diversity they testify that neither works for[fn-122-P12245_3425434:38-nf] the other; so that anything of good can no more seem to be effected for us by the Evil One, than anything of evil by the Good. Therefore I detect the nativity of impatience in the devil himself, at that very time when he impatiently bore that the Lord God subjected the universal works which He had made to His own image, that is, to man.[fn-122-P12246_3425876:39-nf] For if he had endured (that), he would not have grieved; nor would he have envied man if he had not grieved. Accordingly he deceived him, because he had envied him; but he had envied because he had grieved: he had grieved because, of course, he had not patiently borne. What that angel of perdition[fn-122-P12247_3426199:40-nf] first was-malicious or impatient-I scorn to inquire: since manifest it is that either impatience took its rise together with malice, or else malice from impatience; that subsequently they conspired between themselves; and that they grew up indivisible in one paternal bosom. But, however, having been instructed, by his own experiment, what an aid unto sinning was that which he had been the first to feel, and by means of which he had entered on his course of delinquency, he called the same to his assistance for the thrusting of man into crime. The woman,[fn-122-P12248_3426916:41-nf] immediately on being met by him-I may say so without rashness-was, through his very speech with her, breathed on by a spirit infected with impatience: so certain is it that she would never have sinned at all, if she had honoured the divine edict by maintaining her patience to the end. What (of the fact) that she endured not to have been met alone; but in the presence of Adam, not yet her husband, not yet bound to lend her his ears,[fn-122-P12249_3427387:42-nf] she is impatient of keeping silence, and makes him the transmitter of that which she had imbibed from the Evil One? Therefore another human being, too, perishes through the impatience of the one; presently, too, perishes of himself, through his own impatience committed in each respect, both in regard of God's premonition and in regard of the devil's cheatery; not enduring to observe the former nor to refute the latter. Hence, whence (the origin) of delinquency, arose the first origin of judgment; hence, whence man was induced to offend, God began to be wroth. Whence (came)the first indignation in God, thence (came) His first patience; who, content at that time with malediction only, refrained in the devil's case from the instant infliction[fn-122-P12250_3428185:43-nf] of punishment. Else what crime, before this guilt of impatience, is imputed to man? Innocent he was, and in intimate friendship with God, and the husbandman[fn-122-P12251_3428355:44-nf] of paradise. But when once he succumbed to impatience, he quite ceased to be of sweet savour[fn-122-P12252_3428475:45-nf] to God; he quite ceased to be able to endure things celestial. Thenceforward, a creature[fn-122-P12253_3428605:46-nf] given to earth, and ejected from the sight of God, he begins to be easily turned by impatience unto every use offensive to God. For straightway that impatience conceived of the devil's seed, produced, in the fecundity of malice, anger as her son; and when brought forth, trained him in her own arts. For that very thing which had immersed Adam and Eve in death, taught their son, too, to begin with murder. It would be idle for me to ascribe this to impatience, if Cain, that first homicide and first fratricide, had borne with equanimity and not impatiently the refusal by the Lord of his own oblations-if he is not wroth with his own brother-if, finally, he took away no one's life. Since, then, he could neither have killed unless he had been wroth, nor have been wroth unless he had been impatient, he demonstrates that what he did through wrath must be referred to that by which wrath was suggested during this cradle-time of impatience, then (in a certain sense) in her infancy. But how great presently were her augmentations! And no wonder, If she has been the first delinquent, it is a consequence that, because she has been the first, therefore she is the only parent stem,[fn-122-P12254_3429799:47-nf] too, to every delinquency, pouring down from her own fount various veins of crimes.[fn-122-P12255_3430075:48-nf] Of murder we have spoken; but, being from the very beginning the outcome of anger,[fn-122-P12256_3430217:49-nf] whatever causes besides it shortly found for itself it lays collectively on the account of impatience, as to its own origin. For whether from private enmities, or for the sake of prey, any one perpetrates that wickedness,[fn-122-P12257_3430508:50-nf] the earlier step is his becoming impatient of[fn-122-P12258_3430572:51-nf] either the hatred or the avarice. Whatever compels a man, it is not possible that without impatience of itself it can be perfected in deed. Who ever committed adultery without impatience of lust? Moreover, if in females the sale of their modesty is forced by the price, of course it is by impatience of contemning gain[fn-122-P12259_3430921:52-nf] that this sale is regulated.[fn-122-P12260_3431003:53-nf] These (I mention) as the principal delinquencies in the sight of the Lord,[fn-122-P12261_3431147:54-nf] for, to speak compendiously, every sin is ascribable to impatience. \"Evil\" is \"impatience of good.\" None immodest is not impatient of modesty; dishonest of honesty; impious of piety;[fn-122-P12262_3431387:55-nf] unquiet of quietness. In order that each individual may become evil he will be unable to persevere[fn-122-P12263_3431523:56-nf] in being good. How, therefore, can such a hydra of delinquencies fail to offend the Lord, the Disapprover of evils? Is it not manifest that it was through impatience that Israel himself also always failed in his duty toward God, from that time when,[fn-122-P12264_3431794:57-nf] forgetful of the heavenly arm whereby he had been drawn out of his Egyptian affliction, he demands from Aaron \"gods[fn-122-P12265_3431972:58-nf] as his guides; \"when he pours down for an idol the contributions of his gold: for the so necessary delays of Moses, while he met with God, he had borne with impatience. After the edible rain of the manna, after the watery following[fn-122-P12266_3432242:59-nf] of the rock, they despair of the Lord in not enduring a three-days' thirst;[fn-122-P12267_3432421:60-nf] for this also is laid to their charge by the Lord as impatience. And-not to rove through individual cases-there was no instance in which it was not by failing in duty through impatience that they perished. How, moreover, did they lay hands on the prophets, except through impatience of hearing them? on the Lord moreover Himself, through impatience likewise of seeing Him?

In the very beginning, Adam and Eve were the parents of all nations, not of the Jews only; and whatever was represented in Adam concerning Christ, undoubtedly concerned all nations, whose salvation is in Christ. What better can I say of the water of the first water-pot than what the apostle says of Adam and Eve? For no man will say that I misunderstand the meaning when I produce, not my own, but the apostle's. How great a mystery, then, concerning Christ does that of which the apostle makes mention contain, when he says, \"And the two shall be in one flesh: this is a great mystery!\"[fn-6-P620_297291:14-nf] And lest any man should understand that greatness of mystery to exist in the case of the individual men that have wives, he says, \"But I speak concerning Christ and the Church.\" What great mystery is this, \"the two shall be one flesh?\" While Scripture, in the Book of Genesis, was speaking of Adam and Eve, it came to these words, \"Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.\"[fn-6-P621_297757:15-nf] Now, if Christ cleave to the Church, so that the two should be one flesh, in what manner did He leave His Father and His mother? He left His Father in this sense, that when He was in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking to Him the form of a servant.[fn-6-P622_298081:16-nf] In this sense He left His Father, not that He forsook or departed from His Father, but that He did not appear unto men in that form in which He was equal with the Father. But how did He leave His mother? By leaving the synagogue of the Jews, of which, after the flesh, He was born, and by cleaving to the Church which He has gathered out of all nations. Thus the first water-pot then held a prophecy of Christ; but so long as these things of which I speak were not preached among the peoples, the prophecy was water, it was not vet changed into wine. And since the Lord his enlightened us through the apostle, to show us what we were in search of, by this one sentence, \"The two shall be one flesh; a great mystery concerning Christ and the Church;\" we are now permitted to seek Christ everywhere, and to drink wine from all the water-pots. Adam sleeps, that Eve may be formed; Christ dies, that the Church may be formed. When Adam sleeps, Eve is formed from his side; when Christ is dead, the spear pierces His side, that the mysteries may flow forth whereby the Church is formed. Is it not evident to every man that in those things then done, things to come were foreshadowed, since the apostle says that Adam himself was the figure of Him that was to come? \"Who is,\" saith he, \"the figure of Him that was to come.\"[fn-6-P623_299418:17-nf] All was mystically prefigured. For, in reality, God could have taken the rib from Adam when he was awake, and formed the woman. Or was it, haply, necessary for him to sleep lest he should feel pain in his side when the rib was taken away? Who is there that sleeps so soundly that his bones may be torn from him without his awaking? Or was it because it was God that tore it out, that the man did not feel it? Well, He who could take it from him without pain when he was asleep, could do it also when he was awake.

And that will be to reign.\"[fn-90-P9067_2547678:274-nf] That, then, we may be taught that the world was originated, and not suppose that God made it in time, prophecy adds: \"This is the book of the generation: also of the things in them, when they were created in the day that God made heaven and earth.\"[fn-90-P9068_2547949:275-nf] For the expression \"when they were created\" intimates an indefinite and dateless production.

Further that the grandeur of perfection was open to every age and either sex, and that all the members of the Church were urged to scale the heights of heavenly goodness when the Apostle said: \"So run that ye may obtain;\"[fn-63-P6349_2265571:23-nf] nor should those who were ready and eager for it hang back because of the delays of the slow and dawdlers, as it is better for the sluggards to be urged on by those running before than for those who are doing their best to be hampered by the slothful. Further that he had determined and made up his mind to renounce the world and to die to the world that he might live to God, and that if he could not attain this happiness; viz., to pass with his wife into union with Christ, he would rather be saved even with the loss of one member, and enter into the kingdom of heaven as one maimed rather than be condemned with his body whole. But he also added and spoke as follows: If Moses suffered wives to be divorced for the hardness of their hearts, why should not Christ allow this for the desire of chastity, especially when the same Lord among those other affections; viz., for fathers and mothers and children (all due regard to which not only the law but He Himself also charged to be shown, yet for His name's sake and for the desire of perfection He decreed that they should not simply be disregarded but actually hated)-to these, I say, He joined also the mention of wives, saying: \"And everyone that hath left house, or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children for My name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life.\"[fn-63-P6350_2266958:24-nf] So far then is He from allowing anything to be set against that perfection which He is proclaiming, that He actually enjoins that the ties to father and mother should be broken and disregarded out of love for Him, though according to the Apostle it is the first commandment with promise; viz., \"Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with promise, that it may be well with thee and that thy days may be long upon earth.\"[fn-63-P6351_2267428:25-nf] And as the word of the gospel condemns those who break the chains of matrimony where there has been no sin of adultery, so it clearly promises a reward of an hundredfold to those who have cast off a carnal yoke out of love for Christ and the desire for chastity. Wherefore if it can be brought about that you may listen to reason and be turned together with me to this most desirable choice; viz., that we should together serve the Lord and escape the pains of hell, I will not refuse the affection of marriage, nay I will embrace it with a still greater love. For I acknowledge and honour my helpmeet assigned to me by the word of the Lord, and I do not refuse to be joined to her in an unbroken tie of love in Christ, nor do I separate from me what the Lord joined to me by the law of the original condition,[fn-63-P6352_2268260:26-nf] if only you yourself will be what your Maker meant you to be. But if you will not be a helpmeet, but prefer to make yourself a deceiver and an assistance not to me but to the adversary, and fancy that the sacrament of matrimony was granted to you for this reason that you may deprive yourself of this salvation which is offered to you, and also hold me back from following the Saviour as a disciple, then I will resolutely lay hold on the words which were uttered by the lips of Abbot John, or rather of Christ Himself, so that no carnal affection may be able to tear me away from spiritual blessings, for He says: \"He that hateth not father and mother and children and brothers and sisters and wife and lands, yea and his own soul also, cannot be My disciple.\"[fn-63-P6353_2269044:27-nf] When then by these and such like words the woman's purpose was not moved and she persisted in the same obstinate hardness, If, said the blessed Theonas, I cannot drag you away from death, neither shall you separate me from Christ: but it is safer for me to be divorced from a human person than from God. And so by the aid of God's grace he at once set about the execution of his purpose and suffered not the ardour of his desire to grow cool through any delay. For at once he stripped himself of all his worldly goods, and fled to a monastery, where in a very short time he was so famous for the splendour of his sanctity and humility that when John of blessed memory departed this life to the Lord, and the holy Elias, a man who was no less great than his predecessor, had likewise died, Theonas was chosen by the judgment of all as the third to succeed them in the administration of the almsgiving.","title":"XXI.

It is plain then from the above that the Scriptures declare the Son's eternity; it is equally plain from what follows that the Arian phrases `He was not,' and `before' and `when,' are in the same Scriptures predicated of creatures. Moses, for instance, in his account of the generation of our system, says, `And every plant of the field, before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground[fn-53-P5372_2105783:84-nf] .' And in Deuteronomy, `When the Most High divided to the nations[fn-53-P5373_2105866:85-nf] .'

And concerning the creation He says by Solomon, `Or ever the earth was, when there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills. was I brought forth[fn-53-P5375_2106408:87-nf] .' And, `Before Abraham was, I am[fn-53-P5376_2106463:88-nf] .' And concerning Jeremiah He says,`Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee[fn-53-P5377_2106565:89-nf] .' And David in the Psalm says, `Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were made, Thou art, God from everlasting and world without end[fn-53-P5378_2106751:90-nf] .' And in Daniel, `Susanna cried out with a loud voice and said, O everlasting God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest all things before they be[fn-53-P5379_2106915:91-nf] .' Thus it appears that the phrases `once was not,' and `before it came to be,' and `when,' and the like, belong to things originate and creatures, which come out of nothing, but are alien to the Word. But if such terms are used in Scripture of things originate, but `ever' of the Word, it follows, O ye enemies of God, that the Son did not come out of nothing, nor is in the number of originated things at all, but is the Father's Image and Word eternal, never having not been, but being ever, as the, eternal Radiance[fn-53-P5380_2107455:92-nf] of a Light which is eternal. Why imagine then times before the Son? or wherefore blaspheme the Word as after times, by whom even the ages were made? for how did time or age at all subsist when the Word, as you say, had not appeared, `through' whom `all things have been made and without' whom `not one thing was made[fn-53-P5381_2107798:93-nf] ?' Or why, when you mean time, do you not plainly say, `a time was when the Word was not?' But while you drop the word `time' to deceive the simple, you do not at all conceal your own feeling, nor, even if you did, could you escape discovery.

Wherefore they are creatures; this God's Word and Only-begotten Son. For instance, Moses did not say of the creation, `In the beginning He begat,' nor `In the beginning was,' but `In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth[fn-62-P6254_2496239:372-nf] .' Nor did David say in the Psalm, `Thy hands have \"begotten me,\"' but `made me and fashioned me[fn-62-P6255_2496354:373-nf] ,' everywhere applying the word `made' to the creatures. But to the Son contrariwise; for he has not said `I made,' but `I begat[fn-62-P6256_2496504:374-nf] ,' and `He begets me,' and `My heart uttered a good Word[fn-62-P6257_2496579:375-nf] .' And in the instance of the creation, `In the beginning He made;' but in the instance of the Son, `In the beginning was the Word[fn-62-P6258_2496729:376-nf] .' And there is this difference, that the creatures are made upon the beginning, and have a beginning of existence connected with an interval; wherefore also what is said of them, `In the beginning He made,' is as much as saying of them, `From the beginning He made:'-as the Lord, knowing that which He had made, taught, when He silenced the Pharisees, with the words, `He which made them from the beginning, made them male and female[fn-62-P6259_2497182:377-nf] ;' for from some beginning, when they were not yet, were originate things brought into being and created. This too the Holy Spirit has signified in the Psalms, saying, `Thou, Lord, at the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth[fn-62-P6260_2497439:378-nf] ;' and again, `O think upon Thy congregation which Thou hast purchased from the beginning[fn-62-P6261_2497549:379-nf] ;' now it is plain that what takes place at the beginning, has a beginning of creation, and that from some beginning God purchased His congregation. And that `In the beginning He made,' from his saying `made,' means `began to make,' Moses himself shews by saying, after the completion of all things, `And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because that in it He had rested from all His work which God began to make[fn-62-P6262_2497997:380-nf] .' Therefore the creatures began to be made; but the Word of God, not having beginning of being, certainly did not begin to be, nor begin to come to be, but was ever. And the works have their beginning in their making, and their beginning precedes their coming to be; but the Word, not being of things which come to be, rather comes to be Himself the Framer of those which have a beginning. And the being of things originate is measured by their becoming[fn-62-P6263_2498471:381-nf] , and from some beginning does God begin to make them through the Word, that it may be known that they were not before their origination; but the Word has His being, in no other beginning[fn-62-P6264_2498686:382-nf] than the Father, whom[fn-62-P6265_2498739:383-nf] they allow to be without beginning, so that He too exists without beginning? the Father, being His Offspring, not His creature.

For to the body death was proper[fn-63-P6339_2526430:448-nf] ; and in like manner to the bodily presence are the words proper, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways.' For since the Saviour was thus created according to the flesh, and had become a beginning of things new created, and had our first fruits, viz. that human flesh which He took to Himself, therefore after Him, as is fit, is created also the people to come, David saying, `Let this be written for another generation, and the people that shall be created shall praise the Lord[fn-63-P6340_2527725:449-nf] .'

Now immortality was wanting to him, and the way to paradise. This then is what the Saviour says, `I glorified Thee on the earth, I perfected the work which Thou hast given Me to do[fn-63-P6347_2529237:456-nf] ;' and again, `The works which the Father hath given Me to perfect, the same works that I do, bear witness of Me;' but `the works[fn-63-P6348_2529388:457-nf] ' He here says that the Father had given Him to perfect, are those for which He is created, saying in the Proverbs, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways, for His works;' for it is all one to say, `The Father hath given me the works,' and `The Lord created me for the works.'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_77_sermon_lx_cx_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1.

But nevertheless, if He who made did not rule the world, what is made would fall to ruin: He cannot but administer that which He hath made. Because then nothing hath been added to the creation, He is said to have rested from all His works; but because He doth not cease to govern what He made, rightly did the Lord say, \"My Father worketh even hitherto.\" Attend, Beloved. He finished, He is said to have rested; for He finished His works, and hath added no more. He governeth what He hath made; therefore He doth not cease to work. But with the same facility that He made, with the same doth He govern. For do not suppose, brethren, that when He created He did not labour, and that He laboureth in that He governeth: as in a ship, they labour who build the ship, and they who manage it labour too; for they are men. For with the same facility wherewith \"He spake and they were made,\" with the same facility and judgment doth He govern all things by the Word.","title":"Sermon LXXV. [CXXV.

But unless the Almighty God did deign to do this, no kind of righteousness, no form of wisdom could rescue any one from the devil's bondage and from the depths of eternal death. For the condemnation that passes with sin from one upon all would remain, and our nature, corroded by its deadly wound, would discover no remedy, because it could not alter its state in its own strength. For the first man received the substance of flesh from the earth, and was quickened with a rational spirit by the in-breathing of his Creator[fn-30-P3055_730754:7-nf] , so that living after the image and likeness of his Maker, he might preserve the form of God's goodness and righteousness as in a bright mirror. And, if he had perseveringly maintained this high dignity of his nature by observing the Law that was given him, his uncorrupt mind would have raised the character even Of his earthly body to heavenly glory. But because in unhappy rashness he trusted the envious deceiver, and agreeing to his presumptuous counsels, preferred to forestall rather than to win the increase of honour that was in storefor him, not only did that one man, but in him all that came after him also hear the verdict: \"earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou go[fn-30-P3056_731476:8-nf] ;\" \"as in the earthy,\" therefore, \"such are they also that are earthy[fn-30-P3057_731563:9-nf] ,\" and no one is immortal, because no one is heavenly.","title":"Sermon XXIV.

For thus it is written, that, when the first man received a commandment from God to eat of every tree that was in the garden,[fn-50-P5099_1502190:9-nf] but not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the serpent having persuaded them by means of the woman, through the promise that they would become gods, made them look up;[fn-51-P5100_1502423:10-nf] and then, when they had thus looked up, God said,[fn-51-P5101_1502681:11-nf] `Behold, Adam is become as one of us.' When, then, the serpent said,[fn-51-P5102_1502769:12-nf] `Ye shall be as gods, 'he plainly speaks in the belief that gods exist; all the more as God also added His testimony, saying, `Behold, Adam is become as one of us.' The serpent, then, who said that there are many gods, did not speak falsely. Again, the scripture,[fn-51-P5103_1503051:13-nf] `Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the rulers of thy people, 'points out many gods whom it does not wish even-to be cursed. But it is also somewhere else written,[fn-51-P5104_1503241:14-nf] ` `Did another god dare to enter and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, as did I the Lord God? 'When He says, `Did another God dare? 'He speaks on the supposition that other gods exist. And elsewhere:[fn-51-P5105_1503478:15-nf] `Let the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth perish; 'as if those who had made them were not to perish. And in another place, when it says,[fn-51-P5106_1503649:16-nf] `Take heed to thyself lest thou go and serve other gods whom thy fathers knew not, 'it speaks as if other gods existed whom they were not to follow. And again:[fn-51-P5107_1503829:17-nf] `The names of other gods shall not ascend upon thy lips.' Here it mentions many gods whose names it does not wish to be uttered. And again it is written,[fn-51-P5108_1504009:18-nf] `Thy God is the Lord, He is God of gods.' And again:[fn-51-P5109_1504080:19-nf] `Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the Gods? 'And again:[fn-51-P5110_1504170:20-nf] `God is Lord of gods.' And again:[fn-51-P5111_1504219:21-nf] `God stood in the assembly of gods: He judgeth among the gods.' Wherefore I wonder how, when there are so many passages in writing which testify that there are many gods, you have asserted that we ought neither to say nor to think that there are many.[fn-51-P5112_1504491:22-nf] Finally, if you have anything to say against what has been spoken so distinctly, say it in the presence of all.\"","title":"Homily XVI","author":"Pseudo-Clementine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_64_homily_xx_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-08","text":"When Peter heard this, he thought for a little, and said: \"I do not think that any one can converse about evil without doing the will of the evil one. Therefore knowing this, I do not know what I shall do, whether I shall be silent or speak. For if I be silent, I should incur the laughter of the multitude, because, professing to proclaim the truth, I am ignorant of the explanation of vice But if I should state my opinion, I am afraid lest it be not at all pleasing to God that we should seek after evil, for only seeking after good is pleasing to Him. However, in my reply to the statements of Sophonias, I shall make my ideas more plain. I then agree with him in thinking that we ought not to attribute to God all the qualities of men. For instance, men not having bodies that are convertible are not converted; but they have a nature that admits of alteration by the lapse of time through the seasons of the year. But this is not the case with God; for through His inborn[fn-56-P5630_1648712:18-nf] Spirit He becomes, by a power which cannot be described, whatever body He likes. And one can the more easily believe this, as the air, which has received such a nature from Him, is converted into dew by the incorporeal mind permeating it, and being thickened becomes water, and water being compacted becomes stone and earth, and stones through collision light up fire. According to such[fn-56-P5631_1649115:19-nf] a change and conversion, air becomes first water, and ends in being fire through conversions, and the moist is converted into its natural opposite. Why? Did not God convert the rod of Moses into an animal, making it a serpent,[fn-56-P5632_1649389:20-nf] which He reconverted into a rod? And by means of this very converted rodhe converted the water of the Nile[fn-56-P5633_1649515:21-nf] into blood, which again he reconverted into water. Yea, even man, who is dust, He changed by the inbreathing of His breath[fn-56-P5634_1649660:22-nf] into flesh, and changed him back again into dust.[fn-56-P5635_1649727:23-nf] And was not Moses,[fn-56-P5636_1649768:24-nf] who himself was flesh, converted into the grandest light, so that the sons of Israel could not look him in the face? Much more, then, is God completely able to convert Himself into whatsoever He wishes.","title":"Homily XX.","author":"Pseudo-Clementine"}]
