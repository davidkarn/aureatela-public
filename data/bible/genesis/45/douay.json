{"verses":["Joseph could no longer refrain himself before many that stood by:\nwhereupon he commanded that all should go out, and no stranger be\npresent at their knowing one another.","And he lifted up his voice with weeping, which the Egyptians, and\nall the house of Pharao heard.","And he said to his brethren:  I am Joseph:  Is my father yet\nliving?  His brethren could not answer him, being struck with exceeding\ngreat fear.","And he said mildly to them:  Come nearer to me.  And when they were\ncome near him, he said:  I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into\nEgypt.","Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a hard case that you\nsold me into these countries:  for God sent me before you into Egypt for\nyour preservation.","For it is two years since the famine began to be upon the land,\nand five years more remain, wherein there can be neither ploughing nor\nreaping.","And God sent me before, that you may be preserved upon the earth,\nand may have food to live.","Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but by the will of God:\nwho hath made me as it were a father to Pharao, and lord of his whole\nhouse, and governor in all the land of Egypt.","Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and say to him:  Thus saith\nthy son Joseph:  God hath made me lord of the whole land of Egypt; come\ndown to me, linger not.","And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen:  and thou shalt be\nnear me, thou and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, thy sheep, and thy\nherds, and all things that thou hast.","And there I will feed thee, (for there are yet five years of\nfamine remaining) lest both thou perish, and thy house, and all things\nthat thou hast.","Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, see that\nit is my mouth that speaketh to you.","You shall tell my father of all my glory, and all things that\nyou have seen in Egypt:  make haste and bring him to me.","And falling upon the neck of his brother Benjamin, he embraced\nhim and wept:  and Benjamin in like manner wept also on his neck.","And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and wept upon every one of\nthem:  after which they were emboldened to speak to him.","And it was heard, and the fame was spread abroad in the king's\ncourt:  The brethren of Joseph are come; and Pharao with all his family\nwas glad.","And he spoke to Joseph that he should give orders to his\nbrethren, saying:  Load your beasts, and go into the land of Chanaan,","And bring away from thence your father and kindred, and come to\nme; and I will give you all the good things of Egypt, that you may eat\nthe marrow of the land.","Give orders also that they take wagons out of the land of Egypt,\nfor the carriage of their children and their wives; and say:  Take up\nyour father, and make haste to come with all speed:","And leave nothing of your household stuff; for all the riches of\nEgypt shall be yours.","And the sons of Israel did as they were bid.  And Joseph gave\nthem wagons according to Pharao's commandment:  and provisions for the\nway.","He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two\nrobes:  but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, with\nfive robes of the best:","Sending to his father as much money and raiment; adding besides,\nten he-asses, to carry off all the riches of Egypt, and as many\nshe-asses, carrying wheat and bread for the journey.","So he sent away his brethren, and at their departing said to\nthem:  Be not angry in the way.","And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of\nChanaan, to their father Jacob.","And they told him, saying:  Joseph, thy son, is living; and he is\nruler in all the land of Egypt.  Which when Jacob heard, he awaked as it\nwere out of a deep sleep, yet did not believe them.","They, on the other side, told the whole order of the thing.  And\nwhen he saw the wagons, and all that he had sent, his spirit revived,","And he said:  It is enough for me if Joseph, my son, be yet\nliving:  I will go and see him before I die."]}
