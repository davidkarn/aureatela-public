{"verses":["And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he\nhad, and Lot with him into the south.","And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver.","And he returned by the way, that he came, from the south to\nBethel, to the place where before he had pitched his tent between\nBethel and Hai,","In the place of the altar which he had made before, and there he\ncalled upon the name of the Lord.","But Lot also, who was with Abram, had flocks of sheep, and herds\nof beasts, and tents.","Neither was the land able to bear them, that they might dwell\ntogether:  for their substance was great, and they could not dwell\ntogether.","Whereupon also there arose a strife between the herdsmen of Abram\nand of Lot.  And at that time the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled\nin that country.","Abram therefore said to Lot:  Let there be no quarrel, I beseech\nthee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen:\nfor we are brethren.","Behold the whole land is before thee:  depart from me, I pray\nthee:  if thou wilt go to the left hand, I will take the right:  if thou\nchoose the right hand, I will pass to the left.","And Lot lifting up his eyes, saw all the country about the\nJordan, which was watered throughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom\nand Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and like Egypt as one comes\nto Segor.","And Lot chose to himself the country about the Jordan, and he\ndeparted from the east:  and they were separated one brother from the\nother.","Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan:  and Lot abode in the towns,\nthat were about the Jordan, and dwelt in Sodom.","And the men of Sodom were very wicked, and sinners before the\nface of the Lord beyond measure.","And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him:\nLift up thy eyes, and look from the place wherein thou now art, to the\nnorth and to the south, to the east and to the west.","All the land which thou seest, I will give to thee, and to thy\nseed for ever.","And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth:  if any man be\nable to number the dust of the earth, he shall be able to number thy\nseed also.","Arise and walk through the land in the length, and the breadth\nthereof:  for I will give it to thee.","So Abram removing his tent, came, and dwelt by the vale of\nMambre, which is in Hebron:  and he built there an altar to the Lord."]}
