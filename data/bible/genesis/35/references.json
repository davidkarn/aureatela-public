In either case I make no objection. The question now is whether the words unto this day are to be referred to the time of publishing or writing the books, and if so it is for him to show, now that so many years have rolled away since that day, that either the idols hidden beneath the oak have been found, or the grave of Moses discovered; for he obstinately maintains that what does not happen so long as the point of time indicated by until and unto has not been attained, begins to be when that point has been reached. He would do well to pay heed to the idiom of Holy Scripture, and understand with us, (it was here he stuck in the mud) that some things which might seem ambiguous if not expressed are plainly intimated, while others are left to the exercise of our intellect. For if, while the event was still fresh in memory and men were living who had seen Moses, it was possible for his grave to be unknown, much more may this be the case after the lapse of so many ages. And in the same way must we interpret what we are told concerning Joseph. The Evangelist pointed out a circumstance which might have given rise to some scandal, namely, that Mary was not known by her husband until she was delivered, and he did so that we might be the more certain that she from whom Joseph refrained while there was room to doubt the import of the vision was not known after her delivery.","title":"The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary","author":false},{"chapter":35,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"19.

The Law in its progress still follows the sequence of the Gospel mystery, of which it is the shadow; its types are a faithful anticipation of the truths taught by the Apostles. In the vision of his dream the blessed Jacob saw God; this was the revelation of a mystery, not a bodily manifestation. For there was shown to him the descent of angels by the ladder, and their ascent to heaven, and God resting above the ladder; and the vision, as it was interpreted, foretold that his dream should some day become a revealed truth. The Patriarch's words, The house of God and the gate of heaven, skew us the scene of Iris vision; and then, after a long account of what he did, the narrative proceeds thus: And God said unto Jacob, Arise, and go up to the place Bethel, and dwell there: and make there a Sacrifice unto God, that appeared unto thee widen thou fleddest from the face of Esau[fn-13-P1344_826303:12-nf] .

What difference of nature separates the Two, when Both bear the one name which indicates the one nature? It is God Who was seen; it is also God Who speaks about God Who was seen. God cannot be apprehended except through God; even as also God accepts no worship from us except through God. We could not understand that the One must be reverenced, unless the Other had taught us reverence for Him; we could not have known that the One is God, unless we had known the Godhead of the Other.

Just as my Christ is to be expected,[fn-75-P7561_2166421:390-nf] who was predicted from the beginning, so his Christ therefore has no existence, as not having been announced from the beginning. Ours is a better faith, which believes in a future Christ, than the heretic's, which has none at all to believe in. Touching the resurrection of the dead,[fn-75-P7562_2166833:391-nf] let us first inquire how some persons then denied it. No doubt in the same way in which it is even now denied, since the resurrection of the flesh has at all times men to deny it. But many wise men claim for the soul a divine nature, and are confident of its undying destiny, and even the multitude worship the dead[fn-75-P7563_2167171:392-nf] in the presumption which they boldly entertain that their souls survive. As for our bodies, however, it is manifest that they perish either at once by fire or the wild beasts,[fn-75-P7564_2167409:393-nf] or even when most carefully kept by length of time. When, therefore, the apostle refutes those who deny the resurrection of the flesh, he indeed defends, in opposition to them, the precise matter of their denial, that is, the resurrection of the body. You have the whole answer wrapped up in this.[fn-75-P7565_2167752:394-nf] All the rest is superfluous. Now in this very point, which is called the resurrection of the dead, it is requisite that the proper force of the words should be accurately maintained.[fn-75-P7566_2167953:395-nf] The word dead expresses simply what has lost the vital principle,[fn-75-P7567_2168035:396-nf] by means of which it used to live. Now the body is that which loses life, and as the result of losing it becomes dead. To the body, therefore, the term dead is only suitable. Moreover, as resurrection accrues to what is dead, and dead is a term applicable only to a body, therefore the body alone has a resurrection incidental to it. So again the word Resurrection, or (rising again), embraces only that which has fallen down. \"To rise,\" indeed, can be predicated of that which has never fallen down, but had already been always lying down. But \"to rise again\" is predicable only of that which has fallen down; because it is by rising again, in consequence of its having fallen down, that it is said to have re-risen.[fn-75-P7568_2168768:397-nf] For the syllable RE always implies iteration (or happening again). We say, therefore, that the body falls to the ground by death, as indeed facts themselves show, in accordance with the law of God. For to the body it was said, (\"Till thou return to the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for) dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\"[fn-75-P7569_2169270:398-nf] That, therefore, which came from the ground shall return to the ground. Now that falls down which returns to the ground; and that rises again which falls down. \"Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection.\"[fn-75-P7570_2169592:399-nf] Here in the word man, who consists of bodily sub stance, as we have often shown already, is presented to me the body of Christ. But if we are all so made alive in Christ, as we die in Adam, it follows of necessity that we are made alive in Christ as a bodily substance, since we died in Adam as a bodily substance. The similarity, indeed, is not complete, unless our revival[fn-75-P7571_2169989:400-nf] in Christ concur in identity of substance with our mortality[fn-75-P7572_2170071:401-nf] in Adam. But at this point[fn-75-P7573_2170119:402-nf] (the apostle) has made a parenthetical statement[fn-75-P7574_2170182:403-nf] concerning Christ, which, bearing as it does on our present discussion, must not pass unnoticed. For the resurrection of the body will receive all the better proof, in proportion as I shall succeed in showing that Christ belongs to that God who is believed to have provided this resurrection of the flesh in His dispensation. When he says, \"For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet,\"[fn-75-P7575_2170616:404-nf] we can see at once[fn-75-P7576_2170661:405-nf] from this statement that he speaks of a God of vengeance, and therefore of Him who made the following promise to Christ: \"Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool. The rod of Thy strength shall the Lord send forth from Sion, and He shall rule along with Thee in the midst of Thine enemies.\"[fn-75-P7577_2170998:406-nf] It is necessary for me to lay claim to those Scriptures which the Jews endeavour to deprive us of, and to show that they sustain my view. Now they say that this Psalm[fn-75-P7578_2171199:407-nf] was a chant in honour of Hezekiah,[fn-75-P7579_2171249:408-nf] because \"he went up to the house of the Lord,\"[fn-75-P7580_2171326:409-nf] and God turned back and removed his enemies. Therefore, (as they further hold, ) those other words, \"Before the morning star did I beget thee from the womb,\"[fn-75-P7581_2171627:410-nf] are applicable to Hezekiah, and to the birth of Hezekiah. We on our side[fn-75-P7582_2173635:411-nf] have published Gospels (to the credibility of which we have to thank[fn-75-P7583_2173716:412-nf] them[fn-75-P7584_2173737:413-nf] for having given some confirmation, indeed, already in so great a subject[fn-75-P7585_2173854:414-nf] ); and these declare that the Lord was born at night, that so it might be \"before the morning star,\" as is evident both from the star especially, and from the testimony of the angel, who at night announced to the shepherds that Christ had at that moment been born,[fn-75-P7586_2174153:415-nf] and again from the place of the birth, for it is towards night that persons arrive at the (eastern)\" inn.\" Perhaps, too, there was a mystic purpose in Christ's being born at night, destined, as He was, to be the light of the truth amidst the dark shadows of ignorance. Nor, again, would God have said, \"I have begotten Thee,\" except to His true Son. For although He says of all the people (Israel), \"I have begotten[fn-75-P7587_2174600:416-nf] children,\"[fn-75-P7588_2174646:417-nf] yet He added not \"from the womb.\" Now, why should He have added so superfluously this phrase \"from the womb\" (as if there could be any doubt about any one's having been born from the womb), unless the Holy Ghost had wished the words to be with especial care[fn-75-P7589_2174922:418-nf] understood of Christ? \"I have begotten Thee from the womb,\" that is to say, from a womb only, without a man's seed, making it a condition of a fleshly body[fn-75-P7590_2175096:419-nf] that it should come out of a womb. What is here added (in the Psalm), \"Thou art a priest for ever,\"[fn-75-P7591_2175244:420-nf] relates to (Christ) Himself. Hezekiah was no priest; and even if he had been one, he would not have been a priest for ever. \"After the order,\" says He, \"of Melchizedek.\" Now what had Hezekiah to do with Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God, and him uncircumcised too, who blessed the circumcised Abraham, after receiving from him the offering of tithes? To Christ, however, \"the order of Melchizedek\" will be very suitable; for Christ is the proper and legitimate High Priest of God. He is the Pontiff of the priesthood of the uncircumcision, constituted such, even then, for the Gentiles, by whom He was to be more fully received, although at His last coming He will favour with His acceptance and blessing the circumcision also, even the race of Abraham, which by and by is to acknowledge Him. Well, then, there is also another Psalm, which begins with these words: \"Give Thy judgments, O God, to the King,\" that is, to Christ who was to come as King, \"and Thy righteousness unto the King's son,\"[fn-75-P7592_2176269:421-nf] that is, to Christ's people; for His sons are they who are born again in Him. But it will here be said that this Psalm has reference to Solomon. However, will not those portions of the Psalm which apply to Christ alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ, and not to Solomon? \"He shall come down,\" says He, \"like rain upon a fleece,[fn-75-P7593_2176653:422-nf] and like dropping showers upon the earth,\"[fn-75-P7594_2176740:423-nf] describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as gentle and unobserved.[fn-75-P7595_2176835:424-nf] Solomon, however, if he had indeed any descent at all, came not down like a shower, because he descended not from heaven. But I will set before you more literal points.[fn-75-P7596_2177230:425-nf] \"He shall have dominion,\" says the Psalmist, \"from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"[fn-75-P7597_2177361:426-nf] To Christ alone was this given; whilst Solomon reigned over only the moderately-sized kingdom of Judah. \"Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him.\" Whom, indeed, shall they all thus worship, except Christ? \"All nations shall serve Him.\"[fn-75-P7598_2177618:427-nf] To whom shall all thus do homage, but Christ? \"His name shall endure for ever.\" Whose name has this eternity of fame, but Christ's? \"Longer than the sun shall His name remain,\" for longer than the sun shall be the Word of God, even Christ. \"And in Him shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-75-P7599_2177921:428-nf] In Solomon was no nation blessed; in Christ every nation. And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even God? \"They shall call Him blessed.\"[fn-76-P7600_2178079:429-nf] (On what ground? ) Because blessed Is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful things.\"[fn-76-P7601_2178195:430-nf] \"Blessed also is His glorious name, and with His glory shall all the earth be filled.\"[fn-76-P7602_2178302:431-nf] On the contrary, Solomon (as I make bold to affirm) lost even the glory which he had from God, seduced by his love of women even into idolatry. And thus, the statement which occurs in about the middle of this Psalm, \"His enemies shall lick the dust\"[fn-76-P7603_2178572:432-nf] (of course, as having been, (to use the apostle's phrase, ) \"put under His feet\"[fn-76-P7604_2178672:433-nf] ), will bear upon the very object which I had in view, when I both introduced the Psalm, and insisted on my opinion of its sense,-namely, that I might demonstrate both the glory of His kingdom and the subjection of His enemies in pursuance of the Creator's own plans, with the view of laying down[fn-76-P7605_2178995:434-nf] this conclusion, that none but He can be believed to be the Christ of the Creator.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":35,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"131","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Genesis: \"And God said unto Jacob, Arise, and go up to the place of Bethel, and dwell there; and make there an altar to that God who appeared unto thee when thou reddest from the face of thy brother Esau.\"[fn-81-P8189_2712092:155-nf] Also in Isaiah: \"Thus saith the Lord, the God of Sabaoth, Egypt is wearied; and the merchandise of the Ethiopians, and the tall men of the Sabeans, shall pass over unto Thee, and shall be Thy servants; and shall walk after Thee bound with chains; and shall worship Thee, and shall pray to Thee, because God is in Thee, and there is no other God beside Thee.

Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed.\"[fn-82-P8200_2715240:166-nf] Also Paul to the Romans: \"I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren and my kindred according to the flesh: who are Israel-ires: whose are the adoption, and the glory, and the covenant, and the appointment of the law, and the service (of God), and the promises; whose are the fathers, of whom, according to the flesh, Christ came, who is God over all, blessed for evermore.\"[fn-82-P8201_2715664:167-nf] Also in the Apocalypse: \"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end I will give to him that is athirst, of the fountain of living water freely.

The word of God, therefore, [recorded] by Moses, when referring to Jacob the grandson of Abraham, speaks thus: `And it came to pass, when the sheep conceived, that I saw them with my eyes in the dream: And, behold, the he-goats and the rams which leaped upon the sheep and she-goats were spotted with white, and speckled and sprinkled with a dun colour. And the Angel of God said to me in the dream, Jacob, Jacob. And I said, What is it, Lord? And He said, Lift up thine eyes, and see that the he-goats and rams leaping on the sheep and she-goats are spotted with white, speckled, and sprinkled with a dun colour. For I have seen what Laban doeth unto thee. I am the God who appeared to thee in Bethel,[fn-45-P4556_956486:204-nf] where thou anointedst a pillar and vowedst a vow unto Me. Now therefore arise, and get thee out of this land, and depart to the land of thy birth, and I shall be with thee.'[fn-45-P4557_956701:205-nf] And again, in other words, speaking of the same Jacob, it thus says: `And having risen up that night, he took the two wives, and the two women-servants, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford Jabbok; and he took them and went over the brook, and sent over all his belongings. But Jacob was left behind alone, and an Angel[fn-45-P4558_957059:206-nf] wrestled with him until morning. And He saw that He is not prevailing against him, and He touched the broad part of his thigh; and the broad part of Jacob's thigh grew stiff while he wrestled with Him. And He said, Let Me go, for the day breaketh. But he said, I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me. And He said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And He said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; for thou hast prevailed with God, and with men shalt be powerful. And Jacob asked Him, and said, Tell me Thy name. But he said, Why dost thou ask after My name? And He blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of that place Peniel,[fn-45-P4559_957769:207-nf] for I saw God face to face, and my soul rejoiced.'[fn-45-P4560_957857:208-nf] And again, in other terms, referring to the same Jacob, it says the following: `And Jacob came to Luz, in the land of Canaan, which is Bethel, he and all the people that were with him. And there he built an altar, and called the name of that place Bethel; for there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother Esau. And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and Jacob called the name of it The Oak of Sorrow. And God appeared again to Jacob in Luz, when he came out from Mesopotamia in Syria, and He blessed him. And God said to him, Thy name shall be no more called Jacob, but Israel shall he thy name.'[fn-45-P4561_958544:209-nf] He is called God, and He is and shall be God.\" And when all had agreed on these grounds, I continued: \"Moreover, I consider it necessary to repeat to you the words which narrate how He who is both Angel and God and Lord, and who appeared as a man to Abraham, and who wrestled in human form with Jacob, was seen by him when he fled from his brother Esau. They are as follows: `And Jacob went out from the well of the oath,[fn-45-P4562_958990:210-nf] and went toward Charran.[fn-45-P4563_959039:211-nf] And he lighted on a spot, and slept there, for the sun was set; and he gathered of the stones of the place, and put them under his head. And he slept in that place; and he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, whose top reached to heaven; and the angels of God ascended and descended upon it. And the Lord stood[fn-45-P4564_959409:212-nf] above it, and He said, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham thy father, and of Isaac; be not afraid: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and shall be extended to the west, and south, and north, and east: and in thee, and in thy seed, shall all families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am with thee, keeping thee in every way wherein thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done all that I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up in the morning, and took the stone which he had placed under his head, and he set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it; and Jacob called the name of the place The House of God, and the name of the city formerly was Ulammaus.'\"[fn-45-P4565_960486:213-nf] ","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":35,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":62,"source_paragraph":"407","folder":"ANF-01","text":"And I replied, \"Now assuredly, Trypho, I shall show that, in the vision of Moses, this same One alone who is called an Angel, and who is God, appeared to and communed with Moses.

Ye that are well instructed in the school of Christ, know that this Jacob is Israel too. They are two names; for they are one man. His first name Jacob, which is by interpretation supplanter, he received when he was born. For when those twins were born, his brother Esau was born first; and the hand of the younger was found on the elder's foot.[fn-58-P5879_2491870:13-nf] He held his brother's foot who preceded him in his birth, and himself came after And because of this occurrence, because he held his brother's heel,[fn-58-P5880_2492042:14-nf] he was called Jacob, that is, Supplanter. And afterwards, when he was returning from Mesopotamia, the Angel wrestled with him in the way.[fn-58-P5881_2492194:15-nf] What comparison can there. be between an Angel's and a man's strength? Therefore it is a mystery, a sacrament, a prophecy, a figure; let us therefore understand it. For consider the manner of the struggle too. While he wrestleth, Jacob prevailed against the Angel. Some high meaning is here. And when the man had prevailed against the Angel, he kept hold of Him; yes, the man kept hold of Him whom he had conquered. And said to Him, \"I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.\"[fn-58-P5882_2492696:16-nf] When the conqueror was blessed by the Conquered, Christ was figured. So then that Angel, who is understood to be the Lord Jesus, saith to Jacob, \"Thou shall not be any more called Jacob, but Israel shall thy name be,\"[fn-58-P5883_2492935:17-nf] which is by interpretation,\" Seeing God.\" After this He touched the sinew of his thigh, the broad part, that is, of the thigh, and it dried up; and Jacob became lame. Such was He who was conquered. So great power had this Conquered One, as to touch the thigh, and make lame. It was then with His Own will that He was conquered. For He \"had power to lay down\" His strength, \"and He had power to take It up.\"[fn-58-P5884_2493362:18-nf] He is not angry at being conquered, for He is not angry at being crucified. For He even blessed him, saying, \"Thou shall not be called Jacob, but Israel.\" Then the\" supplanter\" was made \"the seer of God.\" And He touched, as I have said, his thigh, and made him lame. Observe in Jacob the people of the Jews, those thousands who followed and went before the Lord's beast, who in concert with the Apostles worshipped the Lord, and cried out, \"Hosanna to the Son of David, Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord.\"[fn-58-P5885_2493901:19-nf] Behold Jacob blessed. He has continued lame until now in them who are at this day Jews. For the broad part of the thigh signifies the multitude ofincrease. Of whom the Psalm, when it prophesied that the Nations should believe, speaketh, saying, \"A people whom I have not known, hath served Me; by the hearing of the ear it hath obeyed Me.\"[fn-58-P5886_2494260:20-nf] I was not there, and I was heard; here I was, and I was killed. \"A people whom I have not known, hath served Me; by the hearing of the ear it hath obeyed Me.\" Therefore, \"faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.\"[fn-58-P5887_2494555:21-nf] And it goes on, \"The strange children have lied unto Me;\" concerning the Jews. \"The strange children have lied unto Me, the strange children have faded away and have halted from their paths.\" I have pointed out Jacob to you, Jacob blessed and Jacob lame.","title":"Sermon LXXII.
