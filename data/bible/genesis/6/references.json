He, when six hundred years old, built an ark, as God had commanded him, in which he himself was saved, together with his wife and three sons, and as many daughters-in-law, when the water had covered all the loftiest mountains. Then when the earth was dry, God, execrating the wickedness of the former age, that the length of life might not again be a cause of meditating evils, gradually diminished the age of man by each successive generation, and placed a limit at a hundred and twenty years,[fn-7-P733_296938:199-nf] which it might not be permitted to exceed. But he, when he went forth from the ark, as the sacred writings inform us, diligently cultivated the earth, and planted a vineyard with his own hand. From which circumstance they are refuted who regard Bacchus as the author of wine. For he not only preceded Bacchus, but also Saturn and Uranus, by many generations. And when he had first taken the fruit from the vineyard, having become merry, he drank even to intoxication, and lay naked. And when one of his sons, whose name was Cham,[fn-7-P734_297962:200-nf] had seen this, he did not cover his father's nakedness, but went out and told the circumstance to his brothers also. But they, having taken a garment, entered with their faces turned backwards, and covered their father.[fn-7-P735_298194:201-nf] And when their father became aware of what had been done he disowned and sent away his son. But he went into exile, and settled in a part of that land which is now called Arabia; and that land was called from him Chanaan, and his posterity Chanaanites. This was the first nation which was ignorant of God, since its prince and founder did not receive from his father the worship of God, being cursed by him;[fn-7-P736_298622:202-nf] and thus he left to his descendants ignorance of the divine nature.[fn-7-P737_299182:203-nf] ","title":"Book II.

Of astrologers there should be no speaking even;[fn-6-P681_289508:46-nf] but since one in these days has challenged us, defending on his own behalf perseverance in that profession, I will use a few words. I allege not that he honours idols, whose names he has inscribed on the heaven,[fn-6-P682_289767:47-nf] to whom he has attributed all God's power; because men, presuming that we are disposed of by the immutable arbitrament of the stars, think on that account that God is not to be sought after. One proposition I lay down: that those angels, the deserters from God, the lovers of women,[fn-6-P683_290093:48-nf] were likewise the discoverers of this curious art, on that account also condemned by God. Oh divine sentence, reaching even unto the earth in its vigour, whereto the unwitting render testimony! The astrologers are expelled just like their angels. The city and Italy are interdicted to the astrologers, just as heaven to their angels.[fn-6-P684_290622:49-nf] There is the same penalty of exclusion for disciples and masters. \"But Magi and astrologers came from the east.\"[fn-6-P685_290777:50-nf] We know the mutual alliance of magic and astrology. The interpreters of the stars, then, were the first to announce Christ's birth the first to present Him \"gifts.\" By this bond, [must] I imagine, they put Christ under obligation to themselves? What then? Shall therefore the religion of those Magi act as patron now also to astrologers? Astrology now-a-days, forsooth, treats of Christ-is the science of the stars of Christ; not of Saturn, or Mars, and whomsoever else out of the same class of the dead[fn-6-P686_291300:51-nf] it pays observance to and preaches? But, however, that science has been allowed until the Gospel, in order that after Christ's birth no one should thence forward interpret any one's nativity by the heaven. For they therefore offered to the then infant Lord that frankincense and myrrh and gold, to be, as it were, the close of worldly[fn-6-P687_291773:52-nf] sacrifice and glory, which Christ was about to do away. What, then? The dream-sent, doubtless, of the will of God-suggested to the same Magi, namely, that they should go home, but by another way, not that by which they came. It means this: that they should not walk in their ancient path.[fn-6-P688_292084:53-nf] Not that Herod should not pursue them, who in fact did not pursue them; unwitting even that they had departed by another way, since be was withal unwitting by what way they came. Just so we ought to understand by it the right Way and Discipline. And so the precept was rather, that thence forward they should walk otherwise. So, too, that other species of magic which operates by miracles, emulous even in opposition to Moses,[fn-6-P689_292526:54-nf] tried God's patience until the Gospel. For thenceforward Simon Magus, just turned believer, (since he was still thinking somewhat of his juggling sect; to wit, that among the miracles of his profession he might buy even the gift of the Holy Spirit through imposition of hands) was cursed by the apostles, and ejected from the faith.[fn-6-P690_292910:55-nf] Both he and that other magician, who was with Sergius Paulus, (since he began opposing himself to the same apostles) was mulcted with loss of eyes.[fn-6-P691_293084:56-nf] The same fate, I believe, would astrologers, too, have met, if any had fallen in the way of the apostles. But yet, when magic is punished, of which astrology is a species, of course the species is condemned in the genus. After the Gospel, you will nowhere find either sophists, Chaldeans, enchanters, diviners, or magicians, except as clearly punished. \"Where is the wise, where the grammarian, where the disputer of this age? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this age? \"[fn-6-P692_293589:57-nf] You know nothing, astrologer, if you know not that you should be a Christian. If you did know it, you ought to have known this also, that you should have nothing more to do with that profession of yours which, of itself, fore-chants the climacterics of others, and might instruct you of its own danger. There is no part nor lot for you in that system of yours.[fn-6-P693_293969:58-nf] He cannot hope for the kingdom of the heavens, whose finger or wand abuses[fn-6-P694_294068:59-nf] the heaven.","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_09_iii_on_the_veiling_of_virgins_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-04","text":"If \"the man is bead of the woman,\"[fn-6-P606_137629:26-nf] of course (he is) of the virgin too, from whom comes the woman who has married; unless the virgin is a third generic class, some monstrosity with a head of its own. If\" it is shameful for a woman to be shaven or shorn,\" of course it is so for a virgin. (Hence let the world, the rival of God, see to it, if it asserts that close-cut hair is graceful to a virgin in like manner as that flowing hair is to a boy.) To her, then, to whom it is equally unbecoming to be shaven or shorn, it is equally becoming to be covered. If\" the woman is the glory of the man,\" how much more the virgin, who is a glory withal to herself! If \"the woman is of the man,\" and \"for the sake of the man,\" that rib of Adam[fn-6-P607_138350:27-nf] was first a virgin. If \"the woman ought to have power upon the head,\"[fn-6-P608_138439:28-nf] all the more justly ought the virgin, to whom pertains the essence of the cause (assigned for this assertion). For if (it is) on account of the angels-those, to wit, whom we read of as having fallen from God and heaven on account of concupiscence after females-who can presume that it was bodies already defiled, and relics of human lust, which such angels yearned after, so as not rather to have been inflamed for virgins, whose bloom pleads an excuse for human lust likewise? For thus does Scripture withal suggest: \"And it came to pass,\" it says, \"when men had begun to grow more numerous upon the earth, there were withal daughters born them; but the sons of God, having descried the daughters of men, that they were fair, took to themselves wives of all whom they elected.\"[fn-6-P609_139238:29-nf] For here the Greek name of women does seem to have the sense \"wives,\" inasmuch as mention is made of marriage. When, then, it says \"the daughters of men,\" it manifestly purports virgins, who would be still reckoned as belonging to their parents-for wedded women are called their husbands'-whereas it could have said \"the wives of men: \"in like manner not naming the angels adulterers, but husbands, while they take unwedded\" daughters of men,\" who it has above said were \"born,\" thus also signifying their virginity: first,\"born; \"but here, wedded to angels. Anything else I know not that they were except \"born\" and subsequently wedded. So perilous a face, then, ought to be shaded, which has cast stumbling-stones even so far as heaven: that, when standing in the presence of God, at whose bar it stands accused of the driving of the angels from their (native) confines, it may blush before the other angels as well; and may repress that former evil liberty of its head,-(a liberty) now to be exhibited not even before human eyes. But even if they were females already contaminated whom those angels had desired, so much the more \"on account of the angels\" would it have been the duty of virgins to be veiled, as it would have been the more possible for virgins to have been the cause of the angels' sinning. If, moreover, the apostle further adds the prejudgment of \"nature,\" that redundancy of locks is an honour to a woman, because hair serves for a covering,[fn-6-P610_140723:30-nf] of course it is most of all to a virgin that this is a distinction; for their very adornment properly consists in this, that, by being massed together upon the crown, it wholly covers the very citadel of the head with an encirclement of hair.","title":"III.

In order, therefore, that the human mind might be purged from falsities of this kind, Holy Scripture, which suits itself to babes has not avoided words drawn from any class of things really existing, through which, as by nourishment, our understanding might rise gradually to things divine and transcendent. For, in speaking of God, it has both used words taken from things corporeal, as when it says, \"Hide me under the shadow of Thy wings;\"[fn-1-P175_53734:2-nf] and it has borrowed many things from the spiritual creature, whereby to signify that which indeed is not so, but must needs so be said: as, for instance, \"I the Lord thy God am a jealous God;\"[fn-1-P176_53943:3-nf] and, \"It repenteth me that I have made man.\"[fn-1-P177_54002:4-nf] But it has drawn no words whatever, whereby to frame either figures of speech or enigmatic sayings, from things which do not exist at all. And hence it is that they who are shut out from the truth by that third kind of error are more mischievously and emptily vain than their fellows; in that they surmise respecting God, what can neither be found in Himself nora in ny creature. For divine Scripture is wont to frame, as it were, allurements for children from the things which are found in the creature; whereby, according to their measure, and as it were by steps, the affections of the weak may be moved to seek those things that are above, and to leave those things that are below.

They who abuse thee, do thee equal hurt with them who use thee not. In fact, neither is such continence laudable because it is heretical, nor such licence defensible because it is psychical. The former is blasphemous, the latter wanton; the former destroys the God of marriages, the latter puts Him to the blush.

But it is now time for us to raise the standard of Joshua's chastity. It is written that Moses had a wife. Now Moses is interpreted both by our Lord and by the Apostle to mean the law:[fn-62-P6279_1921028:124-nf] \"They have Moses and the prophets.\" And[fn-62-P6280_1921092:125-nf] \"Death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression.\" And no one doubts that in both passages Moses signifies the law. We read that Moses, that is the law, had a wife: shew me then in the same way that Joshua the son of Nun had either wife or children, and if you can do so, I will confess that I am beaten. He certainly received the fairest spot in the division of the land of Judah, and died, not in the twenties, which are ever unlucky in Scripture-by them are reckoned the years of[fn-62-P6281_1921661:126-nf] Jacob's service,[fn-62-P6282_1921700:127-nf] the price of Joseph, and[fn-62-P6283_1921749:128-nf] sundry presents which Esau who was fond of them received-but in the[fn-62-P6284_1921840:129-nf] tens, whose praises we have often sung; and he was buried in[fn-62-P6285_1921961:130-nf] Thamnath Sare, that is, most perfect sovereignty, or among those of a new covering, to signify the crowds of virgins, covered by the Saviour's aid on Mount Ephraim, that is, the fruitful mountain; on the north of the Mountain of Gaash, which is, being interpreted, disturbance: for[fn-62-P6286_1922757:131-nf] \"Mount Sion is on the sides of the north, the city of the Great King,\" is ever exposed to hatred, and in every trial says[fn-62-P6287_1922955:132-nf] \"But my feet had well nigh slipped.\" The book which bears the name of Joshua ends with his burial. Again in the book of Judges we read of him as though he had risen and come to life again, and by way of summary his works are extolled. We read too[fn-62-P6288_1923224:133-nf] \"So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance, that they might possess the land.\" And \"Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua,\" and so on. There immediately follows: \"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.\" Moses, moreover, only saw the land of promise; he could not enter: and[fn-62-P6289_1923605:134-nf] \"he died in the land of Moab, and the Lord buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.\" Let us compare the burial of the two: Moses died in the land of Moab, Joshua in the land of Judaea. The former was buried in a valley over against the house of Phogor, which is, being interpreted, reproach (for the Hebrew Phogor corresponds to Priapus[fn-62-P6290_1924044:135-nf] ); the latter in Mount Ephraim on the north of Mount Gaash. And in the simple expressions of the sacred Scriptures there is always a more subtle meaning. The Jews gloried in children and child-bearing; and the barren woman, who had not offspring in Israel, was accursed; but blessed was he whose seed was in Sion, and his family in Jerusalem; and part of the highest blessing was,[fn-62-P6291_1924564:136-nf] \"Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thy house, thy children like olive plants, round about thy table.\" Therefore his grave is described as placed in a valley over against the house of an idol which was in a special sense consecrated to lust. But we who fight under Joshua our leader, even to the present day know not where Moses was buried. For we despise Phogor, and all his shame, knowing that they who are in the flesh cannot please God. And the Lord before the flood had said[fn-62-P6292_1925097:137-nf] \"My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh.\" Wherefore, when Moses died, the people of Israel mourned for him; but Joshua like one on his way to victory was unmourned.

For unless He had given it to all by no means would He have habitually permitted even proselytes out of the nations to have access to it. But-as is congruous with the goodness of God, and with His equity, as the Fashioner of mankind-He gave to all nations the selfsame law, which at definite and stated times He enjoined should be observed, when He willed, and through whom He willed, and as He willed. For in the beginning of the world He gave to Adam himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of the tree planted in the midst of paradise; but that, if they did contrariwise, by death they were to die.[fn-20-P2047_698574:16-nf] Which law had continued enough for them, had it been kept. For in this law given to Adam we recognise in embryo[fn-20-P2048_698720:17-nf] all the precepts which afterwards sprouted forth when given through Moses; that is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart and out of thy whole soul; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;[fn-20-P2049_698941:18-nf] Thou shalt not kill; Thou shall not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; False witness thou shall not utter; Honour thy father and mother; and, That which is another's, shall thou not covet. For the primordial law was given to Adam and Eve in paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of God. In short, if they had loved the Lord their God, they would not have contravened His precept; if they had habitually loved their neighbour-that is, themselves[fn-20-P2050_699548:19-nf] -they would not have believed the persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed murder upon themselves,[fn-20-P2051_699698:20-nf] by falling[fn-20-P2052_699740:21-nf] from immortality, by contravening God's precept; from theft also they would have abstained, if they had not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had been anxious to skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their God; nor would they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating devil, by believing him that they would be \"like God; \"and thus they would not have offended God either, as their Father, who had fashioned them from clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if they had not coveted another's, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit. Therefore, in this general and primordial law of God, the observance of which, in the case of the tree's fruit, He had sanctioned, we recognise enclosed all the precepts specially of the posterior Law, which germinated when disclosed at their proper times. For the subsequent superinduction of a law is the work of the same Being who had before premised a precept; since it is His province withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to form, righteous creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it? if He advances who begins? In short, before the Law of Moses,[fn-20-P2053_701005:22-nf] written in stone-tables, I contend that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood naturally, and by the fathers was habitually kept. For whence was Noah \"found righteous,\"[fn-20-P2054_701248:23-nf] if in his case the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was Abraham accounted \"a friend of God,\"[fn-20-P2055_701408:24-nf] if not on the ground of equity and righteousness, (in the observance) of a natural law? Whence was Melchizedek named \"priest of the most high God,\"[fn-20-P2056_701591:25-nf] if, before the priesthood of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer sacrifices to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from Egypt, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years. In fact, it was after Abraham's \"four hundred and thirty years\"[fn-20-P2057_702033:26-nf] that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses' Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as \"the law was given through Moses\"[fn-20-P2058_702739:27-nf] at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered \"friends of God.\" For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges?

In the symbol of our faith and hope, which was delivered by the Apostles, and is not written with paper and ink, but on fleshy tables of the heart, after the confession of the Trinity and the unity of the Church, the whole symbol of Christian dogma concludes with the resurrection of the flesh. You dwell so exclusively upon the subject of the body, harping upon it in your discourse, repeating first the body, and secondly the body, and again the body, and nine times over the body, that you do not even once name the flesh; whereas they always speak of the flesh, but say nothing of the body. I would have you know that we see through what you craftily add, and with wise precaution seek to conceal. For you make use of the same passages to prove the reality of the resurrection by means of which Origen denies it; you support questionable positions with doubtful arguments, and thus raise a storm which in a moment overthrows the settled fabric of faith. You quote the words,[fn-70-P7094_2336554:66-nf] \"It is sown an animal body: it shall rise a spiritual body.\" \"For they shall neither marry, nor be given in marriage, but shall be as the angels in heaven.\" What other instances would you take if you were denying the resurrection? You intend to confess the resurrection of the flesh, you say, in a real and not an imaginary sense. After the remarks with which you smooth things over to the ears of the ignorant, to the effect that we rise again with the very bodies with which we died and were buried, why do you not go on and speak thus: \"The Lord after His resurrection showed the prints of the nails in His hands, pointed to the wound of the spear in His side, and when the Apostles doubted because they thought they saw a phantom, gave them reply,[fn-70-P7095_2337355:67-nf] `Handle Me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and blood as ye see Me have'; and specially to Thomas,[fn-70-P7096_2337478:68-nf] `Put thy finger into My hands, and thy hand into My side, and be not faithless, but believing.' Similarly after the resurrection we shall have the same members which we now use, the same flesh and blood and bones, for it is not the nature of these which is condemned in Holy Scripture, but their works. Then again, it is written in Genesis:[fn-70-P7097_2337837:69-nf] `My Spirit shall not abide in those men, because they are flesh.' And the Apostle Paul, speaking of the corrupt doctrine and works of the Jews, says:[fn-70-P7098_2338004:70-nf] `I rested not in flesh and blood.' And to the Saints, who, of course, were in the flesh, he says:[fn-70-P7099_2338119:71-nf] `But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you.'

By the justice of God in some sense, the human race was delivered into the power of the devil; the sin of the first man passing over originally into all of both sexes in their birth through conjugal union, and the debt of our first parents binding their whole posterity. This delivering up is first signified in Genesis, where, when it had been said to the serpent, \"Dust shalt thou eat,\" it was said to the man, \"Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shall return.\"[fn-16-P1672_833140:23-nf] In the words, \"Unto dust shalt thou return,\" the death of the body is fore-announced, because he would not have experienced that either, if he had continued to the end upright as he was made; but in that it is said to him whilst still living, \"Dust thou art,\" it is shown that the whole man was changed for the worse. For \"Dust thou art\" is much the same as, \"My spirit shall not always remain in these men, for that they also are flesh.\"[fn-16-P1673_833601:24-nf] Therefore it was at that time shown, that he was delivered to him, in that it had been said to him, \"Dust shall thou eat.\" But the apostle declares this more clearly, where he says: \"And you who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of unfaithfulness; among whom we also had. our conversation in times past, in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.\"[fn-16-P1674_834249:25-nf] The \"children of unfaithfulness\" are the unbelievers; and who is not this before he becomes a believer? And therefore all men are originally under the prince of the power of the air, \"who worketh in the children of unfaithfulness.\" And that which I have expressed by \"originally\" is the same that the apostle expresses when he speaks of themselves who \"by nature\" were as others; viz. by nature as it has been depraved by sin, not as it was created upright from the beginning. But the way in which man was thus delivered into the power of the devil, ought not to be so understood as if God did this, or commanded it to be done; but that He only permitted it, yet that justly. For when He abandoned the sinner, the author of the sin immediately entered. Yet God did not certainly so abandon His own creature as not to show Himself to him as God creating and quickening, and among penal evils bestowing also many good things upon the evil. For He hath not in anger shut up His tender mercies.[fn-16-P1675_835260:26-nf] Nor did He dismiss man from the law of His own power, when He permitted him to be in the power of the devil; since even the devil himself is not separated from the power of the Omnipotent, as neither from His goodness. For whence do even the evil angels subsist in whatever manner of life they have, except through Him who quickens all things? If, therefore, the commission of sins through the just anger of God subjected man to the devil, doubtless the remission of sins through the merciful reconciliation of God rescues man from the devil.","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_20_book_xiv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But because God foresaw all things, and was therefore not ignorant that man also would fall, we ought to consider this holy city in connection with what God foresaw and ordained, and not according to our own ideas, which do not embrace God's ordination. For man, by his sin, could not disturb the divine counsel, nor compel God to change what He had decreed; for God's foreknowledge had anticipated both,-that is to say, both how evil the man whom He had created good should become, and what good He Himself should even thus derive from him. For though God is said to change His determinations (so that in a tropical sense the Holy Scripture says even that God repented[fn-24-P2423_1348287:86-nf] ), this is said with reference to man's expectation, or the order of natural causes, and not with reference to that which the Almighty had foreknown that He would do. Accordingly God, as it is written, made man upright,[fn-24-P2424_1348544:87-nf] and consequently with a good will. For if he had not had a good will, he could not have been upright. The good will, then, is the work of God; for God created him with it. But the first evil will, which preceded all man's evil acts, was rather a kind of falling away from the work of God to its own works than any positive work. And therefore the acts resulting were evil, not having God, but the will itself for their end; so that the will or the man himself, so far as his will is bad, was as it were the evil tree bringing forth evil fruit. Moreover, the bad will, though it be not in harmony with, but opposed to nature, inasmuch as it is a vice or blemish, yet it is true of it as of all vice, that it cannot exist except in a nature, and only in a nature created out of nothing, and not in that which the Creator has begotten of Himself, as He begot the Word, by whom all things were made. For though God formed man of the dust of the earth, yet the earth itself, and every earthly material, is absolutely created out of nothing; and man's soul, too, God created out of nothing, and joined to the body, when He made man. But evils are so thoroughly overcome by good, that though they are permitted to exist, for the sake of demonstrating how the most righteous foresight of God can make a good use even of them, yet good can exist without evil, as in the true and supreme God Himself, and as in every invisible and visible celestial creature that exists above this murky atmosphere; but evil cannot exist without good, because the natures in which evil exists, in so far as they are natures, are good. And evil is removed, not by removing any nature, or part of a nature, which had been introduced by the evil, but by healing and correcting that which had been vitiated and depraved. The will, therefore, is then truly free, when it is not the slave of vices and sins. Such was it given us by God; and this being lost by its own fault, can only be restored by Him who was able at first to give it. And therefore the truth says, \"If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed;\"[fn-24-P2425_1350660:88-nf] which is equivalent to saying, If the Son shall save you, ye shall be saved indeed.

For these turning-points[fn-30-P3032_1416599:136-nf] of those two ages occupy an eminent place in the ancient books. On the other hand, those of the other three ages are also declared in the Gospel,[fn-30-P3033_1416773:137-nf] where the descent of the Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh is likewise mentioned. For the third age extends from Abraham on to David the king; the fourth from David on to that captivity whereby the people of God passed over into Babylonia; and the fifth from that transmigration down to the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ. With His coming the sixth age has entered on its process; so that now the spiritual grace, which in previous times was known to a few patriarchs and prophets, may be made manifest to all nations; to the intent that no man should worship God but freely,[fn-30-P3034_1417377:138-nf] fondly desiring of Him not the visible rewards of His services and the happiness of this present life, but that eternal life alone in which he is to enjoy God Himself: in order that in this sixth age the mind of man may be renewed after the image of God, even as on the sixth day man was made after the image of God.[fn-30-P3035_1417709:139-nf] For then, too, is the law fulfilled, when all that it has commanded is done, not in the strong desire for things temporal, but in the love of Him who has given the commandment. Who is there, moreover, who should not be earnestly disposed to give the return of love to a God of supreme righteousness and also of supreme mercy, who has first loved men of the greatest unrighteousness and the loftiest pride, and that, too, so deeply as to have sent in their behalf His only Son, by whom He made all things, and who being made man, not by any change of Himself, but by the assumption of human nature, was designed thus to become capable not only of living with them, but also of dying at once for them and by their hands?","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"95","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But because he said, \"Your heart shall rejoice,\" lest we should suppose that the blessings of that Jerusalem are only spiritual, he adds, \"And your bones shall rise up like a herb,\" alluding to the resurrection of the body, and as it were supplying an omission he had made. For it will not take place when we have seen; but we shall see when it has taken place. For he had already spoken of the new heavens and the new earth, speaking repeatedly, and under many figures, of the things promised to the saints, and saying,\"There shall be new heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind; but they shall find in it gladness and exultation. Behold, I will make Jerusalem an exultation, and my people a joy. And I will exult in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her;\"[fn-39-P3957_2176778:105-nf] and other promises, which some endeavor to refer to carnal enjoyment during the thousand years. For, in the manner of prophecy, figurative and literal expressions are mingled, so that a serious mind may, by useful and salutary effort, reach the spiritual sense; but carnal sluggishness, or the slowness of an uneducated and undisciplined mind, rests in the superficial letter, and thinks there is nothing beneath to be looked for. But let this be enough regarding the style of those prophetic expressions just quoted. And now, to return to their interpretation. When he had said, \"And your bones shall rise up like a herb,\" in order to show that it was the resurrection of the good, though a bodily resurrection, to which he alluded, he added, \"And the hand of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers.\" What is this but the hand of Him who distinguishes those who worship from those who despise Him? Regarding these the context immediately adds, \"And He shall threaten the contumacious,\" or, as another translator has it, \"the unbelieving.\" He shall not actually threaten then, but the threats which are now uttered shall then be fulfilled in effect. \"For behold,\" he says, \"the Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword: many shall be wounded by the Lord.\" By fire, whirlwind, sword, he means the judicial punishment of God. For he says that the Lord Himself shall come as a fire, to those, that is to say, to whom His coming shall be penal. By His chariots (for the word is plural)we suitably understand the ministration of angels. And when he says that all flesh and all the earth shall be judged with His fire and sword, we do not understand the spiritual and holy to be included, but the earthly and carnal, of whom it is said that they \"mind earthly things,\"[fn-39-P3958_2178747:106-nf] and \"to be carnally minded is death,\"[fn-39-P3959_2178807:107-nf] and whom the Lord calls simply flesh when He says, \"My Spirit shall not always remain in these men, for they are flesh.\"[fn-39-P3960_2178949:108-nf] As to the words, \"Many shall be wounded by the Lord,\" this wounding shall produce the second death. It is possible, indeed, to understand fire, sword, and wound in a good sense. For the Lord said that He wished to send fire on the earth.[fn-39-P3961_2179206:109-nf] And the cloven tongues appeared to them as fire when the Holy Spirit came.[fn-39-P3962_2179302:110-nf] And our Lord says, \"I am not come to send peace on earth, but a sword.\"[fn-39-P3963_2179393:111-nf] And Scripture says that the word of God is a doubly sharp sword,[fn-39-P3964_2179478:112-nf] on account of the two edges, the two Testaments. And in the Song of Songs the holy Church says that she is wounded with love,[fn-39-P3965_2179624:113-nf] -pierced, as it were, with the arrow of love. But here, where we read or hear that the Lord shall come to execute vengeance, it is obvious in what sense we are to understand these expressions.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_30_5_five_books_in_reply_to_marcion_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"714","folder":"ANF-04","text":"The horde of robber-renegades,[fn-41-P4182_728185:123-nf] ) to flee","title":"5.

He adds: \"Because of the angels.\"[fn-75-P7511_2155827:343-nf] What angels? In other words, whose angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,[fn-75-P7512_2155938:344-nf] there is great propriety in his meaning. It is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty. If, however, the angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is there for them? for not even Marcion's disciples, (to say nothing of his angels, ) have any desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as evil[fn-75-P7513_2156431:345-nf] among \"works of the flesh,\" and that he would have those persons accounted estimable[fn-75-P7514_2156542:346-nf] who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,[fn-75-P7515_2156654:347-nf] we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup[fn-75-P7516_2156753:348-nf] the verity of the Lord's body and blood in opposition to Marcion's phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of \"spiritual gifts,\"[fn-75-P7517_2157084:349-nf] I have to remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower[fn-75-P7518_2157455:350-nf] shall spring up from his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.\" After which he enumerates the special gifts of the same \"The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.[fn-75-P7519_2157733:351-nf] And with the fear of the Lord[fn-75-P7520_2157801:352-nf] shall the Spirit fill Him.\"[fn-75-P7521_2157867:353-nf] In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;[fn-75-P7522_2158291:354-nf] so that you cannot argue from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says, ) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,[fn-75-P7523_2158731:355-nf] rising from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst them. From Judah were taken away \"the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet; \"[fn-75-P7524_2159162:356-nf] that so it might prove true that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-75-P7525_2159266:357-nf] Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: \"He ascended up. on high,\" that is, into heaven; \"He led captivity captive,\" meaning death or slavery of man; \"He gave gifts to the sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7526_2159546:358-nf] that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata. He says specifically \"sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7527_2159690:359-nf] and not men promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children of men truly so called, choice men, apostles. \"For,\" says he, \"I have begotten you through the gospel; \"[fn-75-P7528_2159927:360-nf] and \"Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.\"[fn-75-P7529_2160009:361-nf] Now was absolutely fulfilled that promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.\"[fn-75-P7530_2160310:362-nf] Since, then, the Creator promised the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ has in these last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle says, \"When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son; \"[fn-75-P7531_2160624:363-nf] and again, \"This I say, brethren, that the time is short\"[fn-75-P7532_2160701:364-nf] ), it evidently follows in connection with this prediction of the last days, that this gift of the Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters. Now compare the Spirit's specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised by the prophet Isaiah. \"To one is given,\" says he, \"by the Spirit the word of wisdom; \"this we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be \"the spirit of wisdom.\" \"To another, the word of knowledge; \"this will be \"the (prophet's) spirit of understanding and counsel.\" \"To another, faith by the same Spirit; \"this will be \"the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.\" \"To another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles; \"this will be \"the spirit of might.\" \"To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues; \"this will be \"the spirit of knowledge.\"[fn-75-P7533_2161674:365-nf] See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is possible that they are opposed to our side, even if[fn-75-P7550_2164330:382-nf] the Creator promised them for His Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people. Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong severally[fn-75-P7557_2165747:389-nf] to my God.

For the apostle goes on to infer (from his own statement): \"in order that unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might become known through the church the manifold wisdom of God.\"[fn-80-P8012_2280238:814-nf] Whose principalities and powers does he mean? If the Creator's, how does it come to pass that such a God as He could have meant His wisdom to be displayed to the principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For surely no principalities could possibly have understood anything without their sovereign Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage, on the ground that He (as their chief) is Himself reckoned among these (principalities), then he would have plainly said that the mystery had been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had created all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was hidden from them, he must needs be understood[fn-80-P8013_2280952:815-nf] as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all things, from His principalities and powers. For \"who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-80-P8014_2281228:816-nf] Caught in this trap, the heretic probably changed the passage, with the view of saying that his god wished to make known to his principalities and powers the fellowship of his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of the Creator, who was a stranger to the superior god,[fn-80-P8015_2281603:817-nf] and far enough removed from him, when even his own servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator, however, the future was well known. Then why was not that also known to Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven, and on His earth? From this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has it)-\"hidden from the God who created all things\"-he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus: \"in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him, and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.\" So palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing. I, on my part, now wish to engage with you in a discussion on the allegorical expressions of the apostle. What figures of speech could the novel god have found in the prophets (fit for himself)? \"He led captivity captive,\" says the apostle.[fn-80-P8016_2282781:818-nf] With what arms? In what conflicts? From the devastation of what Country? From the overthrow of what city? What women, what children, what princes did the Conqueror throw into chains? For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: \"even as Christ is the head of the Church; \"[fn-80-P8036_2285779:838-nf] and again, in like manner: \"He who loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.\"[fn-80-P8037_2285906:839-nf] You see how your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,[fn-80-P8040_2286747:842-nf] to prove that the same God is (the God) of the man[fn-80-P8041_2286810:843-nf] and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one? If there must be two, I mean to follow Him who was the first to teach the lesson. But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"As our heretic is so fond of his pruning-knife, I do not wonder when syllables are expunged by his hand, seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises his effacing process.

For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has it)-\"hidden from the God who created all things\"-he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus: \"in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him, and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.\" So palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing. I, on my part, now wish to engage with you in a discussion on the allegorical expressions of the apostle. What figures of speech could the novel god have found in the prophets (fit for himself)? \"He led captivity captive,\" says the apostle.[fn-80-P8016_2282781:818-nf] With what arms? In what conflicts? From the devastation of what Country? From the overthrow of what city? What women, what children, what princes did the Conqueror throw into chains? For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: \"even as Christ is the head of the Church; \"[fn-80-P8036_2285779:838-nf] and again, in like manner: \"He who loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.\"[fn-80-P8037_2285906:839-nf] You see how your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,[fn-80-P8040_2286747:842-nf] to prove that the same God is (the God) of the man[fn-80-P8041_2286810:843-nf] and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one? If there must be two, I mean to follow Him who was the first to teach the lesson. But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"As our heretic is so fond of his pruning-knife, I do not wonder when syllables are expunged by his hand, seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises his effacing process.

But if he states that it was hidden from them, he must needs be understood[fn-80-P8013_2280952:815-nf] as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all things, from His principalities and powers.

For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: \"even as Christ is the head of the Church; \"[fn-80-P8036_2285779:838-nf] and again, in like manner: \"He who loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.\"[fn-80-P8037_2285906:839-nf] You see how your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,[fn-80-P8040_2286747:842-nf] to prove that the same God is (the God) of the man[fn-80-P8041_2286810:843-nf] and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one? If there must be two, I mean to follow Him who was the first to teach the lesson. But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_29_the_book_concerning_the_mysteries_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"10.

But the penetrating and scientific mind will not trust to the eyes alone the task of taking the measure of reality; it will not stop at appearances, nor count that which is not seen amongst unrealities. It inquires into the qualities of the man's soul. It takes those of its characteristics which have been developed by his bodily constitution, both in combination and singly; first singly, by analysis, and then in that living combination which makes the personality of the subject. As regards the inquiry into the nature of beauty, we see, again, that the man of half-grown intelligence, when he observes an object which is bathed in the glow of a seeming beauty, thinks that that object is in its essence beautiful, no matter what it is that so prepossesses him with the pleasure of the eye. He will not go deeper into the subject. But the other, whose mind's eye is clear, and who can inspect such appearances, will neglect those elements which are the material only upon which the Form of Beauty works; to him they will be but the ladder by which he climbs to the prospect of that Intellectual Beauty, in accordance with their share in which all other beauties get their existence and their name. But for the majority, I take it, who live all their lives with such obtuse faculties of thinking, it is a difficult thing to perform this feat of mental analysis and of discriminating the material vehicle from the immanent beauty, and thereby of grasping the actual nature of the Beautiful; and if any one wants to know the exact source of all the false and pernicious conceptions of it, he would find it in nothing else but this, viz. the absence, in the soul's faculties of feeling, of that exact training which would enable them to distinguish between true Beauty and the reverse. Owing to this men give up all search after the true Beauty. Some slide into mere sensuality. Others incline in their desires to dead metallic coin. Others limit their imagination of the beautiful to worldly honours, fame, and power. There is another class which is enthusiastic about art and science. The most debased make their gluttony the test of what is good. But he who turns from all grosser thoughts and all passionate longings after what is seeming, and explores the nature of the beauty which is simple, immaterial, formless, would never make a mistake like that when he has to choose between all the objects of desire; he would never be so misled by these attractions as not to see the transient character of their pleasures and not to win his way to an utter contempt for every one of them. This, then, is the path to lead us to the discovery of the Beautiful. All other objects that attract men's love, be they never so fashionable, be they prized never so much and embraced never so eagerly, must be left below us, as too low, too fleeting, to employ the powers of loving which we possess; not indeed that those powers are to be locked up within us unused and motionless; but only that they must first be cleansed from all lower longings; then we must lift them to that height to which sense can never reach. Admiration even of the beauty of the heavens, and of the dazzling sunbeams, and, indeed, of any fair phenomenon, will then cease. The beauty noticed there will be but as the hand to lead us to the love of the supernal Beauty whose glory the heavens and the firmament declare, and whose secret the whole creation sings. The climbing soul, leaving all that she has grasped already as too narrow for her needs, will thus grasp the idea of that magnificence which is exalted far above the heavens. But how can any one reach to this, whose ambitions creep below? How can any one fly up into the heavens, who has not the wings of heaven and is not already buoyant and lofty-minded by reason of a heavenly calling? Few can be such strangers to evangelic mysteries as not to know that there is but one vehicle on which man's soul can mount into the heavens, viz. the self-made likeness in himself to the descending Dove, whose wings[fn-27-P2739_1869111:59-nf] David the Prophet also longed for. This is the allegorical name used in Scripture for the power of the Holy Spirit; whether it be because not a drop of gall[fn-27-P2740_1869284:60-nf] is found in that bird, or because it cannot bear any noisome smell, as close observers tell us. He therefore who keeps away from all bitterness and all the noisome effluvia of the flesh, and raises himself on the aforesaid wings above all low earthly ambitions, or, more than that, above the whole universe itself, will be the man to find that which is alone worth loving, and to become himself as beautiful as the Beauty which he has touched and entered, and to be made bright and luminous himself in the communion of the real Light. We are told by those who have studied the subject, that those gleams which follow each other so fast through the air at night and which some call shooting stars[fn-27-P2741_1870214:61-nf] , are nothing but the air itself streaming into the upper regions of the sky under stress of some particular blasts. They say that the fiery track is traced along the sky when those blasts ignite in the ether. In like manner, then, as this air round the earth is forced upwards by some blast and changes into the pure splendour of the ether, so the mind of man leaves this murky miry world, and under the stress of the spirit becomes pure and luminous in contact with the true and supernal Purity; in such an atmosphere it even itself emits light, and is so filled with radiance, that it becomes itself a Light, according to the promise of our Lord that \"the righteous should shine forth as the sun[fn-27-P2742_1871704:62-nf] .\" We see this even here, in the case of a mirror, or a sheet of water, or any smooth surface that can reflect the light; when they receive the sunbeam they beam themselves; but they would not do this if any stain marred their pure and shining surface. We shall become then as the light, in our nearness to Christ's true light, if we leave this dark atmosphere of the earth and dwell above; and we shall be light, as our Lord says somewhere to His disciples[fn-27-P2743_1872186:63-nf] , if the true Light that shineth in the dark comes down even to us; unless, that is, any foulness of sin spreading over our hearts should dim the brightness of our light. Perhaps these examples have led us gradually on to the discovery that we can be changed into something better than ourselves; and it has been proved as well that this union of the soul with the incorruptible Deity can be accomplished in no other way but by herself attaining by her virgin state to the utmost purity possible,-a state which, being like God, will enable her to grasp that to which it is like, while she places herself like a mirror beneath the purity of God, and moulds her own beauty at the touch and the sight of the Archetype of all beauty. Take a character strong enough to turn from all that is human, from persons, from wealth, from the pursuits of Art and Science, even from whatever in moral practice and in legislation is viewed as right (for still in all of them error in the apprehension of the Beautiful comes in, sense being the criterion); such a character will feel as a passionate lover only towards that Beauty which has no source but Itself, which is not such at one particular time or relatively only, which is Beautiful from, and through, and in itself, not such at one moment and in the next ceasing to be such, above all increase and addition, incapable of change and alteration.

For when He speaks of all power and all judgment, and says that all things were made by Him, and all things have been delivered into His hand, He allows no exception (in respect) of time, because they would not be all things unless they were the things of all time. It is the Son, therefore, who has been from the beginning administering judgment, throwing down the haughty tower, and dividing the tongues, punishing the whole world by the violence of waters, raining upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone, as the Lord from the Lord. For He it was who at all times came down to hold converse with men, from Adam on to the patriarchs and the prophets, in vision, in dream, in mirror, in dark saying; ever from the beginning laying the foundation of the course of His dispensations, which He meant to follow out to the very last. Thus was He ever learning even as God to converse with men upon earth, being no other than the Word which was to be made flesh. But He was thus learning (or rehearsing), in order to level for us the way of faith, that we might the more readily believe that the Son of God had come down into the world, if we knew that in times past also something similar had been done.[fn-106-P10624_2984308:199-nf] For as it was on our account and for our learning that these events are described in the Scriptures, so for our sakes also were they done-(even ours, I say), \"upon whom the ends of the world are come.\"[fn-106-P10625_2984562:200-nf] In this way it was that even then He knew full well what human feelings and affections were, intending as He always did to take upon Him man's actual component substances, body and soul, making inquiry of Adam (as if He were ignorant),[fn-106-P10626_2984825:201-nf] \"Where art thou, Adam? \"[fn-106-P10627_2984907:202-nf] -repenting that He had made man, as if He had lacked foresight;[fn-106-P10628_2984991:203-nf] tempting Abraham, as if ignorant of what was in man; offended with persons, and then reconciled to them; and whatever other (weaknesses and imperfections) the heretics lay hold of (in their assumptions) as unworthy of God, in order to discredit the Creator, not considering that these circumstances are suitable enough for the Son, who was one day to experience even human sufferings-hunger and thirst, and tears, and actual birth and real death, and in respect of such a dispensation \"made by the Father a little less than the angels.\"[fn-106-P10629_2985547:204-nf] But the heretics, you may be sure, will not allow that those things are suitable even to the Son of God, which you are imputing to the very Father Himself, when you pretend[fn-106-P10630_2985740:205-nf] that He made Himself less (than the angels) on our account; whereas the Scripture informs us that He who was made less was so affected by another, and not Himself by Himself.

Surely even these things could not have been believed even of the Son of God, unless they had been given us in the Scriptures; possibly also they could not have been believed of the Father, even if they had been given in the Scriptures, since these men bring Him down into Mary's womb, and set Him before Pilate's judgment-seat, and bury Him in the sepulchre of Joseph. Hence, therefore, their error becomes manifest; for, being ignorant that the entire order of the divine administration has from the very first had its course through the agency of the Son, they believe that the Father Himself was actually seen, and held converse with men. and worked, and was athirst, and suffered hunger (in spite of the prophet who says: \"The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, shall never thirst at all, nor be hungry; \"[fn-106-P10637_2988074:212-nf] much more, shall neither die at any time, nor be buried!), and therefore that it was uniformly one God, even the Father, who at all times did Himself the things which were really done by Him through the agency of the Son.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_45_book_i_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"ANF-04","text":"7. But if this is to be understood as spoken of the Spirit of God, since Adam also is found to have prophesied of some things, it may be taken not as of general application, but as confined to those who are saints. Finally, also, at the time of the flood, when all flesh had corrupter their way before God, it is recorded that God spoke thus, as of undeserving men and sinners: \"My Spirit shall not abide with those men for ever, because they are flesh.\"[fn-63-P6361_1168520:80-nf] By which, it is clearly shown that the Spirit of God is taken away from all who are unworthy. In the Psalms also it is written: \"Thou wilt take away their spirit, and they will die, and return to their earth. Thou wilt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and Thou wilt renew the face of the earth; \"[fn-63-P6362_1168851:81-nf] which is manifestly intended of the Holy Spirit, who, after sinners and unworthy persons have been taken away and destroyed, creates for Himself a new people, and renews the face of the earth, when, laying aside, through the grace of the Spirit, the old map with his deeds, they begin to walk in newness of life. And therefore the expression is competently applied to the Holy Spirit, because He will take up His dwelling, not in all men, nor in those who are flesh, but in those whose land[fn-63-P6363_1169364:82-nf] has been renewed. Lastly, for this reason was the grace and revelation of the Holy Spirit bestowed by the imposition of the apostles' hands after baptism. Our Saviour also, after the resurrection, when old things had already passed away, and all things had become new, Himself a new man, and the first-born from the dead, His apostles also being renewed by faith in His resurrection, says, \"Receive the Holy Spirit; \"[fn-63-P6364_1169794:83-nf] This is doubtless what the Lord the Saviour meant to convey in the Gospel, when He said that new wine cannot be put into old bottles, but commanded that the bottles should be made new, i.e., that men should walk in newness of life, that they might receive the new wine, i.e., the newness of grace of the Holy Spirit. In this manner, then, is the working of the power of God the Father and of the Son extended without distinction to every creature; but a share in the Holy Spirit we find possessed only by the saints. And therefore it is said, \"No man can say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-63-P6365_1170415:84-nf] And on one occasion, scarcely even the apostles themselves are deemed worthy to hear the words, \"Ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you.\"[fn-63-P6366_1170595:85-nf] For this reason, also, I think it follows that he who has committed a sin against the Son of man is deserving of forgiveness; because if he who is a participator of the word or reason of God cease to live agreeably to reason, he seems to have fallen into a state of ignorance or folly, and therefore to deserve forgiveness; whereas he who has been deemed worthy to have a portion of the Holy Spirit, and who has relapsed, is, by this very act and work, said to be guilty of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Let no one indeed suppose that we, from having said that the Holy Spirit is conferred upon the saints alone, but that the benefits or operations of the Father and of the Son extend to good and bad, to just and unjust, by so doing give a preference to the Holy Spirit over the Father and the Son, or assert that His dignity is greater, which certainly would be a very illogical conclusion. For it is the peculiarity of His grace and operations that we have been describing. Moreover, nothing in the Trinity can be called greater or less, since the fountain of divinity alone contains all things by His word and reason, and by the Spirit of His mouth sanctifies all things which are worthy of sanctification, as it is written in the Psalm: \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens strengthened, and all their power by the Spirit of His mouth.\"[fn-63-P6367_1171964:86-nf] There is also a special working of God the Father, besides that by which He bestowed upon all things the gift of natural life. There is also a special ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ to those upon whom he confers by nature the gift of reason, by means of which they are enabled to be rightly what they are. There is also another grace of the Holy Spirit, which is bestowed upon the deserving, through the ministry of Christ and the working of the Father, in proportion to the merits of those who are rendered capable of receiving it. This is most clearly pointed out by the Apostle Paul, when demonstrating that the power of the Trinity is one and the same, in the words, \"There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit; there are diversities of administrations, but the same Lord; and there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit: withal.\"[fn-63-P6368_1172939:87-nf] From which it most clearly follows that there is no difference in the Trinity, but that which is called the gift of the Spirit is made known through the Son, and operated by God the Father. \"But all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every one severally as He will.\"[fn-63-P6369_1173254:88-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_46_a_plea_for_the_christians","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"186","folder":"ANF-02","text":"What need is there, in speaking to you who have searched into every department of knowledge, to mention the poets, or to examine opinions of another kind? Let it suffice to say thus much. If the poets and philosophers did not acknowledge that there is one God, and concerning these gods were not of opinion, some that they are demons, others that they are matter, and others that they once were men,-there might be some show of reason for our being harassed as we are, since we employ language which makes a distinction between God and matter, and the natures of the two. For, as we acknowledge a God, and a Son his Logos, and a Holy Spirit, united in essence,-the Father, the Son, the Spirit, because the Son is the Intelligence, Reason, Wisdom of the Father, and the Spirit an effluence, as light from fire; so also do we apprehend the existence of other powers, which exercise dominion about matter, and by means of it, and one in particular, which is hostile to God: not that anything is really opposed to God, like strife to friendship, according to Empedocles, and night to day, according to the appearing and disappearing of the stars (for even if anything had placed itself in opposition to God, it would have ceased to exist, its structure being destroyed by the power and might of God), but that to the good that is in God, which belongs of necessity to Him, and co-exists with Him, as colour with body, without which it has no existence (not as being part of it, but as an attendant property co-existing with it, united and blended, just as it is natural for fire to be yellow and the ether dark blue),-to the good that is in God, I say, the spirit which is about matter,[fn-23-P2399_654877:89-nf] who was created by God; just as the other angels were created by Him, and entrusted with the control of matter and the forms of matter, is opposed. For this is the office of the angels,-to exercise providence for God over the things created and ordered by Him; so that God may have the universal and general providence of the whole, while the particular parts are provided for by the angels appointed over them.[fn-24-P2400_655322:90-nf] Just as with men, who have freedom of choice as to both virtue and vice (for you would not either honour the good or punish the bad, unless vice and virtue were in their own power; and some are diligent in the matters entrusted to them by you, and others faithless), so is it among the angels. Some, free agents, you will observe, such as they were created by God, continued in those things for which God had made and over which He had ordained them; but some outraged both the constitution of their nature and the government entrusted to them: namely, this ruler of matter and its various forms, and others of those who were placed about this first firmament (you know that we say nothing without witnesses, but state the things which have been declared by the prophets); these fell into impure love of virgins, and were subjugated by the flesh, and he became negligent and wicked in the management of the things entrusted to him. Of these lovers of virgins, therefore, were begotten those who are called giants.[fn-24-P2401_656501:91-nf] And if something has been said by the poets, too, about the giants, be not surprised at this: worldly Wisdom and divine differ as much from each other as truth and plausibility: the one is of heaven and the other of earth; and indeed, according to the prince of matter,-","title":"A Plea For the Christians","author":"Writings of Athenagoras"},{"chapter":6,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_51_on_prayer_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"79","folder":"ANF-03","text":"They who make this concession[fn-119-P11945_3334751:115-nf] ought to reflect on the nature of the word itself-what is the meaning of \"woman\" from the very first records of the sacred writings. Here they find it to be the name of the sex, not a class of the sex: if, that is, God gave to Eve, when she had not yet known a man, the surname \"woman\" and \"female\"[fn-119-P11946_3335110:116-nf] -(\"female,\" whereby the sex generally; \"woman,\" hereby a class of the sex, is marked).[fn-119-P11947_3335285:117-nf] So, since at that time the as yet unwedded Eve was called by the word \"woman,\" that word has been made common even to a virgin.[fn-119-P11948_3335569:118-nf] Nor is it wonderful that the apostle-guided, of course, by the same Spirit by whom, as all the divine Scripture, so that book Genesis, was drawn up-has used the selfsame word in writing \"women,\" which, by the example of Eve unwedded, is applicable too to a \"virgin.\" In fact, all the other passages are in consonance herewith. For even by this very fact, that he has not named \"virgins\" (as he does in another place[fn-119-P11949_3336175:119-nf] where he is teaching touching marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made touching every woman, and touching the whole sex; and that there is no distinction made between a \"virgin\" and any other, while he does not name her at all. For he who elsewhere-namely, where the difference requires-remembers to make the distinction, (moreover, he makes it by designating each species by their appropriate names, ) wishes, where he makes no distinction (while he does not name each), no difference to be understood. What of the fact that in the Greek speech, in which the apostle wrote his letters, it is usual to say, \"women\" rather than \"females; \"that is, gunai=kaj (gunaikas) rather than qhlei/aj (theleias)? Therefore if that word,[fn-119-P11950_3336952:120-nf] which by interpretation represents what \"female\" (femina) represents,[fn-119-P11951_3337036:121-nf] is frequently used instead of the name of the sex[fn-119-P11952_3337467:122-nf] he has named the sex in saying gunai=ka; but in the sex even the virgin is embraced. But, withal, the declaration is plain: \"Every woman,\" saith he, \"praying and prophesying with head uncovered,[fn-119-P11953_3337678:123-nf] dishonoureth her own head.\"[fn-119-P11954_3337729:124-nf] What is \"every woman, but woman of every age, of every rank, of every condition? By saying\" every\" he excepts nought of womanhood, just as he excepts nought of manhood either from not being covered; for just so he says, \"Every man.\"[fn-119-P11955_3337983:125-nf] As, then, in the masculine sex, under the name of\" man\" even the\" youth\" is forbidden to be veiled; so, too, in the feminine, under the name of \"woman,\" even the \"virgin\" is bidden to be veiled. Equally in each sex let the younger age follow the discipline of the elder; or else let the male \"virgins,\"[fn-119-P11956_3338307:126-nf] too, be veiled, if the female virgins withal are not veiled, because they are not mentioned by name. Let \"man\" and \"youth\" be different, if \"woman\" and \"virgin\" are different. For indeed it is \"on account of the angels\"[fn-119-P11957_3338591:127-nf] that he saith women must be veiled, because on account of \"the daughters of men\" angels revolted from God.[fn-119-P11958_3338720:128-nf] Who then, would contend that \"women\" alone-that is,[fn-119-P11959_3339001:129-nf] such as were already wedded and had lost their virginity-were the objects of angelic concupiscence, unless \"virgins\" are incapable of excelling in beauty and finding lovers? Nay, let us see whether it were not virgins alone whom they lusted after; since Scriptures saith \"the daughters of men; \"[fn-119-P11960_3339369:130-nf] inasmuch as it might have named \"wives of men,\" or \"females,\" indifferently.[fn-119-P11961_3339465:131-nf] Likewise, in that it saith, \"And they took them to themselves for wives,\"[fn-119-P11962_3339657:132-nf] it does so on this ground, that, of course, such are \"received for wives\" as are devoid of that title. But it would have expressed itself differently concerning such as were not thus devoid. And so (they who are named) are devoid as much of widowhood as of virginity. So completely has Paul by naming the sex generally, mingled \"daughters\" and species together in the genus. Again, while he says that \"nature herself,\"[fn-119-P11963_3340095:133-nf] which has assigned hair as a tegument and ornament to women, \"teaches that veiling is the duty of females,\" has not the same tegument and the same honour of the head been assigned also to virgins? If \"it is shameful\" for a woman to be shorn it is similarly so to a virgin too. From them, then, to whom is assigned one and the same law of the head,[fn-119-P11964_3340465:134-nf] one and the same discipline[fn-119-P11965_3340516:135-nf] of the head is exacted,-(which extends) even unto those virgins whom their childhood defends,[fn-119-P11966_3340631:136-nf] for from the first[fn-119-P11967_3340673:137-nf] a virgin was named \"female.\" This custom,[fn-119-P11968_3340746:138-nf] in short, even Israel observes; but if Israel did not observe it, our Law,[fn-119-P11969_3340865:139-nf] amplified and supplemented, would vindicate the addition for itself; let it be excused for imposing the veil on virgins also. Under our dispensation, let that age which is ignorant of its sex[fn-119-P11970_3341104:140-nf] retain the privilege of simplicity. For both Eve and Adam, when it befell them to be \"wise,\"[fn-119-P11971_3341223:141-nf] forthwith veiled what they had learnt to know?[fn-119-P11972_3341290:142-nf] At all events, with regard to those in whom girlhood has changed (into maturity), their age ought to remember its duties as to nature, so also, to discipline; for they are being transferred to the rank of \"women\" both in their persons and in their functions. No one is a \"virgin\" from the time when she is capable of marriage; seeing that, in her, age has by that time been wedded to its own husband, that is, to time.[fn-119-P11973_3341773:143-nf] \"But some particular virgin has devoted herself to God.

If your self-devotion is a grace of God, and you have received it, \"why do you boast,\" saith he, \"as if you have not received it? \"[fn-119-P11979_3342939:149-nf] Why, by your ostentation of yourself, do you judge others? Is it that, by your boasting, you invite others unto good? Nay, but even you yourself run the risk of losing, if you boast; and you drive others unto the same perils What is assumed from love of boasting is easily destroyed.

For even those fallen angels, lovers of the maidens of the world, who were corrupted by the corruption of their flesh, though, from having stripped themselves of divine excellence, they have ceased to be angels, yet retain the name of angels, and always esteem themselves as angels, though, being released from the service of God, they have passed from the likeness of their character into the army of the devil, as the great God declares, `My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh.'[fn-48-P4849_2384403:54-nf] To those guilty ones and to you the Lord Christ will say, `Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.'[fn-48-P4850_2384569:55-nf] If there were no evil angels, the devil would have no angels; of whom the apostle says, that in the judgment of the resurrection they shall be condemned by the saints: `Know ye not,' says he, `that we shall judge angels?'[fn-48-P4851_2384811:56-nf] If they were true angels, men would not have authority to judge the angels of God.

And let any one who is able, observe this (as it is carried out) in the Psalms with more, indeed, than human accuracy, so as to find out the reasons in each case, as we shall set them forth. Thus, for instance, it is not without a purpose that the eighth psalm has the inscription, \"On the wine-presses,\" as it comprehends the perfection of fruits in the eight; for the time for the enjoyment of the fruits of the true vine could not be before the eight. And again, the second psalm inscribed\" On the wine-presses,\" is the eightieth, containing another eighth number, viz., in the tenth multiple. The eighty-third, again, is made up by the union of two holy numbers, viz., the eight in the tenth multiple, and the three in the first multiple. And the fiftieth psalm is a prayer for the remission of sins, and a confession. For as, according to the Gospel, the fiftieth obtained remission, confirming thereby that understanding of the jubilee, so he who offers up such petitions in full confession hopes to gain remission in no other number than the fiftieth. And again, there are also certain others which are called \"Songs of degrees,\" in number fifteen, as was also the number of the steps of the temple, and which show thereby, perhaps, that the \"steps\" (or \"degrees\") are comprehended within the number seven and the number eight.

For when he says, \"The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh;\" do not suppose that so much hath been attributed to the spirit of man. It is the Spirit of God who fighteth in thee against thyself, against that which in thee is against thee. For thou wouldest not stand to Godward; thou didst fall, wast broken; as a vessel when it falls from a man's hand to the ground, wast thou broken. And because thou wast broken, therefore art thou turned against thyself; therefore art thou contrary to thine own self. Let there be nought in thee contrary to thyself, and thou shalt stand in thine integrity. For that thou mayest know that this office appertaineth to the Holy Spirit; the Apostle saith in another place,\" For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.\"[fn-61-P6158_2612665:23-nf] From these words man was at once uplifting himself, as though by his own spirit he were able to mortify the deeds of the flesh. \"If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if through the Spirit ye do mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.\" Explain to us, Apostle, through what spirit? For man also hath a spirit appertaining to his proper nature, whereby he is man. For man consists of body and spirit. And of this spirit of man it is said, \"No man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him.\"[fn-61-P6159_2613215:24-nf] I see then that man himself hath his own spirit appertaining to his proper nature, and I hear thee saying, \"But if through the Spirit ye do mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.\" I ask, through what spirit; my own, or God's? For I hear thy words, and am still perplexed by this ambiguity. For when the word \"spirit\" is used, it is used sometimes of the spirit of a man, and of cattle, as it is written, that \"all flesh which had in itself the spirit of life, died by the flood.\"[fn-61-P6160_2613724:25-nf] And so the word spirit is spoken of cattle, and spoken of man too. Sometimes even the wind is called spirit; as it is in the Psalm, \"Fire, hail, snow, frost, the spirit of the tempest.\"[fn-61-P6161_2613940:26-nf] For as much then as the word \"spirit\" is used in many ways, by what spirit, O Apostle, hast thou said that the deeds of the flesh are to be mortified; by mine own, or by the Spirit of God? Hear what follows, and understand. The difficulty is removed by the following words. For when he had said, \"But if through the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live;\"[fn-61-P6162_2614371:27-nf] he added immediately, \"For as many as are acted[fn-61-P6163_2614439:28-nf] upon by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.\" Thou dost act, if thou art acted upon, and actest well, if thou art acted upon by the Good. So then when he said to thee,\" If through the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live;\" and it was doubtful with thee of what spirit he had spoken, in the words following understand the Master, acknowledge the Redeemer. For That Redeemer hath given thee the Spirit Whereby thou mayest mortify the deeds of the flesh. \"For as many as are acted upon by the Spirit of Cool, they are the sons of God.\"They are not the sons of God if they are not acted upon by the Spirit of God. But if they are acted upon by the Spirit of God, they fight; because they have a mighty Helper.

If, indeed, the reason of their abstinence were other than it is, it ought not to be too curiously investigated. But if they do so for this reason, that the divine virtue is more or less absent or present to them, this their meaning is ridiculous. For if plants be more material, how is it in accordance with reason to use that which is inferior for food and sustenance? or, if there be more of the divine virtue in them, how are things of this sort useful as food, when the soul's faculty of nourishing and making increase is more corporeal? Now in that they abstain from marriage and the rites of Venus, fearing lest by the succession of the race the divine virtue should dwell more in matter. I wonder how in thinking so they allow of themselves? For if neither the providence of God suffices, both by generations and by those things which are always and in the same manner existent, to separate off the divine virtue from matter, what can the cunning and subtlety of Manichaeus effect for that purpose? For assuredly by no giant's co-operation does assistance come to God, in order by the removal of generations to make the retreat of the divine virtue from matter quick and speedy.

But the poets who say that they, when they had emerged in full armour from the earth, perished immediately after they stirred up rebellion against the gods, in order that they might insinuate the frail and quickly-perishing constitution of the body, adorn their poetry in this way for the sake of refreshing the soul by the strangeness of the occurrence.
