{"verses":["In the mean time the famine was heavy upon all the land.","And when they had eaten up all the corn, which they had brought\nout of Egypt, Jacob said to his sons:  Go again, and buy us a little\nfood.","Juda answered:  The man declared unto us with the attestation of\nan oath, saying:  You shall not see my face, unless you bring your\nyoungest brother with you.","If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we will set out\ntogether, and will buy necessaries for thee.","But if thou wilt not, we will not go:  for the man, as we have\noften said, declared unto us, saying:  You shall not see my face without\nyour youngest brother.","Israel said to them:  You have done this for my misery, in that\nyou told him you had also another brother.","But they answered:  The man asked us in order concerning our\nkindred:  if our father lived:  if we had a brother:  and we answered him\nregularly, according to what he demanded:  could we know that he would\nsay:  Bring hither your brother with you?","And Juda said to his father:  Send the boy with me, that we may\nset forward, and may live:  lest both we and our children perish.","I take the boy upon me, require him at my hand:  unless I bring\nhim again, and restore him to thee, I will be guilty of sin against\nthee for ever.","If delay had not been made, we had been here again the second\ntime.","Then Israel said to them:  If it must needs be so, do what you\nwill:  take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry\ndown presents to the man, a little balm, and honey, and storax, myrrh,\nturpentine, and almonds.","And take with you double money, and carry back what you found in\nyour sacks, lest perhaps it was done by mistake.","And take also your brother, and go to the man.","And may my almighty God make him favourable to you:  and send\nback with you your brother, whom he keepeth, and this Benjamin:  and as\nfor me I shall be desolate without children.","So the men took the presents, and double money, and Benjamin:\nand went down into Egypt, and stood before Joseph.","And when he had seen them, and Benjamin with them, he commanded\nthe steward of his house, saying:  Bring in the men into the house, and\nkill victims, and prepare a feast:  because they shall eat with me at\nnoon.","He did as he was commanded, and brought the men into the house.","And they being much afraid, said there one to another:  Because\nof the money, which we carried back the first time in our sacks, we are\nbrought in:  that he may bring upon us a false accusation, and by\nviolence make slaves of us and our asses.","Wherefore, going up to the steward of the house, at the door,","They said:  Sir, we desire thee to hear us.  We came down once\nbefore to buy food:","And when we had bought, and were come to the inn, we opened our\nsacks, and found our money in the mouths of the sacks:  which we have\nnow brought again in the same weight.","And we have brought other money besides, to buy what we want:  we\ncannot tell who put it in our bags.","But he answered:  Peace be with you, fear not:  your God, and the\nGod of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks.  For the\nmoney, which you gave me, I have for good.  And he brought Simeon out to\nthem.","And having brought them into the house, he fetched water, and\nthey washed their feet, and he gave provender to their asses.","But they made ready the presents, against Joseph came at noon:\nfor they had heard that they should eat bread there.","Then Joseph came in to his house, and they offered him the\npresents, holding them in their hands; and they bowed down with their\nface to the ground.","But he courteously saluting them again, asked them, saying:  Is\nthe old man your father in health, of whom you told me?  Is he yet\nliving?","And they answered:  Thy servant our father, is in health; he is\nyet living.  And bowing themselves, they made obeisance to him.","And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin, his brother by the\nsame mother, and said:  Is this your young brother, of whom you told me?\nAnd he said:  God be gracious to thee, my son.","And he made haste, because his heart was moved upon his brother,\nand tears gushed out:  and going into his chamber, he wept.","And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he refrained\nhimself, and said:  Set bread on the table.","And when it was set on, for Joseph apart, and for his brethren\napart, for the Egyptians also that ate with him apart, (for it is\nunlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the Hebrews, and they think such\na feast profane):","They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright,\nand the youngest according to his age.  And they wondered very much;","Taking the messes which they received of him:  and the greater\nmess came to Benjamin, so that it exceeded by five parts.  And they\ndrank, and were merry with him."]}
