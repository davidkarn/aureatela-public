{"verses":["And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was\nsitting in the gate of the city.  And seeing them, he rose up and went\nto meet them:  and worshipped prostrate to the ground.","And said:  I beseech you, my lords, turn in to the house of your\nservant, and lodge there:  wash your feet, and in the morning you shall\ngo on your way.  And they said:  No, but we will abide in the street.","He pressed them very much to turn in unto him:  and when they were\ncome into his house, he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread,\nand they ate:","But before they went to bed, the men of the city beset the house,\nboth young and old, all the people together.","And they called Lot, and said to him:  Where are the men that came\nin to thee at night?  bring them out hither, that we may know them:","Lot went out to them, and shut the door after him, and said:","Do not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do not commit this evil.","I have two daughters who, as yet, have not known man; I will\nbring them out to you, and abuse you them as it shall please you, so\nthat you do no evil to these men, because they are come in under the\nshadow of my roof.","But they said:  Get thee back thither.  And again:  Thou camest in,\nsaid they, as a stranger, was it to be a judge?  therefore we will\nafflict thee more than them.  And they pressed very violently upon Lot:\nand they were even at the point of breaking open the doors.","And behold the men put out their hand, and drew in Lot unto\nthem, and shut the door.","And them, that were without, they struck with blindness from the\nleast to the greatest, so that they could not find the door.","And they said to Lot:  Hast thou here any of thine?  son in law,\nor sons, or daughters, all that are thine bring them out of this city:","For we will destroy this place, because their cry is grown loud\nbefore the Lord, who hath sent us to destroy them.","So Lot went out, and spoke to his sons in law that were to have\nhis daughters, and said:  Arise:  get you out of this place, because the\nLord will destroy this city.  And he seemed to them to speak as it were\nin jest.","And when it was morning, the angels pressed him, saying:  Arise,\ntake thy wife, and the two daughters that thou hast:  lest thou also\nperish in the wickedness of the city.","And as he lingered, they took his hand, and the hand of his\nwife, and of his two daughters, because the Lord spared him.","And they brought him forth, and set him without the city:  and\nthere they spoke to him, saying:  Save thy life:  look not back, neither\nstay thou in all the country about:  but save thy self in the mountain,\nlest thou be also consumed.","And Lot said to them:  I beseech thee, my Lord,","Because thy servant hath found grace before thee, and thou hast\nmagnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewn to me, in saving my life,\nand I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil seize me, and I\ndie.","There is this city here at hand, to which I may flee, it is a\nlittle one, and I shall be saved in it:  is it not a little one, and my\nsoul shall live?","And he said to him:  Behold also in this, I have heard thy\nprayers, not to destroy the city for which thou hast spoken.","Make haste, and be saved there:  because I cannot do any thing\ntill thou go in thither.  Therefore the name of that city was called\nSegor.","The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot entered into Segor.","And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire\nfrom the Lord out of heaven.","And he destroyed these cities, and all the country about, all\nthe inhabitants of the cities, and all things that spring from the\nearth.","And his wife looking behind her, was turned into a statue of\nsalt.","And Abraham got up early in the morning, and in the place where\nhe had stood before with the Lord:","He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and the whole land of that\ncountry:  and he saw the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of a\nfurnace.","Now when God destroyed the cities of that country, remembering\nAbraham, he delivered Lot out of the destruction of the cities wherein\nhe had dwelt.","And Lot went up out of Segor, and abode in the mountain, and his\ntwo daughters with him (for he was afraid to stay in Segor) and he\ndwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.","And the elder said to the younger:  Our father is old, and there\nis no man left on the earth, to come in unto us after the manner of the\nwhole earth.","Come, let us make him drunk with wine, and let us lie with him,\nthat we may preserve seed of our father.","And they made their father drink wine that night:  and the elder\nwent in, and lay with her father:  but he perceived not, neither when\nhis daughter lay down, nor when she rose up.","And the next day the elder said to the younger:  Behold I lay\nlast night with my father, let us make him drink wine also to night,\nand thou shalt lie with him, that we may save seed of our father.","They made their father drink wine that night also, and the\nyounger daughter went in, and lay with him:  and neither then did he\nperceive when she lay down, nor when she rose up.","So the two daughters of Lot were with child by their father.","And the elder bore a son, and she called his name Moab:  he is\nthe father of the Moabites unto this day.","The younger also bore a son, and she called his name Ammon; that\nis, the son of my people:  he is the father of the Ammonites unto this\nday."]}
