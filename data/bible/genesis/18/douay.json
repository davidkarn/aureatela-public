{"verses":["And the Lord appeared to him in the vale of Mambre as he was\nsitting at the door of his tent, in the very heat of the day.","And when he had lifted up his eyes, there appeared to him three\nmen standing near to him:  and as soon as he saw them, he ran to meet\nthem from the door of his tent, and adored down to the ground.","And he said:  Lord, if I have found favour in thy sight, pass not\naway from thy servant.","But I will fetch a little water, and wash ye your feet, and rest\nye under the tree.","And I will set a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart,\nafterwards you shall pass on:  for therefore are you come aside to your\nservant.  And they said:  Do as thou hast spoken.","Abraham made haste into the tent to Sara, and said to her:  Make\nhaste, temper together three measures of flour, and make cakes upon the\nhearth.","And he himself ran to the herd, and took from thence a calf, very\ntender and very good, and gave it to a young man, who made haste and\nboiled it.","He took also butter and milk, and the calf which he had boiled,\nand set before them:  but he stood by them under the tree.","And when they had eaten, they said to him:  Where is Sara thy\nwife?  He answered:  Lo she is in the tent.","And he said to him:  I will return and come to thee at this time,\nlife accompanying, and Sara, thy wife, shall have a son.  Which when\nSara heard, she laughed behind the door of the tent.","Now they were both old, and far advanced in years, and it had\nceased to be with Sara after the manner of women.","And she laughed secretly, saying:  After I am grown old, and my\nlord is an old man, shall I give myself to pleasure?","And the Lord said to Abraham:  Why did Sara laugh, saying:  Shall\nI, who am an old woman, bear a child indeed?","Is there any thing hard to God?  According to appointment I will\nreturn to thee at this same time, life accompanying, and Sara shall\nhave a son.","Sara denied, saying:  I did not laugh:  for she was afraid.  But\nthe Lord said:  Nay; but thou didst laugh.","And when the men rose up from thence, they turned their eyes\ntowards Sodom:  and Abraham walked with them, bringing them on the way.","And the Lord said:  Can I hide from Abraham what I am about to\ndo:","Seeing he shall become a great and mighty nation, and in him all\nthe nations of the earth shall be blessed?","For I know that he will command his children, and his household\nafter him, to keep the way of the Lord, and do judgment and justice:\nthat for Abraham's sake, the Lord may bring to effect all the things he\nhath spoken unto him.","And the Lord said:  The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is multiplied,\nand their sin is become exceedingly grievous.","I will go down and see whether they have done according to the\ncry that is come to me; or whether it be not so, that I may know.","And they turned themselves from thence, and went their way to\nSodom:  but Abraham as yet stood before the Lord.","And drawing nigh, he said:  Wilt thou destroy the just with the\nwicked?","If there be fifty just men in the city, shall they perish\nwithal?  and wilt thou not spare that place for the sake of the fifty\njust, if they be therein?","Far be it from thee to do this thing, and to slay the just with\nthe wicked, and for the just to be in like case as the wicked; this is\nnot beseeming thee:  thou who judgest all the earth, wilt not make this\njudgment.","And the Lord said to him:  If I find in Sodom fifty just within\nthe city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.","And Abraham answered, and said:  Seeing I have once begun, I will\nspeak to my Lord, whereas I am dust and ashes.","What if there be five less than fifty just persons?  wilt thou\nfor five and forty destroy the whole city:  And he said:  I will not\ndestroy it, if I find five and forty.","And again he said to him:  But if forty be found there, what wilt\nthou do?  He said:  I will not destroy it for the sake of forty.","Lord, saith he, be not angry, I beseech thee, if I speak:  What\nif thirty shall be found there?  He answered:  I will not do it, if I\nfind thirty there.","Seeing, saith he, I have once begun, I will speak to my Lord:\nWhat if twenty be found there?  He said:  I will not destroy it for the\nsake of twenty.","I beseech thee, saith he, be not angry, Lord, if I speak yet\nonce more:  What if ten shall be found there?  And he said:  I will not\ndestroy it for the sake of ten.","And the Lord departed, after he had left speaking to Abraham:\nand Abraham returned to his place."]}
