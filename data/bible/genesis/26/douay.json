{"verses":["And when a famine came in the land, after that barrenness which\nhad happened in the days of Abraham, Isaac went to Abimelech, king of\nthe Palestines, to Gerara.","And the Lord appeared to him, and said:  Go not down into Egypt,\nbut stay in the land that I shall tell thee.","And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee:\nfor to thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries, to fulfil\nthe oath which I swore to Abraham thy father.","And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of heaven:  and I will\ngive to thy posterity all these countries:  and in thy seed shall all\nthe nations of the earth be blessed.","Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts and\ncommandments, and observed my ceremonies and laws.","So Isaac abode in Gerara.","And when he was asked by the men of that place, concerning his\nwife, he answered:  She is my sister:  for he was afraid to confess that\nshe was his wife, thinking lest perhaps they would kill him because of\nher beauty.","And when very many days were passed, and he abode there,\nAbimelech, king of the Palestines, looking out through a window, saw\nhim playing with Rebecca, his wife.","And calling for him, he said:  It is evident she is thy wife:  why\ndidst thou feign her to be thy sister?  He answered:  I feared lest I\nshould die for her sake.","And Abimelech said:  Why hast thou deceived us?  Some man of the\npeople might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst brought upon us a\ngreat sin.  And he commanded all the people, saying:","He that shall touch this man's wife, shall surely be put to\ndeath.","And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same year a\nhundredfold:  and the Lord blessed him.","And the man was enriched, and he went on prospering and\nincreasing, till he became exceeding great.","And he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a very great\nfamily.  Wherefore the Palestines envying him,","Stopped up at that time all the wells, that the servants of his\nfather, Abraham, had digged, filling them up with earth:","Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac:  Depart from us,\nfor thou art become much mightier than we.","So he departed, and came to the torrent of Gerara, to dwell\nthere:","And he digged again other wells, which the servants of his\nfather, Abraham, had digged, and which, after his death, the\nPhilistines had of old stopped up:  and he called them by the same\nnames, by which his father before had called them.","And they digged in the torrent, and found living water:","But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against the\nherdsmen of Isaac, saying:  It is our water.  Wherefore he called the\nname of the well, on occasion of that which had happened, Calumny.","And they digged also another; and for that they quarrelled\nlikewise, and he called the name of it, Enmity.","Going forward from thence, he digged another well, for which\nthey contended not; therefore he called the name thereof, Latitude,\nsaying:  Now hath the Lord given us room, and made us to increase upon\nthe earth.","And he went up from that place to Bersabee,","Where the Lord appeared to him that same night, saying:  I am the\nGod of Abraham thy father, do not fear, for I am with thee:  I will\nbless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.","And he built there an altar:  and called upon the name of the\nLord, and pitched his tent; and commanded his servants to dig a well.","To which place when Abimelech, and Ochozath his friend, and\nPhicol chief captain of his soldiers, came from Gerara,","Isaac said to them:  Why are ye come to me, a man whom you hate,\nand have thrust out from you?","And they answered:  We saw that the Lord is with thee, and\ntherefore we said:  Let there be an oath between us, and let us make a\ncovenant,","That thou do us no harm, as we on our part have touched nothing\nof thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee; but with peace have\nsent thee away, increased with the blessing of the Lord.","And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten and drunk:","Arising in the morning, they swore one to another:  and Isaac\nsent them away peaceably to their own home.","And behold, the same day the servants of Isaac came, telling him\nof a well which they had digged, and saying:  We have found water.","Whereupon he called it Abundance:  and the name of the city was\ncalled Bersabee, even to this day.","And Esau being forty years old, married wives, Judith, the\ndaughter of Beeri, the Hethite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon, of\nthe same place.","And they both offended the mind of Isaac and Rebecca."]}
