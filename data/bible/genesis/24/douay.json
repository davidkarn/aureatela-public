{"verses":["Now Abraham was old, and advanced in age; and the Lord had\nblessed him in all things.","And he said to the elder servant of his house, who was ruler over\nall he had:  Put thy hand under my thigh,","That I may make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and\nearth, that thou take not a wife for my son, of the daughters of the\nChanaanites, among whom I dwell:","But that thou go to my own country and kindred, and take a wife\nfrom thence for my son Isaac.","The servant answered:  If the woman will not come with me into\nthis land, must I bring thy son back again to the place from whence\nthou camest out?","And Abraham said:  Beware thou never bring my son back again\nthither.","The Lord God of heaven, who took me out of my father's house, and\nout of my native country, who spoke to me, and swore to me, saying:  To\nthy seed will I give this land:  he will send his angel before thee, and\nthou shalt take from thence a wife for my son.","But if the woman will not follow thee, thou shalt not be bound by\nthe oath:  only bring not my son back thither again.","The servant, therefore, put his hand under the thigh of Abraham,\nhis lord, and swore to him upon his word.","And he took ten camels of his master's herd, and departed,\ncarrying something of all his goods with him, and he set forward and\nwent on to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nachor.","And when he had made the camels lie down without the town, near\na well of water, in the evening, at the time when women are wont to\ncome out to draw water, he said:","O Lord, the God of my master, Abraham, meet me today, I beseech\nthee, and shew kindness to my master, Abraham.","Behold, I stand nigh the spring of water, and the daughters of\nthe inhabitants of this city will come out to draw water:","Now, therefore, the maid to whom I shall say:  Let down thy\npitcher that I may drink:  and she shall answer, Drink, and I will give\nthy camels drink also:  let it be the same whom thou hast provided for\nthy servant Isaac:  and by this, I shall understand that thou hast shewn\nkindness to my master.","He had not yet ended these words within himself, and behold\nRebecca came out, the daughter of Bathuel, son of Melcha, wife to\nNachor the brother of Abraham, having a pitcher on her shoulder:","An exceeding comely maid, and a most beautiful virgin, and not\nknown to man:  and she went down to the spring, and filled her pitcher,\nand was coming back.","And the servant ran to meet her, and said:  Give me a little\nwater to drink of thy pitcher.","And she answered:  Drink, my lord.  And quickly she let down the\npitcher upon her arm, and gave him drink.","And when he had drunk, she said:  I will draw water for thy\ncamels also, till they all drink.","And pouring out the pitcher into the troughs, she ran back to\nthe well to draw water; and having drawn, she gave to all the camels.","But he musing, beheld her with silence, desirous to know whether\nthe Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.","And after that the camels had drunk, the man took out golden\nearrings, weighing two sicles; and as many bracelets, of ten sicles\nweight.","And he said to her:  Whose daughter art thou?  tell me:  is there\nany place in thy father's house to lodge?","And she answered:  I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of\nMelcha, whom she bore to Nachor.","And she said, moreover, to him:  We have good store of both straw\nand hay, and a large place to lodge in.","The man bowed himself down, and adored the Lord,","Saying:  Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath\nnot taken away his mercy and truth from my master, and hath brought me\nthe straight way into the house of my master's brother.","Then the maid ran, and told in her mother's house all that she\nhad heard.","And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban, who went out in haste to\nthe man, to the well.","And when he had seen the earrings and bracelets in his sister's\nhands, and had heard all that she related, saying, Thus and thus the\nman spoke to me:  he came to the man who stood by the camels, and near\nto the spring of water,","And said to him:  Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; why standest\nthou without?  I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.","And he brought him into his lodging; and he unharnessed the\ncamels, and gave straw and hay, and water to wash his feet, and the\nfeet of the men that were come with him.","And bread was set before him.  But he said:  I will not eat, till\nI tell my message.  He answered him:  Speak.","And he said:  I am the servant of Abraham:","And the Lord hath blessed my master wonderfully, and he is\nbecome great:  and he hath given him sheep and oxen, silver and gold,\nmen servants and women servants, camels and asses.","And Sara, my master's wife, hath borne my master a son in her\nold age, and he hath given him all that he had.","And my master made me swear, saying:  Thou shalt not take a wife\nfor my son of the Chanaanites, in whose land I dwell:","But thou shalt go to my father's house, and shalt take a wife of\nmy own kindred for my son:","But I answered my master:  What if the woman will not come with\nme?","The Lord, said he, in whose sight I walk, will send his angel\nwith thee, and will direct thy way:  and thou shalt take a wife for my\nson of my own kindred, and of my father's house.","But thou shalt be clear from my curse, when thou shalt come to\nmy kindred, if they will not give thee one.","And I came today to the well of water, and said:  O Lord God of\nmy master, Abraham, if thou hast prospered my way, wherein I now walk,","Behold, I stand by the well of water, and the virgin, that shall\ncome out to draw water, who shall hear me say:  Give me a little water\nto drink of thy pitcher:","And shall say to me:  Both drink thou, and I will also draw for\nthy camels:  let the same be the woman, whom the Lord hath prepared for\nmy master's son.","And whilst I pondered these things secretly with myself, Rebecca\nappeared, coming with a pitcher, which she carried on her shoulder:  and\nshe went down to the well and drew water.  And I said to her:  Give me a\nlittle to drink.","And she speedily let down the pitcher from her shoulder, and\nsaid to me:  Both drink thou, and to thy camels I will give drink.  I\ndrank, and she watered the camels.","And I asked her, and said:  Whose daughter art thou?  And she\nanswered:  I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Nachor, whom Melcha\nbore to him.  So I put earrings on her to adorn her face, and I put\nbracelets on her hands.","And falling down, I adored the Lord, blessing the Lord God of my\nmaster, Abraham, who hath brought me the straight way to take the\ndaughter of my master's brother for his son.","Wherefore, if you do according to mercy and truth with my\nmaster, tell me:  but if it please you otherwise, tell me that also,\nthat I may go to the right hand, or to the left.","And Laban and Bathuel answered:  The word hath proceeded from the\nLord:  we cannot speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.","Behold, Rebecca is before thee, take her and go thy way, and let\nher be the wife of thy master's son, as the Lord hath spoken.","Which when Abraham's servant heard, falling down to the ground,\nhe adored the Lord.","And bringing forth vessels of silver and gold, and garments, he\ngave them to Rebecca, for a present.  He offered gifts also to her\nbrothers, and to her mother.","And a banquet was made, and they ate and drank together, and\nlodged there.  And in the morning, the servant arose, and said:  Let me\ndepart, that I may go to my master.","And her brother and mother answered:  Let the maid stay, at\nleast, ten days with us, and afterwards she shall depart.","Stay me not, said he, because the Lord hath prospered my way:\nsend me away, that I may go to my master.","And they said:  Let us call the maid, and ask her will.","And they called her, and when she was come, they asked:  Wilt\nthou go with this man?  She said:  I will go.","So they sent her away, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and\nhis company.","Wishing prosperity to their sister, and saying:  Thou art our\nsister, mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands; and may thy seed\npossess the gates of their enemies.","So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon camels, followed the\nman:  who with speed returned to his master.","At the same time, Isaac was walking along the way to the well\nwhich is called Of the living and the seeing:  for he dwelt in the south\ncountry:","And he was gone forth to meditate in the field, the day being\nnow well spent:  and when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels\ncoming afar off.","Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted off the camel,","And said to the servant:  Who is that man who cometh towards us\nalong the field?  And he said to her:  That man is my master.  But she\nquickly took her cloak, and covered herself.","And the servant told Isaac all that he had done.","Who brought her into the tent of Sara his mother, and took her\nto wife:  and he loved her so much, that it moderated the sorrow which\nwas occasioned by his mother's death."]}
