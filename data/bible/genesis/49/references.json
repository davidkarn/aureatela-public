The advice of the rhetoricians in such cases is that you should first search out the remote ancestors of the person to be eulogized and recount their exploits, and then come gradually to your hero; so as to make him more illustrious by the virtues of his forefathers, and to show either that he is a worthy successor of good men, or that he has conferred lustre upon a lineage in itself obscure. But as my duty is to sing the praises of the soul, I will not dwell upon those fleshly advantages which Nepotian for his part always despised.

My reverend son Heraclius the deacon has reported to me that in your eagerness to see me you came as far as Cissa, and that, though a Pannonian and consequently a land animal, you did not quail before the surges of the Adriatic and the dangers of the Aegean and Ionian seas. He tells me that you would have actually accomplished your purpose, had not our brethren with affectionate care held you back. I thank you all the same and regard it as a kindness shewn. For in the case of friends one must accept the will for the deed. Enemies often give us the latter, but only sincere attachment can bring us the former. And now that I am writing to you I beseech you do not regard the bodily affliction which has befallen you as due to sin. When the Apostles speculated concerning the man that was born blind from the womb and asked our Lord and Saviour: \"Who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\" they were told \"Neither hath this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.\"[fn-28-P2812_738229:1996-nf] Do we not see numbers of heathens, Jews, heretics and men of various opinions rolling in the mire of lust, bathed in blood, surpassing wolves in ferocity and kites in rapacity, and for all this the plague does not come nigh their dwellings?[fn-28-P2813_738503:1997-nf] They are not smitten as other men, and accordingly they wax insolent against God and lift up their faces even to heaven.

Let me now fulfil the promise I made a little while ago and with all the skill of a rhetorician sing the praises of water and of baptism. In the beginning the earth was without form and void, there was no dazzling sun or pale moon, there were no glittering stars. There was nothing but matter inorganic and invisible, and even this was lost in abysmal depths and shrouded in a distorting gloom. The Spirit of God above moved, as a charioteer, over the face of the waters,[fn-28-P2879_762983:2051-nf] and produced from them the infant world, a type of the Christian child that is drawn from the laver of baptism. A firmament is constructed between heaven and earth, and to this is allotted the name heaven,-in the Hebrew Shamayim or `what comes out of the waters,'-[fn-28-P2880_763268:2052-nf] and the waters which are above the heavens are parted from the others to the praise of God. Wherefore also in the vision of the prophet Ezekiel there is seen above the cherubim a crystal stretched forth,[fn-28-P2881_763585:2053-nf] that is, the compressed and denser waters. The first living beings come out of the waters; and believers soar out of the layer with wings to heaven. Man is formed out of clay[fn-28-P2882_763782:2054-nf] and God holds the mystic waters in the hollow of his hand.[fn-28-P2883_763862:2055-nf] In Eden a garden[fn-28-P2884_763944:2056-nf] is planted, and a fountain in the midst of it parts into four heads.[fn-28-P2885_764033:2057-nf] This is the same fountain which Ezekiel later on describes as issuing out of the temple and flowing towards the rising of the sun, until it heals the bitter waters and quickens those that are dead.[fn-28-P2886_764265:2058-nf] When the world falls into sin nothing but a flood of waters can cleanse it again. But as soon as the foul bird of wickedness is driven away, the dove of the Holy Spirit comes to Noah[fn-28-P2887_764489:2059-nf] as it came afterwards to Christ in the Jordan,[fn-28-P2888_764574:2060-nf] and, carrying ill its beak a branch betokening restoration and light, brings tidings of peace to the whole world. Pharaoh and his host, loth to allow God's people to leave Egypt, are overwhelmed in the Red Sea figuring thereby our baptism. His destruction is thus described in the book of Psalms: \"Thou didst endow the sea with virtue through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters: thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces.\"[fn-28-P2889_765053:2061-nf] For this reason adders and scorpions haunt dry places[fn-28-P2890_765139:2062-nf] and whenever they come near water behave as if rabid or insane.[fn-28-P2891_765228:2063-nf] As wood sweetens Marah so that seventy palm-trees are watered by its streams, so the cross makes the waters of the law lifegiving to the seventy who are Christ's apostles.[fn-28-P2892_765444:2064-nf] It is Abraham and Isaac who dig wells, the Philistines who try to prevent them.[fn-28-P2893_765561:2065-nf] Beersheba too, the city of the oath,[fn-28-P2894_765637:2066-nf] and [Gihon], the scene of Solomon's coronation,[fn-28-P2895_765708:2067-nf] derive their names from springs.

When the daughters of the priests of Midian are in a strait to reach the well, Moses opens a way for them and delivers them from outrage.[fn-28-P2899_766157:2071-nf] The Lord's forerunner at Salem (a name which means peace or perfection) makes ready the people for Christ with spring-water.[fn-29-P2900_766319:2072-nf] The Saviour Himself does not preach the kingdom of heaven until by His baptismal immersion He has cleansed the Jordan.[fn-29-P2901_766461:2073-nf] Water is the matter of His first miracle[fn-29-P2902_766542:2074-nf] and it is from a well that the Samaritan woman is bidden to slake her thirst.[fn-29-P2903_766699:2075-nf] To Nicodemus He secretly says:-\"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.\"[fn-29-P2904_766857:2076-nf] As His earthly course began with water, so it ended with it. His side is pierced by the spear, and blood and water flow forth, twin emblems of baptism and of martyrdom.[fn-29-P2905_767048:2077-nf] After His resurrection also, when sending His apostles to the Gentiles, He commands them to baptize these in the mystery of the Trinity.[fn-29-P2906_767263:2078-nf] The Jewish people repenting of their misdoing are sent forthwith by Peter to be baptized.[fn-29-P2907_767380:2079-nf] Before Sion travails she brings forth children, and a nation is born at once.[fn-29-P2908_767480:2080-nf] Paul the persecutor of the church, that ravening wolf out of Benjamin,[fn-29-P2909_767588:2081-nf] bows his head before Ananias one of Christ's sheep, and only recovers his sight when he applies the remedy of baptism.[fn-29-P2910_767731:2082-nf] By the reading of the prophet the eunuch of Candace the queen of Ethiopia is made ready for the baptism of Christ.[fn-29-P2911_767901:2083-nf] Though it is against nature the Ethiopian does change his skin and the leopard his spots.[fn-29-P2912_768018:2084-nf] Those who have received only John's baptism and have no knowledge of the Holy Spirit are baptized again, lest any should suppose that water unsanctified thereby could suffice for the salvation of either Jew or Gentile.[fn-29-P2913_768261:2085-nf] \"The voice of the Lord isupon the waters ...The Lord is uponmany waters ...the Lord maketh the flood to inhabit it.\"[fn-29-P2914_768398:2086-nf] His \"teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which came up from the washing; whereof everyone bear twins, and none is barren among them.\"[fn-29-P2915_768625:2087-nf] If none is barren among them, all of them must have udders filled with milk and be able to say with the apostle: \"Ye are my little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you;\"[fn-29-P2916_768853:2088-nf] and \"I have fed you with milk and not with meat.\"[fn-29-P2917_768925:2089-nf] And it is to the grace of baptism that the prophecy of Micah refers: \"He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us: he will subdue our iniquities, and will cast all our sins[fn-29-P2918_769130:2090-nf] into the depths of the sea.\"[fn-29-P2919_769207:2091-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":49,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1100","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"10.

Next he brings forward Samson, and does not consider that the Lord's Nazarite was once shaven bald by a woman. And although Samson continues to be a type of the Saviour because he loved a harlot from among the Gentiles, which harlot corresponds to the Church, and because he slew more enemies in his death than he did in his life, yet he does not set an example of conjugal chastity. And he surely reminds us[fn-62-P6294_1925823:138-nf] of Jacob's prophecy-he was shaken by his runaway steed, bitten by an adder and fell backwards. But why he enumerated Deborah, and Barak, and the wife of Heber the Kenite, I am at a loss to understand. For it is one thing to draw up a list of military commanders in historical sequence, another to indicate certain figures of marriage which cannot be found in them. And whereas he prefers the fidelity of the father Jephthah to the tears of the virgin daughter, that makes for us. For we are not commending virgins of the world so much as those who are virgins for Christ's sake, and most Hebrews blame the father for the rash vow he made,[fn-62-P6295_1926516:139-nf] \"If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into mine hand, then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be for the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.\" Supposing (they say) a dog or an ass had met him, what would he have done? Their meaning is that God so ordered events that he who had improvidently made a vow, should learn his error by the death of his daughter. And if Samuel who was brought up in the tabernacle married a wife, how does that prejudice virginity? As if at the present day also there were not many married priests, and as though the Apostle did not[fn-62-P6296_1927244:140-nf] describe a bishop as the husband of one wife, having children with all purity. At the same time we must not forget that Samuel was a Levite, not a priest or high-priest. Hence it was that his mother made for him a linen ephod, that is, a linen garment to go over the shoulders, which was the proper dress of the Levites and of the inferior order. And so he is not named in the Psalms among the priests, but among those who call upon the name of the Lord:[fn-62-P6297_1927721:141-nf] \"Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call upon his name.\" For[fn-62-P6298_1927829:142-nf] Levi begat Kohath, Kohath begat Amminadab, Amminadab begat Korah, Korah begat Assir, Assir begat Elkanah, Elkanah begat Zuph, Zuph begat Tahath, Tahath begat Eliel, Eliel begat Jeroham, Jeroham begat Elkanah, Elkanah begat Samuel. And no one doubts that the priests sprang from the stock of Aaron, Eleazar, and Phinees. And seeing that they had wives, they would be rightly brought against us, if, led away by the error of the Encratites, we were to maintain that marriage deserved censure, and our high priest were not after the order of Melchizedek, without father, without mother,[fn-62-P6299_1928444:143-nf] Agenealo/ghtoj, that is, unmarried.

For which reason, I pray you, confirm toward him affection. For to this end withal have I written, that I may learn a proof of you, that in all (things) ye are obedient to me. But if ye shall have forgiven any, so (do) I; for I, too, if I have forgiven ought, have forgiven in the person of Christ, lest we be overreached by Satan, since we are not ignorant of his injections.\"[fn-14-P1455_416552:126-nf] What (reference) is understood here to the fornicator? what to the contaminator of his father's bed?[fn-14-P1456_416681:127-nf] what to the Christian who had overstepped the shamelessness of heathens?-since, of course, he would have absolved by a special pardon one whom he had condemned by a special anger. He is more obscure in his pity than in his indignation. He is more open in his austerity than in his lenity. And yet, (generally), anger is more readily indirect than indulgence. Things of a sadder are more wont to hesitate than things of a more joyous cast. Of course the question in hand concerned some moderate indulgence; which (moderation in the indulgence) was now, if ever, to be divined, when it is usual for all the greatest indulgences not to be granted without public proclamation, so far (are they from being granted) without particularization. Why, do you yourself, when introducing into the church, for the purpose of melting the brotherhood by his prayers, the repentant adulterer, lead into the midst and prostrate him, all in haircloth and ashes, a compound of disgrace and horror, before the widows, before the elders, suing for the tears of all, licking the footprints of all, clasping the knees of all? And do you, good shepherd and blessed father that you are, to bring about the (desired) end of the man, grace your harangue with all the allurements of mercy in your power, and under the parable of the \"ewe\" go in quest of your goats?[fn-14-P1457_418046:128-nf] do you, for fear lest your \"ewe\" again take a leap out from the flock-as if that were no more lawful for the future which was not even once lawful-fill all the rest likewise full of apprehension at the very moment of granting indulgence? And would the apostle so carelessly have granted indulgence to the atrocious licentiousness of fornication burdened with incest, as not at least to have exacted from the criminal even this legally established garb of repentance which you ought to have learned from him? as to have uttered no commination on the past? no allocution touching the future? Nay, more; he goes further, and beseeches that they \"would confirm toward him affection,\" as if he were making satisfaction to him, not as if he were granting an indulgence! And yet I hear (him speak of) \"affection,\" not \"communion; \"as (he writes) withal to the Thessalonians \"But if any obey not our word through the epistle, him mark; and associate not with him, that he may feel awed; not regarding (him) as an enemy, but rebuking as a brother.\"[fn-14-P1458_419119:129-nf] Accordingly, he could have said that to a fornicator, too, \"affection\" only was conceded, not \"communion \"as well; to an incestuous man, however, not even \"affection; \"whom he would, to be sure, have bidden to be banished from their midst[fn-14-P1459_419387:130-nf] -much more, of course, from their mind. \"But he was apprehensive lest they should be `overreached by Satan' with regard to the loss of that person whom himself had cast forth to Satan; or else lest, `by abundance of mourning, he should be devoured' whom he had sentenced to `destruction of the flesh.'\" Here they go so far as to interpret \"destruction of the flesh\" the office of repentance; in that by fasts, and squalor, and every species of neglect and studious ill-treatment devoted to the extermination of the flesh, it seems to make satisfaction to God; so that they argue that that fornicator-that incestuous person rather-having been delivered by the apostle to Satan, not with a view to \"perdition,\" but with a view to \"emendation,\" on the hypothesis that subsequently he would, on account of the \"destruction\" (that is, the general affliction) \"of the flesh,\" attain pardon, therefore did actually attain it. Plainly, the selfsame apostle delivered to Satan Hymenaeus and Alexander, \"that they might be emended into not blaspheming,\"[fn-14-P1460_420457:131-nf] as he writes to his Timotheus. \"But withal himself says that `a stake[fn-14-P1461_420548:132-nf] was given him, an angel of Satan, 'by which he was to be buffeted, lest he should exalt himself\" If they touch upon this (instance) withal, in order to lead us to understand that such as were \"delivered to Sam\" by him (were so delivered) with a view to emendation, not to perdition; what similarity is there between blasphemy and incest, and a soul entirely free from these,-nay, rather elated from no other source than the highest sanctity and all innocence; which (elation of soul) was being restrained in the apostle by \"buffets,\" if you will, by means (as they say) of pain in the ear or head? Incest, however, and blasphemy, deserved to have delivered the entire persons of men to Satan himself for a possession, not to \"an angel\" of his. And (there is yet another point): for about this it makes a difference, nay, rather withal in regard to this it is of the utmost consequence, that we find those men delivered by the apostle to Satan, but to the apostle himself an angel of Satan given. Lastly, when Paul is praying the Lord for its removal, what does he hear? \"Hold my grace sufficient; for virtue is perfected in infirmity.\"[fn-14-P1462_421709:133-nf] This they who are surrendered to Satan cannot hear. Moreover, if the crime of Hymenaeus and Alexander-blasphemy, to wit-is irremissible in this and in the future. age,[fn-14-P1463_421926:134-nf] of course the apostle would not, in opposition to the determinate decision of the Lord, have given to Satan, under a hope of pardon, men already sunken from the faith into blasphemy; whence, too, he pronounced them \"shipwrecked with regard to faith,\"[fn-14-P1464_422211:135-nf] having no longer the solace of the ship, the Church. For to those who, after believing, have struck upon (the rock of) blasphemy, pardon is denied; on the other hand, heathens and heretics are daily emerging out of blasphemy. But even if he did say, \"I delivered them to Satan, that they might receive the discipline of not blaspheming,\" he said it of the rest, who, by their deliverance to Satan-that is, their projection outside the Church-had to be trained in the knowledge that there must be no blaspheming. So, therefore, the incestuous fornicator, too, he delivered, not with a view to emendation, but with a view to perdition, to Satan, to whom he had already, by sinning above an heathen, gone over; that they might learn there must be no fornicating. Finally, he says, \"for the destruction of the flesh,\" not its \"torture\"-condemning the actual substance through which he had fallen out (of the faith), which substance had already perished immediately on the loss of baptism-\" in order that the spirit,\" he says, \"may be saved in the day of the Lord.\" And (here, again, is a difficulty): for let this point be inquired into, whether the man's own spirit will be saved. In that case, a spirit polluted with so great a wickedness will be saved; the object of the perdition of the flesh being, that the spirit may be saved in penalty. In that case, the interpretation which is contrary to ours will recognise a penalty without the flesh, if we lose the resurrection of the flesh. It remains, therefore, that his meaning was, that that spirit which is accounted to exist in the Church must be presented \"saved,\" that is, untainted by the contagion of impurities in the day of the Lord, by the ejection of the incestuous fornicator; if, that is, he subjoins: \"Know ye not, that a little leaven spoileth the savour of the whole lump? \"[fn-14-P1465_424072:136-nf] And yet incestuous fornication was not a little, but a large, leaven.","title":"VII.

This is the Way[fn-20-P2088_352857:78-nf] which leads to the Father, the Rock,[fn-20-P2089_352912:79-nf] the Defence,[fn-20-P2090_352943:80-nf] the Key, the Shepherd,[fn-20-P2091_352995:81-nf] the Sacrifice, the Door[fn-20-P2092_353036:82-nf] of knowledge, through which have entered Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, Moses and all the company of the prophets, and these pillars of the world, the apostles, and the spouse of Christ, on whose account He poured out His own blood, as her marriage portion, that He might redeem her. All these things tend towards the unity of the one and only true God. But the Gospel possesses something transcendent [above the former dispensation], viz. the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, His passion, and the resurrection itself. For those things which the prophets announced, saying, \"Until He come for whom it is reserved, and He shall be the expectation of the Gentiles,\"[fn-20-P2093_353722:83-nf] have been fulfilled in the Gospel, [our Lord saying, ] \"Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-20-P2094_353909:84-nf] All then are good together, the law, the prophets, the apostles, the whole company [of others] that have believed through them: only if we love one another.","title":"The Epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians","author":"Ignatius"},{"chapter":49,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_13_to_pammachius_against_john_of_jerusalem","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"34. Even the graves were opened[fn-71-P7129_2353208:95-nf] at our Lord's passion when the sun fled, the earth trembled, and many of the bodies of the saints arose, and were seen in the holy city.[fn-71-P7130_2353367:96-nf] \"Who is this,\" says Isaiah, \"that cometh up from Edom, with shining raiment from Bozrah, so beautiful in his glistening robe?\" Edom is by interpretation either earthy or bloody; Bosor either flesh, or in tribulation. In few words he shows the whole mystery of the resurrection, that is, both the reality of the flesh and the growth in glory. And the meaning is: Who is he that cometh up from the earth, cometh up from blood? According to the[fn-71-P7131_2353827:97-nf] prophecy of Jacob, He has bound His foal to the vine, and has trodden the wine-press alone, and His garments are red with new wine from Bosor, that is from flesh, or from the tribulation of the world: for He Himself[fn-71-P7132_2354063:98-nf] has conquered the world. And, therefore, His garments are red and shining, because He is[fn-71-P7133_2354171:99-nf] beauteous in form more than the sons of men, and on account of the glory of His triumph they have been changed into a white robe; and then, in truth, as concerns Christ's flesh, were fulfilled the words,[fn-71-P7134_2354395:100-nf] \"Who is this that cometh up all in white, leaning upon her beloved?\" And that which is written in the same book:[fn-71-P7135_2354530:101-nf] \"My beloved is white and ruddy.\" These men are his true followers who have not[fn-71-P7136_2354629:102-nf] defiled their garments with women, for they have continued virgins, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. And so they shall be in white clothing. Then shall the saying of our Lord appear perfectly realised:[fn-71-P7137_2354887:103-nf] \"All that my Father has given me, I shall not lose aught thereof, but I will raise it up again at the last day;\" the whole of His humanity, forsooth, which He had taken upon Him in its entirety at His birth. Then shall the sheep which was[fn-71-P7138_2355146:104-nf] lost, and was wandering in the lower world, be carried whole on the Saviour's shoulders, and the sheep which was sick with sin shall be supported by the mercy of the Judge. Then shall they see him who pierced Him, who shouted,[fn-71-P7139_2355395:105-nf] \"Crucify Him, crucify Him.\" Again and again shall they beat their breasts, they and their women, those women to whom our Lord said, as He carried His cross,[fn-71-P7140_2355572:106-nf] \"Ye daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves, and for your children.\" Then shall be fulfilled the prophecy of the angels, who said to the stupefied Apostles,[fn-71-P7141_2355776:107-nf] \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking with astonishment into heaven? This Jesus who is taken from you into heaven, shall come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\" But what are we to think of a man saying that our Lord[fn-71-P7142_2356031:108-nf] ate with the Apostles for forty days after His resurrection in order that they might not think Him to be a phantom, and then asserting that it was a phantom which did this very thing, which ate and which was seen by many in the flesh. That which was seen is either real, or false. If it is real, it follows that He really ate, and really had members. But if it is false, how could He be willing to give false impressions in order to prove the truth of His resurrection? For no one proves what is true by means of what is false. You will say, are we then going to eat after our resurrection? I know not. Scripture does not tell us; and yet, if the question be asked, I do not think we shall eat. For I have read that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, while it promises[fn-71-P7143_2356821:109-nf] such things as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man. Moses fasted forty days and forty nights. Human nature does not allow of this, but what is impossible with men is not impossible with God. Just as, in foretelling the future, it matters not whether a person announces what will take place after ten years or after a hundred, since the knowledge of futurity is all one; so he who can fast for forty days and yet live,-not, indeed, that he can of himself fast, but that he lives by the power of God,-will also be able to live for ever without food and drink. Why did our Lord eat an honeycomb? To prove the resurrection: not to give your palate the pleasure of tasting of honey. He asked for a fish broiled on the coals that He might[fn-71-P7144_2357612:110-nf] confirm the doubting Apostles, who did not dare approach Him because they thought they saw not a body, but a spirit.[fn-71-P7145_2357749:111-nf] The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue was raised to life and took food.[fn-71-P7146_2357841:112-nf] Lazarus, who had been four days dead, rose again, and comes before us at a dinner; not because he was accustomed to eat in the lower world, but because a case which presented such difficulties challenged the believer's criticism. As He showed them real hands and a real side, so He really ate with His disciples; really walked with Cleophas; conversed with men with a real tongue; really reclined at supper; with real hands took bread, blessed and brake it, and was offering it to them. And as for His suddenly vanishing out of their sight, that is the power of God, not of a shadowy phantom. Besides, even before His resurrection, when they had led Him out from Nazareth that they might cast Him down headlong from the brow of the hill, He passed through the midst of them, that is, escaped out of their hands. Can we follow Marcion, and say that because, when He was held fast, He escaped in a manner contrary to nature, therefore His birth must have been only apparent? Has not the Lord a privilege which is conceded to magicians? It is related of Apollonius of Tyana that, when standing in court before Domitian, he all at once disappeared. Do not put the power of the Lord on a level with the tricks of magicians, so that He may appear to have been what He was not, and may be thought to have eaten without teeth, walked without feet, broken bread without hands, spoken without a tongue, and showed a side which had no ribs.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":49,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_15_lecture_x_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"3.

After almost fifty years, during which they never had peace, although they prospered in some affairs, Aristobulus first assumed the diadem among them, and was made both king and pontiff. Before that, indeed, from the time of their return from the Babylonish captivity and the rebuilding of the temple, they had not kings, but generals or principes. Although a king himself may be called a prince, from his principality in governing, and a leader, because he leads the army, but it does not follow that all who are princes and leaders may also be called kings, as that Aristobulus was. He was succeeded by Alexander, also both king and pontiff, who is reported to have reigned over them cruelly. After him his wife Alexandra was queen of the Jews, and from her time downwards more grievous evils pursued them; for this Alexandra's sons, Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, when contending with each other for the kingdom, called in the Roman forces against the nation of Israel. For Hyrcanus asked assistance from them against his brother. At that time Rome had already subdued Africa and Greece, and ruled extensively in other parts of the world also, and yet, as if unable to bear her own weight, had, in a manner, broken herself by her own size. For indeed she had come to grave domestic seditions, and from that to social wars, and by and by to civil wars, and had enfeebled and worn herself out so much, that the changed state of the republic, in which she should be governed by kings, was now imminent. Pompey then, a most illustrious prince of the Roman people, having entered Judea with an army, took the city, threw open the temple, not with the devotion of a suppliant, but with the authority of a conqueror, and went, not reverently, but profanely, into the holy of holies, where it was lawful for none but the pontiff to enter. Having established Hyrcanus in the pontificate, and set Antipater over the subjugated nation as guardian or procurator, as they were then called, he led Aristobulus with him bound. From that time the Jews also began to be Roman tributaries. Afterward Cassius plundered the very temple. Then after a few years it was their desert to have Herod, a king of foreign birth, in whose reign Christ was born. For the time had now come signified by the prophetic Spirit through the mouth of the patriarch Jacob, when he says, \"There shall not be lacking a prince out of Judah, nor a teacher from his loins, until He shall come for whom it is reserved; and He is the expectation of the nations.\"[fn-35-P3540_1922952:90-nf] There lacked not therefore a Jewish prince of the Jews until that Herod, who was the first king of a foreign race received by them. Therefore it was now the time when He should come for whom that was reserved which is promised in the New Testament, that He should be the expectation of the nations. But it was not possible that the nations should expect He would come, as we see they did, to do judgment in the splendor of power, unless they should first believe in Him when He came to suffer judgment in the humility of patience.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":49,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_18_lecture_xiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"9.

I should like to know, or rather, it would be well not to know, with what blindness of mind Faustus reads the passage where Jacob calls his sons, and says, \"Assemble, that I may tell you the things that are to happen in the last day. Assemble and hear, ye sons of Jacob; give ear to Israel, your father.\" Surely these are the words of a prophet. What, then, does he say of his son Judah, of whose tribe Christ came of the seed of David according to the flesh, as the apostle teaches? \"Judah,\" he says, \"thy brethren shall praise thee: thy hand shall be upon the backs of thine enemies; the sons of thy father shall bow down to thee. Judah is a lion's whelp; my son and offspring: bowing down, thou hast gone up: thou sleepest as a lion, and as a young lion, who will rouse him up? A prince shall not depart from Judah, nor a leader from his loins, till those things come which have been laid up for him. He also is the desire of nations: binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt with sackcloth, he shall wash his garment in wine,and his clothes in the blood of grapes: his eyes are bright with wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.\"[fn-14-P1486_800436:67-nf] There is no falsehood or obscurity in these words when we read them in the clear light of Christ. We see His brethren the apostles and all His joint-heirs praising Him, seeking, not their own glory, but His. We see His hands on the backs of His enemies, who are bent and bowed to the earth by the growth of the Christian communities in spite of their opposition. We see Him worshipped by the sons of Jacob, the remnant saved according to the election of grace. Christ, who was born as an infant, is the lion's whelp, as it is added, My son and offspring, to show why this whelp, in whose praise it is said, \"The lion's whelp is stronger than the herd,\"[fn-14-P1487_801117:68-nf] is even in infancy stronger than its elders. We see Christ ascending the cross, and bowing down when He gave up His spirit. We see Him sleeping as a lion, because in death itself He was not the conquered, but the conqueror, and as a lion's whelp; for the reason of His birth and of His death was the same. And He is raised from the dead by Him whom no man hath seen or can see; for the words, \"Who will raise Him up?\" point to an unknown power. A prince did not depart from Judah, nor a leader from his loins, till in due time those things came which had been laid up in the promise. For we learn from the authentic history of the Jews themselves, that Herod, under whom Christ was born, was their first foreign king. So the sceptre did not depart from the seed of Judah till the things laid up for him came. Then, as the promise is not only to the believing Jews, it is added: \"He is the desire of the nations.\" Christ bound His foal-that is, His people-to the vine, when He preached in sackcloth, crying, \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" The Gentiles made subject to Him are represented by the ass's colt, on which He also sat, leading it into Jerusalem, that is, the vision of peace teaching the meek His ways. We see Him washing His garments in wine; for He is one with the glorious Church, which He presents to Himself, not having spot or wrinkle; to whom also it is said by Isaiah: \"Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow.\"[fn-14-P1488_802606:69-nf] How is this done but by the remission of sins? And the wine is none other than that of which it is said that it is \"shed for many, for the remission of sins.\" Christ is the cluster that hung on the pole. So it is added, \"and His clothes in the blood of the grape.\" Again, what is said of His eyes being bright with wine, is understood by those members of His body who are enabled, in holy aberration of mind from the current of earthly things, to gaze on the eternal light of wisdom. So Paul says in a passage quoted before: \"If we be beside ourselves, it is to God.\" Those are the eyes bright with wine. But he adds: \"If we be sober, it is for your sakes.\" The babes needing to be fed with milk are not forgotten, as is denoted by the words, \"His teeth are whiter than milk.\"","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":49,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_21_dialogue_iii_the_impassible_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"219","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Orth.-And when you hear the Patriarch Jacob saying \"Bury me with my Fathers.\"[fn-46-P4665_1156406:29-nf] do you suppose this refers to the body or to the soul?","title":"Dialogue III.-The Impassible.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":49,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_21_dialogue_iii_the_impassible_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"222","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Eran.-\"There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife.

First, I shall offer a full explanation[fn-50-P5077_1595510:257-nf] of the types. And no doubt it was proper that this mystery should be prophetically set forth by types, and indeed chiefly by that method: for in proportion to its incredibility would it be a stumbling-block, if it were set forth in bare prophecy; and in proportion too, to its grandeur, was the need of obscuring it in shadow,[fn-50-P5078_1595853:258-nf] that the difficulty of understanding it might lead to prayer for the grace of God. First, then, Isaac, when he was given up by his father as an offering, himself carried the wood for his own death. By this act he even then was setting forth the death of Christ, who was destined by His Father as a sacrifice, and carried the cross whereon He suffered. Joseph likewise was a type of Christ, not indeed on this ground (that I may not delay my course[fn-50-P5079_1596327:259-nf] ), that he suffered persecution for the cause of God from his brethren, as Christ did from His brethren after the flesh, the Jews; but when he is blessed by his father in these words: \"His glory is that of a bullock; his horns are the horns of a unicorn; with them shall he push the nations to the very ends of the earth,\"[fn-50-P5080_1596966:260-nf] -he was not, of course, designated as a mere unicorn with its one horn, or a minotaur with two; but Christ was indicated in him-a bullock in respect of both His characteristics: to some as severe as a Judge, to others gentle as a Saviour, whose horns were the extremities of His cross. For of the antenna, which is a part of a cross, the ends are called horns; while the midway stake of the whole frame is the unicorn. By this virtue, then, of His cross, and in this manner \"horned,\" He is both now pushing all nations through faith, bearing them away from earth to heaven; and will then push them through judgment, casting them down from heaven to earth. He will also, according to another passage in the same scripture, be a bullock, when He is spiritually interpreted to be Jacob against Simeon and Levi, which means against the scribes and the Pharisees; for it was from them that these last derived their origin.[fn-50-P5081_1597909:261-nf] Like Simeon and Levi, they consummated their wickedness by their heresy, with which they persecuted Christ. \"Into their counsel let not my soul enter; to their assembly let not my heart be united: for in their anger they slew men,\" that is, the prophets; \"and in their self-will they hacked the sinews of a bullock,\"[fn-50-P5082_1598241:262-nf] that is, of Christ. For against Him did they wreak their fury after they had slain His prophets, even by affixing Him with nails to the cross. Otherwise, it is an idle thing[fn-50-P5083_1598484:263-nf] when, after slaying men, he inveighs against them for the torture of a bullock! Again, in the case of Moses, wherefore did he at that moment particularly, when Joshua was fighting Amalek, pray in a sitting posture with outstretched hands, when in such a conflict it would surely have been more seemly to have bent the knee, and smitten the breast, and to have fallen on the face to the ground, and in such prostration to have offered prayer? Wherefore, but because in a battle fought in the name of that Lord who was one day to fight against the devil, the shape was necessary of that very cross through which Jesus was to win the victory? Why, once more, did the same Moses, after prohibiting the likeness of everything, set up the golden serpent on the pole; and as it hung there, propose it as an object to be looked at for a cure?[fn-50-P5084_1599333:264-nf] Did he not here also intend to show the power of our Lord's cross, whereby that old serpent the devil was vanquished,-whereby also to every man who was bitten by spiritual serpents, but who yet turned with an eye of faith to it, was proclaimed a cure from the bite of sin, and health for evermore?","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":49,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"413","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"This is the unanimous teaching of the evangelists.

For what need of a traitor was there in the case of one who offered Himself to the people openly, and might quite as easily have been captured by force as taken by treachery? This might no doubt have been well enough for another Christ, but would not have been suitable in One who was accomplishing prophecies. For it was written, \"The righteous one did they sell for silver.\"[fn-69-P6952_2022008:1595-nf] The very amount and the destination[fn-69-P6953_2022066:1596-nf] of the money, which on Judas' remorse was recalled from its first purpose of a fee,[fn-69-P6954_2022167:1597-nf] and appropriated to the purchase of a potter's field, as narrated in the Gospel of Matthew, were clearly foretold by Jeremiah:[fn-69-P6955_2022313:1598-nf] \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued[fn-69-P6956_2023536:1599-nf] and gave them for the potter's field.\" When He so earnestly expressed His desire to eat the passover, He considered it His own feast; for it would have been unworthy of God to desire to partake of what was not His own. Then, having taken the bread and given it to His disciples, He made it His own body, by saying, \"This is my body,\"[fn-69-P6957_2024134:1600-nf] that is, the figure of my body. A figure, however, there could not have been, unless there were first a veritable body.[fn-69-P6958_2024319:1601-nf] An empty thing, or phantom, is incapable of a figure. If, however, (as Marcion might say, ) He pretended the bread was His body, because He lacked the truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for us. It would contribute very well to the support of Marcion's theory of a phantom body,[fn-69-P6959_2024703:1602-nf] that bread should have been crucified!But why call His body bread, and not rather (some other edible thing, say) a melon,[fn-69-P6960_2024876:1603-nf] which Marcion must have had in lieu of a heart! He did not understand how ancient was this figure of the body of Christ, who said Himself by Jeremiah: \"I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter, and I knew not that[fn-69-P6961_2025229:1604-nf] they devised a device against me, saying, Let us cast the tree upon His bread,\"[fn-69-P6962_2025396:1605-nf] which means, of course, the cross upon His body. And thus, casting light, as He always did, upon the ancient prophecies,[fn-69-P6963_2025681:1606-nf] He declared plainly enough what He meant by the bread, when He called the bread His own body. He likewise, when mentioning the cup and making the new testament to be sealed \"in His blood,\"[fn-69-P6964_2026008:1607-nf] affirms the reality of His body. For no blood can belong to a body which is not a body of flesh. If any sort of body were presented to our view, which is not one of flesh, not being fleshly, it would not possess blood. Thus, from the evidence of the flesh, we get a proof of the body, and a proof of the flesh from the evidence of the blood. In order, however, that you may discover how anciently wine is used as a figure for blood, turn to Isaiah, who asks, \"Who is this that cometh from Edom, from Bosor with garments dyed in red, so glorious in His apparel, in the greatness of his might? Why are thy garments red, and thy raiment as his who cometh from the treading of the full winepress? \"[fn-69-P6965_2026727:1608-nf] The prophetic Spirit contemplates the Lord as if He were already on His way to His passion, clad in His fleshly nature; and as He was to suffer therein, He represents the bleeding condition of His flesh under the metaphor of garments dyed in red, as if reddened in the treading and crushing process of the wine-press, from which the labourers descend reddened with the wine-juice, like men stained in blood. Much more clearly still does the book of Genesis foretell this, when (in the blessing of Judah, out of whose tribe Christ was to come according to the flesh) it even then delineated Christ in the person of that patriarch,[fn-69-P6966_2027407:1609-nf] saying, \"He washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes\"[fn-69-P6967_2027506:1610-nf] -in His garments and clothes the prophecy pointed out his flesh, and His blood in the wine.

Thus, twenty and four make as many as there are elders sitting upon the thrones. But as an animal cannot fly unless it have wings, so, too, the announcement of the New Testament gains no faith unless it have the fore-announced testimonies of the Old Testament, by which it is lifted from the earth, and flies. For in every case, what has been told before, and is afterwards found to have happened, that begets an undoubting faith. Again, also, if wings be not attached to the living creatures, they have nothing whence they may draw their life. For unless what the prophets foretold had been consummated in Christ, their preaching was vain. For the Catholic Church holds those things which were both before predicted and afterwards accomplished. And it flies, because the living animal is reasonably lifted up from the earth. But to heretics who do not avail themselves of the prophetic testimony, to them also there are present living creatures; but they do not fly, because they are of the earth. And to the Jews who do not receive the announcement of the New Testament there are present wings; but they do not fly, that is, they bring a vain prophesying to men, not adjusting facts to their words. And the books of the Old Testament that are received are twenty-four, which you will find in the epitomes of Theodore. But, moreover (as we have said), four and twenty elders, patriarchs and apostles, are to judge His people. For to the apostles, when they asked, saying, \"We have forsaken all that we had, and followed Thee: what shall we have? \"our Lord replied, \"When the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\"[fn-46-P4635_1767708:29-nf] But of the fathers also who should judge, says the patriarch Jacob, \"Dan also himself shall judge his people among his brethren, even as one of the tribes in Israel.\"[fn-46-P4636_1767899:30-nf] ","title":"Commentary on the Apocalypse of the Blessed John","author":"Victorinus"},{"chapter":49,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_07_anf07_30_commentary_on_the_apocalypse_of_the_blessed_john","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"ANF-07","text":"5. \"Lo, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed.\"] We read in Genesis that this lion of the tribe of Judah hath conquered, when the patriarch Jacob says, \"Judah, thy brethren shall praise thee; thou hast lain down and slept, and hast risen up again as a lion, and as a lion's whelp.\"[fn-46-P4646_1771469:32-nf] For He is called a lion for the overcoming of death; but for the suffering for men He was led as a lamb to the slaughter. But because He overcame death, and anticipated the duty of the executioner, He was called as it were slain. He therefore opens and seals again the testament, which He Himself had sealed. The legislator Moses intimating this, that it behoved Him to be sealed and concealed, even to the advent of His passion, veiled his face, and so spoke to the people; showing that the words of his announcement were veiled even to the advent of His time. For he himself, when he had read to the people, having taken the wool purpled with the blood of the calf, with water sprinkled the whole people, saying, \"This is the blood of His testament who hath purified you.\"[fn-46-P4647_1772266:33-nf] It should therefore be observed that the Man is accurately announced, and that all things combine into one. For it is not sufficient that that law is spoken of, but it is named as a testament. For no law is called a testament, nor is any thing else called a testament, save what persons make who are about to die. And whatever is within the testament is sealed, even to the day of the testator's death. Therefore it is with reason that it is only sealed by the Lamb slain, who, as it were a lion, has broken death in pieces, and has fulfilled what had been foretold; and has delivered man, that is, the flesh, from death, and has received as a possession the substance of the dying person, that is, of the human members; that as by one body all men had fallen under the obligation of its death, also by one body all believers should be born again unto life, and rise again. Reasonably, therefore, His face is opened and unveiled to Moses; and therefore He is called Apocalypse, Revelation.

He brings forward once more some of the Master's words, to this effect: \"And it is in precisely the same manner that we are taught by Holy Scripture the employment of a conception. Our Lord Jesus Christ, when declaring to men the nature of His Godhead, explains it by certain special characteristics, calling Himself the Door, the Bread, the Way, the Vine, the Shepherd, the Light.\" Now I think it seemly to pass over his insolent remarks on these words (for it is thus that his rhetorical training has taught him to contend with his opponents), nor will I suffer myself to be disturbed by his ebullitions of childish folly. Let us, however, examine one pungent and \"irresistible\" argument which he puts forward for our refutation. Which of the sacred writers, he asks, gives evidence that these names were attributed to our Lord by a conception? But which of them, I reply, forbids it, deeming it a blasphemy to regard such names as the result of a conception? For if he maintains that its not being mentioned is a proof that it is forbidden, by a parity of reasoning he must admit that its not being forbidden is an argument that it is permitted. Is our Lord called by these names, or does Eunomius deny this also? If he does deny that these names are spoken of Christ, we have conquered without a battle. For what more signal victory could there be, than to prove our adversary to be fighting against God, by robbing the sacred words of the Gospel of their meaning? But if he admits that it is true that Christ is named by these names, let him say in what manner they may be applied without irreverence to the Only-begotten Son of God. Does he take \"the stone\" as indicative of His nature? Does he understand His essence under the figure of the Axe (not to encumber our argument by enumerating the rest)? None of these names represents the nature of the Only-begotten, or His Godhead, or the peculiar character of His essence. Nevertheless He is called by these names, and each appellation has its own special fitness. For we cannot, without irreverence, suppose anything in the words of God to be idle and unmeaning. Let him say, then, if he disallows these names as the result of a conception, how do they apply to Christ? For we on our part say this, that as our Lord provided for human life in various forms, each variety of His beneficence is suitably distinguished by His several names, His provident care and working on our behalf passing over into the mould of a name. And such a name is said by us to be arrived at by a conception. But if this is not agreeable to our opponents, let it be as each of them pleases. In his ignorance, however, of the figures of Scripture, our opponent contradicts what is said. For if he had learned the Divine names, he must have known that our Lord is called a Curse and Sin[fn-22-P2289_1487760:72-nf] , and a Heifer[fn-22-P2290_1487794:73-nf] , and a lion's Whelp[fn-22-P2291_1487833:74-nf] , and a Bear bereaved of her whelps[fn-22-P2292_1487888:75-nf] , and a Leopard[fn-22-P2293_1487924:76-nf] and such-like names, according to various modes of conception, by Holy Scripture, the sacred and inspired writers by such names, as by well-directed shafts, indicating the central point of the idea they had in view; even though these words, when taken in their literal and obvious signification, seem not above suspicion, but each single one of them, unless we allow it to be predicated of God by some process of conception, will not escape the taint of a blasphemous suggestion. But it would be a lengthy task to bring them forward, and elucidate in every case how, in the general idea, these words have been perverted[fn-22-P2294_1488565:77-nf] out of their obvious meanings, and how it is only in connection with the conceptive faculty that the names of God can be reconciled with that reverence which is His due.","title":"Answer to Eunomius' Second Book","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":49,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_12_viii_the_testament_of_naphtali_concerning_natural_goodness_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"ANF-08","text":"2.

Indeed, when I hear that this man was chosen by the Lord after He had attained His rest in heaven, I feel that a kind of improvidence is imputable to Christ, for not knowing before that this man was necessary to Him; and because He thought that he must be added to the apostolic body in the way of a fortuitous encounter[fn-71-P7152_2073870:10-nf] rather than a deliberate selection; by necessity (so to speak), and not voluntary choice, although the members of the apostolate had been duly ordained, and were now dismissed to their several missions.

Besides, you have read, no doubt, that \"many shall come, saying, I am Christ.\"[fn-71-P7165_2075897:23-nf] Now if any one can pretend that he is Christ, how much more might a man profess to be an apostle of Christ! But still, for my own part, I appear[fn-71-P7166_2076060:24-nf] in the character of a disciple and an inquirer; that so I may even thus[fn-71-P7167_2076148:25-nf] both refute your belief, who have nothing to support it, and confound your shamelessness, who make claims without possessing the means of establishing them. Let there be a Christ, let there be an apostle, although of another god; but what matter? since they are only to draw their proofs out of the Testament of the Creator. Because even the book of Genesis so long ago promised me the Apostle Paul. For among the types and prophetic blessings which he pronounced over his sons, Jacob, when he turned his attention to Benjamin, exclaimed, \"Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf; in the morning He shall devour the prey, and at night he shall impart nourishment.\"[fn-71-P7168_2076819:26-nf] He foresaw that Paul would arise out of the tribe of Benjamin, a voracious wolf, devouring his prey in the morning: in order words, in the early period of his life he would devastate the Lord's sheep, as a persecutor of the churches; but in the evening he would give them nourishment, which means that in his declining years he would educate the fold of Christ, as the teacher of the Gentiles. Then, again, in Saul's conduct towards David, exhibited first in violent persecution of him, and then in remorse and reparation,[fn-71-P7169_2077439:27-nf] on his receiving from him good for evil, we have nothing else than an anticipation[fn-71-P7170_2077540:28-nf] of Paul in Saul-belonging, too, as they did, to the same tribe-and of Jesus in David, from whom He descended according to the Virgin's genealogy.[fn-71-P7171_2077719:29-nf] Should you, however, disapprove of these types,[fn-71-P7172_2077798:30-nf] the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-71-P7173_2077851:31-nf] at all events, have handed down to me this career of Paul, which you must not refuse to accept. Thence I demonstrate that from a persecutor he became \"an apostle, not of men, neither by man; \"[fn-71-P7174_2079049:32-nf] thence am I led to believe the Apostle himself; thence do I find reason for rejecting your defence of him,[fn-71-P7175_2079172:33-nf] and for bearing fearlessly your taunt. \"Then you deny the Apostle Paul.\" I do not calumniate him whom I defend.[fn-71-P7176_2079324:34-nf] I deny him, to compel you to the proof of him. I deny him, to convince you that he is mine. If you have regard to our belief you should admit the particulars which comprise it. If you challenge us to your belief, (pray) tell us what things constitute its basis.[fn-71-P7177_2079677:35-nf] Either prove the truth of what you believe, or failing in your proof, (tell us) how you believe. Else what conduct is yours,[fn-71-P7178_2079824:36-nf] believing in opposition to Him from whom alone comes the proof of that which you believe? Take now from my point of view[fn-71-P7179_2079961:37-nf] the apostle, in the same manner as you have received the Christ-the apostle shown to be as much mine as the Christ is. And here, too, we will fight within the same lines, and challenge our adversary on the mere ground of a simple rule,[fn-71-P7180_2080221:38-nf] that even an apostle who is said not to belong to the Creator-nay, is displayed as in actual hostility to the Creator-can be fairly regarded as teaching[fn-71-P7181_2080410:39-nf] nothing, knowing nothing, wishing nothing in favour of the Creator whilst it would be a first principle with him to set forth[fn-71-P7182_2080571:40-nf] another god with as much eagerness as he would use in withdrawing us from the law of the Creator. It is not at all likely that he would call men away from Judaism without showing them at the same time what was the god in whom he invited them to believe; because nobody could possibly pass from allegiance to the Creator without knowing to whom he had to cross over. For either Christ had already revealed another god-in which case the apostle's testimony would also follow to the same effect, for fear of his not being else regarded[fn-71-P7183_2081118:41-nf] as an apostle of the god whom Christ had revealed, and because of the impropriety of his being concealed by the apostle who had been already revealed by Christ-or Christ had made no such revelation concerning God; then there was all the greater need why the apostle should reveal a God who could now be made known by no one else, and who would undoubtedly be left without any belief at all, if he were revealed not even by an apostle. We have laid down this as our first principle, because we wish at once to profess that we shall pursue the same method here in the apostle's case as we adopted before in Christ's case, to prove that he proclaimed no new god;[fn-71-P7184_2081801:42-nf] that is, we shall draw our evidence from the epistles of St. Paul himself.

It should be added that Lot, the brother, that is the blood relation, of Abraham, is not to be ranked as equal to those of whom God says, \"I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob;\" nor does he belong to those testified to in Scripture as having continued righteous to the end, although in Sodom he lived a pious and virtuous life, and showed a praiseworthy hospitality, so that he was rescued from the fire, and a land was given by God to his seed to dwell in, for the sake of his uncle Abraham. On these accounts he is commended in Scripture-not for intemperance or incest. But when we find bad and good actions recorded of the same person, we must take warning from the one, and example from the other. As, then, the sin of Lot, of whom we are told that he was righteous previous to this sin, instead of bringing a stain on the character of God, or the truth of Scripture, rather calls on us to approve and admire the record in its resemblance to a faithful mirror, which reflects not only the beauties and perfections, but also the faults and deformities, of those who approach it; still more, in the case of Judah, who lay with his daughter-in-law, we may see how groundless are the reproaches cast on the narrative. The sacred record has an authority which raises it far above not merely the cavils of a handful of Manichaeans, but the determined enmity of the whole Gentile world; for, in confirmation of its claims, we see that already it has brought nearly all people from their idolatrous superstitions to the worship of one God, according to the rule of Christianity. It has conquered the world, not by violence and warfare, but by the resistless force of truth. Where, then, is Judah praised in Scripture? Where is anything good said of him, except that in the blessing pronounced by his father he is distinguished above the rest, because of the prophecy that Christ would come in the flesh from his tribe?[fn-21-P2181_1306271:103-nf] ","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":49,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_35_book_xxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"85. The time when the kingdom was removed from the tribe of Judah was the time appointed for the coming of Christ our Lord, the true Saviour, who should come not for harm, but for great good. Thus was it prophesied, \"A prince shall not fail from Judah, nor a leader from his loins, till He come for whom it is reserved: He is the desire of nations.\"[fn-22-P2260_1364398:157-nf] Not only the kingdom, but all government, of the Jews had ceased, and also, as prophesied by Daniel, the sacred anointing from which the name Christ or Anointed is derived. Then came He for whom it was reserved, the desire of nations; and the holy of holies was anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows.[fn-22-P2261_1364735:158-nf] Christ was born in the time of the elder Herod, and suffered in the time of Herod the tetrarch. He who thus came to the lost sheep of the house of Israel was typified by Judah when he went to shear his sheep in Thamna, which means, failing. For then the prince had failed from Judah, with all the government and anointing of the Jews, that He might come for whom it was reserved. Judah, we are told, came with his Adullamite shepherd, whose name was Iras; and Adullamite means, a testimony in water. So it was with this testimony that the Lord came, having indeed greater testimony than that of John;[fn-22-P2262_1365373:159-nf] but for the sake of his feeble sheep he made use of the testimony in water. The name Iras, too, means, vision of my brother. So John saw his brother, a brother in the family of Abraham, and from the relationship of Mary and Elisabeth; and the same person he recognised as his Lord and his God, for, as he himself says, he received of His fullness.[fn-22-P2263_1365740:160-nf] On account of this vision, among those born of woman, there has arisen no greater than he;[fn-22-P2264_1365849:161-nf] because, of all who foretold Christ, he alone saw what many righteous men and prophets desired to see and saw not. He saluted Christ from the womb;[fn-22-P2265_1366018:162-nf] he knew Him more certainly from seeing the dove; and therefore, as the Adullamite, he gave testimony by water. The Lord came to shear His sheep, in releasing them from painful burdens, as it is said in praise of the Church in the Song of Songs, that her teeth are like a flock of sheep after shearing.[fn-22-P2266_1366339:163-nf] ","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":49,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Let us consider, however, a little more carefully what is the Word which is in the beginning. I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but tropically. But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term \"Word.\" I wonder at the stupidity of the general run of Christians in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity. The Son of God says in one passage, \"I am the light of the world,\" and in another, \"I am the resurrection,\" and again, \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" It is also written, \"I am the door,\" and we have the saying, \"I am the good shepherd,\" and when the woman of Samaria says, \"We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,\" Jesus answers, \"I that speak unto thee am He.\" Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared Himself in these words[fn-62-P6254_982473:92-nf] to be their Master and Lord: \"You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.\" He also distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says,[fn-62-P6255_982654:93-nf] \"He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? \"and[fn-62-P6256_982806:94-nf] \"Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.\" We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate's question,[fn-62-P6257_982993:95-nf] \"Art Thou the King of the Jews? \"by saying, \"My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence.\" We have also read the words,[fn-62-P6258_983272:96-nf] \"I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman,\" and again, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" Add to these testimonies also the saying,[fn-62-P6259_983437:97-nf] \"I am the bread of life, that came down from heaven and giveth life to the world.\" These texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son of God. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says,[fn-62-P6260_983747:98-nf] \"I am the first and the last, and the living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.\" And again,[fn-62-P6261_983876:99-nf] \"I am the A and the W, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" The careful student of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as where He calls Himself[fn-62-P6262_984111:100-nf] a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,[fn-62-P6263_984170:101-nf] and a light of the Gentiles.[fn-62-P6264_984225:102-nf] Isaiah also says,[fn-62-P6265_984264:103-nf] \"From my mother's womb hath He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.\" And a little farther on: \"And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of Israel. Behold I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" And in Jeremiah too[fn-62-P6266_984857:104-nf] He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: \"I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.\" These and other similar sayings He applies to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets proclaim in advance His coining advent and announce the things concerning Him under various names. Thus John calls Him the Lamb of God, saying,[fn-62-P6267_985471:105-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world,\" and in these words he declares Him as a man,[fn-62-P6268_985601:106-nf] \"This is He about whom I said, that there cometh after me a man who is there before me; for He was before me.\" And in his Catholic Epistle John says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus:[fn-62-P6269_985836:107-nf] \"And if any one sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,\" and he adds that He is a propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a propitiation:[fn-62-P6270_986050:108-nf] \"Whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast sins, in the forbearance of God.\" According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:[fn-62-P6271_986344:109-nf] \"Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: \"He was made to us of God,\" he says, \"wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\" But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest:[fn-62-P6272_986654:110-nf] \"Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.\" And the prophets have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons[fn-62-P6273_986898:111-nf] says, \"Judah, thy brethren shall extol thee; thy hands are on the necks of thine enemies. A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art thou sprung up; thou hast lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him? \"We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. What may be quoted against this view, viz., \"A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved; \"this can better be cleared up on another occasion . But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel, when he says,[fn-62-P6274_987528:112-nf] \"Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted Him. He shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break. and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope.\" That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says:[fn-62-P6275_988040:113-nf] \"That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry,\" etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God:[fn-62-P6276_988248:114-nf] \"I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd.\" For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower:[fn-62-P6277_988483:115-nf] \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of tits root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel slid of might, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as follows:[fn-62-P6278_988887:116-nf] \"The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the comer. It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.\" And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows:[fn-62-P6279_989155:117-nf] \"Have ye never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.\" And Luke writes in Acts:[fn-62-P6280_989407:118-nf] \"This is the stone, which was set at naught of you the builders, which has become the head of the corner.\" And one of the names applied to the Saviour is that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records;-the Word who was in the beginning with God, God the Word. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and ask, What is the Son of God when called the Word? The passage they employ most is that in the Psalms,[fn-62-P6281_990132:119-nf] \"My heart hath produced a good Word; \"and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are they clear about His essence. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said to be \"Word\" can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an essence of His own. We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it suggests slid apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course. To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have to say on the question, how the Son of God is the Word, we must begin with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him. This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression, but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these matters will clear the way for what is coming. And once we have entered upon the theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what diligence we can and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall necessarily understand more about Him not only in His character as the Word, but in His other characters also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":49,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_126_oration_on_the_psalms_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"ANF-06","text":"II.

To-day, according to the prophet,[fn-61-P6169_1895902:19-nf] is the King of Glory glorified upon earth, and makes us, the inhabitants of earth, partakers of the heavenly feast, that He may show himself to be the Lord of both, even as He is hymned with the common praises of both.

Up to the time of Jesus Christ, who taught us, and interpreted the prophecies which were not yet understood, [they had a lawgiver] as was foretold by the holy and divine Spirit of prophecy through Moses, \"that a ruler would not fail the Jews until He should come for whom the kingdom was reserved\" (for Judah was the forefather of the Jews, from whom also they have their name of Jews); and after He (i.e., Christ) appeared, you began to rule the Jews, and gained possession of all their territory. And the prophecy, \"He shall be the expectation of the nations,\" signified that there would be some of all nations who should look for Him to come again. And this indeed you can see for yourselves, and be convinced of by fact. For of all races of men there are some who look for Him who was crucified in Judaea, and after whose crucifixion the land was straightway surrendered to you as spoil of war. And the prophecy, \"binding His foal to the vine, and washing His robe in the blood of the grape,\" was a significant symbol of the things that were to happen to Christ, and of what He was to do. For the foal of an ass stood bound to a vine at the entrance of a village, and He ordered His acquaintances to bring it to Him then; and when it was brought, He mounted and sat upon it, and entered Jerusalem, where was the vast temple of the Jews which was afterwards destroyed by you. And after this He was crucified, that the rest of the prophecy might be fulfilled. For this \"washing His robe in the blood of the grape\" was predictive of the passion He was to endure, cleansing by His blood those who believe on Him. For what is called by the Divine Spirit through the prophet \"His robe,\" are those men who believe in Him in whom abideth the seed[fn-37-P3752_682122:61-nf] of God, the Word. And what is spoken of as \"the blood of the grape,\" signifies that He who should appear would have blood, though not of the seed of man, but of the power of God. And the first power after God the Father and Lord of all is the Word, who is also the Son; and of Him we will, in what follows, relate how He took flesh and became man. For as man did not make the blood of the vine, but God, so it was hereby intimated that the blood should not be of human seed, but of divine power, as we have said above. And Isaiah, another prophet, foretelling the same things in other words, spoke thus: \"A star shall rise out of Jacob, and a flower shall spring from the root of Jesse; and His arm shall the nations trust.[fn-37-P3753_682992:62-nf] And a star of light has arisen, and a flower has sprung from the root of Jesse-this Christ. For by the power of God He was conceived by a virgin of the seed of Jacob, who was the father of Judah, who, as we have shown, was the father of the Jews; and Jesse was His forefather according to the oracle, and He was the son of Jacob and Judah according to lineal descent.","title":"The First Apology of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":49,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_46_the_first_apology_of_justin","source_chapter":56,"source_paragraph":"182","folder":"ANF-01","text":"But those who hand down the myths which the poets have made, adduce no proof to the youths who learn them; and we proceed to demonstrate that they have been uttered by the influence of the wicked demons, to deceive and lead astray the human race. For having heard it proclaimed through the prophets that the Christ was to come, and that the ungodly among men were to be punished by fire, they put forward many to be called sons of Jupiter, under the impression that they would be able to produce in men the idea that the things which were said with regard to Christ were mere marvellous tales, like the things which were said by the poets. And these things were said both among the Greeks and among all nations where they [the demons] heard the prophets foretelling that Christ would specially be believed in; but that in hearing what was said by the prophets they did not accurately understand it, but imitated what was said of our Christ, like men who are in error, we will make plain. The prophet Moses, then, was, as we have already said, older than all writers; and by him, as we have also said before, it was thus predicted: \"There shall not fail a prince from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until He come for whom it is reserved; and He shall be the desire of the Gentiles, binding His foal to the vine, washing His robe in the blood of the grape.\"[fn-38-P3872_722615:115-nf] The devils, accordingly, when they heard these prophetic words, said that Bacchus was the son of Jupiter, and gave out that he was the discoverer of the vine, and they number wine[fn-38-P3873_722817:116-nf] [or, the ass] among his mysteries; and they taught that, having been torn in pieces, he ascended into heaven. And because in the prophecy of Moses it had not been expressly intimated whether He who was to come was the Son of God, and whether He would, riding on the foal, remain on earth or ascend into heaven, and because the name of \"foal\" could mean either the foal of an ass or the foal of a horse, they, not knowing whether He who was foretold would bring the foal of an ass or of a horse as the sign of His coming, nor whether He was the Son of God, as we said above, or of man, gave out that Bellerophon, a man born of man, himself ascended to heaven on his horse Pegasus. And when they heard it said by the other prophet Isaiah, that He should be born of a virgin, and by His own means ascend into heaven, they pretended that Perseus was spoken of. And when they knew what was said, as has been cited above, in the prophecies written aforetime, \"Strong as a giant to run his course,\"[fn-38-P3874_724127:117-nf] they said that Hercules was strong, and had journeyed over the whole earth.

Moses was sent with a rod to effect the redemption of the people; and with this in his hands at the head of the people, he divided the sea. By this he saw the water gushing out of the rock; and when he cast a tree into the waters of Marah, which were bitter, he made them sweet. Jacob, by putting rods into the water-troughs, caused the sheep of his uncle to conceive, so that he should obtain their young. With his rod the same Jacob boasts that he had crossed the river. He said he had seen a ladder, and the Scripture has declared that God stood above it. But that this was not the Father, we have proved from the Scriptures. And Jacob, having poured oil on a stone in the same place, is testified to by the very God who appeared to him, that he had anointed a pillar to the God who appeared to him. And that the stone symbolically proclaimed Christ, we have also proved by many Scriptures; and that the unguent, whether it was of oil, or of stacte,[fn-48-P4818_1047511:339-nf] or of any other compounded sweet balsams, had reference to Him, we have also proved,[fn-48-P4819_1047685:340-nf] inasmuch as the word says: `Therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.'[fn-48-P4820_1047871:341-nf] For indeed all kings and anointed persons obtained from Him their share in the names of kings and anointed: just as He Himself received from the Father the titles of King, and Christ, and Priest, and Angel, and such like other titles which He bears or did bear. Aaron's rod, which blossomed, declared him to be the high priest. Isaiah prophesied that a rod would come forth from the root of Jesse, [and this was] Christ. And David says that the righteous man is `like the tree that is planted by the channels of waters, which should yield its fruit in its season, and whose leaf should not fade.'[fn-48-P4821_1048487:342-nf] Again, the righteous is said to flourish like the palm-tree. God appeared from a tree to Abraham, as it is written, near the oak in Mamre. The people found seventy willows and twelve springs after crossing the Jordan.[fn-48-P4822_1048722:343-nf] David affirms that God comforted him with a rod and staff. Elisha, by casting a stick[fn-48-P4823_1048858:344-nf] into the river Jordan, recovered the iron part of the axe with which the sons of the prophets had gone to cut down trees to build the house in which they wished to read and study the law and commandments of God; even as our Christ, by being crucified on the tree, and by purifying [us] with water, has redeemed us, though plunged in the direst offences which we have committed, and has made [us] a house of prayer and adoration. Moreover, it was a rod that pointed out Judah to be the father of Tamar's sons by a great mystery.\"","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":49,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":122,"source_paragraph":"580","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"Observe, too, how the same promises are made to Isaac and to Jacob.

Although, however, I must hasten to other matters, I do not think that I must pass over this point, that in the Gospel the Lord declared, by way of signifying His majesty, saying, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will build it up again.\"[fn-103-P10320_3237144:166-nf] Or when, in another passage, and on another subject, He declares, \"I have power to lay down my life, and again to take it up; for this commandment I have received of my Father.\"[fn-103-P10321_3237343:167-nf] Now who is it who says that He can lay down His life, or can Himself recover His life again, because He has received it of His Father?

And if by the apostle Christ is called \"the first-born of every creature,\"[fn-103-P10328_3238789:174-nf] how could He be the first-born of every creature, unless because according to His divinity the Word proceeded from the Father before every creature? And unless the heretics receive it thus, they will be constrained to show that Christ the man was the first-born of every creature; which they will not be able to do. Either, therefore, He is before every creature, that He may be the first-born of every creature, and He is not man only, because man is after every creature; or He is man only, and He is after every creature. And how is He the first-born of every creature, except because being that Word which is before every creature; and therefore, the first-born of every creature, He becomes flesh and dwells in us, that is, assumes that man's nature which is after every creature, and so dwells with him and in him, in us, that neither is humanity taken away from Christ, nor His divinity denied? For if He is only before every creature, humanity is taken away from Him; but if He is only man, the divinity which is before every creature is interfered with. Both of these, therefore, are leagued together in Christ, and both are conjoined, and both are linked with one another. And rightly, as there is in Him something which excels the creature, the agreement of the divinity and the humanity seems to be pledged in Him: for which reason He who is declared as made the \"Mediator between God and man\"[fn-103-P10329_3240515:175-nf] is revealed to have associated in Himself God and man. And if the same apostle says of Christ, that \"having put off the flesh, He spoiled powers, they being openly triumphed over in Himself,\"[fn-103-P10330_3240729:176-nf] he certainly did not without a meaning propound that the flesh was put off, unless because he wished it to be understood that it was again put on also at the resurrection. Who, therefore, is He that thus put off and put on the flesh? Let the heretics seek out. For we know that the Word of God was invested with the substance of flesh, and that He again was divested of the same bodily material, which again He took up in the resurrection and resumed as a garment. And yet Christ could neither have been divested of nor invested with manhood, had He been only man: for man is never either deprived of nor invested with himself. For that must be something else, whatever it may be, which by any other is either taken away or put on. Whence, reasonably, it was the Word of God who put off the flesh, and again in the resurrection put it on, since He put it off because at His birth He had been invested with it. Therefore in Christ it is God who is invested, and moreover must be divested, because He who is invested must also likewise be He who is divested; whereas, as man, He is invested with and divested of, as it were, a certain tunic of the compacted body.[fn-103-P10331_3241913:177-nf] And therefore by consequence He was, as we have said, the Word of God, who is revealed to be at one time invested, at another time divested of the flesh. For this, moreover, He before predicted in blessings: \"He shall wash His garment in wine, and His clothing in the blood of the grape.\"[fn-103-P10332_3242355:178-nf] If the garment in Christ be the flesh, and the clothing itself be the body, let it be asked who is He whose body is clothing, and garment flesh? For to us it is evident that the flesh is the garment, and the body the clothing of the Word; and He washed His bodily substance, and purified the material of the flesh in blood, that is, in wine, by His passion, in the human character that He had undertaken. Whence, if indeed He is washed, He is man, because the garment which is washed is the flesh; but He who washes is the Word of God, who, in order that He might wash the garment, was made the taker-up of the garment. Rightly, from that substance which is taken that it might be washed, He is revealed as a man, even as from the authority of the Word who washed it He is manifested to be God.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":49,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_55_book_i_","source_chapter":54,"source_paragraph":"184","folder":"ANF-04","text":"And if we should ask for a second prophecy, which may appear to us to have a clear reference to Jesus, we would quote that which was written by Moses very many years before the advent of Christ, when he makes Jacob, on his departure from this life, to have uttered predictions regarding each of his sons, and to have said of Judah along with the others: \"The ruler will not fail from Judah, and the governor from his loins, until that which is reserved for him come.\"[fn-78-P7896_1896997:98-nf] Now, any one meeting with this prophecy, which is in reality much older than Moses, so that one who was not a believer might suspect that it was not written by him, would be surprised that Moses should be able to predict that the princes of the Jews, seeing there are among them twelve tribes, should be born of the tribe of Judah, and should be the rulers of the people; for which reason also the whole nation are called Jews, deriving their name from the ruling tribe.

For Reuben, when he became a beginning of the children[fn-61-P6185_2468628:318-nf] , was not only-begotten, but in time indeed first, but in nature and relationship one among those who came after him.

For as to the separate stars or the great lights, not this appeared first, and that second, but in one day and by the same command, they were all called into being.

Therefore, my beloved brethren, we should not look at these temporal things, but fix our attention on those which are eternal. Though affliction may come, it will have an end, though insult and persecution, yet are they nothing to the hope which is set [before us]. For all present matters are trifling compared with those which are future; the sufferings of this present time not being worthy to be compared with the hope that is to come[fn-94-P9458_3419624:24-nf] . For what can be compared with the kingdom? or what is there in comparison with life eternal? Or what is all we could give here, to that which we shall inherit yonder? For we are `heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ[fn-94-P9459_3419867:25-nf] .' Therefore it is not right, my beloved, to consider afflictions and persecutions, but the hopes which are laid up for us because of persecutions.","title":"Letter XIII.

The Jews, therefore, have erred concerning the first coming of the Lord; and on this point only there is disagreement betwixt us and them.

I shall speak now with the utmost brevity of the veil of Moses and the ministration of death. For I do not think that these things at least can introduce very much to the disparagement of the law. The text in question,[fn-37-P3777_1061464:494-nf] then, proceeds thus: \"But if the ministration of death, engraven[fn-37-P3778_1061576:495-nf] in letters on the stones, was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; \"[fn-37-P3779_1061841:496-nf] and so on. Well, this passage at any rate acknowledges the existence of a glory on the countenance of Moses, and that surely is a fact favourable to our position. And even although it is to be done away. and although there is a veil in the reading of the same, that does not annoy me or disturb me, provided there be glory in it still. Neither is it the case, that whatever is to be done away is reduced thereby under all manner of circumstances to a condition of dishonour.[fn-37-P3780_1062338:497-nf] For when the Scripture speaks of glory, it shows us also that it had cognizance[fn-37-P3781_1062561:498-nf] of differences in glory. Thus it says: \"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.\"[fn-37-P3782_1062878:499-nf] Although, then, the sun has a greater glory than the moon, it does not follow that the moon is thereby reduced to a condition of dishonour. And even thus, too, although my Lord Jesus Christ excelleth Moses in glory, as the lord excelleth the servant, it does not follow from this that the glory of Moses is to be scorned. For in this way, too, we are able to satisfy our hearers, as the nature of the word itself carries the conviction[fn-37-P3783_1063336:500-nf] with it in that we affirm what we allege on the authority of the Scriptures themselves, or verily make the proof of our statements all the clearer also by illustrations taken from them. Thus, although a person kindles a lamp in the night-time, after the sun has once risen he has no further need of the paltry light of his lamp, on account of that effulgence of the sun which sends forth its rays all the world over; and yet, for all that, the man does not throw his lamp contemptuously away, as if it were something absolutely antagonistic to the sun; but rather, when he has once found out its use, he will keep it with all the greater carefulness. Precisely in this way, then, the law of Moses served as a sort of guardian to the people, like the tamp, until the true Sun, who is our Saviour, should arise, even as the apostle also says to us: \"And Christ shall give thee light.\"[fn-37-P3784_1064350:501-nf] We must look, however, to what is said further on: \"Their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same veil in the reading of the Old Testament; it is untaken away, because it is done away in Christ.[fn-37-P3785_1064583:502-nf] For even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit.\"[fn-37-P3786_1064812:503-nf] What, then, is meant by this? Is Moses present with us even unto this day? Is it the case that he has never slept, that he has never gone to his rest, that he has never departed this life? How is it that this phrase \"unto this day\" is used here? Well, only mark the veil, which is placed, where he says it is placed, on their hearts in their reading. This, therefore, is the word of censure upon the children of Israel, because they read Moses and yet do not understand him, and refuse to turn to the Lord; for it is He that was prophesied of by Moses as about to come. This, then, is the veil which was placed upon the face of Moses,[fn-37-P3787_1065473:504-nf] and this also is his testament;[fn-37-P3788_1065543:505-nf] for he says in the law:[fn-37-P3789_1065676:506-nf] \"A prince shall not be wanting from Judah, nor a leader from his thighs,[fn-37-P3790_1065774:507-nf] until He come whose he is;[fn-37-P3791_1066170:508-nf] and He will be the expectation of the nations: who shall bind[fn-37-P3792_1066609:509-nf] His foal unto the vine, and His ass's colt unto the choice vine; He shall wash His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes; His eyes shall be suffused[fn-37-P3793_1066879:510-nf] with wine, and His teeth white with milk; \"and so on. Moreover, he indicated who He was, and whence He was to come. For he said: \"The Lord God will raise up unto you, a Prophet from among your brethren, like unto me: unto Him hearken ye.\"[fn-37-P3794_1067259:511-nf] Now it is plain that this cannot be understood to have been said of Jesus the son of Nun.[fn-37-P3795_1067373:512-nf] For there is nothing of this circumcision[fn-37-P3796_1067610:513-nf] found in him. After him, too, there have still been kings from Judah; and consequently this prophecy is far from being applicable to him. And this is the veil which is on Moses; for it was not, as some among the unlearned perhaps fancy, any piece of linen cloth, or any skin that covered his face. But the apostle also takes care to make this plain to us, when he tells us that the veil is put on in the reading of the Old Testament, inasmuch as they who are called Israel from olden time still look for the coming of Christ, and perceive not that the princes have been wanting from Judah, and the leaders from his thighs; as even at present we see them in subjection to kings and princes, and paying tribute to these, without having any power left to them either of judgment or of punishment, such as Judah certainly had, for after he had condemned Thamar, he was able also to justify her.[fn-37-P3797_1068629:514-nf] \"But you will also see your life hang (in doubt) before your eyes.\"[fn-37-P3798_1068824:515-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":49,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_87_epistle_lxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-05","text":"6.

As to Jeconias, whom the prophet Jeremiah declares in these words to have been rejected from the land of Judah, \"Jeconias was dishonoured like a vessel for which there is no more use; and because he was cast out he and his seed; and none shall rise from his seed sitting upon the throne of David and ruling in Judah,\"[fn-55-P5513_1735607:17-nf] the matter is plain and clear. On the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, the kingdom had been destroyed, and there was no longer an hereditary succession of reigns as before. Nevertheless, at that time, the deposed descendants of David were living in captivity. On the return of Salathiel and Zerubbabel i the supreme government rested to a greater degree with the people, and the sovereignty was afterwards transferred to the priesthood, on account of the intermingling of the priestly and royal tribes; whence the Lord, in things pertaining, to God, is both King and High Priest. Moreover, the royal tribe did not fail until the coming of the Christ; nevertheless, the seed of Jeconias sat no longer upon the throne of David. Plainly it is the royal dignity which is described by the term \"throne.\" You remember the history, how all Judaea, Idumaea, Moab. both the neighbouring regions of Syria and the further countries up to Mesopotamia, and the country on the other side as far as the river of Egypt, were all tributary to David. If then none of his descendants appeared with a sovereignty so wide, how is not the word of the prophet true that no one of the seed of Jeconias should any longer sit upon the throne of David, for none of his descendants appears to have attained this dignity. Nevertheless, the tribe of Judah did not fail, until He for whom it was destined came. But even He did not sit upon the material throne. The kingdom of Judaea was transferred to Herod, the son of Antipater the Ascalonite, and his sons who divided Judaea into four principalities, when Pilate was Procurator and Tiberius was Master of the Roman Empire. It is the indestructible kingdom which he calls the throne of David on which the Lord sat. He is the expectation of the Gentiles[fn-55-P5514_1737420:18-nf] and not of the smallest division of the world, for it is written, \"In that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek.\"[fn-55-P5515_1737629:19-nf] \"I have called thee ...for a covenant of the people for a light of the Gentiles \";[fn-55-P5516_1737778:20-nf] and thus then God remained a priest although He did not receive the sceptre of Judah, and King of all the earth; so the blessing of Jacob was fulfilled, and in Him[fn-55-P5517_1737981:21-nf] \"shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,\" and all the nations shall call the Christ blessed.","title":"Letter CCXXXVI.","author":"St. Basil"}]
