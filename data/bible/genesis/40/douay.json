{"verses":["After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the\nbaker of the king of Egypt, offended their lord.","And Pharao being angry with them, (now the one was chief butler,\nthe other chief baker,)","He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in\nwhich Joseph also was prisoner.","But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he\nserved them.  Some little time passed, and they were kept in custody.","And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the\ninterpretation agreeing to themselves:","And when Joseph was come into them in the morning, and saw them\nsad,","He asked them, saying:  Why is your countenance sadder today than\nusual?","They answered:  We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to\ninterpret it to us.  And Joseph said to them:  Doth not interpretation\nbelong to God?  Tell me what you have dreamed:","The chief butler first told his dream:  I saw before me a vine,","On which were three branches, which by little and little sent\nout buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes:","And the cup of Pharao was in my hand:  and I took the grapes, and\npressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.","Joseph answered:  This is the interpretation of the dream:  The\nthree branches, are yet three days:","After which Pharao will remember thy service, and will restore\nthee to thy former place:  and thou shalt present him the cup according\nto thy office, as before thou was wont to do.","Only remember me when it shall be well with thee, and do me this\nkindness:  to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison:","For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here\nwithout any fault was cast into the dungeon.","The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream,\nsaid:  I also dreamed a dream, That I had three baskets of meal upon my\nhead:","And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats\nthat are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.","Joseph answered:  This is the interpretation of the dream:  The\nthree baskets, are yet three days:","After which Pharao will take thy head from thee, and hang thee\non a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh.","The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao:  and he made\na great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief\nbutler, and the chief baker.","And he restored the one to his place, to present him the cup:","The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of the\ninterpreter might be shewn.","But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his\ninterpreter."]}
