{"verses":["After two years Pharao had a dream.  He thought he stood by the\nriver,","Out of which came up seven kine, very beautiful and fat:  and they\nfed in marshy places.","Other seven also came up out of the river, ill-favoured, and lean\nfleshed:  and they fed on the very bank of the river, in green places:","And they devoured them, whose bodies were very beautiful and well\nconditioned.  So Pharao awoke.","He slept again, and dreamed another dream:  Seven ears of corn\ncame up upon one stalk full and fair:","Then seven other ears sprung up thin and blasted,","And devoured all the beauty of the former.  Pharao awaked after\nhis rest:","And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he sent to all\nthe interpreters of Egypt, and to all the wise men:  and they being\ncalled for, he told them his dream, and there was not any one that\ncould interpret it.","Then at length the chief butler remembering, said:  I confess my\nsin:","The king being angry with his servants, commanded me and the\nchief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers.","Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream foreboding things\nto come.","There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the same\ncaptain of the soldiers:  to whom we told our dreams,","And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be\nso.  For I was restored to my office:  and he was hanged upon a gibbet.","Forthwith at the king's command Joseph was brought out of the\nprison, and they shaved him:  and changing his apparel brought him in to\nhim.","And he said to him:  I have dreamed dreams, and there is no one\nthat can expound them:  Now I have heard that thou art very wise at\ninterpreting them:","Joseph answered:  Without me, God shall give Pharao a prosperous\nanswer.","So Pharao told what he had dreamed:  Methought I stood upon the\nbank of the river,","And seven kine came up out of the river, exceeding beautiful and\nfull of flesh:  and they grazed on green places in a marshy pasture.","And behold, there followed these, other seven kine, so very\nill-favoured and lean, that I never saw the like in the land of Egypt:","And they devoured and consumed the former,","And yet gave no mark of their being full:  but were as lean and\nill-favoured as before.  I awoke, and then fell asleep again,","And dreamed a dream:  Seven ears of corn grew up upon one stalk,\nfull and very fair.","Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the stalk:","And they devoured the beauty of the former:  I told this dream to\nthe conjecturers, and there is no man that can expound it.","Joseph answered:  The king's dream is one:  God hath shewn to\nPharao what he is about to do.","The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears, are seven\nyears of plenty:  and both contain the same meaning of the dream.","And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after them, and\nthe seven thin ears that were blasted with the burning wind, are seven\nyears of famine to come:","Which shall be fulfilled in this order.","Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty in the\nwhole land of Egypt:","After which shall follow other seven years of so great scarcity,\nthat all the abundance before shall be forgotten:  for the famine shall\nconsume all the land,","And the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the greatness of\nthe plenty.","And for that thou didst see the second time a dream pertaining\nto the same thing:  it is a token of the certainty, and that the word of\nGod cometh to pass, and is fulfilled speedily.","Now therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man,\nand make him ruler over the land of Egypt:","That he may appoint overseers over all the countries:  and gather\ninto barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the seven fruitful\nyears,","That shall now presently ensue:  and let all the corn be laid up,\nunder Pharao's hands, and be reserved in the cities.","And let it be in readiness, against the famine of seven years to\ncome, which shall oppress Egypt, and the land shall not be consumed\nwith scarcity.","The counsel pleased Pharao, and all his servants.","And he said to them:  Can we find such another man, that is full\nof the spirit of God?","He said therefore to Joseph:  Seeing God hath shewn thee all that\nthou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?","Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment of thy mouth\nall the people shall obey:  only in the kingly throne will I be above\nthee.","And again Pharao said to Joseph:  Behold, I have appointed thee\nover the whole land of Egypt.","And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it into his\nhand:  and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a chain of gold about\nhis neck.","And he made him go up into his second chariot, the crier\nproclaiming that all should bow their knee before him, and that they\nshould know he was made governor over the whole land of Egypt.","And the king said to Joseph:  I am Pharao:  without thy\ncommandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.","And he turned his name, and called him in the Egyptian tongue\nthe saviour of the world.  And he gave him to wife Aseneth, the daughter\nof Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis.  Then Joseph went out to the land of\nEgypt.","(Now he was thirty years old when he stood before king Pharao),\nand he went round all the countries of Egypt.","And the fruitfulness of the seven years came:  and the corn being\nbound up into sheaves, was gathered together into the barns of Egypt.","And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.","And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it was equal to\nthe sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded measure.","And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born:  whom\nAseneth, the daughter of Putiphare, priest of Heliopolis, bore unto\nhim.","And he called the name of the firstborn Manasses, saying:  God\nhath made me to forget all my labours, and my father's house.","And he named the second Ephraim, saying:  God hath made me to\ngrow in the land of my poverty.","Now when the seven years of plenty that had been in Egypt were\npassed:","The seven years of scarcity, which Joseph had foretold, began to\ncome:  and the famine prevailed in the whole world, but there was bread\nin all the land of Egypt.","And when there also they began to be famished, the people cried\nto Pharao, for food.  And he said to them:  Go to Joseph:  and do all\nthat he shall say to you.","And the famine increased daily in all the land:  and Joseph\nopened all the barns, and sold to the Egyptians:  for the famine had\noppressed them also.","And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy food, and to seek some\nrelief of their want."]}
