{"verses":["And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan, wherein his father\nsojourned.","And these are his generations:  Joseph, when he was sixteen years\nold, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being but a boy:  and he\nwas with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father's wives:  and he\naccused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.","Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in\nhis old age:  and he made him a coat of divers colours.","And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more\nthan all his sons, hated hem, and could not speak peaceably to him.","Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream, that he\nhad dreamed:  which occasioned them to hate him the more.","And he said to them:  Hear my dream which I dreamed.","I thought we were binding sheaves in the field:  and my sheaf\narose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about bowed down\nbefore my sheaf.","His brethren answered:  Shalt thou be our king?  or shall we be\nsubject to thy dominion?  Therefore this matter of his dreams and words\nministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.","He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren,\nsaying:  I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven\nstars worshipping me.","And when he had told this to his father, and brethren, his\nfather rebuked him and said:  What meaneth this dream that thou hast\ndreamed?  shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren worship thee upon the\nearth?","His brethren therefore envied him:  but his father considered the\nthing with himself.","And when his brethren abode in Sechem, feeding their father's\nflocks,","Israel said to him:  Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem:  come,\nI will send thee to them.  And when he answered:","I am ready:  he said to him:  Go, and see if all things be well\nwith thy brethren, and the cattle:  and bring me word again what is\ndoing.  So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:","And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what\nhe sought.","But he answered:  I seek my brethren, tell me where they feed the\nflocks.","And the man said to him:  They are departed from this place:  for\nI heard them say:  Let us go to Dothain.  And Joseph went forward after\nhis brethren, and found them in Dothain.","And when they saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, they\nthought to kill him:","And said one to another:  Behold the dreamer cometh.","Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit:  and we\nwill say:  Some evil beast hath devoured him:  and then it shall appear\nwhat his dreams avail him:","And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their\nhands, and said:","Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood:  but cast him into\nthis pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless:  now\nhe said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to\nrestore him to his father.","And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript\nhim of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:","And cast him into an old pit where there was not water.","And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their\nway coming from Galaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm,\nand myrrh to Egypt.","And Juda said to his brethren:  What will it profit us to kill\nour brother, and conceal his blood?","It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our\nhands be not defiled:  for he is our brother and our flesh.  His brethren\nagreed to his words.","And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of\nthe pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver:\nand they led him into Egypt.","And Ruben returning to the pit, found not the boy:","And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said:  The\nboy doth not appear, and whither shall I go?","And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid,\nwhich they had killed:","Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say:  This we\nhave found:  see whether it be thy son's coat, or not.","And the father acknowledging it, said:  It is my son's coat, an\nevil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.","And tearing his garments, he put on sackcloth, mourning for his\nson a long time.","And all his children being gathered together to comfort their\nfather in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said:  I will go\ndown to my son into hell, mourning.  And whilst he continued weeping,","The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an eunuch of\nPharao, captain of the soldiers."]}
