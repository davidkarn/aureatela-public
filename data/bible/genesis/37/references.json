Why should I not mourn, you say? Jacob lint on sackcloth for Joseph, and when all his family gathered round him, refused to be comforted. \"I will go down,\" he said, \"into the grave unto my son mourning.\"[fn-12-P1230_263754:826-nf] David also mourned for Absalom, covering his face, and crying: \"O my son, Absalom ...my son, Absalom! Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son!\"[fn-12-P1231_263929:827-nf] Moses,[fn-12-P1232_263961:828-nf] too, and Aaron,[fn-12-P1233_264000:829-nf] and the rest of the saints were mourned for with a solemn mourning. The answer to your reasoning issimple. Jacob, it is true, mourned for Joseph, whom he fancied slain, and thought tomeet only in the grave (his words were: \"I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning\"), but he only did so because Christ had not yet broken open the door of paradise, nor quenched with his blood the flaming sword and the whirling of the guardian cherubim.[fn-12-P1234_264466:830-nf] (Hence in the story of Dives and Lazarus, Abraham and the beggar, though really in a place of refreshment, are described as being in hell.[fn-12-P1235_264876:831-nf] ) And David, who, after interceding in vain for the life of his infant child, refused to weep for it, knowing that it had not sinned, did well to weep for a son who had been a parricide-in will, if not in deed.[fn-12-P1236_265121:832-nf] And when we read that, for Moses and Aaron, lamentation was made after ancient custom, this ought not to surprise us, for even in the Acts of the Apostles, in the full blaze of the gospel, we see that the brethren at Jerusalem made great lamentation for Stephen.[fn-12-P1237_265409:833-nf] This great lamentation, however, refers not to the mourners, but to the funeral procession and to the crowds which accompanied it. This is what the Scripture says of Jacob: \"Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, and all the house of Joseph and his brethren\"; and a few lines farther on: \"And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a great company.\" Finally, \"they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation.\"[fn-12-P1238_265980:834-nf] This solemn lamentation does not impose prolonged weeping upon the Egyptians, but simply describes the funeral ceremony. In like manner, when we read of weeping made for Moses and Aaron,[fn-12-P1239_266188:835-nf] this is all that is meant.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":37,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"518","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"4. As the brief compass of a letter does not suffer us to delay too long on a single point, let us now pass to those which remain. In explaining the testimony of the apostle, \"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise, also, the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife,\"[fn-15-P1544_349566:1054-nf] we have subjoined the following:[fn-15-P1545_349623:1055-nf] \"The entire question relates to those who are living in wedlock, whether it is lawful for them to put away their wives, a thing which the Lord also has forbidden in the Gospel.[fn-15-P1546_349824:1056-nf] Hence, also, the apostle says: `It is good for a man not to touch' a wife or `a woman,'[fn-15-P1547_349935:1057-nf] as if there were danger in the contact which he who should so touch one could not escape. Accordingly, when the Egyptian woman desired to touch Joseph he flung away his cloak and fled from her hands.[fn-15-P1548_350159:1058-nf] But as he who has once married a wife cannot, except by consent, abstain from intercourse with her or repudiate her, so long as she does not sin, he must render unto his wife her due,[fn-15-P1549_350384:1059-nf] because he has of his own free will bound himself to render it under compulsion.\" Can one who declares that it is a precept of the Lord that wives should not be put away, and that what God has joined together man must not, without consent, put asunder[fn-15-P1550_350665:1060-nf] -can such an one be said to condemn marriage? Again, in the verses which follow, the apostle says: \"But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.\"[fn-15-P1551_350879:1061-nf] In explanation of this saying we made the following remarks:[fn-15-P1552_350964:1062-nf] \"What I myself would wish, he says, is clear. But since there are diversities of gifts in the church,[fn-15-P1553_351090:1063-nf] I allow marriage as well, that I may not appear to condemn nature. Reflect, too, that the gift of virginity is one thing, that of marriage another. For had there been one reward for married women and for virgins he would never, after giving the counsel of continence, have gone on to say: `But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner and another after that.' Where each class has its proper gift, there must be some distinction between the classes. I allow that marriage, as well as virginity, is the gift of God, but there is a great difference between gift and gift. Finally, the apostle himself says of one who had lived in incest and afterwards repented: `Contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him,'[fn-15-P1554_351857:1064-nf] and `To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also.'[fn-15-P1555_351931:1065-nf] And, lest we might suppose a man's gift to be but a small thing, he has added: `For if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the sight[fn-15-P1556_352125:1066-nf] of Christ.'[fn-15-P1557_352157:1067-nf] The gifts of Christ are different. Hence Joseph as a type of Him had a coat of many colors.[fn-15-P1558_352273:1068-nf] So in the forty-fourth psalm[fn-15-P1559_352328:1069-nf] we read of the Church: `Upon thy right hand did stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colors.'[fn-15-P1560_352503:1070-nf] The apostle Peter, too, speaks (of husbands and wives) `as being heirs together of the manifold grace of God.'[fn-15-P1561_352643:1071-nf] In Greek the expression is still more striking, the word used being poiai/lh, that is, `many-colored.'\"","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":37,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"667","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"11.

These remarks are intended to shew that the youth of whom I speak used his kinship to the royal family, his abundant wealth, and the outward tokens of power, as helps to virtue. For, as the preacher says, \"wisdom is a defence and money is a defence\"[fn-33-P3314_871422:2402-nf] also. We must not hastily conclude that this statement conflicts with that of the Lord: \"verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven; and again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-33-P3315_871763:2403-nf] Were it so, the salvation of Zacchaeus the publican, described in scripture as a man of great wealth, would contradict the Lord's declaration. But that what is impossible with men is possible with God[fn-33-P3316_872003:2404-nf] we are taught by the counsel of the apostle who thus writes to Timothy:-\"charge them that are rich in this world that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy, that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute. willing to communicate, laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on the true life.\"[fn-33-P3317_872477:2405-nf] We have learned how a camel can pass through a needle's eye, how an animal with a hump on its back,[fn-33-P3318_872646:2406-nf] when it has laid down its packs, can take to itself the wings of a dove[fn-33-P3319_872781:2407-nf] and rest in the branches of the tree which has grown from a grain of mustard seed.[fn-33-P3320_872884:2408-nf] In Isaiah we read of camels, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah and Sheba, which carry gold and incense to the city of the Lord.[fn-33-P3321_873055:2409-nf] On like typical camels the Ishmaelitish merchantmen[fn-33-P3322_873128:2410-nf] bring down to the Egyptians perfume and incense and balm (of the kind that grows in Gilead good for the healing of wounds[fn-33-P3323_873276:2411-nf] ); and so fortunate are they that in the purchase and sale of Joseph they have for their merchandise the Saviour of the world.[fn-33-P3324_873427:2412-nf] And Aesop's fable tells us of a mouse which after eating its fill can no longer creep out as before it crept in.[fn-33-P3325_873642:2413-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":37,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"911","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"5.

Again though he was the friend, companion, and cousin of princes and had been educated along with them-a thing which makes even strangers intimate-he did not allow pride to inflate him or frown with contempt upon others who were less fortunate than he: no, he was kind to all, and while he loved the princes as brothers he revered them as sovereigns. He used to avow that his own health and safety were dependent upon theirs. Their attendants and all those officers of the palace who by their numbers add to the grandeur of the imperial court he had so well conciliated by shewing his regard for them, that men who were in reality inferior to him were led by his attention to believe themselves his peers. It is no easy task to throw one's rank into the shade by one's virtue, or to gain the affection of men who are forced to yield you precedence. What widow was not supported by his help? What ward did not find in him a father? To him the bishops of the entire East used to bring the prayers of the unfortunate and the petitions of the distressed.

There immediately follows: \"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.\" Moses, moreover, only saw the land of promise; he could not enter: and[fn-62-P6289_1923605:134-nf] \"he died in the land of Moab, and the Lord buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.\" Let us compare the burial of the two: Moses died in the land of Moab, Joshua in the land of Judaea. The former was buried in a valley over against the house of Phogor, which is, being interpreted, reproach (for the Hebrew Phogor corresponds to Priapus[fn-62-P6290_1924044:135-nf] ); the latter in Mount Ephraim on the north of Mount Gaash.

But we who fight under Joshua our leader, even to the present day know not where Moses was buried. For we despise Phogor, and all his shame, knowing that they who are in the flesh cannot please God.

And assuredly, if we were now in the enjoyment of the true and perfect happiness that lies before us, we should not be subject to any deception through any sense, whether of body or of mind.","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":37,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_19_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"24.

For in one way we love our parents, in another our wives, in another our brothers, in another our children, and there is a wide difference in regard to the claims of these feelings of affection, nor is the love of parents towards their children always equal. As is shown by the case of the patriarch Jacob, who, though he was the father of twelve sons and loved them all with a father's love, yet loved Joseph with deeper affection, as Scripture clearly shows: \"But his brethren envied him, because his father loved him;\"[fn-57-P5740_2040288:22-nf] evidently not that that good man his father failed in greatly loving the rest of his children, but that in his affection he clung to this one, because he was a type of the Lord, more tenderly and indulgently. This also, we read, was very clearly shown in the case of John the Evangelist, where these words are used of him: \"that disciple whom Jesus loved,\"[fn-57-P5741_2040666:23-nf] though certainly He embraced all the other eleven, whom He had chosen in the same way, with His special love, as this He shows also by the witness of the gospel, where He says: \"As I have loved you, so do ye also love one another;\" of whom elsewhere also it is said: \"Loving His own who were in the world, He loved them even to the end.\"[fn-57-P5742_2041027:24-nf] But this love of one in particular did not indicate any coldness in love for the rest of the disciples, but only a fuller and more abundant love towards the one, which his prerogative of virginity and the purity of his flesh bestowed upon him. And therefore it is marked by exceptional treatment, as being something more sublime, because no hateful comparison with others, but a richer grace of superabundant love singled it out. Some-thing of this sort too we have in the character of the bride in the Song of Songs, where she says: \"Set in order love in me.\"[fn-57-P5743_2041609:25-nf] For this is true love set in order, which, while it hates no one, yet loves some still more by reason of their deserving it, and which, while it loves all in general, singles out for itself some from those, whom it may embrace with a special affection, and again among those, who are the special and chief objects of its love, singles out some who are preferred to others in affection.","title":"XVI. The First Conference of Abbot Joseph.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":37,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_70_xviii_conference_of_abbot_piamun_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"A Twofold reason however led me to relate this fact, first that we may weigh this steadfastness and constancy of the man, and as we are attacked by less serious wiles of the enemy, may the better secure a greater feeling of calmness and patience, secondly that we may with resolute decision hold that we cannot be safe from the storms of temptation and assaults of the devil if we make all the protection for our patience and all our confidence consist not in the strength of our inner man but in the doors of our cell or the recesses of the desert, and companionship of the saints, or the safeguard of anything else outside us. For unless our mind is strengthened by the power of His protection Who says in the gospel \"the kingdom of God is within you,\"[fn-61-P6111_2175480:23-nf] in vain do we fancy that we can defeat the plots of our airy foe by the aid of men who are living with us, or that we can avoid them by distance of place, or exclude them by the protection of walls. For though none of these things was wanting to Saint Paphnutius yet the tempter did not fail to find a way of access against him to attack him; nor did the encircling walls, or the solitude of the desert or the merits of all those saints in the congregation repulse that most foul spirit. But because the holy servant of God had fixed the hope of his heart not on those external things but on Him Who is the judge of all secrets, he could not be moved even by the machinations of such an assault as that. On the other hand did not the man whom envy had hurried into so grievous a sin enjoy the benefit of solitude and the protection of a retired dwelling, and intercourse with the blessed Abbot and Presbyter Isidore and other saints? And yet because the storm raised by the devil found him upon the sand, it not only drove in his house but actually overturned it. We need not then seek for our peace in externals, nor fancy that another person's patience can be of any use to the faults of our impatience. For just as \"the kingdom of God is within you,\" so \"a man's foes are they of his own household.\"[fn-61-P6112_2176806:24-nf] For no one is more my enemy than my own heart which is truly the one of my household closest to me. And therefore if we are careful, we cannot possibly be injured by intestine enemies. For where those of our own household are not opposed to us, there also the kingdom of God is secured in peace of heart. For if you diligently investigate the matter, I cannot be injured by any man however spiteful, if I do not fight against myself with warlike heart. But if I am injured, the fault is not owing to the other's attack, but to my own impatience. For as strong and solid food is good for a man in good health, so it is bad for a sick one. But it cannot hurt the man who takes it, unless the weakness of its recipient gives it its power to hurt. If then any similar temptation ever arises among brethren, we need never be shaken out of the even tenor of our ways and give an opening to the blasphemous snarls of men living in the world, nor wonder that some bad and detestable men have secretly found their way into the number of the saints, because so long as we are trodden down and trampled in the threshing floor of this world, the chaff which is destined for eternal fire is quite sure to be mingled with the choicest of the wheat. Finally if we bear in mind that Satan was chosen among the angels, and Judas among the apostles, and Nicholas the author of a detestable heresy among the deacons, it will be no wonder that the basest of men are found among the ranks of the saints. For although some maintain that this Nicholas was not the same man who was chosen for the work of the ministry by the Apostles,[fn-61-P6113_2178439:25-nf] nevertheless they cannot deny that he was of the number of the disciples, all of whom were clearly of such a character and so perfect as those few whom we can now with difficulty discover in the coenobia. Let us then bring forward not the fall of the above-mentioned brother, who fell in the desert with so grievous a collapse, nor that horrible stain which he afterwards wiped out by the copious tears of his penitence, but the example of the blessed Paphnutius; and let us not be destroyed by the ruin of the former, whose ingrained sin of envy was increased and made worse by his affected piety, but let us imitate with all our might the humility of the latter, which in his case was no sudden production of the quiet of the desert, but had been gained among men, and was consummated and perfected by solitude. However you should know that the evil of envy is harder to be cured than other faults, for I should almost say that a man whom it has once tainted with the mischief of its poison is without a remedy. For it is the plague of which it is figuratively said by the prophet: \"Behold I will send among you serpents, basilisks, against which there is no charm: and they shall bite you.\"[fn-61-P6114_2180237:26-nf] Rightly then are the stings of envy compared by the prophet to the deadly poison of basilisks, as by it the first author of all poisons and their chief perished and died. For he slew himself before him of whom he was envious, and destroyed himself before that he poured forth the poison of death against man: for \"by the envy of the devil death entered into the world: they therefore who are on his side follow him.\"[fn-61-P6115_2180674:27-nf] For just as he who was the first to be corrupted by the plague of that evil, admitted no remedy of penitence, nor any healing plaster, so those also who have given themselves up to be smitten by the same pricks, exclude all the aid of the sacred charmer, because as they are tormented not by the faults but by the prosperity of those of whom they are jealous, they are ashamed to display the real truth and look out for some external unnecessary and trifling causes of offence: and of these, because they are altogether false, vain is the hope of cure, while the deadly poison which they will not produce is lurking in their veins. Of which the wisest of men has fitly said: \"If a serpent bite without hissing, there is no supply for the charmer.\"[fn-61-P6116_2181444:28-nf] For those are silent bites, to which alone the medicine of the wise is no succour. For that evil is so far incurable that it is made worse by attentions, it is increased by services, is irritated by presents, because as the same Solomon says: \"envy endures nothing.\"[fn-61-P6117_2181728:29-nf] For just in proportion as another has made progress in humble submission or in the virtue of patience or in the merit of munificence, so is a man excited by worse pricks of envy, because he desires nothing less than the ruin or death of the man whom he envies. Lastly no submission on the part of their harmless brother could soften the envy of the eleven patriarchs, so that Scripture relates of them: \"But his brothers envied him because his father loved him, and they could not speak peaceably unto him\"[fn-61-P6118_2182256:30-nf] until their jealousy, which would not listen to any entreaties on the part of their obedient and submissive brother, desired his death, and would scarcely be satisfied with the sin of selling a brother. It is plain then thatenvy is worse than all faults, and harder to get rid of, as it is inflamed by those remedies by which the others are destroyed. For, for example, a man who is grieved by a loss that has been caused to him, is healed by a liberal compensation: one who is sore owing to a wrong done to him, is appeased by humble satisfaction being made. What can you do with one who is the more offended by the very fact that he sees you humbler and kinder, who is not aroused to anger by any greed which can be appeased by a bribe; or by any injurious attack or love of vengeance, which is overcome by obsequious services; but is only irritated by another's success and happiness? But who is there who in order to satisfy one who envies him, would wish to fall from his good fortune, or to lose his prosperity or to be involved in some calamity? Wherefore we must constantly implore the divine aid, to which nothing is impossible, in order that the serpent may not by a single bite of this evil destroy whatever is flourishing in us, and animated as it were by the life and quickening power of the Holy Ghost. For the other poisons of serpents, i.e., carnal sins and faults, in which human frailty is easily entangled and from which it is as easily purified, show some traces of their wounds in the flesh, whereby although the earthly body is most dangerously inflamed, yet if any charmer well skilled in divine incantations applies a cure and antidote or the remedy of words of salvation, the poisonous evil does not reach to the everlasting death of the soul. But the poison of envy as if emitted by the basilisk, destroys the very life of religion and faith, even before the wound is perceived in the body. For he does not raise himself up against men, but, in his blasphemy, against God, who carps at nothing in his brother except his felicity, and so blames no fault of man, but simply the judgment of God. This then is that \"root of bitterness springing up\"[fn-61-P6119_2184449:31-nf] which raises itself to heaven and tends to reproaching the very Author Who bestows good things on man. Nor shall anyone be disturbed because God threatens to send \"serpents, basilisks,\"[fn-61-P6120_2184654:32-nf] to bite those by whose crimes He is offended. For although it is certain that God cannot be the author of envy, yet it is fair and worthy of the divine judgment that, while good gifts are bestowed on the humble and refused to the proud and reprobate, those who, as the Apostle says, deserve to be given over \"to a reprobate mind,\"[fn-61-P6121_2185005:33-nf] should be smitten and consumed by envy sent as it were by Him, according to this passage: \"They have provoked me to jealousy by them that are no gods: and I will provoke them to jealousy by them that are no nation.\"[fn-61-P6122_2185238:34-nf] ","title":"XVIII.
