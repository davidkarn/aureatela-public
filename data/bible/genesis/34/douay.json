{"verses":["And Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see the women of that\ncountry.","And when Sichem the son of Hemor the Hevite, the prince of that\nland, saw her, he was in love with her:  and took her away, and lay with\nher, ravishing the virgin.","And his soul was fast knit unto her; and whereas she was sad, he\ncomforted her with sweet words.","And going to Hemor his father, he said:  Get me this damsel to\nwife.","But when Jacob had heard this, his sons being absent, and\nemployed in feeding the cattle, he held his peace till they came back.","And when Hemor the father of Sichem was come out to speak to\nJacob,","Behold his sons came from the field:  and hearing what had passed,\nthey were exceeding angry, because he had done a foul thing in Israel,\nand committed an unlawful act, in ravishing Jacob's daughter.","And Hemor spoke to them:  The soul of my son Sichem has a longing\nfor your daughter:  give her him to wife:","And let us contract marriages one with another:  give us your\ndaughters, and take you our daughters.","And dwell with us:  the land is at your command, till, trade, and\npossess it.","Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren:  Let me find\nfavour in your sight, and whatsoever you shall appoint I will give:","Raise the dowry, and ask gifts, and I will gladly give what you\nshall demand:  only give me this damsel to wife.","The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his father deceitfully,\nbeing enraged at the deflowering of their sister:","We cannot do what you demand, nor give our sister to one that is\nuncircumcised; which with us is unlawful and abominable.","But in this we may be allied with you, if you will be like us,\nand all the male sex among you be circumcised:","Then will we mutually give and take your daughters, and ours;\nand we will dwell with you, and will be one people:","But if you will not be circumcised, we will take our daughter\nand depart.","Their offer pleased Hemor, and Sichem, his son:","And the young man made no delay, but forthwith fulfilled what\nwas required:  for he loved the damsel exceedingly, and he was the\ngreatest man in all his father's house.","And going into the gate of the city, they spoke to the people:","These men are peaceable, and are willing to dwell with us:  let\nthem trade in the land, and till it, which being large and wide wanteth\nmen to till it:  we shall take their daughters for wives, and we will\ngive them ours.","One thing there is for which so great a good is deferred:  We\nmust circumcise every male among us, following the manner of the\nnation.","And their substance, and cattle, and all that they possess,\nshall be ours; only in this let us condescend, and by dwelling\ntogether, we shall make one people.","And they all agreed, and circumcised all the males.","And behold the third day, when the pain of the wound was\ngreatest:  two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of\nDina, taking their swords, entered boldly into the city and slew all\nthe men.","And they killed also Hemor and Sichem, and took away their\nsister Dina out of Sichem's house.","And when they were gone out, the other sons of Jacob came upon\nthe slain; and plundered the city in revenge of the rape.","And they took their sheep, and their herds, and their asses,\nwasting all they had in their houses and in their fields.","And their children and wives they took captive.","And when they had boldly perpetrated these things, Jacob said to\nSimeon and Levi:  You have troubled me, and made me hateful to the\nChanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants of this land.  We are few:\nthey will gather themselves together and kill me; and both I, and my\nhouse shall be destroyed.","They answered:  Should they abuse our sister as a strumpet?"]}
