{"verses":["Abraham removed from thence to the south country, and dwelt\nbetween Cades and Sur, and sojourned in Gerara.","And he said of Sara his wife:  She is my sister.  So Abimelech the\nking of Gerara sent, and took her.","And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and he said to\nhim:  Lo thou shalt die for the woman that thou hast taken:  for she hath\na husband.","Now Abimelech had not touched her, and he said:  Lord, wilt thou\nslay a nation that is ignorant and just?","Did not he say to me:  She is my sister:  and she say, He is my\nbrother?  in the simplicity of my heart, and cleanness of my hands have\nI done this.","And God said to him:  And I know that thou didst it with a sincere\nheart:  and therefore I withheld thee from sinning against me, and I\nsuffered thee not to touch her.","Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet:  and\nhe shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live:  but if thou wilt not\nrestore her, know that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are\nthine.","And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the night, called all his\nservants:  and spoke all these words in their hearing, and all the men\nwere exceedingly afraid.","And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and said to him:  What hast\nthou done to us?  what have we offended thee in, that thou hast brought\nupon me and upon my kingdom a great sin?  thou hast done to us what thou\noughtest not to do.","And again he expostulated with him, and said:  What sawest thou,\nthat thou hast done this?","Abraham answered:  I thought with myself, saying:  Perhaps there\nis not the fear of God in this place:  and they will kill me for the\nsake of my wife:","Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my sister, the daughter of\nmy father, and not the daughter of my mother, and I took her to wife.","And after God brought me out of my father's house, I said to\nher:  Thou shalt do me this kindness:  In every place, to which we shall\ncome, thou shalt say that I am thy brother.","And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids,\nand gave to Abraham:  and restored to him Sara his wife,","And said:  The land is before you, dwell wheresoever it shall\nplease thee.","And to Sara he said:  Behold I have given thy brother a thousand\npieces of silver, this shall serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to\nall that are with thee, and whithersoever thou shalt go:  and remember\nthou wast taken.","And when Abraham prayed, God healed Abimelech and his wife, and\nhis handmaids, and they bore children:","For the Lord had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech,\non account of Sara, Abraham's wife."]}
