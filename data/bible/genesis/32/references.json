Circumcise yourselves to the Lord your God, and take away the foreskins of your heart, lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it.\" Also Moses himself says:[fn-14-P1443_600547:226-nf] \"In the last days the Lord shall circumcise thine heart to love the Lord thy God.\" Also Jesus[fn-14-P1444_600662:227-nf] the son of Nun, his successor, said: \"And the Lord said unto Jesus, Make thee knives of flint very sharp, and sit and circumcise the children of Israel the second time.\" He said that this second circumcision would be not of the flesh, as the first was, which the Jews practise even now, but of the heart and spirit, which was delivered by Christ, who was the true Jesus. For the prophet does not say, \"And the Lord said unto me,\" but \"unto Jesus,\" that he might show that God was not speaking of him, but of Christ, to whom God was then speaking. For that Jesus represented[fn-14-P1445_601273:228-nf] Christ: for when he was at first called Auses,[fn-14-P1446_601385:229-nf] Moses, foreseeing the future, ordered that he should be called Jesus; that since he had been chosen as the leader of the warfare against Amalek, who was the enemy of the children of Israel, he might both subdue the adversary by the emblem[fn-14-P1447_601953:230-nf] of the name, and lead the people into the land of promise. And for this reason he was also successor to Moses, to show that the new law given by Christ Jesus was about to succeed to the old law which was given by Moses. For that circumcision of the flesh is plainly irrational; since, if God had so willed it, He might so have formed man from the beginning, that he should be without a foreskin. But it was a figure of this second circumcision, signifying that the breast is to be laid bare; that is, that we ought to live with an open and simple heart, since that part of the body which is circumcised has a kind of resemblance to the heart, and is to be treated with reverence. On this account God ordered that it should be laid bare, that by this argument He might admonish us not to have our breast hidden[fn-14-P1448_602929:231-nf] in obscurity; that is, not to veil any shameful deed within the secrets of conscience. This is the circumcision of the heart of which the prophets speak, which God transferred from the mortal flesh to the soul, which alone is about to endure. For being desirous of promoting our life and salvation in accordance with His own goodness, in that circumcision He hath set before us repentance, that if we lay open our hearts,-that is if we confess our sins and make satisfaction to God,-we shall obtain pardon, which is denied to those who are obstinate and conceal their faults, by Him who regards not the outward appearance, as man does, but the innermost secrets of the heart.[fn-14-P1449_603727:232-nf] ","title":"Book IV.

Do we wish to know what widows ought to be? Let us read the gospel according to Luke. \"There was one Anna,\" he says, \"a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Aser.\"[fn-22-P2253_559177:1602-nf] The meaning of the name Anna is grace. Phanuel is in our tongue the face of God. Aser may be translated either as blessedness or as wealth. From her youth up to the age of fourscore and four years she had borne the burden of widowhood, not departing from the temple and giving herself to fastings and prayers night and day; therefore she earned spiritual grace, received the title `daughter of the face of God,'[fn-22-P2254_559611:1603-nf] and obtained a share in the `blessedness and wealth'[fn-22-P2255_559736:1604-nf] which belonged to her ancestry. Let us recall to mind the widow of Zarephath[fn-22-P2256_559857:1605-nf] who thought more of satisfying Elijah's hunger than of preserving her own life and that of her son. Though she believed that she and he must die that very night unless they had food, she determined that her guest should survive. She preferred to sacrifice her life rather than to neglect the duty of almsgiving. In her handful of meal she found the seed from which she was to reap a harvest sent her by the Lord. She sows her meal and lo! a cruse of oil comes from it. In the land of Judah grain was scarce for the corn of wheat had died there;[fn-22-P2257_560422:1606-nf] but in the house of a heathen widow oil flowed in streams. In the book of Judith-if any one is of opinion that it should be received as canonical-we read of a widow wasted with fasting and wearing the sombre garb of a mourner, whose outward squalor indicated not so much the regret which she felt for her dead husband as the temper[fn-22-P2258_560777:1607-nf] in which she looked forward to the coming of the Bridegroom. I see her hand armed with the sword and stained with blood. I recognize the head of Holofernes which she has carried away from the camp of the enemy. Here a woman vanquishes men, and chastity beheads lust. Quickly changing her garb, she puts on once more in the hour of victory her own mean dress finer than all the splendours of the world.[fn-22-P2259_561213:1608-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":32,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1288","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Jacob in his flight from his brother left behind in his father's house great riches and made his way with nothing into Mesopotamia.

But it is now time for us to raise the standard of Joshua's chastity. It is written that Moses had a wife. Now Moses is interpreted both by our Lord and by the Apostle to mean the law:[fn-62-P6279_1921028:124-nf] \"They have Moses and the prophets.\" And[fn-62-P6280_1921092:125-nf] \"Death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression.\" And no one doubts that in both passages Moses signifies the law. We read that Moses, that is the law, had a wife: shew me then in the same way that Joshua the son of Nun had either wife or children, and if you can do so, I will confess that I am beaten. He certainly received the fairest spot in the division of the land of Judah, and died, not in the twenties, which are ever unlucky in Scripture-by them are reckoned the years of[fn-62-P6281_1921661:126-nf] Jacob's service,[fn-62-P6282_1921700:127-nf] the price of Joseph, and[fn-62-P6283_1921749:128-nf] sundry presents which Esau who was fond of them received-but in the[fn-62-P6284_1921840:129-nf] tens, whose praises we have often sung; and he was buried in[fn-62-P6285_1921961:130-nf] Thamnath Sare, that is, most perfect sovereignty, or among those of a new covering, to signify the crowds of virgins, covered by the Saviour's aid on Mount Ephraim, that is, the fruitful mountain; on the north of the Mountain of Gaash, which is, being interpreted, disturbance: for[fn-62-P6286_1922757:131-nf] \"Mount Sion is on the sides of the north, the city of the Great King,\" is ever exposed to hatred, and in every trial says[fn-62-P6287_1922955:132-nf] \"But my feet had well nigh slipped.\" The book which bears the name of Joshua ends with his burial. Again in the book of Judges we read of him as though he had risen and come to life again, and by way of summary his works are extolled. We read too[fn-62-P6288_1923224:133-nf] \"So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance, that they might possess the land.\" And \"Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua,\" and so on. There immediately follows: \"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.\" Moses, moreover, only saw the land of promise; he could not enter: and[fn-62-P6289_1923605:134-nf] \"he died in the land of Moab, and the Lord buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.\" Let us compare the burial of the two: Moses died in the land of Moab, Joshua in the land of Judaea. The former was buried in a valley over against the house of Phogor, which is, being interpreted, reproach (for the Hebrew Phogor corresponds to Priapus[fn-62-P6290_1924044:135-nf] ); the latter in Mount Ephraim on the north of Mount Gaash. And in the simple expressions of the sacred Scriptures there is always a more subtle meaning. The Jews gloried in children and child-bearing; and the barren woman, who had not offspring in Israel, was accursed; but blessed was he whose seed was in Sion, and his family in Jerusalem; and part of the highest blessing was,[fn-62-P6291_1924564:136-nf] \"Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thy house, thy children like olive plants, round about thy table.\" Therefore his grave is described as placed in a valley over against the house of an idol which was in a special sense consecrated to lust. But we who fight under Joshua our leader, even to the present day know not where Moses was buried. For we despise Phogor, and all his shame, knowing that they who are in the flesh cannot please God. And the Lord before the flood had said[fn-62-P6292_1925097:137-nf] \"My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh.\" Wherefore, when Moses died, the people of Israel mourned for him; but Joshua like one on his way to victory was unmourned. For marriage ends at death; virginity thereafter begins to wear the crown.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":32,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_22_book_xvi","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"143","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"As I said a little ago, Jacob was also called Israel, the name which was most prevalent among the people descended from him.

The impudence, therefore, of Marcion's Christ will be evident, when he says that many will come in his name, whereas this name does not at all belong to him, since he is not the Christ and Jesus of the Creator, to whom these names do properly appertain; and more especially when he prohibits those to be received whose very equal in imposture he is, inasmuch as he (equally with them[fn-68-P6888_2005048:1535-nf] ) comes in a name which belongs to another-unless it was his business to warn off from a mendaciously assumed name the disciples (of One) who, by reason of His name being properly given to Him, possessed also the verity thereof.

For He affirms thai these appointments of His must fully come to pass; but surely as the good God, He would have frustrated rather than advanced events so sad and terrible, if they had not been His own (decrees). \"But before all these,\" He foretells that persecutions and sufferings were to come upon them, which indeed were \"to turn for a testimony to them,\" and for their salvation.[fn-68-P6893_2006846:1540-nf] Hear what is predicted in Zechariah: \"The Lord of hosts[fn-68-P6894_2006926:1541-nf] shall protect them; and they shall devour them, and subdue them with sling-stones; and they shall drink their blood like wine, and they shall fill the bowls as it were of the altar. And the Lord shall save them in that day, even His people, like sheep; because as sacred stones they roll,\"[fn-68-P6895_2007273:1542-nf] etc. And that you may not suppose that these predictions refer to such sufferings as await them from so many wars with strangers,[fn-68-P6896_2007443:1543-nf] consider the nature (of the sufferings). In a prophecy of wars which were to be waged with legitimate arms, no one would think of enumerating stones as weapons, which are better known in popular crowds and unarmed tumults. Nobody measures the copious streams of blood which flow in war by bowlfuls, nor limits it to what is shed upon a single altar. No one gives the name of sheep to those who fall in battle with arms in hand, and while repelling force with force, but only to those who are slain, yielding themselves up in their own place of duty and with patience, rather than fighting in self-defence. In short, as he says, \"they roll as sacred stones,\" and not like soldiers fight. Stones are they, even foundation stones, upon which we are ourselves edified-\"built,\" as St. Paul says, \"upon the foundation of the apostles,\"[fn-68-P6897_2008294:1544-nf] who, like \"consecrated stones,\" were rolled up and down exposed to the attack of all men. And therefore in this passage He forbids men \"to meditate before what they answer\" when brought before tribunals,[fn-68-P6898_2008520:1545-nf] even as once He suggested to Balaam the message which he had not thought of,[fn-68-P6899_2008623:1546-nf] nay, contrary to what he had thought; and promised \"a mouth\" to Moses, when he pleaded in excuse the slowness of his speech,[fn-69-P6900_2008774:1547-nf] and that wisdom which, by Isaiah, He showed to be irresistible: \"One shall say, I am the Lord's, and shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe himself by the name of lsrµl.\"[fn-69-P6901_2008999:1548-nf] Now, what plea is wiser and more irresistible than the simple and open\"[fn-69-P6902_2009094:1549-nf] confession made in a martyr's cause, who \"prevails with God\"-which is what \"Israel\" means?[fn-69-P6903_2009202:1550-nf] Now, one cannot wonder that He forbade \"premeditation,\" who actually Himself received from the Father the ability of uttering words in season: \"The Lord hath given to me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season (to him that is weary); \"[fn-69-P6904_2009503:1551-nf] except that Marcion introduces to us a Christ who is not subject to the Father. That persecutions from one's nearest friends are predicted, and calumny out of hatred to His name,[fn-69-P6905_2009702:1552-nf] I need not again refer to. But \"by patience,\"[fn-69-P6906_2009775:1553-nf] says He, \"ye shall yourselves be saved.\"[fn-69-P6907_2009855:1554-nf] Of this very patience the Psalm says, \"The patient endurance of the just shall not perish for ever; \"[fn-69-P6908_2010006:1555-nf] because it is said in another Psalm, \"Precious (in the sight of the Lord) is the death of the just\"-arising, no doubt, out of their patient endurance, so that Zechariah declares: \"A crown shall be to them that endure.\"[fn-69-P6909_2010246:1556-nf] But that you may not boldly contend that it was as announcers of another god that the apostles were persecuted by the Jews, remember that even the prophets suffered the same treatment of the Jews, and that they were not the heralds of any other god than the Creator. Then, having shown what was to be the period of the destruction, even \"when Jerusalem should begin to be compassed with armies,\"[fn-69-P6910_2010774:1557-nf] He described the signs of the end of all things: \"portents in the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity-like the sea roaring-by reason of their expectation of the evils which are coming on the earth.\"[fn-69-P6911_2011047:1558-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Moreover, there comes to our aid, when we insist upon the Father and the Son as being Two, that regulating principle which has determined God to be invisible. When Moses in Egypt desired to see the face of the Lord, saying, \"If therefore I have found grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself unto me, that I may see Thee and know Thee,\"[fn-105-P10573_2968798:154-nf] God said, \"Thou canst not see my face; for there shall no man see me, and live: \"[fn-105-P10574_2968903:155-nf] in other words, he who sees me shall die. Now we find that God has been seen by many persons, and yet that no one who saw Him died (at the sight). The truth is, they saw God according to the faculties of men, but not in accordance with the full glory of the Godhead. For the patriarchs are said to have seen God (as Abraham and Jacob), and the prophets (as, for instance Isaiah and Ezekiel), and yet they did not die. Either, then, they ought to have died, since they had seen Him-for (the sentence runs), \"No man shall see God, and live ; \"or else if they saw God, and yet did not die, the Scripture is false in stating that God said, \"If a man see my face, he shall not live.\" Either way, the Scripture misleads us, when it makes God invisible, and when it produces Him to our sight. Now, then, He must be a different Being who was seen, because of one who was seen it could not be predicated that He is invisible. It will therefore follow, that by Him who is invisible we must understand the Father in the fulness of His majesty, while we recognise the Son as visible by reason of the dispensation of His derived existence;[fn-105-P10575_2970046:156-nf] even as it is not permitted us to contemplate, the sun, in the full amount of his substance which is in the heavens, but we can only endure with our eyes a ray, by reason of the tempered condition of this portion which is projected from him to the earth. Here some one on the other side may be disposed to contend that the Son is also invisible as being the Word, and as being also the Spirit;[fn-105-P10576_2970472:157-nf] and, while claiming one nature for the Father and the Son, to affirm that the Father is rather One and the Same Person with the Son. But the Scripture, as we have said, maintains their difference by the distinction it makes between the Visible and the Invisible. They then go on to argue to this effect, that if it was the Son who then spake to Moses, He must mean it of Himself that His face was visible to no one, because He was Himself indeed the invisible Father in the name of the Son. And by this means they will have it that the Visible and the Invisible are one and the same, just as the Father and the Son are the same; (and this they maintain) because in a preceding passage, before He had refused (the sight of) His face to Moses, the Scripture informs us that \"the Lord spake face to face with Moses, even as a man speaketh unto his friend; \"[fn-105-P10577_2971380:158-nf] just as Jacob also says, \"I have seen God face to face.\"[fn-105-P10578_2971460:159-nf] Therefore the Visible and the Invisible are one and the same; and both being thus the same, it follows that He is invisible as the Father, and visible as the Son. As if the Scripture, according to our exposition of it, were inapplicable to the Son, when the Father is set aside in His own invisibility. We declare, however, that the Son also, considered in Himself (as the Son), is invisible, in that He is God, and the Word and Spirit of God; but that He was visible before the days of His flesh, in the way that He says to Aaron and Miriam, \"And if there shall be a prophet amongst you, I will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream; not as with Moses, with whom I shall speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, that is to say, in truth, and not enigmatically\" that is to say, in image;[fn-105-P10579_2972302:160-nf] as the apostle also expresses it, \"Now we see through a glass, darkly (or enigmatically), but then face to face.\"[fn-105-P10580_2972438:161-nf] Since, therefore, He reserves to some future time His presence and speech face to face with Moses-a promise which was afterwards fulfilled in the retirement of the mount (of transfiguration), when as we read in the Gospel,\" Moses appeared talking with Jesus\"[fn-105-P10581_2972721:162-nf] -it is evident that in early times it was always in a glass, (as it were, )and an enigma, in vision and dream, that God, I mean the Son of God, appeared-to the prophets and the patriarchs, as also to Moses indeed himself. And even if the Lord did possibly[fn-105-P10582_2973011:163-nf] speak with him face to face, yet it was not as man that he could behold His face, unless indeed it was in a glass, (as it were, ) and by enigma. Besides, if the Lord so spake with Moses, that Moses actually discerned His face, eye to eye,[fn-105-P10583_2973267:164-nf] how comes it to pass that immediately afterwards, on the same occasion, he desires to see His face,[fn-105-P10584_2973391:165-nf] which he ought not to have desired, because he had already seen it? And how, in like manner, does the Lord also Say that His face cannot be seen, because He had shown it, if indeed He really had, (as our opponents suppose.) Or what is that fade of God, the sight of which is refused, if there was one which was visible to man? \"I have seen God,\" says Jacob, \"face to face, and my life is preserved.\"[fn-105-P10585_2973840:166-nf] There ought to be some other face which kills if it be only seen. Well, then, was the Son visible? (Certainly not,[fn-105-P10586_2973973:167-nf] ) although He was the face of God, except only in vision and dream, and in a glass and enigma, because the Word and Spirit (of God) cannot be seen except in an imaginary form. But, (they say, ) He calls the invisible Father His face. For who is the Father? Must He not be the face of the Son, by reason of that authority which He obtains as the begotten of the Father? For is there not a natural propriety in saying of some personage greater (than yourself), That man is my face; he gives me his countenance? \"My Father,\"says Christ, \"is greater than I.\"[fn-105-P10587_2974560:168-nf] Therefore the Father must be the face of the Son. For what does the Scripture say? \"The Spirit of His person is Christ the Lord.\"[fn-105-P10588_2974711:169-nf] As therefore Christ is the Spirit of the Father's person, there is good reason why, in virtue indeed of the unity, the Spirit of Him to whose person He belonged-that is to say, the Father-pronounced Him to be His \"face.\" Now this, to be sure, is an astonishing thing, that the Father can be taken to be the face of the Son, when He is His head; for \"the head of Christ is God.\"[fn-105-P10589_2975553:170-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_37_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"34.

The word of God, therefore, [recorded] by Moses, when referring to Jacob the grandson of Abraham, speaks thus: `And it came to pass, when the sheep conceived, that I saw them with my eyes in the dream: And, behold, the he-goats and the rams which leaped upon the sheep and she-goats were spotted with white, and speckled and sprinkled with a dun colour. And the Angel of God said to me in the dream, Jacob, Jacob. And I said, What is it, Lord? And He said, Lift up thine eyes, and see that the he-goats and rams leaping on the sheep and she-goats are spotted with white, speckled, and sprinkled with a dun colour. For I have seen what Laban doeth unto thee. I am the God who appeared to thee in Bethel,[fn-45-P4556_956486:204-nf] where thou anointedst a pillar and vowedst a vow unto Me. Now therefore arise, and get thee out of this land, and depart to the land of thy birth, and I shall be with thee.'[fn-45-P4557_956701:205-nf] And again, in other words, speaking of the same Jacob, it thus says: `And having risen up that night, he took the two wives, and the two women-servants, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford Jabbok; and he took them and went over the brook, and sent over all his belongings. But Jacob was left behind alone, and an Angel[fn-45-P4558_957059:206-nf] wrestled with him until morning. And He saw that He is not prevailing against him, and He touched the broad part of his thigh; and the broad part of Jacob's thigh grew stiff while he wrestled with Him. And He said, Let Me go, for the day breaketh. But he said, I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me. And He said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And He said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; for thou hast prevailed with God, and with men shalt be powerful. And Jacob asked Him, and said, Tell me Thy name. But he said, Why dost thou ask after My name? And He blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of that place Peniel,[fn-45-P4559_957769:207-nf] for I saw God face to face, and my soul rejoiced.'[fn-45-P4560_957857:208-nf] And again, in other terms, referring to the same Jacob, it says the following: `And Jacob came to Luz, in the land of Canaan, which is Bethel, he and all the people that were with him. And there he built an altar, and called the name of that place Bethel; for there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother Esau. And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and Jacob called the name of it The Oak of Sorrow. And God appeared again to Jacob in Luz, when he came out from Mesopotamia in Syria, and He blessed him. And God said to him, Thy name shall be no more called Jacob, but Israel shall he thy name.'[fn-45-P4561_958544:209-nf] He is called God, and He is and shall be God.\" And when all had agreed on these grounds, I continued: \"Moreover, I consider it necessary to repeat to you the words which narrate how He who is both Angel and God and Lord, and who appeared as a man to Abraham, and who wrestled in human form with Jacob, was seen by him when he fled from his brother Esau. They are as follows: `And Jacob went out from the well of the oath,[fn-45-P4562_958990:210-nf] and went toward Charran.[fn-45-P4563_959039:211-nf] And he lighted on a spot, and slept there, for the sun was set; and he gathered of the stones of the place, and put them under his head. And he slept in that place; and he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder was set up on the earth, whose top reached to heaven; and the angels of God ascended and descended upon it. And the Lord stood[fn-45-P4564_959409:212-nf] above it, and He said, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham thy father, and of Isaac; be not afraid: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and shall be extended to the west, and south, and north, and east: and in thee, and in thy seed, shall all families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am with thee, keeping thee in every way wherein thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done all that I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob rose up in the morning, and took the stone which he had placed under his head, and he set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it; and Jacob called the name of the place The House of God, and the name of the city formerly was Ulammaus.'\"[fn-45-P4565_960486:213-nf] ","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":32,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":128,"source_paragraph":"596","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"But if you knew, Trypho,\" continued I, \"who He is that is called at one time the Angel of great counsel,[fn-51-P5108_1156246:492-nf] and a Man by Ezekiel, and like the Son of man by Daniel, and a Child by Isaiah, and Christ and God to be worshipped by David, and Christ and a Stone by many, and Wisdom by Solomon, and Joseph and Judah and a Star by Moses, and the East by Zechariah, and the Suffering One and Jacob and Israel by Isaiah again, and a Rod, and Flower, and Corner-Stone, and Son of God, you would not have blasphemer Him who has now come, and been born, and suffered, and ascended to heaven; who shall also come again, and then your twelve tribes shall mourn.

And it is recorded that he called the place where He wrestled with him, appeared to and blessed him, the Face of God (Peniel). And Moses says that God appeared also to Abraham near the oak in Mature, when he was sitting at the door of his tent at mid-day. Then he goes on to say: `And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, three men stood before him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them.'[fn-51-P5111_1157863:495-nf] a After a little, one of them promises a son to Abraham: `Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall.

Threatenings also are held out as impending over those who shall transgress the law; different kinds of purifications are moreover prescribed for those who required purification, as being persons who were liable to frequent pollution, that by means of these they may arrive at last at that one purification after which no further pollution is permitted. The very people are numbered, though not all; for the souls of children are not yet old enough to be numbered according to the divine command: nor are those souls who cannot become the head of another, but are themselves subordinated to others as to a head, who are called \"women,\" who certainly are not included in that numbering which is enjoined by God; but they alone are numbered who are called \"men,\" by which it might be shown that the women could not be counted separately,[fn-73-P7331_1671596:3-nf] but were included in those called men. Those, however, especially belong to the sacred number, who are prepared to go forth to the battles of the Israelites, and are able to fight against those public and private enemies[fn-73-P7332_1671833:4-nf] whom the Father subjects to the Son, who sits on His right hand that He may destroy all principality and power, and by means of these bands of His soldiery, who, being engaged in a warfare for God, do not entangle themselves in secular business, He may overturn the Kingdom of His adversary; by whom the shields of faith are borne, and the weapons of wisdom brandished; among whom also the helmet of hope and salvation gleams forth, and the breastplate of brightness fortifies the breast that is filled with God. Such soldiers appear to me to be indicated, and to be prepared for wars of this kind, in those persons who in the sacred books are ordered by God's command to be numbered. But of these, by far the more perfect and distinguished are shown to be those of whom the very hairs of the head are said to be numbered. Such, indeed, as were punished for their sins, whose bodies fell in the wilderness, appear to possess a resemblance to those who had made indeed no little progress, but who could not at all, for various reasons, attain to the end of perfection; because they are reported either to have murmured, or to have worshipped idols, or to have committed fornication, or to have done some evil work which the mind ought not even to conceive. I do not consider the following even to be without some mystical meaning,[fn-73-P7333_1673186:5-nf] viz., that certain (of the Israelites), possessing many flocks and animals, take possession by anticipation of a country adapted for pasture and the feeding of cattle, which was the very first that the right hand of the Hebrews had secured in war.[fn-73-P7334_1673485:6-nf] For, making a request of Moses to receive this region, they are divided off by the waters of the Jordan, and set apart from any possession in the holy land.

For as Deuteronomy is called, as it were, the second law, which to some will appear to convey this signification, that when the first law which was given through Moses had come to an end, so a second legislation seems to have been enacted, which was specially transmitted by Moses to his successor Joshua, who is certainly believed to embody a type[fn-73-P7336_1674544:8-nf] of our Saviour, by whose second law-that is, the precepts of the Gospel-all things are brought to perfection.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":32,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_51_a_letter_from_origen_to_africanus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"ANF-04","text":"And as to an appearance (which is better than a dream), he speaks as follows about himself: \"And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.

Thou weft wanton, boil not over like water; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou the couch to which thou wentetest up.[fn-75-P7576_1747070:23-nf] And so with the rest: it was by inspiration that the prophetic blessings were pronounced.

Thus, therefore, Christ also-that is, the image of God, and the Son of God-is looked upon by men, inasmuch as He could be seen. And thus the weakness and imperfection of the human destiny is nourished, led up, and educated by Him; so that, being accustomed to look upon the Son, it may one day be able to see God the Father Himself also as He is, that it may not be stricken by His sudden and intolerable brightness, and be hindered from being able to see God the Father, whom it has always desired.[fn-102-P10282_3215614:137-nf] Wherefore it is the Son who is seen; but the Son of God is the Word of God: and the Word of God was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and this is Christ. What in the world is the reason that we should hesitate to call Him God, who in so many ways is acknowledged to be proved God? And if, moreover, the angel meets with Hagar, Sarah's maid, driven from her home as well as turned away, near the fountain of water in the way to Shur; asks and learns the reason of her flight, and after that offers her advice that she should humble herself; and, moreover, gives her the hope of the name of mother, and pledges and promises that from her womb there should be a numerous seed, and that she should have Ishmael to be born from her; and with other things unfolds the place of his habitation, and describes his mode oflife; yet Scripture sets forth this angel as both Lord and God-for He would not have promised the blessing of seed unless the angel had also been God. Let them ask what the heretics can make of this present passage. Was that the Father that was seen by Hagar or not? For He is declared to be God. But far be it from us to call God the Father an angel, lest He should be subordinate to another whose angel He would be. But they will say that it was an angel. How then shall He be God if He was an angel? Since this name is nowhere conceded to angels, except that on either side the truth compels us into this opinion, that we ought to understand it to have been God the Son, who, because He is of God, is rightly called God, because He is the Son of God. But, because He is subjected[fn-102-P10283_3217306:138-nf] to the Father, and the Announcer of the Father's will, He is declared to be the Angel of Great Counsel.[fn-102-P10284_3217548:139-nf] Therefore, although this passage neither is suited to the person of the Father, lest He should be called an angel, nor to the person of an angel, lest he should be called God; yet it is suited to the person of Christ that He should be both God because He is the Son of God, and should be an angel because He is the Announcer of the Father's mind. And the heretics ought to understand that they are setting themselves against the Scriptures, in that, while they say that they believe Christ to have been also an angel, they are unwilling to declare Him to have been also God, when they read in the Old Testament that He often came to visit the human race. To this, moreover, Moses added the instance of God seen of Abraham at the oak of Mature, when he was sitting at the opening of his tent at noon-day. And nevertheless, although he had beheld three men, note that he called one of them Lord; and when he had washed their feet, he offers them bread baked on the ashes, with butter and abundance of milk itself, and urges them that, being detained as guests, they should eat. And after I this he hears also that he should be a father, and learns that Sarah his wife should bring forth a son by him; and acknowledges concerning the destruction of the people of Sodom, what they deserve to suffer; and learns that God had come down on account of the cry of Sodom. in which place, if they will have it that the Father was seen at that time to have been received with hospitality in company with two angels, the heretics have believed the Father to be visible. But if an angel, although of the three angels one is called Lord, why, although it is not usual, is an angel called God? Unless because, in order that His proper invisibility may be restored to the Father, and the proper inferiority[fn-102-P10285_3219497:140-nf] be remitted to the angel, it was only God the Son, who also is God, who was seen by Abraham, and was believed to have been received with hospitality. For He anticipated sacramentally what He was hereafter to become. He was made a guest of Abraham, being about to be among the sons of Abraham. And his children's feet, by way of proving what He was, He washed; returning in the children the claim of hospitality which formerly the Father had put out to interest to Him. Whence also, that there might be no doubt but that it was He who was the guest of Abraham on the destruction of the people of Sodom, it is declared: \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrha fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven.\"[fn-102-P10286_3220353:141-nf] For thus also said the prophet in the person of God: \"I have overthrown you, as the Lord overturned Sodom and Gomorrha.\"[fn-102-P10287_3220496:142-nf] Therefore the Lord overturned Sodom, that is, God overturned Sodom; but in the overturning of Sodom, the Lord rained fire from the Lord. And this Lord was the God seen by Abraham; and this God was the guest of Abraham, certainly seen because He was also touched. But although the Father, being invisible, was assuredly not at that time seen, He who was accustomed to be touched and seen was seen and received to hospitality. But this the Son of God, \"The Lord rained from the Lord upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire.\" And this is the Word of God. And the Word of God was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and this is Christ. It was not the Father, then, who was a guest with Abraham, but Christ. Nor was it the Father who was seen then, but the Son; and Christ was seen. Rightly, therefore, Christ is both Lord and God, who was not otherwise seen by Abraham, except that as God the Word He was begotten of God the Father before Abraham himself. Moreover, says the Scripture, the same Angel and God visits and consoles the same Hagar when driven with her son from the dwelling of Abraham. For when in the desert she had exposed the infant, because the water had fallen short from the pitcher; and when the lad had cried out, and she had lifted up her weeping and lamentation, \"God heard,\" says the Scripture, \"the voice of the lad from the place where he was.\"[fn-102-P10288_3221883:143-nf] Having told that it was God who heard the voice of the infant, it adds: \"And the angel of the Lord called Hagar herself out of heaven,\" saying that that was an angel[fn-102-P10289_3222076:144-nf] whom it had called God, and pronouncing Him to be Lord whom it had set forth as an angel; which Angel and God moreover promises to Hagar herself greater consolations, in saying, \"Fear not; for I have heard the voice of the lad from the place where he was. Arise, take up the lad, and hold him; for I will make of him a great nation.\"[fn-102-P10290_3222446:145-nf] Why does this angel, if angel only, claim to himself this right of saying, I will make of him a great nation, since assuredly this kind of power belongs to God, and cannot belong to an angel? Whence also He is confirmed to be God, since He is able to do this; because, by way of proving this very point, it is immediately added by the Scripture: \"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of running water; and she went and filled the bottle from the well, and gave to the lad: and God was with the lad.\"[fn-102-P10291_3222975:146-nf] If, then, this God was with the Lord, who opened the eyes of Hagar that she might see the well of running water, and might draw the water on account of the urgent need of the lad's thirst, and this God who calls her from heaven is called an angel when, in previously hearing the voice of the lad crying, He was rather God; is not understood to be other than angel, in like manner as He was God also. And since this cannot be applicable or fitting to the Father, who is God only, but may be applicable to Christ, who is declared to be not only God, but angel also,[fn-102-P10292_3223561:147-nf] it manifestly appears that it was not the Father who thus spoke to Hagar, but rather Christ, since He is God; and to Him also is applied the name of angel, since He became the \"angel of great counsel.\"[fn-102-P10293_3223792:148-nf] And He is the angel, in that He declares the bosom of the Father, as John sets forth. For if John himself says, that He Himself who sets forth the bosom of the Father, as the Word, became flesh in order to declare the bosom of the Father, assuredly Christ is not only man, but angel also; and not only angel, but He is shown by the Scriptures to be God also. And this is believed to be the case by us; so that, if we will not consent to apprehend that it was Christ who then spoke to Hagar, we must either make an angel God, or we must reckon God the Father Almighty among the angels.[fn-102-P10294_3224402:149-nf] ","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"ANF-05","text":"What if in another place also we read in like manner that God was described as an angel? For when, to his wives Leah and Rachel, Jacob complained of the injustice of their father, and when he told them that he desired now to go and return into his own land, he moreover inter posed the authority of his dream; and at this time he says that the angel of God had said to him in a dream, \"Jacob, Jacob. And I said,\" says he, \"What is it? Lift up thine eyes, said He, and see, the he-goats and the rams leaping upon the sheep, and the she-goats are black and white, and many-coloured, and grizzled, and speckled: for I have seen all that Laban hath done to thee. I am God, who appeared to thee in the place of God, where thou anointedst for me there the standing stone, and there vowedst a vow unto me: now therefore arise, and go forth from this land, and go unto the land of thy nativity, and I will be with thee.\"[fn-102-P10299_3225566:151-nf] If the Angel of God speaks thus to Jacob, and the Angel himself mentions and says, \"I am God, who appeared unto thee in the house of God,\" we see without any hesitation that this is declared to be not only an angel, but God also; because He speaks of the vow directed to Himself by Jacob in the place of God, and He does not say, in my place. It is then the place of God, and He also is God. Moreover, it is written simply in the place of God, for it is not said in the place of the angel and God, but only of God; and He who promises those things is manifested to be both God and Angel, so that reasonably there must be a distinction between Him who is called God only, and Him who is declared to be not God simply, but Angel also. Whence if so great an authority cannot here be regarded as belonging to any other angel, that He should also avow Himself to be God, and should bear witness that a vow was made to Him, except to Christ alone, to whom not as angel only, but as to God, a vow can be vowed; it is manifest that it is not to be received as the Father, but as the Son, God and Angel.[fn-103-P10300_3226687:152-nf] Moreover, if this is Christ, as it is, he is in terrible risk who says that Christ is either man or angel alone, withholding from Him the power of the divine name,-an authority which He has constantly received on the faith of the heavenly Scriptures, which continually say that He is both Angel and God. To all these things, moreover, is added this, that in like manner as the divine Scripture has frequently declared Him both Angel and God, so the same divine Scripture declares Him also both man and God, expressing thereby what He should be, and depicting even then in figure what He was to be in the truth of His substance. \"For,\" it says, \"Jacob remained alone; and there wrestled with him a man even till daybreak. And He saw that He did not prevail against him; and He touched the broad part of Jacob's thigh while He was wrestling with him and he with Him, and said to him, Let me go, for the morning has dawned. And he said, I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me. And He said, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And He said to him, Thy name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; because thou hast prevailed with God, and thou an powerful with men.\"[fn-103-P10301_3228013:153-nf] And it adds, moreover: \"And Jacob called the name of that place the Vision of God: for I have seen the Lord face to face, and my soul has been made safe. And the sun arose upon him. Afterwards he crossed over the Vision of God, but he halted upon his thigh.\"[fn-103-P10302_3228328:154-nf] A man, it says, wrestled with Jacob. If this was a mere man, who is he? Whence is he? Wherefore does he contend and wrestle with Jacob? What had intervened? What had happened? What was the cause of so great a dispute as that, and so great a struggle? Why, moreover, is Jacob, who is found to be strong enough to hold the man with whom he is wrestling, and asks for a blessing from Him whom he is holding, asserted to have asked therefore, except because this struggle was prefigured as that which should be between Christ and the sons of Jacob, which is said to be completed in the Gospel? For against this man Jacob's people struggled, in which struggle Jacob's people was found to be the more powerful, because against Christ it gained the victory of its iniquity: at which time, on account of the crime that it committed, hesitating and giving way, it began most sorely to halt in the walk of its own faith and salvation; and although it was found the stronger, in respect of the condemnation of Christ, it still needs His mercy, still needs His blessing. But, moreover, the man who wrestled with Jacob says, \"Moreover, thy name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; \"and if Israel is the man who sees God, the Lord was beautifully showing that it was not only a man who was then wrestling with Jacob, but God also. Certainly Jacob saw God, with whom he wrestled, although he was holding the man in his own struggle. And in order that there might still be no hesitation, He Himself laid down the interpretation by saying, \"Because thou hast prevailed with God, and art powerful with men.\" For which reason the same Jacob, perceiving already the force of the Mystery, and apprehending the authority of Him with whom he had wrestled, called the name of that place in which he had wrestled, the Vision of God. He, moreover, superadded the reason for his interpretation being offered of the Vision of God: \"For I have seen,\" said he, \"God face to face, and my soul has been saved.\" Moreover, he saw God, with whom he wrestled as with a man; but still indeed he held the man as a conqueror, though as an inferior he asked a blessing as from God. Thus he wrestled with God and with man; and thus truly was that struggle prefigured, and in the Gospel was fulfilled, between Christ and the people of Jacob, wherein, although the people had the mastery, yet it proved to be inferior by being shown to be guilty. Who will hesitate to acknowledge that Christ, in whom this type of a wrestling was fulfilled, was not man only, but God also, since even that very type of a wrestling seems to have proved Him man and God? And yet, even after this, the same divine Scripture justly does not cease to call the Angel God, and to pronounce God the Angel. For when this very Jacob was about to bless Manasseh and Ephraim, the sons of Joseph, with his hands placed across on the heads of the lads, he said, \"The God which fed me from my youth even unto this day, the Angel who delivered me from all evils, bless these lads.\"[fn-103-P10303_3231389:155-nf] Even to such a point does he affirm the same Being to be an Angel, whom he had called God, as in the end of his discourse, to express the person of whom he was speaking as one, when he said[fn-103-P10304_3231607:156-nf] \"bless these lads.\" For if he had meant the one to be understood as God, and the other as an angel, he would have comprised the two persons in the plural number; but now he defined the singular number of one person in the blessing, whence he meant it to be understood that the same person is God and Angel. But yet He cannot be received as God the Father; but as God and Angel, as Christ He can be received. And Him, as the author of this blessing, Jacob also signified by placing his hands crossed upon the lads, as if their father was Christ, and showing, from thus placing his hands, the figure and future form of the passion.[fn-103-P10305_3232256:157-nf] Let no one, therefore, who does not shrink from speaking of Christ as an Angel, thus shrink from pronouncing Him God also, when he perceives that He Himself was invoked in the blessing of these lads, by the sacrament of the passion, intimated in the type of the crossed hands, as both God and Angel.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"12.

For knowing that He is also called the Father's `Angel of great Counsel[fn-66-P6613_2625677:101-nf] ,' he said that none other than He was the Giver of blessing, and Deliverer from evil Nor was it that he desired a blessing for himself from God but for his grandchildren from the Angel, but whom He Himself had besought saying, `I will not let Thee go except Thou bless me[fn-66-P6614_2625973:102-nf] ' (for that was God, as he says himself, `I have seen God face to face'), Him he prayed to bless also the sons of Joseph.

And if the Patriarch Jacob, blessing his grandchildren Ephraim and Manasses, said, `God which fed me all my life long unto this day, the Angel which delivered me from all evil, bless the lads[fn-66-P6612_2624677:100-nf] ,' yet none of created and natural Angels did he join to God their Creator, nor rejecting God that fed him, did he from Angel ask the blessing on his grandsons; but in saying, `Who delivered me from all evil,' he shewed that it was no created Angel, but the Word of God, whom he joined to the Father in his prayer, through whom, whomsoever He will, God doth deliver. For knowing that He is also called the Father's `Angel of great Counsel[fn-66-P6613_2625677:101-nf] ,' he said that none other than He was the Giver of blessing, and Deliverer from evil Nor was it that he desired a blessing for himself from God but for his grandchildren from the Angel, but whom He Himself had besought saying, `I will not let Thee go except Thou bless me[fn-66-P6614_2625973:102-nf] ' (for that was God, as he says himself, `I have seen God face to face'), Him he prayed to bless also the sons of Joseph. It is proper then to an Angel to minister at the command of God, and often does he go forth to cast out the Amorite, and is sent to guard the people in the way; but these are not his doings, but of God who commanded and sent him, whose also it is to deliver, whom He will deliver. There- fore it was no other than the Lord God Himself whom he had seen, who said to him, `And behold I am with thee, to guard thee in all the way whither thou[fn-66-P6615_2626575:103-nf] goest;' and it was no other than God whom lie had seen, who kept Laban from his treachery, ordering him not to speak evil words to Jacob; and none other than God did he himself beseech, saying, `Rescue me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I fear him[fn-66-P6616_2626858:104-nf] ;' for in conversation too with his wives he said, `God hath not suffered Laban to injure me.'","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":32,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"16. For if it be not so, but the Word is a creature and a work out of nothing, either He is not True God because He is Himself one of the creatures, or if they name Him God from regard for the Scriptures, they must of necessity say that there are two Gods[fn-66-P6638_2635988:122-nf] , one Creator, the other creature, and must serve two Lords, one Unoriginate, and the other originate and a creature; and must have two faiths, one in the True God, and the other in one who is made and fashioned by themselves and called God. And it follows of necessity in so great blindness, that, when they worship the Unoriginate, they renounce the originate, and when they come to the creature, they turn from the Creator. For they cannot see the One in the Other, because their natures and operations are foreign and distinct[fn-66-P6639_2636972:123-nf] . And with such sentiments, they will certainly be going on to more gods, for this will be the essay[fn-66-P6640_2637091:124-nf] of those who revolt from the One God. Wherefore then, when the Arians have these speculations and views, do they not rank themselves with the Gentiles? for they too, as these, worship the creature rather than God the Creator of all[fn-66-P6641_2637360:125-nf] , and though they shrink from the Gentile name, in order to deceive the unskilful, yet they secretly hold a like sentiment with them. For their subtle saying which they are accustomed to urge, We say not two `Unoriginates[fn-66-P6642_2637896:126-nf] ,' they plainly say to deceive the simple; for in their very professing `We say not two Unoriginates,' they imply two Gods, and these with different natures, one originate and one Unoriginate. And though the Greeks worship one Unoriginate and many originate, but these one Unoriginate and one originate, this is no differ- ence from them; for the God whom they call originate is one out of many, and again the many gods of the Greeks have the same nature with this one, for both he and they are creatures. Unhappy are they, and the more for that their hurt is from thinking against Christ; for they have fallen from the truth, and are greater traitors than the Jews in denying the Christ, and they wallow[fn-66-P6643_2638626:127-nf] with the Gentiles, hateful[fn-66-P6644_2638751:128-nf] as they are to God, worshipping the creature and many deities. For there is One God, and not many, and One is His Word, and not many; for the Word is God, and He alone has the Form[fn-66-P6645_2638975:129-nf] of the Father. Being then such, the Saviour Himself troubled the Jews with these words, `The Father Himself which hath sent Me, hath borne witness of Me; ye have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His Form; and ye have not His Word abiding in you; for whom He hath sent, Him ye believe not[fn-66-P6646_2641125:130-nf] .' Suitably has He joined the `Word' to the `Form,' to shew that the Word of God is Himself Image and Expression and Form of His Father; and that the Jews who did not receive Him who spoke to them, thereby did not receive the Word, which is the Form of God. This too it was that the Patriarch Jacob having seen, received a blessing from Him and the name of Israel instead of Jacob, as divine Scripture witnesses, saying, `And as he passed by the Form of God, the Sun rose upon him[fn-66-P6647_2641625:131-nf] .'
