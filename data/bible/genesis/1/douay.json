{"verses":["In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.","And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face\nof the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.","And God said:  Be light made.  And light was made.","And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light\nfrom the darkness.","And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was\nevening and morning one day.","And God said:  Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters:  and\nlet it divide the waters from the waters.","And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under\nthe firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.","And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning\nwere the second day.","God also said; Let the waters that are under the heaven, be\ngathered together into one place:  and let the dry land appear.  And it\nwas so done.","And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of\nthe waters, he called Seas.  And God saw that it was good.","And he said:  let the earth bring forth green herb, and such as\nmay seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may\nhave seed in itself upon the earth.  And it was so done.","And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth\nseed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having\nseed each one according to its kind.  And God saw that it was good.","And the evening and the morning were the third day.","And God said:  Let there be lights made in the firmament of\nheaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and\nfor seasons, and for days and years:","To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the\nearth, and it was so done.","And God made two great lights:  a greater light to rule the day;\nand a lesser light to rule the night:  and the stars.","And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the\nearth.","And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and\nthe darkness.  And God saw that it was good.","And the evening and morning were the fourth day.","God also said:  let the waters bring forth the creeping creature\nhaving life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the\nfirmament of heaven.","And God created the great whales, and every living and moving\ncreature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and\nevery winged fowl according to its kind.  And God saw that it was good.","And he blessed them, saying:  Increase and multiply, and fill the\nwaters of the sea:  and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.","And the evening and morning were the fifth day.","And God said:  Let the earth bring forth the living creature in\nits kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth,\naccording to their kinds.  And it was so done.","And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds,\nand cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind.\nAnd God saw that it was good.","And he said:  Let us make man to our image and likeness:  and let\nhim have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air,\nand the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that\nmoveth upon the earth.","And God created man to his own image:  to the image of God he\ncreated him:  male and female he created them.","And God blessed them, saying:  Increase and multiply, and fill the\nearth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the\nfowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.","And God said:  Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed\nupon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own\nkind, to be your meat:","And to all beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and\nto all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they\nmay have to feed upon.  And it was so done.","And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very\ngood.  And the evening and morning were the sixth day."]}
