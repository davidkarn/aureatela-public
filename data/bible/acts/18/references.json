In the use of this passage, however, we must be very specially on our guard, lest perchance, when we see any servant of God making provision that such necessaries shall not be wanting either to himself or to those with whose care he has been entrusted, we should decide that he is acting contrary to the Lord's precept, and is anxious for the morrow.[fn-8-P845_318746:168-nf] For the Lord Himself also, although angels ministered to Him,[fn-8-P846_319396:169-nf] yet for the sake of example, that no one might afterwards be scandalized when he observed any of His servants procuring such necessaries, condescended to have money bags, out of which whatever might be required for necessary uses might be provided; of which bags, as it is written, Judas, who betrayed Him, was the keeper and the thief.[fn-8-P847_319754:170-nf] In like manner, the Apostle Paul also may seem to have taken thought for the morrow, when he said: \"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the saints of Galatia, even so do ye: upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store[fn-8-P848_320056:171-nf] what shall seem good unto him, that there be no gatherings when I conic. And when I come[fn-8-P849_320186:172-nf] whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. Now I will come unto you when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I shall pass through Macedonia. And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.\"[fn-8-P850_320744:173-nf] In the Acts of the Apostles also it is written, that such things as are necessary for food were provided for the future, on account of an impending famine. For we thus read: \"And in these days came prophets down from Jerusalem to Antioch,[fn-8-P851_321007:174-nf] and there was great rejoicing. And when we were gathered together,[fn-8-P852_321158:175-nf] there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples, every one according to his ability, determined to send relief to the elders for the brethren which dwelt in Judaea, which also they did by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.\"[fn-8-P853_321614:176-nf] And in the case of the necessaries presented to him, wherewith the same Apostle Paul when setting sail was laden,[fn-8-P854_321818:177-nf] food seems to have been furnished for more than a single day. And when the same apostle writes, \"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working[fn-8-P855_322008:178-nf] with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth;\"[fn-8-P856_322131:179-nf] to those who misunderstand him he does not seem to keep the Lord's precept, which runs, \"Behold the fowls of the air; for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns;\" and, \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin;\" while he enjoins the parties in question to labour, working with their hands, that they may have something which they may be able to give to others also. And in what he often says of himself, that he wrought with his hands that he might not be burdensome;[fn-8-P857_322756:180-nf] and in what is written of him, that he joined himself to Aquila on account of the similarity of their occupation, in order that they might work together at that from which they might make a living;[fn-8-P858_322994:181-nf] he does not seem to have imitated the birds of the air and the lilies of the field. From these and such like passages of Scripture, it is sufficiently apparent that our Lord does not disapprove of it, when one looks after such things in the ordinary way that men do; but only when one enlists as a soldier of God for the sake of such things, so that in what he does he fixes his eye not on the kingdom of God, but on the acquisition of such things.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_06_book_i_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"166","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"2 They say that Sosthenes also, who wrote tothe Corinthians with Paul, was one of them.[fn-8-P878_433288:192-nf] This is the account of Clement[fn-8-P879_433890:193-nf] in the fifthbook of his Hypotyposes, in which he also says that Cephas was one of the seventy disciples,[fn-8-P880_434078:194-nf] a man who bore the same name as the apostle Peter, and the one concerning whom Paul says, \"When Cephas came to Antioch I withstood him to his face.\"[fn-8-P881_434788:195-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":18,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"163","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"9 At this time, while Paul was completing his journey \"from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum,\"[fn-13-P1312_616110:220-nf] Claudius drove the Jews out of Rome; and Aquila and Priscilla, leaving Rome with the other Jews, came to Asia, and there abode with the apostle Paul, who was confirming the churches of that region whose foundations he had newly laid.

And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.\" (v. 9-12.) That they may establish the charge, the phrase is, \"he speaks against God, and against Moses.\" And with this object too they disputed, that they might force him to say somewhat. But he now discoursed more openly, and perhaps spoke of the cessation of the Divine Law: or, spoke it not, but hinted as much: since had he spoken plainly, there had been no need of suborned men, nor yet of false witnesses.[fn-7-P702_572516:1-nf] The synagogues were diverse: [to wit, \"Of the Libertines\"]: \"of the Cyrenians, i. e. those in the parts beyond Alexandria [\"of the Alexandrians,\" etc.]. There also they seem to have had synagogues according to their different nations; for many stayed behind there, that they might not be obliged to be continually travelling. The Libertines perhaps were freedmen of the Romans. As there were many foreigners dwelling there, so they had their synagogues, where the Law was to be read. \"Disputing with Stephen.\" Observe him, not taking upon him to teach, but forced to do so. The miracles once more brought him into ill-will; but when he overcame in argument, it was false-witness! For they did not wish to kill intolerable to them. \"They could not resist, etc.: then they suborned men.\" Everywhere out of hand, but by means of a sentence, that they might hurt their reputation also: and leaving those (the Apostles), they attack these (the disciples), thinking in this way to terrify those also. They say not, \"he speaketh,\" but, \"he ceaseth not to speak. And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law.\" (v. 12, 13.) \"Ceaseth not,\" say they, as if he made this his business. \"For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.\" (v. 14.) \"Jesus,\" they say, \"the Nazarene,\" as a term of reproach, \"shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs.\" This is also what they said about Christ. \"Thou that destroyest this Temple.\" (Matt. xxvii. 40.) For great was their veneration for the Temple (as indeed they had chosen to leave their own country (metoikein) in order to be near it) and for the name of Moses. The charge is twofold. If[fn-7-P703_575666:2-nf] He \"shall change the customs,\" He will also introduce others instead: observe how the charge is a bitter one, and fraught with perils. \"And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.\" (v. 15.) So possible is it even for one in a lower degree to shine. For what, I ask, had this man less than the Apostles? He lacked not miracles,and great was the boldness he exhibited.[fn-7-P704_576325:3-nf] -\"They saw His face,\" it is said, \"as it had been the face of an angel.\" (Ex. xxxiv. 30.) For this was his grace, this was the glory of Moses. God made him thus gracious (epikarin) of visage, now that he was about to say somewhat, thus at once by his very look to awe them. For there are, yes, there are faces full-fraught with spiritual grace, lovely to them that love, awful to haters and enemies. It mentions also the reason, why they suffered his oration.-\"Then,\" it proceeds, \"said the high-priest, Are these things so?\" (ch. vii. 1.) Observe, the question is put with mildness, that he may, effect some great mischief. For this reason Stephen too begins his speech in a tone of gentleness, and says, \"Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran.\" (v. 2.) Immediately at the outset he overthrows their conceit, and makes it appear by what he says, that the temple is nothing, that the customs are nothing either, without their suspecting his drift: also that they shall not overcome the preaching; and that from powerless (amhxanwn) things God evermore contrives Him powerful (eumhxana) instruments. Mark then how these threads make the texture of the whole speech: and moreover that having evermore enjoyed exceeding goodness, they still requited their Benefactor with the opposite conduct, and that they are now attempting impossibilities. \"The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he came into Charran.\" Both the temple was not, and sacrifice was not, and yet a vision of God was vouchsafed to Abraham, and yet had he Persians[fn-7-P705_578321:4-nf] for his ancestors, and was in a strange land. And he does well at the beginning of his speech to call Him, \"the God of glory:\" seeing that He hath made them that are without honor to be glorious. \"Because\" (says he) \"it was He that made them glorious, He will make us also.\" Observe how he leads them away from things of the body, from the place, in the first instance, as the place was in question. \"The God of glory,\" says he: implying again, that He needs not the glory which comes from us, which comes by the Temple: for Himself is the Fountain thereof. Think not, he would say, in this way to glorify Him. \"And from thy kindred.\" How[fn-7-P706_579049:5-nf] then saith the Scripture, that Abraham's father was willing to go out? Hence we learn, that it was in consequence of Abraham's vision, that his father was moved to join in the migration. (Gen. xi. 31.) \"And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into a land which I shall show thee.\" (v. 3.) It shows how far these men are from being children of Abraham, how obedient he was. \"And[fn-7-P707_579919:6-nf] from thy kindred.\" Uncomfortable (fortika) reflections, both, that he endured the labors, while ye reap the fruits, and that all your ancestors were in evil case. \"Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, He removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. And He gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on.\" (v. 4, 5.) See how he raises their thoughts away from (their possession of) the land.[fn-7-P708_580531:7-nf] For if He said (that, He will give: clearly fall came from him], and nothing from themselves. For he came, having left both kindred and country. Wherefore then did He not give it to him? Truly it was a figure of another land. \"And He promised to give it to him.\" Do you perceive, that he does not merely resume the thread of his discourse? \"He gave him not,\" says he; \"and He promised; and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.\" Again, what God can do: that out of impossibilities, He doeth all; For here is a man in Persia, so far away, and this man God saith He will make lord of Palestine.

Hence the aged Simeon, putting off the weakness of the flesh, and putting on the strength of hope, in the face of the law hastened to receive the Minister of the law, the Teacher[fn-60-P6058_1854745:47-nf] with authority, the God of Abraham, the Protector of Isaac, the Holy One of Israel, the Instructor of Moses; Him, I say, who promised to show him His divine incarnation, as it were His hinder parts;[fn-60-P6059_1855009:48-nf] Him who, in the midst of poverty, was rich; Him who in infancy was before the ages; Him who, though seen, was invisible; Him who in comprehension was incomprehensible; Him who, though in littleness, yet surpassed all magnitude-at one and the same time in the temple and in the highest heavens-on a royal throne, and on the chariot of the cherubim Him who is both above and below continuously Him who is in the form of a servant, and in the form of God the Father; a subject, and yet King of all. He was entirely given up to desire, to hope, to joy; he was no longer his own, but His who had been looked for. The Holy Spirit had announced to him the joyful tidings, and before he reached the temple, carried aloft by the eyes of his understanding, as if even now he possessed what he had longed for, he exulted with joy. Being thus led on, and in his haste treading the air with his steps, he reaches the shrine hitherto held sacred; but, not heeding the temple, he stretches out his holy arms to the Ruler of the temple, chanting forth in song such strains as become the joyous occasion: I long for Thee, O Lord God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast deigned, of Thine own glory and goodness, which provides for all, of Thy gracious condescension, with which Thou inclinest towards us, as a Mediator bringing peace, to establish harmony between earth and heaven. I seek Thee, the Great Author of all. With longing I expect Thee who, with Thy word, embracest all things. I wait for Thee, the Lord of life and death. For Thee I look, the Giver of the law, and the Successor of the law. I hunger for Thee, who quickenest the dead; I thirst for Thee, who refreshest the weary; I desire Thee, the Creator and Redeemer of the world.[fn-60-P6060_1856764:49-nf] Thou art our God, and Thee we adore; Thou art our holy Temple, and in Thee we pray; Thou art our Lawgiver, and Thee we obey; Thou art God of all things the First. Before Thee was no other god begotten of God the Father; neither after Thee shall there be any other son consubstantial and of one glory with the Father.

Moreover, if discourse must be bestowed upon any, and this so take up thespeaker that he have not time to work with his hands, are all in the monastery able to hold discourse unto brethren which come unto them from another kind of life, whether it be to expound the divine lessons, or concerning any questions which may be put, to reason in an wholesome manner? Then since not all have the ability, why upon this pretext do all want to have nothing else to do? Although even if all were able, they ought to do it by turns; not only that the rest might not be taken up from necessary works, but also because it sufficeth that to many hearers there be one speaker. To come now to the Apostle; how could he find time to work with his hands, unless for the bestowing of the word of God he had certain set times? And indeed God hath not willed this either to be hidden from us. For both of what craft he was a workman, and at what times he was taken up with dispensing the Gospel, holy Scripture has not left untold. Namely, when the day of his departure caused him to be in haste, being at Troas, even on the first day of the week when the brethren were assembled to break bread, such was his earnestness, and so necessary the disputation, that his discourse was prolonged even until midnight,[fn-46-P4614_2276168:68-nf] as though it had slipped from their minds that on that day it was not a fast:[fn-46-P4615_2276263:69-nf] but when he was making longer stay in any place and disputing daily, who can doubt that he had certain hours set apart for this office? For at Athens, because he had there found most studious inquirers of things, it is thus written of him: \"He disputed therefore with the Jews in the synagogue, and with the Gentile inhabitants[fn-46-P4616_2276786:70-nf] in the market every day to those who were there.\"[fn-46-P4617_2277053:71-nf] Not, namely, in the synagogue every day, for there it was his custom to discourse on the sabbath: but \"in the market,\" saith he, \"every day;\" by reason, doubtless, of the studiousness of the Athenians. For so it follows: \"Certain however of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers conferred with him.\" And a little after, it says: \"Now the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.\" Let us suppose him all those days that he was at Athens not to have worked: on this account, indeed, was his need supplied from Macedonia, as he says in the second to the Corinthians:[fn-46-P4618_2277724:72-nf] though in fact he could work both at other hours and of nights, because he was so strong in both mind and body. But when he had gone from Athens, let us see what says the Scripture: \"He disputed,\" saith it, \"in the synagogue every sabbath;\"[fn-46-P4619_2277984:73-nf] this at Corinth. In Troas, however, where through necessity of his departure being close at hand, his discourse was protracted until midnight, it was the first day of the week, which is called the Lord's Day: whence we understand that he was not with Jews but with Christians; when also the narrator himself saith they were gathered together to break bread. And indeed this same is the best management, that all things be distributed to their times and be done in order, test becoming ravelled in perplexing entanglements, they throw our human mind into confusion.","title":"Of the Work of Monks.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_37_of_the_work_of_monks_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"22. There also is said at what work the Apostle wrought. \"After these things,\" it says, \"he departed from Athens and came to Corinth; and having found a certain Jew, by name Aquila, of Pontus by birth, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, because that Claudius had ordered all Jews to depart from Rome, he came unto them, and because he was of the same craft he abode with them, doing work: for they were tent-makers.\"[fn-46-P4621_2278998:74-nf] This if they shall essay to interpret allegorically, they show what proficients they be in ecclesiastical learning, on which they glory that they bestow all their time.

For it is one thing to plead infirmity of body, either truly alleged, or falsely pretended: but another so to be deceived and so to deceive, that it shall evenbe thought a proof of righteousness obtainingmore mightily in servants of God, if laziness have gotten power to reign among a set of ignorant men. He, namely, who shows a true infirmity of body, must be humanely dealt withal; he who pretends a false one, and cannot be convicted, must be left unto God: yet neither of them fixeth a pernicious rule; because a good servant of God both serves his manifestly infirm brother; and, when the other deceives, if he believes him because he does not think him a bad man, he does not imitate him that he may be bad; and if he believe him not; he thinks him deceitful, and does, nevertheless, not imitate him. But when a man says, \"This is true righteousness, that by doing no bodily work we imitate the birds of the air, because he who shall do any such work, goes against the Gospel:\" whoso being infirm in mind hears and believes this, that person, not for that he so bestows all his time, but for that he so erreth, must be mourned over.","title":"Of the Work of Monks.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_44_book_x_of_the_spirit_of_accidie_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"IN the Epistle to the Ephesians also he thus gives a charge on this subject of work, saying: \"He that stole, let him now steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need.\"[fn-31-P3114_1204832:18-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles too we find that he not only taught this, but actually practised it himself.

For we thus read: \"After this, Paul departing from Athens came to Corinth; and finding a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, and Priscilla his wife, he came to them because they were of the same trade; and abode with them, and worked: for they were tent-makers by trade.\"[fn-31-P3115_1205429:19-nf] ","title":"Book X.
