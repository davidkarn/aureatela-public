Origen quotes from it, and Tertullian is supposed to have borrowed from it one of his expositions, as will be noted in its place. Lardner clears it from charges of Ebionitism,[fn-2-P261_13603:4-nf] but thinks the author was so far in accord with that heresy as to use expressions savouring of \"Unitarianism.\" Of this charge he is not justly susceptible, it appears to me: quite otherwise. If we can imagine Trypho coming to the light after his kindly parting with Justin,[fn-2-P262_13955:5-nf] I can conceive of such a man as the author of this work. He is a Christian awakening to the real purport of the Old-Testament Scriptures, and anxious to lead rather than drive his brethren after the flesh to the discovery of Him \"concerning whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write: \"not a \"Judaizing Christian,\" as Cave imagined, but the reverse,-a Christianizing Jew. Now, I must think that such a writer would weave into his plan many accepted traditions of the Jews and many Rabbinical expositions of the sacred writers. He was doubtless acquainted with that remarkable passage in the Revelation in which the patriarchs are so honourably named,[fn-2-P263_14656:6-nf] and with that corresponding passage which seems to unite the twelve patriarchs with the twelve apostles.[fn-2-P264_14794:7-nf] St. Paul's claim for the twelve tribes before Agrippa[fn-2-P265_14898:8-nf] would naturally impress itself on such a mind. Whether the product of such a character with such a disposition would naturally be such an affectionate and filial attempt as this to identify the religion of the Crucified with the faith of the Jewish fathers,[fn-2-P266_15173:9-nf] may be judged of by my reader.

Therefore they harass and torment them with studied kinds of punishments, and think it little to kill those whom they hate, unless cruelty also mocks their bodies. But if any through fear of pain or death, or by their own perfidy, have deserted the heavenly oath,[fn-18-P1867_744091:73-nf] and have consented to deadly sacrifices, these they praise and load[fn-18-P1868_744194:74-nf] with honours, that by their ample they may allure others. But upon those who have highly esteemed their faith, and have not denied that they are worshippers of God, they fall with all the strength of their butchery, as though they thirsted for blood; and they call them desperate,[fn-18-P1869_744489:75-nf] because they by no means spare their body; as though anything could be more desperate, than to torture and tear in pieces him whom you know to be innocent. Thus no sense of shame remains among those from whom all kind feeling is absent, and they retort upon just men reproaches which are befitting to themselves. For they call them impious, being themselves forsooth pious, and shrinking from the shedding of human blood; whereas, if they would consider their own acts, and the acts of those whom they condemn as impious, they would now understand how false they are, and more deserving of all those things which they either say or do against the good. For they are not of our number, but of theirs who besiege the roads in arms, practise piracy by sea; or if it has not been in their power openly to assail, secretly mix poisons; who kill their wives that they may gain their dowries, or their husbands that they may marry adulterers; who either strangle the sons born from themselves, or if they are too pious, expose them; who restrain their incestuous passions neither from a daughter, nor sister, nor mother, nor priestess; who conspire against their own citizens and country; who do not fear the sack;[fn-18-P1870_745871:76-nf] who, in fine, commit sacrilege, and despoil the temples of the gods whom they worship; and, to speak of things which are light and usually practised by them, who hunt for inheritances, forge wills, either remove or exclude the just heirs; who prostitute their own persons to lust; who, in short, unmindful of what they were born, contend with women in passivity;[fn-18-P1871_746388:77-nf] who, in violation of all propriety,[fn-18-P1872_746548:78-nf] pollute and dishonour the most sacred part of their body; who mutilate themselves, and that which is more impious, in order that they may be priests of religion; who do not even spare their own life, but sell their lives to be taken away in public; who, if they sit as judges, corrupted by a bribe, either destroy the innocent or set free the guilty without punishment; who grasp at the heaven itself by sorceries, as though the earth would not contain their wickedness.

It is not then difficult to see that the devil was conquered, when he who was slain by Him rose again. It is something more, and more profound of comprehension, to see that the devil was conquered when he thought himself to have conquered, that is, when Christ was slain. For then that blood, since it was His who had no sin at all, was poured out for the remission of our sins; that, because the devil deservedly held those whom, as guilty of sin, he bound by the condition of death,he might deservedly loose them through Him, whom, as guilty of no sin, the punishment of death undeservedly affected. The strong man was conquered by this righteousness, and bound with this chain, that his vessels might be spoiled,[fn-16-P1694_844411:36-nf] which with himself and his angels had been vessels of wrath while with him, and might be turned into vessels of mercy.[fn-16-P1695_844550:37-nf] For the Apostle Paul tells us, that these words of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself were spoken from heaven to him when he was first called.

Not this was the reason, else this must have been the case from the beginning: but it was because of the evils done to the Apostles-and God had borne long with them; but, when they pressed upon them, a great famine ensues, betokening to the Jews the coming woes. \"If it was because of them, in any wise it ought to have stopped (there), when it did exist. What harm had the Gentiles done, that they should have their share in the evils? They ought rather to have been marked as approved (eudokimhsai), because they were doing their part, were slaying, punishing, taking vengeance, persecuting on every side. And mark also at what time the famine comes: precisely when the Gentiles were thenceforth added to the Church. But if, as you say, it was because of the evils (done by the Jews), these ought to have been exempted.\" How so? Christ, forestalling this objection, said, \"Ye shall have tribulation.\" (John xvi. 33.) (It is) just as if you should say, They ought not to have been scourged either. \"Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea.\" (v. 29.) Mark how the famine becomes to them the means of salvation, an occasion of alms-giving, a harbinger of many blessing. And (so it might have been) to you, one may say, if you were so minded, but ye would not. But it is predicted, that they might be prepared beforehand for almsgiving. \"Unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea;\" for they were enduring great hardships, but before this, they were not suffering from famine. \"Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.\" (v. 30.)

But[fn-10-P1058_998626:5-nf] here of necessity (this was the case). \"And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there would be great dearth throughout the world, which also came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.\" (v. 28.) \"By the Spirit,\" it says: for; that they may not imagine that this was the reason why the famine came, (namely) because Christianity was come in, because the demons were departed, the Holy Ghost foretells it: this, however, was nothing wonderful, for in fact Christ predicted it. Not this was the reason, else this must have been the case from the beginning: but it was because of the evils done to the Apostles-and God had borne long with them; but, when they pressed upon them, a great famine ensues, betokening to the Jews the coming woes. \"If it was because of them, in any wise it ought to have stopped (there), when it did exist. What harm had the Gentiles done, that they should have their share in the evils? They ought rather to have been marked as approved (eudokimhsai), because they were doing their part, were slaying, punishing, taking vengeance, persecuting on every side. And mark also at what time the famine comes: precisely when the Gentiles were thenceforth added to the Church. But if, as you say, it was because of the evils (done by the Jews), these ought to have been exempted.\" How so? Christ, forestalling this objection, said, \"Ye shall have tribulation.\" (John xvi. 33.) (It is) just as if you should say, They ought not to have been scourged either. \"Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea.\" (v. 29.) Mark how the famine becomes to them the means of salvation, an occasion of alms-giving, a harbinger of many blessing. And (so it might have been) to you, one may say, if you were so minded, but ye would not. But it is predicted, that they might be prepared beforehand for almsgiving. \"Unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea;\" for they were enduring great hardships, but before this, they were not suffering from famine. \"Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.\" (v. 30.) Do you mark them, that no sooner do they believe than they bring forth fruit, not only for their own but for those afar off? And Barnabas is sent and Saul, to minister (the same.) Of this occasion ('Entauqa) he says (to the Galatians), \"And James, Cephas, and John gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, only\" (they would) \"that we should remember the poor.\" (Gal. ii. 9.)

Now the apostles had nothing else to do, at least among the Jews, than to-explain[fn-100-P10049_2794328:253-nf] the Old Testament and confirm[fn-100-P10050_2794377:254-nf] the New, and above all, to preach God in Christ. Consequently they introduced nothing new concerning the resurrection, besides announcing it to the glory of Christ: in every other respect it had been already received in simple and intelligent faith, without any question as to what sort of resurrection it was to be, and without encountering any other opponents than the Sadducees. So much easier was it to deny the resurrection altogether, than to understand it in an alien sense. You find Paul confessing his faith before the chief priests, under the shelter of the chief captain,[fn-100-P10051_2794980:255-nf] among the Sadducees and the Pharisees: \"Men and brethren,\" he says, \"I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am now called in question by you,\"[fn-100-P10052_2795187:256-nf] -referring, of course, to the nation's hope; in order to avoid, in his present condition, as an apparent transgressor of the law, being thought to approach to the Sadducees in opinion on the most important article of the faith-even the resurrection. That belief, therefore, in the resurrection which he would not appear to impair, he really confirmed in the opinion of the Pharisees, since he rejected the views of the Sadducees, who denied it. In like manner, before Agrippa also, he says that he was advancing \"none other things than those which the prophets had announced.\"[fn-100-P10053_2795786:257-nf] He was therefore maintaining just such a resurrection as the prophets had foretold. He mentions also what is written by \"Moses \", touching the resurrection of the dead; (and in so doing) he must have known that it would be a rising in the body, since requisition will have to be made therein of the blood of man.[fn-100-P10054_2796121:258-nf] He declared it then to be of such a character as the Pharisees had admitted it, and such as the Lord had Himself maintained it, and such too as the Sadducees refused to believe it-such refusal leading them indeed to an absolute rejection of the whole verity. Nor had the Athenians previously understood Paul to announce any other resurrection.[fn-100-P10055_2796487:259-nf] They had, in fact, derided his announcement; but they would have indulged no such derision if they had heard from him nothing but the restoration of the soul, for they would have received that as the very common anticipation of their own native philosophy. But when the preaching of the resurrection, of which they had previously not heard, by its absolute novelty excited the heathen, and a not unnatural incredulity in so wonderful a matter began to harass the simple faith with many discussions, then the apostle took care in almost every one of his writings to strengthen men's belief of this Christian hope, pointing out that there was such a hope, and that it had not as yet been realized, and that it would be in the body,-a point which was the especial object of inquiry, and, what was besides a doubtful question, not in a body of a different kind from ours.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":26,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_33_on_our_lord_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"27.

For, lo! the sun also in measure assists the eyes, but beyond measure and out of measure it injures the eyes. And it is not by way of vengeance in wrath that it smites them. For lo! it is the friend of the eyes and beloved of the eyeballs. And this is a marvel; while with its gentle lustre it befriends and assists the eyes; yet by its vehement rays itis hostile to and injures the eyeballs. But if the sun which is here below, and of kindred nature with the eyes that are here below, yet injures them, in vehemence and not in anger, in its proper force and not in wrath; how much more should the light that is from above, akin to the things that are above, by its vehemence injure a man here below who has suddenly gazed upon that which is not akin to his nature? For since Paul might have been injured by the vehemence of this sun to which he was accustomed, if he gazed upon it not according to custom, how much more should he be injured by the glory of that light to which his eyes never had been accustomed? For behold, Daniel also[fn-37-P3770_1217114:30-nf] was melted and poured out on every side before the glory of the angel, whose vehement brightness suddenly shone upon him! and it was not because of the angel's wrath that his human weakness was melted, just as it is not on account of the wrath or hostility of fire that wax is melted before it; but on account of the weakness of the wax it cannot keep firm and stand in presence of fire.

Paul, in the Acts of the Apostles, is recorded to have said to the Areopagites, \"I perceive that ye are more than ordinarily religious. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with the inscription, To The Unknown God. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you. God, that made the world and all things therein, seeing that He is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though He needed anything, seeing He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; and hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him; though He be not far from every one of us: for in Him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we also are His offspring.\"[fn-52-P5204_1568452:208-nf] Whence it is evident that the apostle, by availing himself of poetical examples from the Phenomena of Aratus, approves of what had been well spoken by the Greeks; and intimates that, by the unknown God, God the Creator was in a roundabout way worshipped by the Greeks; but that it was necessary by positive knowledge to apprehend and learn Him by the Son. \"Wherefore, then, I send thee to the Gentiles,\" it is said, \"to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith which is in Me.\"[fn-52-P5205_1569109:209-nf] Such, then, are the eyes of the blind which are opened. The knowledge of the Father by the Son is the comprehension of the \"Greek circumlocution; \"[fn-52-P5206_1569283:210-nf] and to turn from the power of Satan is to change from sin, through which bondage was produced. We do not, indeed, receive absolutely all philosophy, but that of which Socrates[fn-52-P5207_1569516:211-nf] speaks in Plato. \"For there are (as they say) in the mysteries many bearers of the thyrsus, but few bacchanals; \"meaning, \"that many are called, but few chosen.\" He accordingly plainly adds: \"These, in my opinion, are none else than those who have philosophized right; to belong to whose number, I myself have left nothing undone in life, as far as I could, but have endeavoured in every way. Whether we have endeavoured rightly and achieved aught, we shall know when we have gone there, if God will, a little afterwards.\" Does he not then seem to declare from the Hebrew Scriptures the righteous man's hope, through faith, after death? And in Demodocus[fn-52-P5208_1570227:212-nf] (if that is really the work of Plato): \"And do not imagine that I call it philosophizing to spend life pottering about the arts, or learning many things, but something different; since I, at least, would consider this a disgrace.\" For he knew, I reckon, \"that the knowledge of many things does not educate the mind,\"[fn-52-P5209_1570968:213-nf] according to Heraclitus. And in the fifth book of the Republic.[fn-52-P5210_1571130:214-nf] he says, \"Shall we then call all these, and the others which study such things, and those who apply themselves to the meaner arts, philosophers? `By no means, 'I said, `but like philosophers.'`And whom, 'said he, `do you call true? '`Those, 'said I, `who delight in the contemplation of truth. For philosophy is not in geometry, with its postulates and hypotheses; nor in music, which is conjectural; nor in astronomy, crammed full of physical, fluid, and probable causes. But the knowledge of the good and truth itself are requisite,-what is good being one thing, and the ways to the good another.'\"[fn-52-P5211_1571763:215-nf] So that he does not allow that the curriculum of training suffices for the good, but co-operates in rousing and training the soul to intellectual objects. Whether, then, they say that the Greeks gave forth some utterances of the true philosophy by accident, it is the accident of a divine administration (for no one will, for the sake of the present argument with us, deify chance); or by good fortune, good fortune is not unforeseen. Or were one, on the other hand, to say that the Greeks possessed a natural conception of these things, we know the one Creator of nature; just as we also call righteousness natural; or that they had a common intellect, let us reflect who is its father, and what righteousness is in the mental economy. For were one to name \"prediction,\"[fn-52-P5212_1572659:216-nf] and assign as its cause \"combined utterance,\"[fn-52-P5213_1572728:217-nf] he specifies forms of prophecy.
