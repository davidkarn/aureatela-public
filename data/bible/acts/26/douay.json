{"verses":["Then Agrippa said to Paul:  Thou art permitted to speak for\nthyself.  Then Paul, stretching forth his hand, began to make his\nanswer.","I think myself happy, O king Agrippa, that I am to answer for\nmyself this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am\naccused by the Jews.","Especially as thou knowest all, both customs and questions, that\nare among the Jews.  Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.","And my life indeed from my youth, which was from the beginning\namong my own nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews do know:","Having known me from the beginning (if they will give testimony)\nthat according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived, a\nPharisee.","And now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to the\nfathers, do I stand subject to judgment:","Unto which, our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to\ncome.  For which hope, O king, I am accused by the Jews.","Why should it be thought a thing incredible that God should raise\nthe dead?","And I indeed did formerly think that I ought to do many things\ncontrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.","Which also I did at Jerusalem:  and many of the saints did I shut\nup in prison, having received authority of the chief priests.  And when\nthey were put to death, I brought the sentence.","And oftentimes punishing them, in every synagogue, I compelled\nthem to blaspheme:  and being yet more mad against them, I persecuted\nthem even unto foreign cities.","Whereupon, when I was going to Damascus with authority and\npermission of the chief priest,","At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above\nthe brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that were in\ncompany with me.","And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice\nspeaking to me in the Hebrew tongue:  Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou\nme?  It is hard for thee to kick against the good.","And I said:  Who art thou, Lord?  And the Lord answered:  I am\nJesus whom thou persecutest.","But rise up and stand upon thy feet:  for to this end have I\nappeared to thee, that I may make thee a minister and a witness of\nthose things which thou hast seen and of those things wherein I will\nappear to thee,","Delivering thee from the people and from the nations unto which\nnow I send thee:","To open their eyes, that they may be converted from darkness to\nlight and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive\nforgiveness of sins and a lot among the saints, by the faith that is in\nme.","Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to the heavenly\nvision.","But to them first that are at Damascus and at Jerusalem, and\nunto all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles did I preach, that\nthey should do penance and turn to God, doing works worthy of penance.","For this cause, the Jews, when I was in the temple, having\napprehended me, went about to kill me.","But being aided by the help of God, I stand unto this day,\nwitnessing both to small and great, saying no other thing than those\nwhich the prophets and Moses did say should come to pass:","That Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that\nshould rise from the dead and should shew light to the people and to\nthe Gentiles.","As he spoke these things and made his answer, Festus said with a\nloud voice:  Paul, thou art beside thyself:  much learning doth make thee\nmad.","And Paul said:  I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I speak\nwords of truth and soberness.","For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with\nconfidence.  For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden\nfrom him.  For neither was any of these things done in a corner.","Believest thou the prophets, O king Agrippa?  I know that thou\nbelievest.","And Agrippa said to Paul:  In a little thou persuadest me to\nbecome a Christian.","And Paul said:  I would to God that both in a little and in much,\nnot only thou, but also all that hear me this day, should become such\nas I also am, except these bands.","And the king rose up, and the governor and Bernice and they that\nsat with them.","And when they were gone aside, they spoke among themselves,\nsaying:  This man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bands.","And Agrippa said to Festus:  This man might have been set at\nliberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar."]}
