But great and holy men, although they at the time knew excellently well that that death which separates the soul from the body is not to be dreaded, yet, in accordance with the sentiment of those who might fear it, punished some sins with death, both because the living were struck with a salutary fear, and because it was not death itself that would injure those who were being punished with death, but sin, which might be increased if they continued to live. They did not judge rashly on whom God had bestowed such a power of judging. Hence it is that Elijah inflicted death on many, both with his own hand[fn-5-P510_175839:190-nf] and by calling down fire from heaven;[fn-5-P511_175903:191-nf] as was done also without rashness by many other great and godlike men, in the same spirit of concern for the good of humanity. And when the disciples had quoted an example from this Elias, mentioning to the Lord what had been done by him, in order that He might give to themselves also the power of calling down fire from heaven to consume those who would not show Him hospitality, the Lord reproved in them, not the example of the holy prophet, but their ignorance in respect to taking vengeance, their knowledge being as yet elementary;[fn-5-P512_176464:192-nf] perceiving that they did not in love desire correction, but in hated desired revenge. Accordingly, after He had taught them what it was to love one's neighbour as oneself, and when the Holy Spirit had been poured out, whom, at the end of ten days after His ascension, He sent from above, as He had promised,[fn-5-P513_176795:193-nf] there were not wanting such acts of vengeance, although much more rarely than in the Old Testament. For there, for the most part, as servants they were kept down by fear; but here mostly as free they were nourished by love. For at the words of the Apostle Peter also, Ananias and his wife, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, fell down dead, and were not raised to life again, but buried.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"10. If, therefore, He is said to be sent, in so far as He appeared outwardly in the bodily creature, who inwardly in His spiritual nature is always hidden from the eyes of mortals, it is now easy to understand also of the Holy Spirit why He too is said to be sent. For in due time a certain outward appearance of the creature was wrought, wherein the Holy Spirit might be visibly shown; whether when He descended upon the Lord Himself in a bodily shape as a dove,[fn-4-P490_177050:35-nf] or when, ten days having past since His ascension, on the day of Pentecost a sound came suddenly from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and cloven tongues like as of fire were seen upon them, and it sat upon each of them.[fn-4-P491_177295:36-nf] This operation, visibly exhibited, and presented to mortal eyes, is called the sending of the Holy Spirit; not that His very substance appeared, in which He himself also is invisible and unchangeable, like the Father and the Son, but that the hearts of men, touched by things seen outwardly, might be turned from the manifestation in time of Him as coming to His hidden eternity as ever present.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"11. It is, then, for this reason nowhere written, that the Father is greater than the Holy Spirit, or that the Holy Spirit is less than God the Father, because the creature in which the Holy Spirit was to appear was not taken in the same way as the Son of man was taken, as the form in which the person of the Word of God Himself should be set forth not that He might possess the word of God, as other holy and wise men have possessed it, but \"above His fellows;\"[fn-4-P495_178258:37-nf] not certainly that He possessed the word more than they, so as to be of more surpassing wisdom than the rest were, but that He was the very Word Himself. For the word in the flesh is one thing, and the Word made flesh is another; i.e. the word in man is one thing, the Word that is man is another. For flesh is put for man, where it is said, \"The Word was made flesh;\"[fn-4-P496_178643:38-nf] and again, \"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\"[fn-4-P497_178719:39-nf] For it does not mean flesh without soul and without mind; but \"all flesh,\" is the same as if it were said, every man. The creature, then, in which the Holy Spirit should appear, was not so taken, as that flesh and human form were taken, of the Virgin Mary. For the Spirit did not beatify the dove, or the wind, or the fire, and join them for ever to Himself and to His person in unity and \"fashion.\"[fn-4-P498_179137:40-nf] Nor, again, is the nature of the Holy Spirit mutable and changeable; so that these things were not made of the creature, but He himself was turned and changed first into one and then into another, as water is changed into ice. But these things appeared at the seasons at which they ought to have appeared, the creature serving the Creator, and being changed and converted at the command of Him who remains immutably in Himself, in order to signify and manifest Him in such way as it was fit He should be signified and manifested to mortal men. Accordingly, although that dove is called the Spirit;[fn-4-P499_180250:41-nf] and in speaking of that fire, \"There appeared unto them,\" he says, \"cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance;[fn-5-P500_180480:42-nf] in order to show that the Spirit was manifested by that fire, as by the dove; yet we cannot call the Holy Spirit both God and a dove, or both God and fire, in the same way as we call the Son both God and man; nor as we call the Son the Lamb of God; which not only John the Baptist says, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\"[fn-5-P501_180813:43-nf] but also John the Evangelist sees the Lamb slain in the Apocalypse.[fn-5-P502_180899:44-nf] For that prophetic vision was not shown to bodily eyes through bodily forms, but in the spirit through spiritual images of bodily things. But whosoever saw that dove and that fire, saw them with their eyes. Although it may perhaps be disputed concerning the fire, whether it was seen by the eyes or in the spirit, on account of the form of the sentence. For the text does not say, They saw cloven tongues like fire, but, \"There appeared to them.\" But we are not wont to say with the same meaning, It appeared to me; as we say, I saw. And in those spiritual visions of corporeal images the usual expressions are, both, It appeared to me; and, I saw: but in those things which are shown to the eyes through express corporeal forms, the common expression is not, It appeared to me; but, I saw. There may, therefore, be a question raised respecting that fire, how it was seen; whether within in the spirit as it were outwardly, or really outwardly before the eyes of the flesh. But of that dove, which is said to have descended in a bodily form, no one ever doubted that it was seen by the eyes. Nor, again, as we call the Son a Rock (for it is written, \"And that Rock was Christ\"[fn-5-P503_182093:45-nf] ), can we so call the Spirits dove or fire. For that rock was a thing already created, and after the mode of its action was called by the name of Christ, whom it signified; like the stone placed under Jacob's head, and also anointed, which he took in order to signify the Lord;[fn-5-P504_182390:46-nf] or as Isaac was Christ, when he carried the wood for the sacrifice of himself.[fn-5-P505_182492:47-nf] A particular significative action was added to those already existing things; they did not, as that dove and fire, suddenly come into being in order simply so to signify. The dove and the fire, indeed, seem to me more like that flame which appeared to Moses in the bush,[fn-5-P506_182782:48-nf] or that pillar which the people followed in the wilderness,[fn-5-P507_182860:49-nf] or the thunders and lightnings which came when the Law was given in the mount.[fn-5-P508_182962:50-nf] For the corporeal form of these things came into being for the very purpose, that it might signify something, and then pass away.[fn-5-P509_183110:51-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"26. But as far as concerns our present undertaking, neither on Mount Sinai do I see how it appears, by all those things which were fearfully displayed to the senses of mortal men, whether God the Trinity spake, or the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit severally. But if it is allowable, without rash assertion, to venture upon a modest and hesitating conjecture from this passage, if it is possible to understand it of one person of the Trinity, why do we not rather understand the Holy Spirit to be spoken of, since the Law itself also, which was given there, is said to have been written upon tables of stone with the finger of God,[fn-5-P589_218442:97-nf] by which name we know the Holy Spirit to be signified in the Gospel.[fn-5-P590_218529:98-nf] And fifty days are numbered from the slaying of the lamb and the celebration of the Passover until the day in which these things began to be done in Mount Sinai; just as after the passion of our Lord fifty days are numbered from His resurrection, and then came the Holy Spirit which the Son of God had promised. And in that very coming of His, which we read of in the Acts of the Apostles, there appeared cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them:[fn-5-P591_219014:99-nf] which agrees with Exodus, where it is written, \"And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire;\" and a little after, \"And the sight of the glory of the Lord,\" he says, \"was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.\"[fn-5-P592_219331:100-nf] Or if these things were therefore wrought because neither the Father nor the Son could be there presented in that mode without the Holy Spirit, by whom the Law itself must needs be written; then we know doubtless that God appeared there, not by His own substance, which remains invisible and unchangeable, but by the appearance above mentioned of the creature; but that some special person of the Trinity appeared, distinguished by a proper mark, as far as my capacity of understanding reaches, we do not see.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"31. For as to that, too, which follows in Exodus, \"I will cover thee with mine hand while I pass by, and I will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back parts;\" many Israelites, of whom Moses was then a figure, believed in the Lord after His resurrection, as if His hand had been taken off from their eyes, and they now saw His back parts. And hence the evangelist also mentions that prophesy of Isaiah, \"Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes.\"[fn-6-P631_230809:129-nf] Lastly, in the Psalm, that is not unreasonably understood to be said in their person, \"For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me.\" \"By day,\" perhaps, when He performed manifest miracles, yet was not acknowledged by them; but \"by night,\" when He died in suffering, when they thought still more certainly that, like any one among men, He was cut off and brought to an end. But since, when He had already passed by, so that His back parts were seen, upon the preaching to them by the Apostle Peter that it behoved Christ to suffer and rise again, they were pricked in their hearts with the grief of repentance,[fn-6-P632_231456:130-nf] that that might come to pass among the baptized which is said in the beginning of that Psalm, \"Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;\" therefore, after it had been said, \"Thy hand is heavy upon me,\" the Lord, as it were, passing by, so that now He removed His hand, and His back parts were seen, there follows the voice of one who grieves and confesses and receives remission of sins by faith in the resurrection of the Lord: \"My moisture,\" he says, \"is turned into the drought of summer.

In the beginning the earth was without form and void, there was no dazzling sun or pale moon, there were no glittering stars. There was nothing but matter inorganic and invisible, and even this was lost in abysmal depths and shrouded in a distorting gloom. The Spirit of God above moved, as a charioteer, over the face of the waters,[fn-28-P2879_762983:2051-nf] and produced from them the infant world, a type of the Christian child that is drawn from the laver of baptism. A firmament is constructed between heaven and earth, and to this is allotted the name heaven,-in the Hebrew Shamayim or `what comes out of the waters,'-[fn-28-P2880_763268:2052-nf] and the waters which are above the heavens are parted from the others to the praise of God. Wherefore also in the vision of the prophet Ezekiel there is seen above the cherubim a crystal stretched forth,[fn-28-P2881_763585:2053-nf] that is, the compressed and denser waters. The first living beings come out of the waters; and believers soar out of the layer with wings to heaven.

Pharaoh and his host, loth to allow God's people to leave Egypt, are overwhelmed in the Red Sea figuring thereby our baptism. His destruction is thus described in the book of Psalms: \"Thou didst endow the sea with virtue through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters: thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces.\"[fn-28-P2889_765053:2061-nf] For this reason adders and scorpions haunt dry places[fn-28-P2890_765139:2062-nf] and whenever they come near water behave as if rabid or insane.[fn-28-P2891_765228:2063-nf] As wood sweetens Marah so that seventy palm-trees are watered by its streams, so the cross makes the waters of the law lifegiving to the seventy who are Christ's apostles.[fn-28-P2892_765444:2064-nf] It is Abraham and Isaac who dig wells, the Philistines who try to prevent them.[fn-28-P2893_765561:2065-nf] Beersheba too, the city of the oath,[fn-28-P2894_765637:2066-nf] and [Gihon], the scene of Solomon's coronation,[fn-28-P2895_765708:2067-nf] derive their names from springs. It is beside a well that Eliezer finds Rebekah.[fn-28-P2896_765833:2068-nf] Rachel too is a drawer of water and wins a kiss thereby[fn-28-P2897_765928:2069-nf] from the supplanter[fn-28-P2898_765987:2070-nf] Jacob. When the daughters of the priests of Midian are in a strait to reach the well, Moses opens a way for them and delivers them from outrage.[fn-28-P2899_766157:2071-nf] The Lord's forerunner at Salem (a name which means peace or perfection) makes ready the people for Christ with spring-water.[fn-29-P2900_766319:2072-nf] The Saviour Himself does not preach the kingdom of heaven until by His baptismal immersion He has cleansed the Jordan.[fn-29-P2901_766461:2073-nf] Water is the matter of His first miracle[fn-29-P2902_766542:2074-nf] and it is from a well that the Samaritan woman is bidden to slake her thirst.[fn-29-P2903_766699:2075-nf] To Nicodemus He secretly says:-\"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.\"[fn-29-P2904_766857:2076-nf] As His earthly course began with water, so it ended with it. His side is pierced by the spear, and blood and water flow forth, twin emblems of baptism and of martyrdom.[fn-29-P2905_767048:2077-nf] After His resurrection also, when sending His apostles to the Gentiles, He commands them to baptize these in the mystery of the Trinity.[fn-29-P2906_767263:2078-nf] The Jewish people repenting of their misdoing are sent forthwith by Peter to be baptized.[fn-29-P2907_767380:2079-nf] Before Sion travails she brings forth children, and a nation is born at once.[fn-29-P2908_767480:2080-nf] Paul the persecutor of the church, that ravening wolf out of Benjamin,[fn-29-P2909_767588:2081-nf] bows his head before Ananias one of Christ's sheep, and only recovers his sight when he applies the remedy of baptism.[fn-29-P2910_767731:2082-nf] By the reading of the prophet the eunuch of Candace the queen of Ethiopia is made ready for the baptism of Christ.[fn-29-P2911_767901:2083-nf] Though it is against nature the Ethiopian does change his skin and the leopard his spots.[fn-29-P2912_768018:2084-nf] Those who have received only John's baptism and have no knowledge of the Holy Spirit are baptized again, lest any should suppose that water unsanctified thereby could suffice for the salvation of either Jew or Gentile.[fn-29-P2913_768261:2085-nf] \"The voice of the Lord isupon the waters ...The Lord is uponmany waters ...the Lord maketh the flood to inhabit it.\"[fn-29-P2914_768398:2086-nf] His \"teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which came up from the washing; whereof everyone bear twins, and none is barren among them.\"[fn-29-P2915_768625:2087-nf] If none is barren among them, all of them must have udders filled with milk and be able to say with the apostle: \"Ye are my little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you;\"[fn-29-P2916_768853:2088-nf] and \"I have fed you with milk and not with meat.\"[fn-29-P2917_768925:2089-nf] And it is to the grace of baptism that the prophecy of Micah refers: \"He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us: he will subdue our iniquities, and will cast all our sins[fn-29-P2918_769130:2090-nf] into the depths of the sea.\"[fn-29-P2919_769207:2091-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1099","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"9.

Moreover, in visiting the holy places so great was the passion and the enthusiasm she exhibited for each, that she could never have torn herself away from one had she not been eager to visit the rest. Before the Cross she threw herself down in adoration as though she beheld the Lord hanging upon it: and when she entered the tomb which was the scene of the Resurrection she kissed the stone which the angel had rolled away from the door of the sepulchre.[fn-39-P3906_1057721:2775-nf] Indeed so ardent was her faith that she even licked with her mouth the very spot on which the Lord's body had lain, like one athirst for the river which he has longed for. What tears she shed there, what groans she uttered, and what grief she poured forth, all Jerusalem knows; the Lord also to whom she prayed knows. Going out thence she made the ascent of Zion; a name which signifies either \"citadel\" or \"watch-tower.\" This formed the city which David formerly stormed and afterwards rebuilt.[fn-39-P3907_1058243:2776-nf] Of its storming it is written, \"Woe to Ariel, to Ariel\"-that is, God's lion, (and indeed in those days it was extremely strong)-\"the city which David stormed:\"[fn-39-P3908_1058438:2777-nf] and of its rebuilding it is said, \"His foundation is in the holy mountains: the Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.\"[fn-39-P3909_1058616:2778-nf] He does not mean the gates which we see to-day in dust and ashes; the gates he means are those against which hell prevails not[fn-39-P3910_1058784:2779-nf] and through which the multitude of those who believe in Christ enter in.[fn-39-P3911_1058881:2780-nf] There was shewn to her upholding the portico of a church the bloodstained column to which our Lord is said to have been bound when He suffered His scourging.

Let this third book, then, take its beginning at the point to which the second had reached. For after we had arrived at this, I that we desired to show that the Son was not l therefore less than the Father, because the Father sent and the Son was sent; nor the Holy Spirit therefore less than both, because we read in the Gospel that He was sent both by the one and by the other; we undertook then to inquire, since the Son was sent thither, where He already was, for He came into the world, and \"was in the world;\"[fn-6-P662_246260:3-nf] since also the Holy Spirit was sent thither, where Healready was, for \"the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world, and that which containeth all things hath knowledge of the voice;\"[fn-6-P663_246455:4-nf] whether the Lord was therefore \"sent\" because He was born in the flesh so as to be no longer hidden, and, as it were, came forth from the bosom of the Father, and appeared to the eyes of men in the form of a servant; and the Holy Spirit also was therefore \"sent,\" because He too was seen as a dove in a corporeal form,[fn-6-P664_246789:5-nf] and in cloven tongues, like as of fire;[fn-6-P665_246847:6-nf] so that, to be sent, when spoken of them, means to go forth to the sight of mortals in some corporeal form from a spiritual hiding-place; which, because the Father did not, He is said only to have sent, not also to be sent. Our next inquiry was, Why the Father also is not sometimes said to be sent, if He Himself was manifested through those corporeal forms which appeared to the eyes of the ancients. But if the Son was manifested at these times, why should He be said to be \"sent\" so long after, when the fullness of time was come that He should be born of a woman;[fn-6-P666_247431:7-nf] since, indeed, He was sent before also, viz., when He appeared corporeally in those forms? Or if He were not rightly said to be \"sent,\" except when the Word was made flesh;[fn-6-P667_247619:8-nf] why should the Holy Spirit be read of as \"sent,\" of whom such an incarnation never took place? But if neither the Father, nor the Son, but the Holy Spirit was manifested through these ancient appearances; why should He too be said to be \"sent\" now, when He was also sent before in these various manners? Next we subdivided the subject, that it might be handled most carefully, and we made the question threefold, of which one part was explained in the second book, and two remain, which I shall next proceed to discuss. For we have already inquired and determined, that not only the Father, nor only the Son, nor only the Holy Spirit appeared in those ancient corporeal forms and visions. but either indifferently the Lord God, who is understood to be the Trinity itself, or some one person of the Trinity, whichever the text of the narrative might signify, through intimations supplied by the context.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_09_book_iii_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"27. But now, as I think, that which we had undertaken to show in this book has been sufficiently discussed and demonstrated, according to our capacity; and it has been established, both by probable reason, so far as a man, or rather, so far as I am able, and by strength of authority, so far as the divine declarations from the Holy Scriptures have been made clear, that those words and bodily appearances which were given to these ancient fathers of ours before the incarnation of the Saviour, when God was said to appear, were wrought by angels: whether themselves speaking or doing something in the person of God, as we have shown that the prophets also were wont to do, or assuming from the creature that which they themselves were not, wherein God might be shown in a figure to men; which manner of showing also, Scripture teaches by many examples, that the prophets, too, did not omit. It remains, therefore, now for us to consider,-since both in the Lord as born of a virgin, and in the Holy Spirit descending in a corporeal form like a dove.[fn-7-P795_308062:86-nf] and in the tongues like as of fire, which appeared with a sound from heaven on the day of Pentecost, after the ascension of the Lord,[fn-7-P796_308216:87-nf] it was not the Word of God Himself by His own substance, in which He is equal and eternal with the Father, nor the Spirit of the Father and of the Son by His own substance, in which He Himself also is equal and co-eternal with both, but assuredly a creature, such as could be formed and exist in these fashions, which appeared to corporeal and mortal senses,-it remains, I say, to consider what difference there is between these manifestations and those which were proper to the Son of God and to the Holy Spirit, although wrought by the visible creature;[fn-7-P797_308791:88-nf] which subject we shall more conveniently begin in another book.

As, therefore, the Father begat, the Son is begotten; so the Father sent, the Son was sent. But in like manner as He who begat and He who was begotten, so both He who sent and He who was sent, are one, since the Father and the Son are one.[fn-9-P985_386032:111-nf] So also the Holy Spirit is one with them, since these three are one. For as to be born, in respect to the Son, means to be from the Father; so to be sent, in respect to the Son, means to be known to be from the Father. And as to be the gift of God in respect to the Holy Spirit, means to proceed from the Father; so to be sent, is to be known to proceed from the Father. Neither can we say that the Holy Spirit does not also proceed from the Son, for the same Spirit is not without reason said to be the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son.[fn-9-P986_386597:112-nf] Nor do I see what else He intended to signify, when He breathed on the face of the disciples, and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P987_386852:113-nf] For that bodily breathing, proceeding from the body with the feeling of bodily touching, was not the substance of the Holy Spirit, but a declaration by a fitting sign, that the Holy Spirit proceeds not only from the Father, but also from the Son. For the veriest of madmen would not say, that it was one Spirit which He gave when He breathed on them, and another which He sent after His ascension.[fn-9-P988_387270:114-nf] For the Spirit of God is one, the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, the Holy Spirit, who worketh all in all.[fn-9-P989_387403:115-nf] But that He was given twice was certainly a significant economy, which we will discuss in its place, as far as the Lord may grant. That then which the Lord says,-\"Whom I will send unto you from the Father,\"[fn-9-P990_387633:116-nf] -shows the Spirit to be both of the Father and of the Son; because, also, when He had said, \"Whom the Father will send,\" He added also, \"in my name.\"[fn-9-P991_387803:117-nf] Yet He did not say, Whom the Father will send from me, as He said, \"Whom Iwill send unto you from the Father,\"-showing, namely, that the Father is the beginning (principium) of the whole divinity, or if it is better so expressed, deity.[fn-9-P992_388061:118-nf] He, therefore, who proceeds from the Father and from the Son, is referred back to Him from whom the Son was born (natus). And that which the evangelist says, \"For the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified;\"[fn-9-P993_389484:119-nf] how is this to be understood, unless because the special giving or sending of the Holy Spirit after the glorification of Christ was to be such as it had never been before? For it was not previously none at all, but it had not been such as this. For if the Holy Spirit was not given before, wherewith were the prophets who spoke filled? Whereas the Scripture plainly says, and shows in many places, that they spake by the Holy Spirit. Whereas, also, it is said of John the Baptist, \"And he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.\" And his father Zacharias is found to have been filled with the Holy Ghost, so as to say such things of him. And Mary, too, was filled with the Holy Ghost, so as to foretell such things of the Lord, whom she was bearing in her womb.[fn-9-P994_390293:120-nf] And Simeon and Anna were filled with the Holy Spirit, so as to acknowledge the greatness of the little child Christ.[fn-9-P995_390437:121-nf] How, then, was \"the Spirit not yet given, since Jesus was not yet glorified,\" unless because that giving, or granting, or mission of the Holy Spirit was to have a certain speciality of its own in its very advent, such as never was before? For we read nowhere that men spoke in tongues which they did not know, through the Holy Spirit coming upon them; as happened then, when it was needful that His coming should be made plain by visible signs, in order to show that the whole world, and all nations constituted with different tongues, should believe in Christ through the gift of the Holy Spirit, to fulfill that which is sung in the Psalm, \"There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard; their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"[fn-9-P996_391256:122-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"But with respect to the sensible showing of the Holy Spirit, whether by the shape of a dove,[fn-10-P1001_391928:123-nf] or by fiery tongues,[fn-10-P1002_391971:124-nf] when the subjected and subservient creature by temporal motions and forms manifested His substance co-eternal with the Father and the Son, and alike with them unchangeable, while it was not united so as to be one person with Him, as the flesh was which the Word was made;[fn-10-P1003_392261:125-nf] I do not dare to say that nothing of the kind was done aforetime. But I would boldly say, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, of one and the same substance, God the Creator, the Omnipotent Trinity, work indivisibly; but that this cannot be indivisibly manifested by the creature, which is far inferior, and least of all by the bodily creature: just as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit cannot be named by our words, which certainly are bodily sounds, except in their own proper intervals of time, divided by a distinct separation, which intervals the proper syllables of each word occupy. Since in their proper substance wherein they are, the three are one, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the very same, by no temporal motion, above the whole creature, without any interval of time and place, and at once one and the same from eternity to eternity, as it were eternity itself, which is not without truth and charity. But, in my words, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are separated, and cannot be named at once, and occupy their own proper places separately invisible letters. And as, when I name my memory, and intellect, and will, each name refers to each severally, but yet each is uttered by all three; for there is no one of these three names that is not uttered by both my memory and my intellect and my will together [by the soul as a whole]; so the Trinity together wrought both the voice of the Father, and the flesh of the Son, and the dove of the Holy Spirit, while each of these things is referred severally to each person. And by this similitude it is in some degree discernible, that the Trinity, which is inseparable in itself, is manifested separably by the appearance of the visible creature; and that the operation of the Trinity is also inseparable in each severally of those things which are said to pertain properly to the manifesting of either the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_06_book_i_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"`Wherefore the most eminent of the ministers of God in all the churches which have filled Europe, Africa, and Asia, were convened.

The prelate[fn-2-P267_79759:50-nf] of the imperial city was absent on account of age; but some of his presbyters were present and filled his place.

If, therefore, for the liberty of dying men, and for the desire of human praise which is sought after by mortals, sons could be put to death by a father, what great thing is it, if, for the true liberty which has made us free from the dominion of sin, and death, and the devil,-not through the desire of human praise, but through the earnest desire of fleeing men, not from King Tarquin, but from demons and the prince of the demons,-we should, I do not say put to death our sons, but reckon among our sons Christ's poor ones? If, also, another Roman chief, surnamed Torquatus, slew his son, not because he fought against his country, but because, being challenged by an enemy, he through youthful impetuosity fought, though for his country, yet contrary to orders which he his father had given as general; and this he did, notwithstanding that his son was victorious, lest there should be more evil in the example of authority despised, than good in the glory of slaying an enemy;-if, I say, Torquatus acted thus, wherefore should they boast themselves, who, for the laws of a celestial country, despise all earthly good things, which are loved far less than sons? If Furius Camillus, who was condemned by those who envied him, notwithstanding that he had thrown off from the necks of his countrymen the yoke of their most bitter enemies, the Veientes, again delivered his ungrateful country from the Gauls, because he had no other in which he could have better opportunities for living a life of glory;-if Camillus did thus, why should he be extolled as having done some great thing, who, having, it may be, suffered in the church at the hands of carnal enemies most grievous and dishonoring injury, has not betaken himself to heretical enemies, or himself raised some heresy against her, but has rather defended her, as far as he was able, from the most pernicious perversity of heretics, since there is not another church, I say not in which one can live a life of glory, but in which eternal life can be obtained? If Mucius, in order that peace might be made with King Porsenna, who was pressing the Romans with a most grievous war, when he did not succeed in slaying Porsenna, but slew another by mistake for him, reached forth his right hand and laid it on a red-hot altar, saying that many such as he saw him to be had conspired for his destruction, so that Porsenna, terrified at his daring, and at the thought of a conspiracy of such as he, without any delay recalled all his warlike purposes, and made peace;-if, I say, Mucius did this, who shall speak of his meritorious claims to the kingdom of heaven, if for it he may have given to the flames not one hand, but even his whole body, and that not by his own spontaneous act, but because he was persecuted by another? If Curtius, spurring on his steed, threw himself all armed into a precipitous gulf, obeying the oracles of their gods, which had commanded that the Romans should throw into that gulf the best thing which they possessed, and they could only understand thereby that, since they excelled in men and arms, the gods had commanded that an armed man should be cast headlong into that destruction;-if he did this, shall we say that that man has done a great thing for the eternal city who may have died by a like death, not, however, precipitating himself spontaneously into a gulf, but having suffered this death at the hands of some enemy of his faith, more especially when he has received from his Lord, who is also King of his country, a more certain oracle, \"Fear not them who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul?\"[fn-10-P1009_515089:32-nf] If the Decii dedicated themselves to death, consecrating themselves in a form of words, as it were, that falling, and pacifying by their blood the wrath of the gods, they might be the means of delivering the Roman army;-if they did this, let not the holy martyrs carry themselves proudly, as though they had done some meritorious thing for a share in that country where are eternal life and felicity, if even to the shedding of their blood, loving not only the brethren for whom it was shed, but, according as had been commanded them, even their enemies by whom it was being shed, they have vied with one another in faith of love and love of faith. If Marcus Pulvillus, when engaged in dedicating a temple to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, received with such indifference the false intelligence which was brought to him of the death of his son, with the intention of so agitating him that he should go away, and thus the glory of dedicating the temple should fall to his colleague; -if he received that intelligence with such indifference that he even ordered that his son should be cast out unburied, the love of glory having overcome in his heart the grief of bereavement, how shall any one affirm that he had done a great thing for the preaching of the gospel, by which the citizens of the heavenly city are delivered from divers errors and gathered together from divers wanderings, to whom his Lord has said, when anxious about the burial of his father, \"Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead?\"[fn-10-P1010_516610:33-nf] Regulus, in order not to break his oath, even with his most cruel enemies, returned to them from Rome itself, because (as he is said to have replied to the Romans when they wished to retain him) he could not have the dignity of an honorable citizen at Rome after having been a slave to the Africans, and the Carthaginians put him to death with the utmost tortures, because he had spoken against them in the senate. If Regulus acted thus, what tortures are not to be despised for the sake of good faith toward that country to whose beatitude faith itself leads? Or what will a man have rendered to the Lord for all He has bestowed upon him, if, for the faithfulness he owes to Him, he shall have suffered such things as Regulus suffered at the hands of his most ruthless enemies for the good faith which he owed to them? And how shall a Christian dare vaunt himself of his voluntary poverty, which he has chosen in order that during the pilgrimage of this life he may walk the more disencumbered on the way which leads to the country where the true riches are, even God Himself;-how, I say, shall he vaunt himself for this, when he hears or reads that Lucius Valerius, who died when he was holding the office of consul, was so poor that his funeral expenses were paid with money collected by the people?-or when he hears that Quintius Cincinnatus, who, possessing only four acres of land, and cultivating them with his own hands, was taken from the plough to be made dictator,-an office more honorable even than that of consul,-and that, after having won great glory by conquering the enemy, he preferred notwithstanding to continue in his poverty? Or how shall he boast of having done a great thing, who has not been prevailed upon by the offer of any reward of this world to renounce his connection with that heavenly and eternal country, when he hears that Fabricius could not be prevailed on to forsake the Roman city by the great gifts offered to him by Pyrrhus king of the Epirots, who promised him the fourth part of his kingdom, but preferred to abide there in his poverty as a private individual? For if, when their republic, -that is, the interest of the people, the interest of the country, the common interest, -was most prosperous and wealthy, they themselves were so poor in their own houses, that one of them, who had already been twice a consul, was expelled from that senate of poor men by the censor, because he was discovered to possess ten pounds weight of silverplate,-since, I say, those very men by whose triumphs the public treasury was enriched were so poor, ought not all Christians, who make common property of their riches with a far nobler purpose, even that (according to what is written in the Acts of the Apostles) they may distribute to each one according to his need, and that no one may say that anything is his own, but that all things may be their common possession,[fn-10-P1011_519534:34-nf] -ought they not to understand that they should not vaunt themselves, because they do that to obtain the society of angels, when those men did well-nigh the same thing to preserve the glory of the Romans?","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"134","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"6 For in the Acts of the Apostles, a work universally acknowledged as authentic,[fn-12-P1231_582796:169-nf] it is recorded that all the companions of the apostles sold their possessions and their property and distributed to all according to the necessity of each one, so that no one among them was in want. \"For as many as were possessors of lands or houses,\" as the account says, \"sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them at the apostles' feet, so that distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.\"[fn-12-P1232_583281:170-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"125","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"`Accordingly, these things being thus established, it follows that in the same sense as that which preceded, the words, \"The Lord created me the beginning of his ways, on account of his works,\" must have been spoken.

Julian answered his reproaches by loading him with contumelious epithets: andhe defended himself by words calling him `blind.' `You blind old fool,' said he, `this Galilaean God of yours will never cure you.' For he was accustomed to term Christ `the Galilaean,'[fn-11-P1113_489366:60-nf] and Christians Galilaeans. Maris with still greater boldness replied, `I thank God for bereaving me of my sight, that I might not behold the face of one who has fallen into such awful impiety.' The emperor suffered this to pass without farther notice at that time; but he afterwards had his revenge. Observing that those who suffered martyrdom under the reign of Diocletian were greatly honored by the Christians, and knowing that many among them were eagerly desirous of becoming martyrs, he determined to wreak his vengeance upon them in some other way.

For in the Acts it is written as follows: \"The former treatise have we made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, in the day in which He chose the apostles by the Holy Spirit, and commanded them to preach the gospel. By those to whom He showed Himself alive after His passion by many proofs in the daytime, He was seen forty days, teaching concerning the kingdom of God.

Let us now see when He was sent; for shortly after we read as follows: \"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. And when the sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because every man heard them speak in his own language. And they were all amazed, and marvelled, saying one to another, Are not all these which speak Galilaeans? and how heard we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Armenia, and in Cappadocia, in Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the regions of Africa about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews, natives, Cretes, and Arabians, they heard them speak in their own tongues the wonderful works of God. And they were all amazed, and were in doubt on account of what had happened, saying, What meaneth this? But others, mocking, said, These men are full of new wine.\"[fn-9-P993_509057:12-nf] You see when the Holy Spirit came. What more do you wish?

For example: since that birth, men come from the ends of the earth to see the manger, and the site of the shed. And this the prophet foretold aloud from the first, saying, \"Thou art not the least among the princes of Judah;\" that is, among the heads of tribes. By which expression he comprehended even Jerusalem.[fn-7-P724_229708:7-nf] But not even so have they given heed, although the advantage passes on to themselves. Yea, and because of this the prophets at the beginning discourse nowhere so much of His dignity, as touching the benefit which accrued to them by Him. For so, when the Virgin was bearing the child, he saith, \"Thou shalt call His name Jesus;\"[fn-7-P725_230160:8-nf] and he gives the reason saying, \"for He shall save His people from their sins.\" And the wise men too said not, \"Where is the Son of God?\" but \"He that is born King of the Jews.\" And here again it is not affirmed, \"Out of thee shall come forth\" the Son of God, but \"a Governor, that shall feed my people Israel.\"[fn-7-P726_230489:9-nf] For it was needful to converse with them at first, setting out in a tone of very exceeding condescension, test they should be offended; and to preach what related to their salvation in particular, that hereby they might be the rather won over.

Here again he begins with an introduction, that they may not become excited, now that he is going to make express mention to them of Jesus: for in what preceded, there was no reason why they should be excited, while the Prophet was the subject of discourse: but the name of Jesus would have given offence at the very outset.-And he does not say, \"Do as I bid you,\" but, Hear; as being not at all exacting. And observe how he forbears to speak of the high matters, and begins with the very low: \"Jesus,\" he says: and then straightway mentions the place He belonged to, being one which was held in mean estimation: \"Jesus of Nazareth\": and does not say anything great about Him, nor even such as one would say about a Prophet, so far: \"Jesus,\" he says, \"of Nazareth, a man proved (to be) from God among you.\" Observe; what great matter was this, to say that He was sent from God?[fn-4-P411_240211:2-nf] For this was the point which on all occasions both He and John and the Apostles were studious to show. Thus hear John saying: \"The same said unto me On whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding on him, this is He.\" (John i. 33.) But Christ Himself does this to an extreme; Of Myself I am not come, He sent Me. (ib. vii. 28.) And everywhere in the Scriptures this seems the point most studiously insisted upon. Therefore also this holy leader of the blessed company, the lover of Christ, the good shepherd, the man put in trust with the keys of heaven, the man who received the Spiritual Wisdom, when he has first subdued the Jews by fear; and has shown what great things have been vouchsafed to the disciples, and what a right they have to be believed, then first proceeds to speak concerning Him. Only think what boldness it was to say it, in the midst of the murderers-that He is risen! And yet he does not all at once say, He is risen; but what?-\" He came,\" says he, \"from God: this is manifest by the signs which\"-he does not yet say, Jesus Himself wrought: but what?-\"which God wrought by Him in the midst of you.\" He calls themselves as witnesses. \"A man proved (to be sent) from God among you, by miracles and wonders and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you, as also ye yourselves know.\" Then, having fallen upon the mention of that their sacrilegious outrage, observe how he endeavors to quit them of the crime: \"Him,\" he says, \"being by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God delivered up\": (v. 23) [adding however,] \"ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:\" for though it was predetermined, still they were murderers.[fn-4-P412_243525:3-nf] [\"By the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God:\"] all but using the same words as Joseph did; just as he said to his brethren; \"Be not angry one with another by the way: God sent me hither.\" (Gen. xlv. 5, Gen. xlv. 24.) It is God's doing. \"What of us, then?\" (it might be said,) \"it was even well done on our part.\" That they may not say this, therefore it is that he adds, \"By wicked hands ye have crucified and slain.\"[fn-4-P413_244351:4-nf] Here then he hints at Judas; while at the same time he shows them that it was not from any strength of theirs, and would not have been, if He had not Himself permitted it: it was God that delivered Him up. He has transferred the evil entire upon the head of Judas, now already parted from them; for he it was that delivered Him over to them by the kiss. Or, \"By wicked hands,\" refers to the soldiers: for neither is it simply, \"Ye have slain,\" but, By wicked men ye have done this.[fn-4-P414_245167:5-nf] And observe how everywhere they make it of great importance that the Passion should first be confessed. Whom God Raised Up (v. 24), says he. This was the great thing; and observe how he sets it in the middle of his discourse: for the former matters had been confessed; both the miracles and the signs and the slaying-\"Whom God,\" says he, \"raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be kept in its power.\" It is something great and sublime that he has hinted at here. For the expression, \"It was not possible,\" even itself is that of one assigning something.[fn-4-P415_246408:6-nf] It shows that death itself in holding Him had pangs as in travail, and was sore bestead:[fn-4-P416_248616:7-nf] whereas, by pains, or, travail-pangs, of death, the Old Testament means danger and disaster: and that He so rose as never more to die. For the assertion, \"Seeing that it was not possible that He should be holden of it,\" means this, that His rising was not common to the rest. Then, however, before their thoughts can enter at all into his meaning, he brings David upon them, an authority which sets aside all human reasoning. \"For David saith (with reference) to Him.\" (v. 25.) And observe how, once more, the testimony is lowly. For therefore he begins the citation further up, with the matters of lowlier import therefore[fn-4-P417_250050:8-nf] was death not in the number of grievous things [because], says he, \"I foresaw the Lord always before my face, that He is on my right hand that I should not be moved:\" (v. 25-27) and, \"that Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell.\" Then, having finished the citation from the Prophet, he adds; \"Men and brethren.\" (v. 29.) When he is about to say anything great, he uses this opening address, to rouse and to conciliate them. \"Let me be allowed,\" he says, \"to speak freely to you of the patriarch David.\" Remarkable lowliness, in a case where he was giving no hurt, nor was there any reason why the hearers should be angry. For he did not say, This is not said concerning David, but concerning the Christ. But in another point of view: by his reverential expression towards the blessed David, he awed them; speaking of an acknowledged fact as if it were a bold thing to say, and therefore begging them to pardon him for saying it. And thereupon his expression is not simply \"concerning David,\" but \"concerning the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried:\" he does not also say, \"and is not risen again,\" but in another way (though this too would have been no great thing to say), \"And his sepulchre is with us unto this day,\" he has said what comes to the same thing. Then-and even so he does not come to the mention of Christ, but what next?-he goes on with his encomium upon David, \"Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that with an oath God had sworn unto him.\" (v. 30.) But this he says, that were it but on account of the honor shown to David, and the descent from him, they may accept what is said concerning Christ's resurrection, as seeing that it would be an injury to the prophecy, and a derogating from (thj eij autouj timhj) their honor, if this were not the fact. \"And knowing,\" he says, \"that with an oath God had sworn unto him\"-he does not say simply \"promised\"-\"of the fruit of his loins after the flesh to raise up Christ, to seat Him upon his throne.\" Observe how he has again only hinted at what is sublime. For now that he has soothed them with his expression, he confidently adds this: The prophet [saith it] \"of His resurrection, that neither was His soul left in hell, nor did His flesh see corruption.\" (v. 31.) This again is wonderful: it shows that His resurrection was not like that of other men. For though death laid hold on Him, yet it did not its own work then.-And, as regards the sin, he has spoken of that, covertly and darkly; of the punishment, he forbore to add anything; but that they had slain Him, this he has spoken out; for the rest he now comes to the sign given by God. And when it is once proved, that He, the slain, was just, was dear to God, then, though thou be silent of the punishment, be sure that he which did the sin will condemn himself more than ever thou canst condemn him: So then, that he refers all to the Father, is in order that they may receive what is said: and that assertion, \"Not possible,\" he fetches in from the prophecy. Well then, let us again look over what has been said.","title":"Homily VI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":2,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_13_homily_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"[\"Ye men of Israel\"]: it is not for flattery that he uses this term; but, as he has borne hard upon them, he relaxes a little, and puts them in mind of their great ancestor[fn-4-P410_239100:1-nf] [Israel].

For the expression, \"It was not possible,\" even itself is that of one assigning something.[fn-4-P415_246408:6-nf] It shows that death itself in holding Him had pangs as in travail, and was sore bestead:[fn-4-P416_248616:7-nf] whereas, by pains, or, travail-pangs, of death, the Old Testament means danger and disaster: and that He so rose as never more to die. For the assertion, \"Seeing that it was not possible that He should be holden of it,\" means this, that His rising was not common to the rest. Then, however, before their thoughts can enter at all into his meaning, he brings David upon them, an authority which sets aside all human reasoning. \"For David saith (with reference) to Him.\" (v. 25.) And observe how, once more, the testimony is lowly. For therefore he begins the citation further up, with the matters of lowlier import therefore[fn-4-P417_250050:8-nf] was death not in the number of grievous things [because], says he, \"I foresaw the Lord always before my face, that He is on my right hand that I should not be moved:\" (v. 25-27) and, \"that Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell.\" Then, having finished the citation from the Prophet, he adds; \"Men and brethren.\" (v. 29.) When he is about to say anything great, he uses this opening address, to rouse and to conciliate them. \"Let me be allowed,\" he says, \"to speak freely to you of the patriarch David.\" Remarkable lowliness, in a case where he was giving no hurt, nor was there any reason why the hearers should be angry. For he did not say, This is not said concerning David, but concerning the Christ. But in another point of view: by his reverential expression towards the blessed David, he awed them; speaking of an acknowledged fact as if it were a bold thing to say, and therefore begging them to pardon him for saying it. And thereupon his expression is not simply \"concerning David,\" but \"concerning the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried:\" he does not also say, \"and is not risen again,\" but in another way (though this too would have been no great thing to say), \"And his sepulchre is with us unto this day,\" he has said what comes to the same thing. Then-and even so he does not come to the mention of Christ, but what next?-he goes on with his encomium upon David, \"Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that with an oath God had sworn unto him.\" (v. 30.) But this he says, that were it but on account of the honor shown to David, and the descent from him, they may accept what is said concerning Christ's resurrection, as seeing that it would be an injury to the prophecy, and a derogating from (thj eij autouj timhj) their honor, if this were not the fact. \"And knowing,\" he says, \"that with an oath God had sworn unto him\"-he does not say simply \"promised\"-\"of the fruit of his loins after the flesh to raise up Christ, to seat Him upon his throne.\" Observe how he has again only hinted at what is sublime. For now that he has soothed them with his expression, he confidently adds this: The prophet [saith it] \"of His resurrection, that neither was His soul left in hell, nor did His flesh see corruption.\" (v. 31.) This again is wonderful: it shows that His resurrection was not like that of other men. For though death laid hold on Him, yet it did not its own work then.-And, as regards the sin, he has spoken of that, covertly and darkly; of the punishment, he forbore to add anything; but that they had slain Him, this he has spoken out; for the rest he now comes to the sign given by God. And when it is once proved, that He, the slain, was just, was dear to God, then, though thou be silent of the punishment, be sure that he which did the sin will condemn himself more than ever thou canst condemn him: So then, that he refers all to the Father, is in order that they may receive what is said: and that assertion, \"Not possible,\" he fetches in from the prophecy. Well then, let us again look over what has been said.","title":"Homily VI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Therefore upon this issue plant we foot to foot, whether the Christ who was constantly announced as to come be already come, or whether His coming be yet a subject of hope.

And that our view about this may be made clearer let us thus divide our argument. The inspired apostle on four occasions employs this term, once as here, calling Him, \"first-born of all creation[fn-10-P1069_579579:88-nf] ,\" another time, \"the first-born among many brethren[fn-10-P1070_579649:89-nf] ,\" again, \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1071_579705:90-nf] ,\" and on another occasion he employs the term absolutely, without combining it with other words, saying, \"But when again He bringeth the first-born into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him[fn-10-P1072_579955:91-nf] .\" Accordingly whatever view we entertain concerning this title in the other combinations, the same we shall in consistency apply to the phrase \"first-born of all creation.\" For since the title is one and the same it must needs be that the meaning conveyed is also one. In what sense then does He become \"the first-born among many brethren?\" in what sense does He become \"the first-born from the dead?\" Assuredly this is plain, that because we are by birth flesh and blood, as the Scripture saith, \"He Who for our sakes was born among us and was partaker of flesh and blood[fn-10-P1073_580545:92-nf] ,\" purposing to change us from corruption to incorruption by the birth from above, the birth by water and the Spirit, Himself led the way in this birth, drawing down upon the water, by His own baptism, the Holy Spirit; so that in all things He became the first-born of those who are spiritually born again, and gave the name of brethren to those who partook in a birth like to His own by water and the Spirit. But since it was also meet that He should implant in our nature the power of rising again from the dead, He becomes the \"first-fruits of them that slept[fn-10-P1074_581130:93-nf] \" and the \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1075_581186:94-nf] ,\" in that He first by His own act loosed the pains of death[fn-10-P1076_581264:95-nf] , so that His new birth from the dead was made a way for us also, since the pains of death, wherein we were held, were loosed by the resurrection of the Lord. Thus, just as by having shared in the washing of regeneration[fn-10-P1077_581533:96-nf] He became \"the first-born among many brethren,\" and again by having made Himself the first-fruits of the resurrection, He obtains the name of the \"first-born from the dead,\" so having in all things the pre-eminence, after that \"all old things,\" as the apostle says, \"have passed away[fn-10-P1078_581877:97-nf] ,\" He becomes the first-born of the new creation of men in Christ by the two-fold regeneration, alike that by Holy Baptism and that which is the consequence of the resurrection from the dead, becoming for us in both alike the Prince of Life[fn-10-P1079_582141:98-nf] , the first-fruits, the first-born. This first-born, then, hath also brethren, concerning whom He speaks to Mary, saying, \"Go and tell My brethren, I go to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God[fn-10-P1080_582374:99-nf] .\" In these words He sums up the whole aim of His dispensation as Man. For men revolted front God, and \"served them which by nature were no gods[fn-10-P1081_582574:100-nf] ,\" and though being the children of God became attached to an evil father falsely so called. For this cause the mediator between God and man[fn-10-P1082_582738:101-nf] having assumed the first-fruits of all human nature[fn-10-P1083_582815:102-nf] , sends to His brethren the announcement of Himself not in His divine character, but in that which He shares with us, saying, \"I am departing in order to make by My own self that true Father, from whom you were separated, to be your Father, and by My own self to make that true God from whom you had revolted to be your God, for by that first-fruits which I have assumed, I am in Myself presenting all humanity to its God and Father.\"","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Why should I pursue this part of the subject in more detail? For the words preceding also are tainted with the same profanity-\"receiving glory from the Father, not sharing glory with the Father, for the glory of the Almighty God is incommunicable.\" For my own part, even had his words referred to Moses who was glorified in the ministration of the Law,-not even then should I have tolerated such a statement, even if it be conceded that Moses, having no glory from within, appeared completely glorious to the Israelites by the favour bestowed on him from God. For the very glory that was bestowed on the lawgiver was the glory of none other but of God Himself, which glory the Lord in the Gospel bids all to seek, when He blames those who value human glory highly and seek not the glory that cometh from God only[fn-11-P1136_615427:142-nf] . For by the fact that He commanded them to seek the glory that cometh from the only God, He declared the possibility of their obtaining what they sought. How then is the glory of the Almighty incommunicable, if it is even our duty to ask for the glory that cometh from the only God, and if, according to our Lord's word, \"every one that asketh receiveth[fn-11-P1137_615808:143-nf] ?\" But one who says concerning the Brightness of the Father's glory, that He has the glory by having received it, says in effect that the Brightness of the glory is in Itself devoid of glory, and needs, in order to become Himself at last the Lord of some glory, to receive glory from another. How then are we to dispose of the utterances of the Truth,-one which tells us that He shall be seen in the glory of the Father[fn-11-P1138_616252:144-nf] , and another which says, \"All things that the Father hath are Mine[fn-11-P1139_616345:145-nf] \"? To whom ought the hearer to give ear? To him who says, \"He that is, as the Apostle says, the `heir of all things[fn-11-P1140_616485:146-nf] ' that are in the Father, is without part or lot in His Father's glory\"; or to Him Who declares that all things that the Father hath, He Himself hath also? Now among the \"all things,\" glory surely is included. Yet Eunomius says that the glory of the Almighty is incommunicable. This view Joel does not attest, nor yet the mighty Peter, who adopted, in his speech to the Jews, the language of the prophet. For both the prophet and the apostle say, in the person of God,-\"I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh[fn-11-P1141_617017:147-nf] .\" He then Who did not grudge the partaking in His own Spirit to all flesh,-how can it be that He does not impart His own glory to the only-begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, Who has all things that the Father has? Perhaps one should say that Eunomius is here speaking the truth, though not intending it. For the term \"impart\" is strictly used in the case of one who has not his glory from within, whose possession of it is an accession from without, and not part of his own nature: but where one and the same nature is observed in both Persons, He Who is as regards nature all that the Father is believed to be stands in no need of one to impart to Him each several attribute. This it will be well to explain more clearly and precisely. He Who has the Father dwelling in Him in His entirety-what need has He of the Father's glory, when none of the attributes contemplated in the Father is withdrawn from Him?","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But to what has been already said, ought to be added some notice of that position which they make a kind of foundation of their impiety in their discussions concerning the Incarnation, the position, namely, that not the whole man has been saved by Him, but only the half of man, I mean the body. Their object in such a malignant perversion of the true doctrine, is to show that the less exalted statements, which our Lord utters in tits humanity, are to be thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show their blasphemy to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual acknowledgment of the Lord. For this reason it is that Eunomius says, \"He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man made up of soul and body.\" But, after searching through all the inspired and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came \"to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-12-P1204_656584:193-nf] .\" Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster of our nature bad its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was twofold, death correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the deprivation of the twofold life that operates in him who is thus mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body into its kindred elements: but \"the soul that sinneth,\" he saith, \"it shall die[fn-12-P1205_657543:194-nf] .\" Now sin is nothing else than alienation from God, Who is the true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived many hundred years after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, \"In the day that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die[fn-12-P1206_657814:195-nf] .\" For by the fact of his alienation from the true life, the sentence of death was ratified against him that self-same day: and after this, at a much later time, there followed also the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this cause that He might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries home on His shoulders the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may make the man of God complete, united to the deity in body and in soul. And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now the soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the result of being ill-advised: and this He sanctifies by union with Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy along with the first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the destruction of the enemies of the Lord, said, \"They are dead which sought the young Child's life[fn-12-P1207_658887:196-nf] ,\" (or \"soul\"): and the Lord says to the Jews, \"Ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth[fn-12-P1208_659073:197-nf] .\" Now by \"Man\" is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is composed of both, soul and body.

John, by liberating the soul also from its own malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, \"Thou art made whole, sin no more[fn-12-P1211_659932:200-nf] ,\" thou, that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul and in body.

But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter said, \"This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ[fn-12-P1215_661720:204-nf] ;\" and we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them through His body.

Paul speak, \"for to make in Himself of twain one new man[fn-12-P1212_660105:201-nf] .\" And so too He foretells that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul from His body, saying, \"No man taketh\" my soul \"from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again[fn-12-P1213_660370:202-nf] .\" Yea, the prophet David also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with foresight of Him, \"Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption[fn-12-P1214_660678:203-nf] ,\" while the Apostle Peter thus expounds the saying, that \"His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption.\" For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh and in the flesh and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at all times what It was by nature, and so continuing for ever. But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter said, \"This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ[fn-12-P1215_661720:204-nf] ;\" and we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them through His body.

Well: as to that which pertains to the question of injunction, I will once for all give a reply to suit all causes. Now, (turning) to the point which is proper to this particular cause-concerning the limit of time, I mean-I must first demand from themselves whence they derive this prescriptive law for concluding Stations at the ninth hour. If it is from the fact that we read that Peter and he who was with him entered the temple \"at the ninth (hour), the hour of prayer,\" who will prove to me that they had that day been performing a Station, so as to interpret the ninth hour as the hour for the conclusion and discharge of the Station? Nay, but you would more easily find that Peter at the sixth hour had, for the sake of taking food, gone up first on the roof to pray;[fn-18-P1817_532730:77-nf] so that the sixth hour of the day may the rather be made the limit to this duty, which (in Peter's case) was apparently to finish that duty, after prayer. Further: since in the self-same commentary of Luke the third hour is demonstrated as an hour of prayer, about which hour it was that they who had received the initiatory gift of the Holy Spirit were held for drunkards;[fn-18-P1818_533124:78-nf] and the sixth, at which Peter went up on the roof; and the ninth, at which they entered the temple: why should we not understand that, with absolutely perfect indifference, we must pray[fn-18-P1819_533337:79-nf] always, and everywhere, and at every time; yet still that these three hours, as being more marked in things human-(hours) which divide the day, which distinguish businesses, which re-echo in the public ear-have likewise ever been of special solemnity in divine prayers? A persuasion which is sanctioned also by the corroborative fact of Daniel praying thrice in the day;[fn-18-P1820_533789:80-nf] of course, through exception of certain stated hours, no other, moreover, than the more marked and subsequently apostolic (hours)-the third, the sixth, the ninth.

I do not ask whether there was not a time when you refused to say this. I will not discuss the question, whether you were fond of those who preached such doctrines; on whose side you were when, for expressing those sentiments, they underwent banishment; or who the man was that, when the presbyter Theo preached in the Church that the Holy Spirit is God, closed his ears, and excitedly rushed out of doors that he might not so much as hear the impiety.

The true confession of the resurrection declares that the flesh will be glorious, but without destroying its reality. And when the Apostle says,[fn-71-P7101_2338505:72-nf] \"This is corruptible and mortal,\" his words denote this very body, that is to say, the flesh which was then seen. But when he adds that it puts on incorruption and immortality, he does not say that that which is put on, that is the clothing, does away with the body which it adorns in glory, but that it makes that body glorious, which before lacked glory; so that the more worthless robe of mortality and weakness being laid aside, we may be clothed with the gold of immortality, and, so to speak, with the blessedness of strength as well as virtue; since we wish not to be stripped of the flesh, but to put on over it the vesture of glory, and desire to be clothed upon with our house, which is from heaven, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. Certainly, no one is clothed upon who was not previously clothed. Accordingly, our Lord was not so transfigured on the mountain that He lost His hands and feet and other members, and suddenly began to roll along in a round shape like that of the sun or a ball; but the same members glowed with the brightness of the sun and blinded the eyes of the Apostles. Hence, also, His garments were changed, but so as to become white and glistening, not aërial, for I suppose you do not intend to maintain that His clothes also were spiritual.[fn-71-P7102_2339814:73-nf] The Evangelist adds that His face shone like the sun; but when mention is made of His face, I reckon that His other members were beheld as well. Enoch was translated in the flesh; Elias was carried up to heaven in the flesh. They are not dead, they are inhabitants of Paradise, and even there retain the members with which they were rapt away and translated. What we aim at in fasting, they have through fellowship with God. They feed on heavenly bread, and are satisfied with every word of God, having Him as their food who is also their Lord.

He is the first-born from the dead, Who first by Himself loosed the pains of death[fn-14-P1478_825316:28-nf] , that He might also make that birth of the resurrection a way for all men[fn-14-P1479_825409:29-nf] . Again, He becomes \"the first-born among many brethren,\" Who is born before us by the new birth of regeneration in water, for the travail whereof the hovering of the Dove was the midwife, whereby He makes those who share with Him in the like birth to be His own brethren, and becomes the first-born of those who after Him are born of water and of the Spirit[fn-14-P1480_825829:30-nf] : and to speak briefly, as there are in us three births, whereby human nature is quickened, one of the body, another in the sacrament of regeneration, another by that resurrection of the dead for which we look, He is first-born in all three:-of the twofold regeneration which is wrought by two (by baptism and by the resurrection), by being Himself the leader in each of them; while it, the flesh He is first-born, as having first and alone devised in His own case that birth unknown to nature, which no one in the many generations of men had originated. If these passages, then, have been rightly understood, neither will the signification of the \"creation,\" of which He is first-born, be unknown to as. For we recognize a twofold creation of our nature, the first that whereby we were made, the second that whereby we were made anew. But there would have been no need of the second creation had we not made the first unavailing by our disobedience. Accordingly, when the first creation had waxed old and vanished away, it was needful that there should be a new creation in Christ, (as the Apostle says, who asserts that we should no longer see in the second creation any trace of that which has waxed old, saying, \"Having put off the old man with his deeds and his lusts, put on the new man which is created according to God[fn-14-P1481_827405:31-nf] ,\" and \"If any man be in Christ,\" he says, \"he is a new creature: the old things are passed away, behold all things are become new[fn-14-P1482_827575:32-nf] :\") -for the maker of human nature at the first and afterwards is one and the same. Then He took dust from the earth and formed man: again, He took dust from the Virgin, and did not merely form man, but formed man about Himself: then, He created; afterwards, He was created: then, the Word made flesh; afterwards, the Word became flesh, that He might change our flesh to spirit, by being made partaker with us in flesh and blood. Of this new creation therefore in Christ, which He Himself began, He was called the first-born, being the first-fruits of all, both of those begotten into life, and of those quickened by resurrection of the dead, \"that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living[fn-14-P1483_828299:33-nf] ,\" and might sanctify the whole lump[fn-14-P1484_828354:34-nf] by means of its first-fruits in Himself. Now that the character of \"first-born\" does not apply to the Son in respect of His pre-temporal existence the appellation of \"Only-begotten\" testifies. For he who is truly only-begotten has no brethren, for bow could any one be only-begotten if numbered among brethren? but as He is called God and man, Son of God and Son of man,-for He has the form of God and the form of a servant[fn-14-P1485_828800:35-nf] , being some things according to His supreme nature, becoming other things in His dispensation of love to man,-so too, being the Only-begotten God, He becomes the first-born of all creation,-the Only-begotten, He that is in the bosom of the Father, yet, among the e who are saved by the new creation, both becoming and being called the first born of the creation. But if, as heresy will have it, He is called first-born because He was made before the rest of the creation, the name does not agree with what they maintain concerning the Only-begotten God. For they do not say this,-that the Son and the universe were from the Father in like manner,-but they say, that the Only-begotten God was made by the Father, and that all else was made by the Only-begotten. Therefore on the same ground on which, while they hold that the Son was created, they call God the Father of the created Being, on the same ground, while they say that all things were made by the Only-begotten God, they give Him the name not of the \"first-born\" of the things that were made by Him, but more properly of their \"Father,\" as the same relation existing in both cases towards the things created, logically gives rise to the same appellation. For if God, Who is over all, is not properly called the \"First-born,\" but the Father of the Being He Himself created, the Only-begotten God will surely also be called, by the same reasoning, the \"father,\" and not properly the \"first-born\" of His own creatures, so that the appellation of \"first-born\" will be altogether improper and superfluous, having no place in the heretical conception,","title":"Book IV","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_18_homily_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"For in the case of the apostles too, there was a \"sound of a mighty wind,\"[fn-11-P1158_388945:7-nf] and visions of fiery tongues appeared, but not for the apostles' sake, but because of the Jews who were then present.

And Christ was certainly not then anointed with the Holy Spirit, when He, as a dove, descended upon Him at His baptism.[fn-21-P2129_1075416:126-nf] For at that time He deigned to prefigure His body, i.e. His Church, in which especially the baptized receive the Holy Spirit.

And the Church preserves this custom even now in the case of her rulers. Lastly, Simon Magus also, when he offered the apostles money, does not say, \"Give me also this power, that I may give\" the Holy Spirit; but, \"that on whomsoever I may lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.\" Because neither had the Scriptures said before, And Simon, seeing that the apostles gave the Holy Spirit; but it had said,\" And Simon, seeing that the Holy Spirit was given by the laying on of the apostles' hands.\"[fn-21-P2125_1074760:122-nf] Therefore also the Lord Jesus Christ Himself not only gave the Holy Spirit as God, but also received it as man, and therefore He is said to be full of grace,[fn-21-P2126_1074944:123-nf] and of the Holy Spirit.[fn-21-P2127_1074987:124-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles it is more plainly written of Him, \"Because God anointed Him With the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-21-P2128_1075133:125-nf] Certainly not with visible oil but with the gift of grace which is signified by the visible ointment wherewith the Church anoints the baptized. And Christ was certainly not then anointed with the Holy Spirit, when He, as a dove, descended upon Him at His baptism.[fn-21-P2129_1075416:126-nf] For at that time He deigned to prefigure His body, i.e. His Church, in which especially the baptized receive the Holy Spirit. But He is to be understood to have been then anointed with that mystical and invisible unction, when the Word of God was made flesh,[fn-21-P2130_1075697:127-nf] i.e. when human nature, without any precedent merits of good works, was joined to God the Word in the womb of the Virgin, so that with it it became one person. Therefore it is that we confess Him to have been born of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary. For it is most absurd to believe Him to have received the Holy Spirit when He was near thirty years old: for at that age He was baptized by John;[fn-21-P2131_1076118:128-nf] but that He came to baptism as without any sin at all, so not without the Holy Spirit. For if it was written of His servant and forerunner John himself, \"He shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb,\"[fn-21-P2132_1076367:129-nf] because, although generated by his father, yet he received the Holy Spirit when formed in the womb; what must be understood and believed of the man Christ, of whose flesh the very conception was not carnal, but spiritual? Both natures, too, as well the human as the divine, are shown in that also that is written of Him, that He received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, and shed forth the Holy Spirit:[fn-21-P2133_1076802:130-nf] seeing that He received as man, and shed forth as God. And we indeed can receive that gift according to our small measure, but assuredly we cannot shed it forth upon others; but, that this may be done, we invoke over them God, by whom this is accomplished.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_16_book_v","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"It is now, perhaps, time to make enquiry into what is said concerning the words of the Apostle Peter[fn-15-P1575_902731:1-nf] , by Eunomius himself, and by our father[fn-15-P1576_902823:2-nf] concerning the latter.

For the word of the Scripture says that in regard to one person two things were wrought,-by the Jews, the Passion, and by God, honour; not as though one person had suffered and another had been honoured by exaltation: and he further explains this yet more clearly by his words in what follows, \"being exalted by the right hand of God.\" Who then was \"exalted\"? He that was lowly, or He that was the Highest? and what else is the lowly, but the Humanity? what else is the Highest, but the Divinity? Surely, God needs not to be exalted, seeing that He is the Highest. It follows, then, that the Apostle's meaning is that the Humanity was exalted: and its exaltation was effected by its becoming Lord and Christ. And this took place after the Passion.[fn-16-P1625_935230:38-nf] It is not therefore the pre-temporal existence of the Lord which the Apostle indicates by the word \"made,\" but that change of the lowly to the lofty which was effected \"by the right hand of God.\" Even by this phrase is declared the mystery of godliness; for he who says \"exalted by the right hand of God\" manifestly reveals the unspeakable dispensation of this mystery, that the Right. Hand of God, that made all things that are, (which is the Lord, by Whom all things were made, and without Whom nothing that is subsists,) Itself raised to Its own height the Man united with It, making Him also to be what It is by nature. Now It is Lord and King: Christ is the King's name: these things It made Him too. For as He was highly exalted by being in the Highest, so too He became all else,-Immortal in the Immortal, Light in the Light, Incorruptible in the Incorruptible, Invisible in the Invisible, Christ in the Christ, Lord in the Lord. For even in physical combinations. when one of the combined parts exceeds the other in a great degree, the inferior is wont to change completely to that which ismore potent. And this we are plainly taught by the voice of the Apostle Peter in his mystic discourse, that the lowly nature of Him Who was crucified through weakness, (and weakness, as we have heard from the Lord, marks the flesh[fn-16-P1626_937297:39-nf] ,) that lowly nature, I say, by virtue of its combination with the infinite and boundless element of good, remained no longer in its own measures and properties, but was by the Right Hand of God raised up together with Itself, and became Lord instead of servant, Christ a King instead of a subject, Highest instead of Lowly, God instead of man. What handle then against the saints did he who pretends to give warning against us in defence of the Apostles find in the material of our writings?

Now I think that it ought to be clearly understood that God the Father is denoted by the Spirit of God, because our Lord Jesus Christ declared that the Spirit of the Lord was upon Him since He anoints Him and sends Him to preach the Gospel. For in Him is made manifest the excellence of the Father's nature, disclosing that the Son partakes of His nature even when born in the flesh through the mystery of this spiritual unction, since after the birth ratified in. His baptism this intimation of His inherent Sonship was heard as a voice bore witness from Heaven:-Thou art My Son; this day have begotten Thee[fn-16-P1658_1089688:34-nf] . For not even He Himself can be understood as resting upon Himself or coming to Himself from Heaven, or as bestowing on Himself the title of Son: but all this demonstration was for our faith, in order that under the mystery of a complete and true birth we should recognise that the unity of the nature dwells in the Son Who had begun to be also man. We have thus found that in the Spirit of God the Father is designated; but we understand that the Son is indicated in the same way, when He says: But if I in the Spirit of God cast out devils, then has the kingdom of God come upon you. That is, He shews clearly that He, by the power of His nature, casts out devils, which cannot be cast out save by the Spirit of God. The phrase `Spirit of God' denotes also the Paraclete Spirit, and that not only on the testimony of prophets but also of apostles, when it is said:-This is that which was spoken through the Prophet, It shall come to pass on the last day, saith the Lord, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and their sans and their daughters shall prophesy[fn-16-P1659_1090801:35-nf] ú And we learn that all this prophecy was fulfilled in the case of the Apostles, when, after the sending of the Holy Spirit, they all spoke with the tongues of the Gentiles.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":2,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_17_book_vi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But I perceive that while the necessities of the subject compelled me to follow this line of thought, I have lingered too long over this passage[fn-16-P1663_958949:1-nf] . I must now resume the train of his complaints, that we may pass by none of the charges brought against us without an answer. And first I propose that we should examine this point, that he charges us with asserting that an ordinary man has wrought the salvation of the world. For although this point has been to some extent already cleared up by the investigations we have made, we shall yet briefly deal with it once more, that the mind of those who are acting as our judges on this slanderous accusation may be entirely freed from misapprehension. So far are we from referring to an ordinary man the cause of this great and unspeakable grace, that even if any should refer so great a boon to Peter and Paul, or to an angel from heaven, we should say with Paul, \"let him be anathema[fn-16-P1664_959817:2-nf] .\" For Paul was not crucified for us, nor were we baptized into a human name[fn-16-P1665_959923:3-nf] . Surely the doctrine which our adversaries oppose to the truth is not thereby strengthened when we confess that the saving power of Christ is more potent than human nature[fn-16-P1666_960112:4-nf] :-yet it may seem to be so, for their aim is to maintain at all points the difference of the essence of the Son from that of the Father, and they strive to show the dissimilarity of essence not only by the contrast of the Generated with the Ungenerate, but also by the opposition of the passible to the impassible. And while this is more openly maintained in the last part of their argument, it is also clearly shown in their present discourse[fn-16-P1667_961029:5-nf] . For if he finds fault with those who refer the Passion to the Human Nature, his intention is certainly to subject to the Passion the Godhead Itself. For our conception being twofold, and admitting of two developments, accordingly as the Divinity or the Humanity is held to have been in a condition of suffering, an attack on one of these views is clearly a maintaining of the other. Accordingly, if they find fault with those who look upon the Passion as concerning the Man, they will clearly approve those who say that the Godhead of the Son was subject to passion, and the position which these last maintain becomes an argument in favour of their own absurd doctrine. For if, according to their statement, the Godhead of the Son suffers, while that of the Father is preserved in absolute impassibility, then the impassible Nature is essentially different from that which admits passion. Seeing, therefore, that the dictum before us, though, so far as it is limited by number of words, it is a short one, yet affords principles and hypotheses for every kind ofdoctrinal pravity, it would seem right that ourreaders should require in our reply not so much brevity as soundness. We, then, neither attribute our own salvation to a man, nor admit that the incorruptible and Divine Nature is capable of suffering and mortality: but since we must assuredly believe the Divine utterances which declare to us that the Word that was in the beginning was God[fn-16-P1668_962564:6-nf] , and that afterward the Word made flesh was seen upon the earth and conversed with men[fn-16-P1669_962673:7-nf] , we admit in our creed those conceptions which are consonant with the Divine utterance. For when we hear that He is Light, and Power, and Righteousness, and Life, and Truth, and that by Him all things were made, we account all these and such-like statements as things to be believed, referring them to God the Word: but when we hear of pain, of slumber, of need, of trouble, of bonds, of nails, of the spear, of blood, of wounds, of burial, of the sepulchre, and all else of this kind, even if they are somewhat opposed to what has previously been stated, we none the less admit them to be things to be believed, and true, having regard to the flesh; which we receive by faith as conjoined with the Word. For as it is not possible to contemplate the peculiar attributes of the flesh as existing in the Word that was in the beginning, so also on the other hand we may not conceive those which are proper to the Godhead as existing in the nature of the flesh. As, therefore, the teaching of the Gospel concerning our Lord is mingled, partly of lofty and Divine ideas, partly of those which are lowly and human, we assign every particular phrase accordingly to one or other of these Natures which we conceive in the mystery, that which is human to the Humanity, that which is lofty to the Godhead, and say that, as God, the Son is certainly impassible and incapable of corruption: and whatever suffering is asserted concerning Him in the Gospel, He assuredly wrought by means of His Human Nature which admitted of such suffering. For verily the Godhead works the salvation of the world by means of that body which encompassed It, in such wise that the suffering was of the body, but the operation was of God; and even if some wrest to the support of the opposite doctrine the words of the Apostle, \"God spared not His own Sons,[fn-16-P1670_964521:8-nf] ,\" and, \"God sent His own Son[fn-16-P1671_964569:9-nf] ,\" and other similar phrases which seem to refer, in the matter of the Passion, to the Divine Nature, and not to the Humanity, we shall none the less refuse to abandon sound doctrine, seeing that Paul himself declares to us more clearly the mystery of this subject. For he everywhere attributes to the Human element in Christ the dispensation of the Passion, when he says, \"for since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead[fn-16-P1672_965040:10-nf] ,\" and, \"God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, condemned sin in the flesh[fn-16-P1673_965154:11-nf] \" (for he says, \"in the flesh,\" not \"in the Godhead\"); and \"He was crucified through weakness\" (where by \"weakness\" he means \"the flesh\"), \"yet liveth by power[fn-16-P1674_965337:12-nf] \" (while he indicates by \"power\" the Divine Nature); and, \"He died unto sin\" (that is, with regard to the body), \"but liveth unto God[fn-16-P1675_965492:13-nf] \" (that is, with regard to the Godhead, so that by these words it is established that, while the Man tasted death, the immortal Nature did not admit the suffering of death); and again; \"He made Him to be sin for us, Who knew no sin[fn-16-P1676_965742:14-nf] ,\" giving once more the name of \"sin\" to the flesh.","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_17_book_vi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"And although we make these remarks in passing, the parenthetic addition seems, perhaps, not less important than the main question before us.

Who now is it, I pray, my most keen rhetorician, who transfers the Son from the servile form to another form of a servant? he who claims for Him uncreated I being, and thereby proves that He is no servant, or you, rather, who continually cry that the Son is the servant of the Father, and was actually under His dominion before He took the servant's form? I ask for no other judges; I leave the vote on these questions in your own hands. For I suppose that no one is so shameless in his dealings with the truth as to oppose acknowledged facts out of sheer impudence. What we have said is clear to any one, that by the peculiar attributes of servitude is marked that which is by nature servile, and to be created is an attribute proper to servitude.

Let us accordingly look at the point in this way. What are the Apostle's words? \"Be it known,\" he says, \"that God made Him Lord and Christ[fn-17-P1723_992214:49-nf] .\" Then, as though some one had asked him on whom such a grace was bestowed, he points as it were with his finger to the subject, saying, \"this Jesus, Whom ye crucified.\" What does Basil say upon this? That the demonstrative word declares that that person was made Christ, Who had been crucified by the hearers;-for he says, \"ye crucified,\" and it was likely that those who had demanded the murder that was done upon Him were hearers of the speech; for the time from the crucifixion to the discourse of Peter was not long. What, then, does Eunomius advance in answer to this? \"If it is not of the Word Who was in the beginning and was God that the blessed Peter speaks, but of Him Who was `seen,' and Who `emptied Himself,' as Basil says, and if the man who was `seen' `emptied himself' to take `the form of a servant'\"- Hold! who says this, that the man who was seen emptied himself again to take the form of a servant? or who maintains that the suffering of the Cross took place before the manifestation in the flesh? The Cross did not precede the body, nor the body \"the form of the servant.\" But God is manifested in the flesh, while the flesh that displayed God in itself, after having by itself fulfilled the great mystery of the Death, is transformed by commixture to that which is exalted and Divine, becoming Christ and Lord, being transferred and changed to that which He was, Who manifested Himself in that flesh. But if we should say this, our champion of the truth maintains once more that we say that He Who was shown upon the Cross \"emptied Himself\" to become another man, putting his sophism together as follows in its wording:-\"If,\" quoth he, \"the man who was `seen' `emptied himself' to take the `form of a servant,' and He Who `emptied Himself' to take the `form of a servant,' `emptied Himself' to come into being as man, then the man who was `seen' `emptied himself' to come into being as man.\"","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_17_book_vi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"How well he remembers the task before him! how much to the point is the conclusion of his argument!

The fact that the Apostle's discourse refers to Him Who was \"crucified through weakness[fn-17-P1725_994797:50-nf] \" is forsooth powerfully disproved when we learn that if we believe this to be so, the man who was \"seen\" again becomes another, \"emptying Himself\" for another coming into being of man. Will you never cease jesting against what should be secure from such attempts? will you not blush at destroying by such ridiculous sophisms the awe that hedges the Divine mysteries? will you not turn now, if never before, to know that the Only-begotten God, Who is in the bosom of the Father, being Word, and King, and Lord, and all that is exalted in word and thought, needs not to become anything that is good, seeing that He is Himself the fulness of all good things? What then is that, by changing into which He becomes what He was not before? Well, as He Who knew not sin becomes sin[fn-17-P1726_995593:51-nf] , that He may take away the sin of the world, so on the other hand the flesh which received the Lord becomes Christ and Lord, being transformed by the commixture into that which it was not by nature: whereby We learn that neither would God have been manifested in the flesh, had not the Word been made flesh, nor would the human flesh that compassed Him about have been transformed to what is Divine, had not that which was apparent to the senses become Christ and Lord.

See you not what confusion you bring upon the matter, turning, as the phrase goes, things upside down? It was the fiftieth day after the Passion, when Peter preached his sermon to the Jews and said, \"Him Whom ye crucified, God made Christ and Lord.\" Do you not mark the order of his saying? which stands first, which second in his words?

For since He was the Word and was God, and \"afterwards,\" as the prophet says, \"was seen upon earth and conversed with men[fn-17-P1730_999407:54-nf] ,\" He will hereby be proved to be one of the creatures! And if this is held to be beside the question, similar passages too are not quite akin to the subject. For in sense it is just the same to say that the Word that was in the beginning was manifested to men through the flesh, and to say that being in the form of God He put on the form of a servant: and if one of these statements gives no help for the establishment of his blasphemy, he must needs give up the remaining one also. He is kind enough, however, to advise us to abandon our error, and to point out the truth which He himself maintains. He tells us that the Apostle Peter declares Him to have been made Who was in the beginning the Word and God. Well, if he were making up dreams for our amusement, and giving us information about the prophetic interpretation of the visions of sleep, there might be no risk in allowing him to set forth the riddles of his imagination at his pleasure. But when he tells us that he is explaining the Divine utterances, it is no longer safe for us to leave him to interpret the words as he likes. What does the Scripture say? \"God made Lord and Christ this Jesus whom ye crucified[fn-17-P1731_1000603:55-nf] .\" When everything, then, is found to concur-the demonstrative word denoting Him Who is spoken of by the Name of His Humanity, the charge against those who were stained with blood-guiltiness, the suffering of the Cross-our thought necessarily turns to that which was apparent to the senses. But he asserts that while Peter uses these words it is the pretemporal existence that is indicated by the word \"made\"[fn-17-P1732_1001030:56-nf] . Well, we may safely allow nurses and old wives to jest with children, and to lay down the meaning of dreams as they choose: but when inspired Scripture is set before us for exposition, the great Apostle forbids us to have recourse to old wives' tattle[fn-17-P1733_1001439:57-nf] . When I hear \"the Cross\" spoken of, I understand the Cross, and when I hear mention of a human name, I understand the nature which that name connotes. So when I hear from Peter that \"this\" one was made Lord and Christ, I do not doubt that he speaks of Him Who had been before the eyes of men, since the saints agree with one another in this matter as well as in others. For, as he says that He Who was crucified has been made Lord, so Paul also says that He was \"highly exalted[fn-17-P1734_1001970:58-nf] ,\" after the Passion and the Resurrection, not being exalted in so far forth as He is God. For what height is there more sublime than the Divine height, that he should say God was exalted thereunto? But he means that the lowliness of the Humanity was exalted, the word, I suppose, indicating the assimilation and union of the Man Who was assumed to the exalted state of the Divine Nature. And even if one were to allow him licence to misinterpret the Divine utterance, not even so will his argument conclude in accordance with the aim of his heresy. For be it granted that Peter does say of Him Who was in the beginning, \"God made Him Lord and Christ, this Jesus Whom ye crucified,\" we shall find that even so his blasphemy does not gain any strength against the truth. \"God made Him,\" he says, \"Lord and Christ.\" To which of the words are we to refer the word made? with which of those that are employed in this sentence are we to connect the word? There are three before us:-\"this,\" and \"Lord,\" and \"Christ.\" With which of these three will he construct the word \"made\"? No one is so bold against the truth as to deny that \"made\" has reference to \"Christ\" and \"Lord\"; for Peter says that He, being already whatever He was, was \"made Christ and Lord\" by the Father.","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_11_tractate_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3. Therefore, when He sent the Holy Spirit He manifested Him visibly in two ways-by a dove and by fire: by a dove upon the Lord when He was baptized, by fire upon the disciples when they were gathered together. For when the Lord had ascended into heaven after His resurrection, having spent forty days with His disciples, and the day of Pentecost being fully come, He sent unto them the Holy Spirit as He had promised. Accordingly the Spirit coming at that time filled the place, and there was first a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, and \"there appeared unto them,\" it says, \"cloven tongues as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they began to speak with tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.\"[fn-4-P445_166735:5-nf] Here we have seen a dove descending upon the Lord; there, cloven tongues upon the assembled disciples: in the former, simplicity is shown; in the latter, fervency. Now there are who are said to be simple, who are only indolent; they are called simple, but they are only slow. Not such was Stephen, full of the Holy Ghost: he was simple, because he injured no one; he was fervent, because he reproved the ungodly. For he held not his peace before the Jews. His are those burning words: \"Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised of heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit.\" Mighty impetuosity; but it is the dove without gall raging. For that you know that he was fierce without gall, see how, upon hearing these words, they who were the ravens immediately took up stones and rushed together upon this dove. They begin to stone Stephen; and he who a little before stormed and glowed with ardor of spirit,-who had, as it were, made an onset on his enemies, and like one full of violence had attacked them in such fiery and burning words as you have heard, \"Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears,\" that any one who heard those words might fancy that Stephen, if he were allowed, would have them consumed at once,-but when the stones thrown from their hands reached him, with fixed knee he saith, \"Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.\"[fn-4-P446_168106:6-nf] He held fast to the unity of the dove. For his Master, upon whom the dove descended, had done the same thing before him; who, while hanging on the cross, said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"[fn-4-P447_168342:7-nf] Wherefore by the dove it is shown that they who are sanctified by the Spirit should be without guile; and that their simplicity should not continue cold is shown us by the fire. Nor let it trouble you that the tongues were divided; for tongues are diverse, therefore the appearance was that of cloven tongues. \"Cloven tongues,\" it saith, \"as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.\" There is a diversity of tongues, but the diversity of tongues does not imply schisms. Be not afraid of separation in the cloven tongues; in the dove recognize unity.","title":"Tractate VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_23_book_xvii","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"\"The Lord killeth and maketh alive:\" He has killed her who had many children, and made this barren one alive, so that she has born seven.

For it will not take place when we have seen; but we shall see when it has taken place. For he had already spoken of the new heavens and the new earth, speaking repeatedly, and under many figures, of the things promised to the saints, and saying,\"There shall be new heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind; but they shall find in it gladness and exultation. Behold, I will make Jerusalem an exultation, and my people a joy. And I will exult in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her;\"[fn-39-P3957_2176778:105-nf] and other promises, which some endeavor to refer to carnal enjoyment during the thousand years. For, in the manner of prophecy, figurative and literal expressions are mingled, so that a serious mind may, by useful and salutary effort, reach the spiritual sense; but carnal sluggishness, or the slowness of an uneducated and undisciplined mind, rests in the superficial letter, and thinks there is nothing beneath to be looked for. But let this be enough regarding the style of those prophetic expressions just quoted. And now, to return to their interpretation. When he had said, \"And your bones shall rise up like a herb,\" in order to show that it was the resurrection of the good, though a bodily resurrection, to which he alluded, he added, \"And the hand of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers.\" What is this but the hand of Him who distinguishes those who worship from those who despise Him? Regarding these the context immediately adds, \"And He shall threaten the contumacious,\" or, as another translator has it, \"the unbelieving.\" He shall not actually threaten then, but the threats which are now uttered shall then be fulfilled in effect. \"For behold,\" he says, \"the Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword: many shall be wounded by the Lord.\" By fire, whirlwind, sword, he means the judicial punishment of God. For he says that the Lord Himself shall come as a fire, to those, that is to say, to whom His coming shall be penal. By His chariots (for the word is plural)we suitably understand the ministration of angels. And when he says that all flesh and all the earth shall be judged with His fire and sword, we do not understand the spiritual and holy to be included, but the earthly and carnal, of whom it is said that they \"mind earthly things,\"[fn-39-P3958_2178747:106-nf] and \"to be carnally minded is death,\"[fn-39-P3959_2178807:107-nf] and whom the Lord calls simply flesh when He says, \"My Spirit shall not always remain in these men, for they are flesh.\"[fn-39-P3960_2178949:108-nf] As to the words, \"Many shall be wounded by the Lord,\" this wounding shall produce the second death. It is possible, indeed, to understand fire, sword, and wound in a good sense. For the Lord said that He wished to send fire on the earth.[fn-39-P3961_2179206:109-nf] And the cloven tongues appeared to them as fire when the Holy Spirit came.[fn-39-P3962_2179302:110-nf] And our Lord says, \"I am not come to send peace on earth, but a sword.\"[fn-39-P3963_2179393:111-nf] And Scripture says that the word of God is a doubly sharp sword,[fn-39-P3964_2179478:112-nf] on account of the two edges, the two Testaments. And in the Song of Songs the holy Church says that she is wounded with love,[fn-39-P3965_2179624:113-nf] -pierced, as it were, with the arrow of love. But here, where we read or hear that the Lord shall come to execute vengeance, it is obvious in what sense we are to understand these expressions.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":41,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_20_lecture_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"26.

With respect to the Holy Spirit, however, there has not been as yet, on the part of learned and distinguished investigators of the Scriptures, a discussion of the subject full enough or careful enough to make it possible for us to obtain an intelligent conception of what also constitutes His special individuality (proprium): in virtue of which special individuality it comes to be the case that we cannot call Him either the Son or the Father, but only the Holy Spirit; excepting that they predicate Him to be the Gift of God, so that we may believe God not to give a gift inferior to Himself. At the same time they hold by this position, namely, to predicate the Holy Spirit neither as begotten, like the Son, of the Father; for Christ is the only one [so begotten]: nor as [begotten] of the Son, like a Grandson of the Supreme Father: while they do not affirm Him to owe that which He is to no one, but [admit Him to owe it] to the Father, of whom are all things; lest we should establish two Beginnings without beginning (ne duo constituamus principia isne principio), which would be an assertion at once most false and most absurd, and one proper not to the catholic faith, but to the error of certain heretics.[fn-32-P3275_1506357:92-nf] Some, however, have gone so far as to believe that the communion of the Father and the Son, and (so to speak) their Godhead (deitatem), which the Greeks designate qeotha, is the Holy Spirit; so that, inasmuch as the Father is God and the Son God, the Godhead itself, in which they are united with each other,-to wit, the former by begetting the Son, and the latter by cleaving to the Father,[fn-32-P3276_1506799:93-nf] -should [thereby] be constituted equal with Him by whom He is begotten. This Godhead, then, which they wish to be understood likewise as the love and charity subsisting between these two [Persons], the one toward the other, they affirm to have received the name of the Holy Spirit. And this opinion of theirs they support by many proofs drawn from the Scriptures; among which we might instance either the passage which says, \"For the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who has been given unto us,\"[fn-32-P3277_1507383:94-nf] or many other proofs texts of a similar tenor: while they ground their position also upon the express fact that it is through the Holy Spirit that we are reconciled unto God; whence also, when He is called the Gift of God, they will have it that sufficient indication is offered of the love of God and the Holy Spirit being identical. For we are not reconciled unto Him except through that love in virtue of which we are also called sons:[fn-32-P3278_1507839:95-nf] as we are no more \"under fear, like servants,\"[fn-32-P3279_1507954:96-nf] because \"love, when it is made perfect, casteth out fear;\"[fn-32-P3280_1508033:97-nf] and [as] \"we have received the spirit of liberty, wherein we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-32-P3281_1508134:98-nf] And inasmuch as, being reconciled and called back into friendship through love, we shall be able to become acquainted with all the secret things of God, for this reason it is said of the Holy Spirit that \"He shall lead you into all truth.\"[fn-32-P3282_1508394:99-nf] For the same reason also, that confidence in preaching the truth, with which the apostles were filled at His advent,[fn-32-P3283_1508531:100-nf] is rightly ascribed to love; because diffidence also is assigned to fear, which the perfecting of love excludes. Thus, likewise, the same is called the Gift of God,[fn-32-P3284_1508715:101-nf] because no one enjoys that which he knows, unless he also love it. To enjoy the Wisdom of God, however, implies nothing else than to cleave to the same in love (ei dilectione cohaerere). Neither does any one abide in that which he apprehends, but by love; and accordingly the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of sanctity (Spiritus Sanctus), inasmuch as all things that are sanctioned (sanciuntur)[fn-32-P3285_1509135:102-nf] are sanctioned with a view to their permanence, and there is no doubt that the term sanctity (sanctitatem) is derived from sanction (a sanciendo). Above all, however, that testimony is employed by the upholders of this opinion, where it is thus written, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;\"[fn-32-P3286_1509634:103-nf] \"for God is a Spirit.\"[fn-32-P3287_1509677:104-nf] For here He speaks of our regeneration,[fn-32-P3288_1509737:105-nf] which is not, according to Adam, of the flesh, but, according to Christ, of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, if in this passage mention is made of the Holy Spirit, when it is said, \"For God is a Spirit,\" they maintain that we must take note that it is not said, \"for the Spirit is God,\"[fn-32-P3289_1510223:106-nf] but, \"for God is a Spirit;\" so that the very Godhead of the Father and the Son is in this passage called God, and that is the Holy Spirit. To this is added another testimony which the Apostle John offers, when he says, \"For God is love.\"[fn-32-P3290_1510571:107-nf] For here, in like manner, what he says is not, \"Love is God,\"[fn-32-P3291_1510655:108-nf] but, \"God is love;\" so that the very Godhead is taken to be love. And with respect to the circumstance that, in that enumeration of mutually connected objects which is given when it is said, \"All things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's,\"[fn-32-P3292_1511009:109-nf] as also, \"The head of the woman is the man, the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God,\"[fn-32-P3293_1511143:110-nf] there is no mention of the Holy Spirit; this they affirm to be but an application of the principle that, in general, the connection itself is not wont to be enumerated among the things which are connected with each other. Whence, also, those who read with closer attention appear to recognize the express Trinity likewise in that passage in which it is said, \"For of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things.\"[fn-32-P3294_1511582:111-nf] \"Of Him,\" as if it meant, of that One who owes it to no one that He is: \"through Him,\" as if the idea were, through a Mediator; \"in Him,\" as if it were, in that One who holds together, that is, unites by connecting.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Since, therefore, there clearly exist these two characteristics in the Jewish prophetic literature, let the reader remember,[fn-48-P4849_1534678:66-nf] whenever we adduce any evidence therefrom, that, by mutual consent,[fn-48-P4850_1534773:67-nf] the point of discussion is not the form of the scripture, but the subject it is called in to prove. When, therefore, our heretics in their phrenzy presumed to say that that Christ was come who had never been fore-announced, it followed that, on their assumption, that Christ had not yet appeared who had always been predicted; and thus they are obliged to make common cause with[fn-48-P4851_1535171:68-nf] Jewish error, and construct their arguments with its assistance, on the pretence that the Jews were themselves quite certain that it was some other who came: so they not only rejected Him as a stranger, but slew Him as an enemy, although they would without doubt have acknowledged Him, and with all religious devotion followed Him, if He had only been one of themselves: Our shipmaster[fn-48-P4852_1535576:69-nf] of course got his craft-wisdom not from the Rhodian law,[fn-48-P4853_1535647:70-nf] but from the Pontic,[fn-48-P4854_1535763:71-nf] which cautioned him against believing that the Jews had no right to sin against their Christ; whereas (even if nothing like their conduct had been predicted against them) human nature alone, liable to error as it is, might well have induced him to suppose that it was quite possible for the Jews to have committed such a sin, considered as men, without assuming any unfair prejudice regarding their feelings, whose sin was antecedently so credible. Since, however, it was actually foretold that they would not acknowledge Christ, and therefore would even put Him to death, it will therefore follow that He was both ignored[fn-48-P4855_1536474:72-nf] and slain by them, who were beforehand pointed out as being about to commit such offences against Him. If you require a proof of this, instead of turning out those passages of Scripture which, while they declare Christ to be capable of suffering death, do thereby also affirm the possibility of His being rejected (for if He had not been rejected, He could not really suffer anything), but rather reserving them for the subject of His sufferings, I shall content myself at the present moment with adducing those which simply show that there was a probability of Christ's rejection. This is quickly done, since the passages indicate that the entire power of understanding was by the Creator taken from the people. \"I will take away,\" says He, \"the wisdom of their wise men; and the understanding of their prudent men will I hide; \"[fn-48-P4856_1537340:73-nf] and again: \"With your ear ye shall hear, and not understand; and with your eyes ye shall see, but not perceive: for the heart of this people hath growth fat, and with their ears they hear heavily, and their eyes have they shut; lest they hear with their ears, and see with their eyes, and understand with the heart, and be converted, and I heal them.\"[fn-48-P4857_1537712:74-nf] Now this blunting of their sound senses they had brought on themselves, loving God with their lips, but keeping far away from Him in their heart. Since, then, Christ was announced by the Creator, \"who formeth the lightning, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man His Christ,\" as the prophet Joel says,[fn-48-P4858_1538079:75-nf] since the entire hope of the Jews, not to say of the Gentiles too, was fixed on the manifestation of Christ,-it was demonstrated that they, by their being deprived of those powers of knowledge and understanding-wisdom and prudence, would fail to know and understand that which was predicted, even Christ; when the chief of their wise men should be in error respecting Him-that is to say, their scribes and prudent ones, or Pharisees; and when the people, like them, should hear with their ears and not understand Christ while teaching them, and see with their eyes and not perceive Christ, although giving them signs. Similarly it is said elsewhere: \"Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, but he who ruleth over them? \"[fn-48-P4859_1539476:76-nf] Also when He upbraids them by the same Isaiah: \"I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know; my people doth not consider.\"[fn-48-P4860_1539743:77-nf] We indeed, who know for certain that Christ always spoke in the prophets, as the Spirit of the Creator (for so says the prophet: \"The person of our Spirit, Christ the Lord,\"[fn-48-P4861_1539936:78-nf] who from the beginning was both heard and seen as the Father's vicegerent in the name of God), are well aware that His words, when actually upbraiding Israel, were the same as those which it was foretold that He should denounce against him: \"Ye have forsaken the Lord, and have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger.\"[fn-48-P4862_1540398:79-nf] If, however, you would rather refer to God Himself, instead of to Christ, the whole imputation of Jewish ignorance from the first, through an unwillingness to allow that even anciently[fn-48-P4863_1540599:80-nf] the Creator's word and Spirit-that is to say, His Christ-was despised and not acknowledged by them, you will even in this subterfuge be defeated. For when you do not deny that the Creator's Son and Spirit and Substance is also His Christ, you must needs allow that those who have not acknowledged the Father have failed likewise to acknowledge the Son through the identity of their natural substance;[fn-48-P4864_1541013:81-nf] for if in Its fulness It has baffled man's understanding, much more has a portion of It, especially when partaking of the fulness[fn-48-P4865_1541185:82-nf] Now, when these things are carefully considered, it becomes evident how the Jews both rejected Christ and slew Him; not because they regarded Him as a strange Christ, but because they did not acknowledge Him, although their own. For how could they have understood the strange One, concerning whom nothing had ever been announced, when they failed to understand Him about whom there had been a perpetual course of prophecy? That admits of being understood or being not understood, which, by possessing a substantial basis for prophecy,[fn-48-P4866_1541795:83-nf] will also have a subject-matter[fn-48-P4867_1541861:84-nf] for either knowledge or error; whilst that which lacks such matter admits not the issue of wisdom. So that it was not as if He belonged to another[fn-48-P4868_1542023:85-nf] god that they conceived an aversion for Christ, and persecuted Him, but simply as a man whom they regarded as a wonder-working juggler,[fn-48-P4869_1542214:86-nf] and an enemy[fn-48-P4870_1542293:87-nf] in His doctrines. They brought Him therefore to trial as a mere man, and one of themselves too-that is, a Jew (only a renegade and a destroyer of Judaism)-and punished Him according to their law. If He had been a stranger, indeed, they would not have sat in judgment over Him. So far are they from appearing to have understood Him to be a strange Christ, that they did not even judge Him to be a stranger to their own human nature.[fn-48-P4871_1542766:88-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Since, therefore, there clearly exist these two characteristics in the Jewish prophetic literature, let the reader remember,[fn-48-P4849_1534678:66-nf] whenever we adduce any evidence therefrom, that, by mutual consent,[fn-48-P4850_1534773:67-nf] the point of discussion is not the form of the scripture, but the subject it is called in to prove. When, therefore, our heretics in their phrenzy presumed to say that that Christ was come who had never been fore-announced, it followed that, on their assumption, that Christ had not yet appeared who had always been predicted; and thus they are obliged to make common cause with[fn-48-P4851_1535171:68-nf] Jewish error, and construct their arguments with its assistance, on the pretence that the Jews were themselves quite certain that it was some other who came: so they not only rejected Him as a stranger, but slew Him as an enemy, although they would without doubt have acknowledged Him, and with all religious devotion followed Him, if He had only been one of themselves: Our shipmaster[fn-48-P4852_1535576:69-nf] of course got his craft-wisdom not from the Rhodian law,[fn-48-P4853_1535647:70-nf] but from the Pontic,[fn-48-P4854_1535763:71-nf] which cautioned him against believing that the Jews had no right to sin against their Christ; whereas (even if nothing like their conduct had been predicted against them) human nature alone, liable to error as it is, might well have induced him to suppose that it was quite possible for the Jews to have committed such a sin, considered as men, without assuming any unfair prejudice regarding their feelings, whose sin was antecedently so credible. Since, however, it was actually foretold that they would not acknowledge Christ, and therefore would even put Him to death, it will therefore follow that He was both ignored[fn-48-P4855_1536474:72-nf] and slain by them, who were beforehand pointed out as being about to commit such offences against Him. If you require a proof of this, instead of turning out those passages of Scripture which, while they declare Christ to be capable of suffering death, do thereby also affirm the possibility of His being rejected (for if He had not been rejected, He could not really suffer anything), but rather reserving them for the subject of His sufferings, I shall content myself at the present moment with adducing those which simply show that there was a probability of Christ's rejection. This is quickly done, since the passages indicate that the entire power of understanding was by the Creator taken from the people. \"I will take away,\" says He, \"the wisdom of their wise men; and the understanding of their prudent men will I hide; \"[fn-48-P4856_1537340:73-nf] and again: \"With your ear ye shall hear, and not understand; and with your eyes ye shall see, but not perceive: for the heart of this people hath growth fat, and with their ears they hear heavily, and their eyes have they shut; lest they hear with their ears, and see with their eyes, and understand with the heart, and be converted, and I heal them.\"[fn-48-P4857_1537712:74-nf] Now this blunting of their sound senses they had brought on themselves, loving God with their lips, but keeping far away from Him in their heart. Since, then, Christ was announced by the Creator, \"who formeth the lightning, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man His Christ,\" as the prophet Joel says,[fn-48-P4858_1538079:75-nf] since the entire hope of the Jews, not to say of the Gentiles too, was fixed on the manifestation of Christ,-it was demonstrated that they, by their being deprived of those powers of knowledge and understanding-wisdom and prudence, would fail to know and understand that which was predicted, even Christ; when the chief of their wise men should be in error respecting Him-that is to say, their scribes and prudent ones, or Pharisees; and when the people, like them, should hear with their ears and not understand Christ while teaching them, and see with their eyes and not perceive Christ, although giving them signs. Similarly it is said elsewhere: \"Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, but he who ruleth over them? \"[fn-48-P4859_1539476:76-nf] Also when He upbraids them by the same Isaiah: \"I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know; my people doth not consider.\"[fn-48-P4860_1539743:77-nf] We indeed, who know for certain that Christ always spoke in the prophets, as the Spirit of the Creator (for so says the prophet: \"The person of our Spirit, Christ the Lord,\"[fn-48-P4861_1539936:78-nf] who from the beginning was both heard and seen as the Father's vicegerent in the name of God), are well aware that His words, when actually upbraiding Israel, were the same as those which it was foretold that He should denounce against him: \"Ye have forsaken the Lord, and have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger.\"[fn-48-P4862_1540398:79-nf] If, however, you would rather refer to God Himself, instead of to Christ, the whole imputation of Jewish ignorance from the first, through an unwillingness to allow that even anciently[fn-48-P4863_1540599:80-nf] the Creator's word and Spirit-that is to say, His Christ-was despised and not acknowledged by them, you will even in this subterfuge be defeated. For when you do not deny that the Creator's Son and Spirit and Substance is also His Christ, you must needs allow that those who have not acknowledged the Father have failed likewise to acknowledge the Son through the identity of their natural substance;[fn-48-P4864_1541013:81-nf] for if in Its fulness It has baffled man's understanding, much more has a portion of It, especially when partaking of the fulness[fn-48-P4865_1541185:82-nf] Now, when these things are carefully considered, it becomes evident how the Jews both rejected Christ and slew Him; not because they regarded Him as a strange Christ, but because they did not acknowledge Him, although their own. For how could they have understood the strange One, concerning whom nothing had ever been announced, when they failed to understand Him about whom there had been a perpetual course of prophecy? That admits of being understood or being not understood, which, by possessing a substantial basis for prophecy,[fn-48-P4866_1541795:83-nf] will also have a subject-matter[fn-48-P4867_1541861:84-nf] for either knowledge or error; whilst that which lacks such matter admits not the issue of wisdom. So that it was not as if He belonged to another[fn-48-P4868_1542023:85-nf] god that they conceived an aversion for Christ, and persecuted Him, but simply as a man whom they regarded as a wonder-working juggler,[fn-48-P4869_1542214:86-nf] and an enemy[fn-48-P4870_1542293:87-nf] in His doctrines. They brought Him therefore to trial as a mere man, and one of themselves too-that is, a Jew (only a renegade and a destroyer of Judaism)-and punished Him according to their law. If He had been a stranger, indeed, they would not have sat in judgment over Him. So far are they from appearing to have understood Him to be a strange Christ, that they did not even judge Him to be a stranger to their own human nature.[fn-48-P4871_1542766:88-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"424","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"So great is the divergence between the doctrines.

When the only-begotten Son of God was made man, then He was named Christ, then human nature received the beams of intellectual light; then the heralds of the truth shed their beams upon the world. Teachers of the Church, however, constantly used the names of the only begotten without distinction; at one time they glorify the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost; at another the Father with Christ and the Holy Ghost; yet as far as the sense is concerned there is here no difference.

But the restitution of motion to the maimed, the resurrection of the dead, the supply of loaves, and all the other miracles we believe to be works of the divine power. In this sense I say that the same Lord Christ both suffers and destroys suffering; suffers, that is, as touching the visible, and destroys suffering as touching the ineffably indwelling Godhead. This is proved beyond question by the narrative of the holy evangelists, from whom we learn that when lying in a manger and wrapped in swaddling clothes, He was announced by a star, worshipped by magi and hymned by angels. Thus we reverent discern that the swaddling bands and the want of a bed and all the poverty belonged to the manhood; while the journey of the magi and the guiding of the star and the company of the angels proclaim the Godhead of the unseen. In like manner He makes His escape into Egypt and avoids the fury of Herod by flight,[fn-65-P6538_1688697:576-nf] for He was man; but as the Prophet says \"He shakes the idols of Egypt,\"[fn-65-P6539_1688799:577-nf] for He was by nature God. He is circumcised; He keeps the law; and offers offerings of purification, because He sprang from the root of Jesse. And, as man, He was under the law; and afterwards did away with the law and gave the new covenant, because He was a lawgiver and had promised by the prophets that He Himself would give it. He was baptized by John; and this shews His sharing what is ours. He is testified to by the Father from on high and is pointed out by the Spirit; this proclaims Him eternal. He hungered; but He fed many thousands with five loaves; the latter is divine, the former human. He thirsted and He asked for water; but He was the well of life; the former of His human weakness, the latter of His divine power. He fell asleep in the boat, but he put the tempest of the sea to sleep; the former of His human nature, the latter of His efficient and creative power which has gifted all things with their being. He was weary as he walked; but He healed the halt and raised dead men from their tombs; the former of human weakness, the latter of a power passing that of this world. He feared death and He destroyed death; the former shows that He was mortal, the latter that He was immortal or rather giver of life. \"He was crucified,\" as the blessed Paul says \"through weakness.\"[fn-65-P6540_1690119:578-nf] But as the same Paul says \"Yet He liveth by the power of God.\"[fn-65-P6541_1690207:579-nf] Let that word \"weakness\" teach us that He was not nailed to the tree as the Almighty, the Uncircumscribed, the Immutable and Invariable, but that the nature quickened by the power of God, was according to the Apostle's teaching dead and buried, both death and burial being proper to the form of the servant. \"He broke the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder\"[fn-65-P6542_1690605:580-nf] and destroyed the power of death and in three days raised His own temple.

As Peter exclaimed to the Jews: \"Being at the right hand of God exalted, He hath shed forth this Spirit received from the Father, which ye both see and hear.\"[fn-45-P4580_1748443:16-nf] Moreover, John the Baptist had also anticipated this, by saying to his disciples: \"For God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him. The Father,\" says he, \"loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hands.\"[fn-45-P4581_1748677:17-nf] Those seven stars are the seven churches, which he names in his addresses by name, old calls them to whom he wrote epistles. Not that they are themselves the only, or even the principal churches; but what he says to one, he says to all. For they are in no respect different, that on that ground any one should prefer them to the larger number of similar small ones. In the whole world Paul taught that all the churches are arranged by sevens, that they are called seven, and that the Catholic Church is one. And first of all, indeed, that he himself also might maintain the type of seven churches, he did not exceed that number. But he wrote to the Romans, to the Corinthians, to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the Thessalonians, to the Philippians, to the Colossians; afterwards he wrote to individual persons, so as not to exceed the number of seven churches. And abridging in a short space his announcement, he thus says to Timothy: \"That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the Church of the living God.\"[fn-45-P4582_1749774:18-nf] We read also that this typical number is announced by the Holy Spirit by the month of Isaiah: \"Of seven women which took hold of one man.\"[fn-45-P4583_1749934:19-nf] The one man is Christ, not born of seed; but the seven women are seven churches, receiving His bread, and clothed with his apparel, who ask that their reproach should be taken away, only that His name should be called upon them. The bread is the Holy Spirit, which nourishes to eternal life, promised to them, that is, by faith. And His garments wherewith they desire to be clothed are the glory of immortality, of which Paul the apostle says: \"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on mortality.\"[fn-45-P4584_1750484:20-nf] Moreover, they ask that their reproach may be taken away-that is, that they may be cleansed from their sins: for the reproach is the original sin which is taken away in baptism, and they begin to be called Christian men, which is, \"Let thy name be called upon us.\" Therefore in these seven churches, of one Catholic Church are believers, because it is one in seven by the quality of faith and election. Whether writing to them who labour in the world, and live[fn-45-P4585_1750965:21-nf] of the frugality of their labours, and are patient, and when they see certain men in the Church wasters, and pernicious, they hear them, lest there should become dissension, he yet admonishes them by love, that in what respects their faith is deficient they should repent; or to those who dwell in cruel places among persecutors, that they should continue faithful; or to those who, under the pretext of mercy, do unlawful sins in the Church, and make them manifest to be done by others; or to those that are at ease in the Church; or to those who are negligent, and Christians only in name; or to those who are meekly instructed, that they may bravely persevere in faith; or to those who study the Scriptures, and labour to know the mysteries of their announcement, and are unwilling to do God's work that is mercy and love: to all he urges penitence, to all he declares judgment.","title":"Commentary on the Apocalypse of the Blessed John","author":"Victorinus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_29_on_the_profit_of_believing_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"7. And further, analogy, whereby the agreement of both Testaments is plainly seen, why shall I say that all have made use of, to whose authority they yield; whereas it is in their power to consider with themselves, how many things they are wont to say have been inserted in the divine Scriptures by certain, I know not who, corrupters of truth? Which speech of theirs I always thought to be most weak, even at the time that I was their hearer: nor I alone, but you also, (for I well remember,) and all of us, who essayed to exercise a little more care in forming a judgment than the crowd of hearers. But now, after that many things have been expounded and made clear to me, which used chiefly to move me: those I mean, wherein their discourse for the most part boasts itself, and expatiates the more freely, the more safely it can do so as having no opponent; it seems to me that there is no assertion of theirs more shameless, or (to use a milder phrase) more careless and weak than that the divine Scriptures have been corrupted; whereas there are no copies in existence, in a matter of so recent date, whereby they can prove it. For were they to assert, that they thought not that they ought thoroughly to receive them, because they had been written by persons, who they thought had not written the truth; any how their refusal[fn-34-P3411_1571432:11-nf] would be more right, or their error more natural.[fn-34-P3412_1571502:12-nf] For this is what they have done in the case of the Book which is inscribed the Acts of the Apostles. And this device of theirs, when I consider with myself, I cannot enough wonder at. For it is not the want of wisdom in the men that I complain of in this matter, but the want of ordinary understanding.[fn-34-P3413_1571821:13-nf] For that book hath so great matters, which are like what they receive, that it seems to me great folly to refuse to receive this book also, and if any thing offend them there to call it false and inserted. Or, if such language is shameless, as it is why in the Epistles of Paul, why in the four books of the Gospel, do they think that they[fn-34-P3414_1572181:14-nf] are of any avail, in which I am not sure but that there are in proportion many more things, than could be in that book, which they will have believed to have been interpolated by falsifiers. But fosooth this is what I believe to be the case, and I ask of you to consider it with me with as calm and serene a judgment as possible. For you know that, essaying to bring the person of their founder Manichaeus into the number of the Apostles, they say that the Holy Spirit, Whom the Lord promised His disciples that He would send, hath come to us through him. Therefore, were they to receive those Acts of the Apostles, in which the coming of the Holy Spirit is plainly set forth,[fn-34-P3415_1572868:15-nf] they could not find how to say that it was interpolated. For they will have it that there were some, I know not who, falsifiers of the divine Books before the times of Manichaeus himself; and that they were falsified by persons who wished to combine the Law of the Jews with the Gospel. But this they cannot say concerning the Holy Spirit, unless haply they assert that those persons divined, and set in their books what should be brought forward against Manichaeus, who should at some future time arise, and say that the Holy Spirit had been sent through him. But concerning the Holy Spirit we will speak somewhat more plainly in another place.

Surely of him concerning whom he adds soon afterwards: \"The man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image of God.\"[fn-75-P7507_2155063:339-nf] Since then he is the image of the Creator (for He, when looking on Christ His Word, who was to become man, said, \"Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness\"[fn-75-P7508_2155252:340-nf] ), how can I possibly have another head but Him whose image I am?

He adds: \"Because of the angels.\"[fn-75-P7511_2155827:343-nf] What angels? In other words, whose angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,[fn-75-P7512_2155938:344-nf] there is great propriety in his meaning. It is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty. If, however, the angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is there for them? for not even Marcion's disciples, (to say nothing of his angels, ) have any desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as evil[fn-75-P7513_2156431:345-nf] among \"works of the flesh,\" and that he would have those persons accounted estimable[fn-75-P7514_2156542:346-nf] who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,[fn-75-P7515_2156654:347-nf] we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup[fn-75-P7516_2156753:348-nf] the verity of the Lord's body and blood in opposition to Marcion's phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of \"spiritual gifts,\"[fn-75-P7517_2157084:349-nf] I have to remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower[fn-75-P7518_2157455:350-nf] shall spring up from his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.\" After which he enumerates the special gifts of the same \"The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.[fn-75-P7519_2157733:351-nf] And with the fear of the Lord[fn-75-P7520_2157801:352-nf] shall the Spirit fill Him.\"[fn-75-P7521_2157867:353-nf] In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;[fn-75-P7522_2158291:354-nf] so that you cannot argue from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says, ) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,[fn-75-P7523_2158731:355-nf] rising from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst them. From Judah were taken away \"the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet; \"[fn-75-P7524_2159162:356-nf] that so it might prove true that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-75-P7525_2159266:357-nf] Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: \"He ascended up. on high,\" that is, into heaven; \"He led captivity captive,\" meaning death or slavery of man; \"He gave gifts to the sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7526_2159546:358-nf] that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata. He says specifically \"sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7527_2159690:359-nf] and not men promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children of men truly so called, choice men, apostles. \"For,\" says he, \"I have begotten you through the gospel; \"[fn-75-P7528_2159927:360-nf] and \"Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.\"[fn-75-P7529_2160009:361-nf] Now was absolutely fulfilled that promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.\"[fn-75-P7530_2160310:362-nf] Since, then, the Creator promised the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ has in these last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle says, \"When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son; \"[fn-75-P7531_2160624:363-nf] and again, \"This I say, brethren, that the time is short\"[fn-75-P7532_2160701:364-nf] ), it evidently follows in connection with this prediction of the last days, that this gift of the Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters. Now compare the Spirit's specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised by the prophet Isaiah. \"To one is given,\" says he, \"by the Spirit the word of wisdom; \"this we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be \"the spirit of wisdom.\" \"To another, the word of knowledge; \"this will be \"the (prophet's) spirit of understanding and counsel.\" \"To another, faith by the same Spirit; \"this will be \"the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.\" \"To another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles; \"this will be \"the spirit of might.\" \"To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues; \"this will be \"the spirit of knowledge.\"[fn-75-P7533_2161674:365-nf] See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is possible that they are opposed to our side, even if[fn-75-P7550_2164330:382-nf] the Creator promised them for His Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people. Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong severally[fn-75-P7557_2165747:389-nf] to my God.

For if in their spiritual things the Gentiles have communicated, they ought also in carnal things to minister unto them.\"[fn-46-P4600_2265239:58-nf] This is like that which he says to the Corinthians: \"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things?\"[fn-46-P4601_2265408:59-nf] Also to the Corinthians in the second Epistle: \"Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia; how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality; for to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power, they were willing of themselves; with many prayers beseeching of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints: and not as we hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God, insomuch, that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. But as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the exceeding dearness of your love. For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be made rich. And herein I give advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be willing a year ago; now therefore perfect it in the doing; that as there is a readiness to will, so of performance also out of that which each hath. For if there be first a ready mind, it is acceptable according to that a man hath, not according to that he hath not. Not, namely, that others may have ease, and ye straits. but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may become a supply for your want: that there may be equality, as it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack. But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus: for indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went forth unto you. And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the Gospel throughout all the Churches; and not that only, but he was also ordained of the Churches as a companion of our travail, with this grace. which is administered by us to the glory of the Lord, and our ready mind: avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us.

But we learn no such fact from the Acts of the Apostles in that ejaculation of the Church to God, \"Of a truth, Lord, against Thy Holy Child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together.\"[fn-108-P10857_3048785:396-nf] These then testified both that Jesus was the Son of God, and that being the Son, He was anointed by the Father. Christ therefore must be the same as Jesus who was anointed by the Father, and not the Father, who anointed the Son. To the same effect are the words of Peter: \"Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ,\" that is, Anointed.[fn-108-P10858_3049223:397-nf] John, moreover, brands that man as \"a liar\" who \"denieth that Jesus is the Christ; \"whilst on the other hand he declares that \"every one is born of God who believeth that Jesus is the Christ.\"[fn-108-P10859_3049436:398-nf] Wherefore he also exhorts us to believe in the name of His (the Father's, ) Son Jesus Christ, that \"our fellowship may be with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.\"[fn-108-P10860_3049653:399-nf] Paul, in like manner, everywhere speaks of \"God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.\" When writing to the Romans, he gives thanks to God through our Lord Jesus Christ.[fn-108-P10861_3049843:400-nf] To the Galatians he declares himself to be \"an apostle not of men, neither by man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father.\"[fn-108-P10862_3049990:401-nf] You possess indeed all his writings, which testify plainly to the same effect, and set forth Two-God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father. (They also testify) that Jesus is Himself the Christ, and under one or the other designation the Son of God. For precisely by the same right as both names belong to the same Person, even the Son of God, does either name alone without the other belong to the same Person. Consequently, whether it be the name Jesus which occurs alone, Christ is also understood, because Jesus is the Anointed One; or if the name Christ is the only one given, then Jesus is identified with Him, because the Anointed One is Jesus. Now, of these two names Jesus Christ, the former is the proper one, which was given to Him by the angel; and the latter is only an adjunct, predicable of Him from His anointing,-thussuggesting the proviso that Christ must be the Son, not the Father. How blind, to be sure, is the man who fails to perceive that by the name of Christ some other God is implied, if he ascribes to the Father this name of Christ! For if Christ is God the Father, when He says, \"I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God,\"[fn-108-P10863_3051210:402-nf] He of course shows plainly enough that there is above Himself another Father and another God. If, again, the Father is Christ, He must be some other Being who \"strengtheneth the thunder, and createth the wind, and declareth unto men His Christ.\"[fn-108-P10864_3051476:403-nf] And if \"the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ,\"[fn-108-P10865_3051623:404-nf] that Lord must be another Being, against whose Christ were gathered together the kings and the rulers. And if, to quote another passage, \"Thus saith the Lord to my Lord Christ,\"[fn-108-P10866_3051819:405-nf] the Lord who speaks to the Father of Christ must be a distinct Being. Moreover, when the apostle in his epistle prays, \"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of knowledge,\"[fn-108-P10867_3052138:406-nf] He must be other (than Christ), who is the God of Jesus Christ, the bestower of spiritual gifts. And once for all, that we may not wander through every passage, He \"who raised up Christ from the dead, and is also to raise up our mortal bodies,\"[fn-108-P10868_3052402:407-nf] must certainly be, as the quickener, different from the dead Father,[fn-108-P10869_3052493:408-nf] or even from the quickened Father, if Christ who died is the Father.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":41,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_38_homily_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And had we attained to excellence in respect of concord, then had we no other home beside this.

Not that the same method of instruction will be suitable in the case of all who approach the word. The catechism must be adapted to the diversities of their religious worship; with an eye, indeed, to the one aim and end of the system, but not using the same method of preparation in each individual case. The Judaizer has been preoccupied with one set of notions, one conversant with Hellenism, with others; while the Anomoean, and the Manichee, with the followers of Marcion[fn-38-P3835_2503220:3-nf] , Valentinus, and Basilides[fn-38-P3836_2504317:4-nf] , and the rest on the list of those who have wandered into heresy, each of them being prepossessed with their peculiar notions, necessitate a special controversy with their several. opinions. The method of recovery must be adapted to the form of the disease. You will not by the same means cure the polytheism of the Greek, and the unbelief of the Jew as to the Only-begotten God: nor as regards those who have wandered into heresy will you, by the same arguments in each case, upset their misleading romances as to the tenets of the Faith. No one could set Sabellius[fn-38-P3837_2505435:5-nf] right by the same instruction as would benefit the Anomoean[fn-38-P3838_2505978:6-nf] . The controversy with the Manichee is profitless against the Jew[fn-38-P3839_2506806:7-nf] . It is necessary, therefore, as I have said, to regard the opinions which the persons have taken up, and to frame your argument in accordance with the error into which each has fallen, by advancing in each discussion certain principles and reasonable propositions, that thus, through what is agreed upon on both sides, the truth may conclusively be brought to light. When, then, a discussion is held with one of those who favour Greek ideas, it would be well to make the ascertaining of this the commencement of the reasoning, i.e. whether he presupposes the existence of a God, or concurs with the atheistic view. Should he say there is no God, then, from the consideration of the skilful and wise economy of the Universe he will be brought to acknowledge that there is a certain overmastering power manifested through these channels. If, on the other hand, he should have no doubt as to the existence of Deity, but should be inclined to entertain the presumption of a plurality of Gods, then we will adopt against him some such train of reasoning as this: \"does he think Deity is perfect or defective?\" and if, as is likely, he bears testimony to the perfection in the Divine nature, then we will demand of him to grant a perfection throughout in everything that is observable in that divinity, in order that Deity may not be regarded as a mixture of opposites, defect and perfection. But whether as respects power, or the conception of goodness, or wisdom and imperishability and eternal existence, or any other notion besides suitable to the nature of Deity, that is found to lie close to the subject of our contemplation, in all he will agree that perfection is the idea to be entertained of the Divine nature, as being a just inference from these premises. If this, then, be granted us, it would not be difficult to bring round these scattered notions of a plurality of Gods to the acknowledgment of a unity of Deity. For if he admits that perfection is in every respect to be ascribed to the subject before us, though there is a plurality of these perfect things which are marked with the same character, he must be required by a logical necessity, either to point out the particularity in each of these things which present no distinctive variation, but are found always with the same marks, or, if (he cannot do that, and) the mind can grasp nothing in them in the way of particular, to give up the idea of any distinction. For if neither as regards \"more and less\" a person can detect a difference (in as much as the idea of perfection does not admit of it), nor as regards \"worse\" and \"better\" (for he cannot entertain a notion of Deity at all where the term \"worse\" is not got rid of), nor as regards \"ancient\" and \"modern\" (for what exists not for ever is foreign to the notion of Deity), but on the contrary the idea of Godhead is one and the same, no peculiarity being on any ground of reason to be discovered in any one point, it is an absolute necessity that the mistaken fancy of a plurality of Gods would be forced to the acknowledgment of a unity of Deity. For if goodness, and justice, and wisdom, and power may be equally predicated of it, then also imperishability and eternal existence, and every orthodox idea would be in the same way admitted. As then all distinctive difference in any aspect whatever has been gradually removed, it necessarily follows that together with it a plurality of Gods has been removed from his belief, the general identity bringing round conviction to the Unity.","title":"The Great Catechism","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_37_book_iii_of_the_canonical_system_of_the_daily_prayers_and_psalms_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"And so in the monasteries of Palestine and Mesopotamia and all the East the services of the above-mentioned hours are ended each day with three Psalms apiece, so that constant prayers may be offered to God at the appointed times, and yet, the spiritual duties being completed with due moderation, the necessary offices of work may not be in any way interfered with: for at these three seasons we know that Daniel the prophet also poured forth his prayers to God day by day in his chamber with the windows open.[fn-21-P2127_915020:4-nf] Nor is it without good reasons that these times are more particularly assigned to religious offices, since at them what completed the promises and summed up our salvation was fulfilled. For we can show that at the third hour the Holy Spirit, who had been of old promised by the prophets, descended in the first instance on the Apostles assembled together for prayer. For when in their astonishment at the speaking with tongues, which proceeded from them throughthe outpouring of the Holy Ghost upon them, the unbelieving people of the Jews mocked and said that they were full of new wine, then Peter, standing up in the midst of them, said: \"Men of Israel, and all ye who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known unto you, and consider my words. For these men are not, as ye imagine, drunk, since it is the third hour of the day; but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel: and it shall come to pass in the last days, saith the Lord, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams. And indeed upon my servants and my handmaids in those days I will pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.\"[fn-21-P2128_916267:5-nf] And all of this was fulfilled at the third hour, when the Holy Spirit, announced before by the prophets, came at that hour and abode upon the Apostles. But at the sixth hour the spotless Sacrifice, our Lord and Saviour, was offered up to the Father, and, ascending the cross for the salvation of the whole world, made atonement for the sins of mankind, and, despoiling principalities and powers, led them away openly; and all of us who were liable to death and bound by the debt of the handwriting that could not be paid, He freed, by taking it away out of the midst and affixing it to His cross for a trophy,[fn-21-P2129_916896:6-nf] At the same hour, too, to Peter,in an ecstasy of mind, there was divinely revealed both the calling of the Gentiles by the letting down of the Gospel vessel from heaven, and also the cleansing of all the living creatures contained in it, when a voice came to him and said to him: \"Rise, Peter; kill and eat; \"[fn-21-P2130_917522:7-nf] which vessel, let down from heaven by the four corners, is plainly seen to signify nothing else than the Gospel. For although, as it is divided by the fourfold narrative of the Evangelists, it seems to have \"four corners\" (or beginnings), yet the body of the Gospel is but one; embracing, as it does, the birth as well as the Godhead, and the miracles as well as the passion of one and the same Christ. Excellently, too, it says not \"of linen\" but \"as if of linen.\" For linen signifies death. Since, then, our Lord's death and passion were not undergone by the law of human nature, but of His own free will, it says \"as if of linen.\" For when dead according to theflesh He was not dead according to the spirit, because \"His soul was not left in hell, neither did His flesh see corruption.\"[fn-21-P2131_918331:8-nf] And again He says: \"No man taketh My life from Mebut I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-21-P2132_918496:9-nf] And so in this vessel of the Gospels let down from heaven, that is written by the Holy Ghost, all the nations which were formerly outside the observance of the law and reckoned as unclean now flow together through belief in the faith that they may to their salvation be turned away from the worship of idols and be serviceable for health-giving food, and are brought to Peter and cleansed by the voice of the Lord. But at the ninth hour, penetrating to hades, He there by the brightness of His splendour extinguished the indescribable darkness of hell, and, bursting its brazen gates and breaking the iron bars brought away with Him to the skies the captive band of saints which was there shut up and detained in the darkness of inexorable hell,[fn-21-P2133_919261:10-nf] and, by taking away the fiery sword, restored to paradise its original inhabitants by his pious confession. At the same hour, too, Cornelius, the centurion, continuing with his customary devotion in his prayers, is made aware through the converse of the angel with him that his prayers and alms are remembered before the Lord, and at the ninth hour the mystery[fn-21-P2134_920046:11-nf] of the calling of the Gentiles is clearly shown to him, which had been revealed to Peter in his ecstasy of mind at the sixth hour. In another passage, too, in the Acts of the Apostles, we are told as follows about the same time: \"But Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.\"[fn-21-P2135_920765:12-nf] And by these notices it is clearly proved that these hours were not without good reason consecrated with religious services by holy and apostolic men, and ought to be observed in like manner by us, who, unless we are compelled, as it were, by some rule to discharge these pious offices at least at stated times,either through sloth or through forgetfulness,or being absorbed in business, spend the wholeday without engaging in prayer. But concerning the evening sacrifices what is to be said,since even in the Old Testament these areordered to be offered continually by the law of Moses? For that the morning whole-burnt offerings and evening sacrifices were offered every day continually in the temple, although with figurative offerings, we can show from that which is sung by David: \"Let my prayer be set forth in Thy sight as the incense, and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice,\"[fn-21-P2136_921687:13-nf] in which place we can understand it in a still higher sense of that true evening sacrifice which was given by the Lord our Saviour in the evening to the Apostles at the Supper, when He instituted the holy mysteries of the Church, and of that evening sacrifice which He Himself, on the following day, in the end of the ages, offered up to the Father by the lifting up of His hands for the salvation of the whole world; which spreading forth of His hands on the Cross is quite correctly called a \"lifting up.\" For when we were all lying in hades He raised us to heaven, according to the word of His own promise when He says: \"When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto Me.\"[fn-21-P2137_922402:14-nf] But concerning Martins, that also teaches us which it is customary every day to sing at it: \"O God, my God, to Thee do I watch at break of day;\" and \"I will meditate on Thee in the morning;\" and \"I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;\" and again, \"Mine eyes to Thee have prevented the morning, that I might meditate on Thy words.\"[fn-21-P2138_922762:15-nf] At these hours too that householder in the Gospel hired labourers into his vineyard. For thus also is he described as having hired them in the early morning, which time denotes the Mattin office; then at the third hour; then at the sixth; after this, at the ninth; and last of all, at the eleventh,[fn-21-P2139_923473:16-nf] by which the hour of the lamps[fn-21-P2140_923526:17-nf] is denoted.[fn-21-P2141_923704:18-nf] ","title":"Book III.

All things that are read from the Holy Scriptures in order to our instruction and salvation, it behoves us to hear with earnest heed. Yet most of all must those things be commended to our memory, which are of most force against heretics; whose insidious designs cease not to circumvent all that are weaker and more negligent. Remember that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ both died for us, and rose again; died, to wit, for our offenses, rose again for our justification.[fn-40-P4056_2225496:2-nf] Even as ye have just heard concerning the two disciples whom He met with in the way, how \"their eyes were holden that they should not know Him:\"[fn-40-P4057_2225658:3-nf] and He found them despairing of the redemption that was in Christ, and deeming that now He had suffered and was dead as a man, not accounting that as Son of God He ever liveth; and deeming too that He was so dead in the flesh as not to come to life again, but just as one of the prophets: as those of you who were attentive have just now heard their own words. Then\"He opened to them the Scriptures, beginning at Moses,\" and going through all the prophets, showing them that all He had suffered had been foretold, lest they should be more staggered if the Lord should rise again, and the more fail to believe Him, if these things had not been told before concerning Him. For the firmness of faith is in this, that all things which came to pass in Christ were foretold. The disciples, then, knew Him not, save \"in the breaking of bread.\" And truly he that eateth and drinketh not judgment to himself in the breaking of bread doth know Christ.[fn-40-P4058_2226621:4-nf] Afterward also those eleven \"thought they saw a spirit.\" He gave Himself to be handled by them, who also gave Himself to be crucified; to be crucified by enemies, to be handled by friends: yet the Physician of all, both of the ungodliness of those, and of the unbelief of these. For ye heard when the Acts of the Apostles were read, how many thousands of Christ's slayers believed.[fn-40-P4059_2227021:5-nf] If those believed afterwards who had killed, should not those believe who for a little while doubted? And yet even in regard of them, (a thing which ye ought especially to observe, and to commit to your memory, because that which shall make us strong against insidious errors, God has been pleased to put in the Scriptures, against which no man dares to speak, who in any sort wishes to seem a Christian), when He had given Himself to be handled by them, that did not suffice Him, but He would also confirm by means of the Scriptures the heart of them that believe: for He looked forward to us who should be afterwards; seeing that in Him we have nothing that we can handle, but have that which we may read. For if those believed only because they held and handled, what shall we do? Now, Christ is ascended into heaven; He is not to come save at the end, to judge the quick and the dead. Whereby shall we believe, but by that whereby it was His will that even those who handled Him should be confirmed? For He opened to them the Scriptures and showed them that it behoved Christ to suffer, and that all things should be fulfilled which were written of Him in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms. He embraced in His discourse the whole ancient text of the Scriptures. All that there is of those former Scriptures tells of Christ; but only if it find ears.

For to \"ascend,\" and to \"sit,\" and to \"come,\" unless you understand the words in accordance with the dignity of the divine nature, appear to point to something of human weakness. For having consummated what was to be done on earth, and having recalled souls from the captivity of hell, He is spoken of as ascending up to heaven, as the Prophet had foretold, \"Ascending up on high He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men,\"[fn-98-P9814_2757299:121-nf] those gifts, namely, which Peter, in the Acts of the Apostles, spoke of concerning the Holy Ghost, \"Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, He hath shed forth this gift which ye do see and hear.\"[fn-98-P9815_2757528:122-nf] He gave the gift of the Holy Ghost to men, because the captives, whom the devil had before carried into hell through sin, Christ by His resurrection from death recalled to heaven.

Lastly, since this entrance within the gates of heaven seemed new to its ministers and princes, they say to one another, on seeing the nature of flesh penetrating into the secret recesses of heaven, as David full of the Holy Ghost, declares, \"Lift up your gates, ye princes, and be ye lift up ye everlasting gates, and the King of glory shall enter in.

For the former deserved to be accused, because they had contemned the law; and they of the Gentiles who believe deserve to be aided by the defence of the Spirit, because they earnestly desire to attain to the Gospel law. Assuredly in the Spirit there are different kinds of offices, because in the times there is a different order of occasions; and yet, on this account, He who discharges these offices is not different, nor is He another in so acting, but He is one and the same, distributing His offices according to the times, and the occasions and impulses of things. Moreover, the Apostle Paul says, \"Having the same Spirit; as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-104-P10424_3282722:246-nf] He is therefore one and the same Spirit who was in the prophets and apostles, except that in the former He was occasional, in the latter always.

For this is He who strengthened their hearts and minds, who marked out the Gospel sacraments, who was in them the enlightener of divine things; and they being strengthened, feared, for the sake of the Lord's name, neither dungeons nor chains, nay, even trod under foot the very powers of the world and its tortures, since they were henceforth armed and strengthened by the same Spirit, having in themselves the gifts which this same Spirit distributes, and appropriates to the Church, the spouse of Christ, as her ornaments. This is He who places prophets in the Church, instructs teachers, directs tongues, gives powers and healings, does wonderful works, often discrimination of spirits, affords powers of government, suggests counsels, and orders and arranges whatever other gifts there are of charismata; and thus make the Lord's Church everywhere, and in all, perfected and completed. This is He who, after the manner of a dove, when our Lord was baptized, came and abode upon Him, dwelling in Christ full and entire, and not maimed in any measure or portion; but with His whole overflow copiously distributed and sent forth, so that from Him others might receive some enjoyment of His graces: the source of the entire Holy Spirit remaining in Christ, so that from Him might be drawn streams of gifts and works, while the Holy Spirit dwelt affluently in Christ.

Who, working in us for eternity, can also produce our bodies at the resurrection of immortality, accustoming them to be associated in Himself with heavenly power, and to be allied with the divine eternity of the Holy Spirit.

Look at these facts:-Christ is born; the Spirit is His Forerunner. He is baptized; the Spirit bears witness. He is tempted; the Spirit leads Him up.[fn-46-P4687_1503505:50-nf] He works miracles; the Spirit accompanies them. He ascends; the Spirit takes His place.

Indeed I tremble when I think of the abundance of the titles, and how many Names they outrage who fall foul of the Spirit.

For He is the Maker of all these, filling all with His Essence, containing all things, filling the world in His Essence, yet incapable of being comprehended in His power by the world; good, upright, princely, by nature not by adoption; sanctifying, not sanctified; measuring, not measured; shared, not sharing; filling, not filled; containing, not contained; inherited, glorified, reckoned with the Father and the Son; held out as a threat;[fn-46-P4690_1504909:53-nf] the Finger of God; fire like God; to manifest, as I take it, His consubstantiality); the Creator-Spirit, Who by Baptism and by Resurrection creates anew; the Spirit That knoweth all things, That teacheth, That bloweth where and to what extent He listeth; That guideth, talketh, sendeth forth, separateth, is angry or tempted; That revealeth, illumineth, quickeneth, or rather is the very Light and Life; That maketh Temples; That deifieth; That perfecteth so as even to anticipate Baptism,[fn-46-P4691_1505480:54-nf] yet after Baptism to be sought as a separate gift;[fn-46-P4692_1505590:55-nf] That doeth all things that God doeth; divided into fiery tongues; dividing gifts; making Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers; understanding manifold, clear, piercing, undefiled, unhindered, which is the same thing as Most wise and varied in His actions; and making all things clear and plain; and of independent power, unchangeable, Almighty, all-seeing, penetrating all spirits that are intelligent, pure, most subtle (the Angel Hosts I think); and also all prophetic spirits and apostolic in the same manner and not in the same places; for they lived in different places; thus showing that He is uncircumscript.","title":"Oration XXXII.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_137_homily_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"10. In the earliest times, \"the Holy Ghost fell upon them that believed: and they spake with tongues,\" which they had not learned, \"as the Spirit gave them utterance.\"[fn-43-P4398_2376276:43-nf] These were signs adapted to the time. For there behooved to be that betokening of the Holy Spirit in all tongues, to shew that the Gospel of God was to run through all tongues over the whole earth. That thing was done for a betokening, and it passed away. In the laying on of hands now, that persons may receive the Holy Ghost, do we look that they should speak with tongues? Or when we laid the hand on these infants,[fn-43-P4399_2376713:44-nf] did each one of you look to see whether they would speak With tongues, and, when he saw that they did not speak with tongues, was any of you so wrong-minded as to say, These have not received the Holy Ghost; for, had they received, they would speak with tongues as was the case in those times? If then the witness of the presence of the Holy Ghost be not now given through these miracles, by what is it given, by what does one get to know that he has received the Holy Ghost? Let him question his own heal?. If he love his brother the Spirit of God dwelleth in him. Let him see, let him prove himself before the eyes of God, let him see whether there he in him the love of peace and unity, the love of the Church that is spread over the whole earth. Let him not rest only in his loving the brother whom he has before his eyes, for we have many brethren whom we do not see, and in the unity of the Spirit we are joined to them. What marvel that they are not with us? We are in one body, we have one Head, in heaven. Brethren, our two eyes do not see each other; as one may say, they do not know each other. But in the charity of the bodily frame do they not know each other? For, to shew you that in the charity which knits them together they do know each other; when both eyes are open, the right may not rest on some object, on which the left shall not rest likewise. Direct the glance of the right eye without the other, if thou canst. Together they meet in one object, together they are directed tone object: their aim is one, their places diverse. If then all who with thee love God have one aim with thee, heed not that in the body thou are separated in place; the eyesight of the heart ye have alike fixed on the light of truth. Then if thou wouldest know that thou hast received the Spirit, question thine heart: lest haply thou have the sacrament, and have not the virtue of the sacrament. Question thine heart. If love of thy brethren be there, set thy mind at rest.

Whence their preconceived idea inclines them to disbelieve. For the advent of the Saviour did not make people foolish, and hard of heart, and unbelieving, but made them understanding, amenable to persuasion, and believing. But those that would not believe, by separating themselves from the voluntary adherence of those who obeyed, were proved to be without understanding, unbelievers and fools. \"But to them who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God, and the wisdom of God.\" Should we not understand (as is better) the words rendered, \"Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? \"negatively: \"God hath not made foolish the wisdom of the world? \"-so that the cause of their hardness of heart may not appear to have proceeded from God, \"making foolish the wisdom of the world.\" For on all accounts, being wise, they incur greater blame in not believing the proclamation. For the preference and choice of truth is voluntary. But that declaration, \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,\" declares Him to have sent forth light, by bringing forth in opposition the despised and contemned barbarian philosophy; as the lamp, when shone upon by the sun, is said to be extinguished, on account of its not then exerting the same power. All having been therefore called, those who are willing to obey have been named[fn-51-P5196_1565507:203-nf] \"called.\" For there is no unrighteousness with God. Those of either race who have believed, are \"a peculiar people.\"[fn-51-P5197_1565664:204-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles you will find this, word for word, \"Those then who received his word were baptized; \"[fn-51-P5198_1565802:205-nf] but those who would not obey kept themselves aloof. To these prophecy says, \"If ye be willing and hear me, ye shall eat the good things of the land; \"[fn-51-P5199_1565973:206-nf] proving that choice or refusal depends on ourselves. The apostle designates the doctrine which is according to the Lord, \"the wisdom of God,\" in order to show that the true philosophy has been communicated by the Son. Further, he, who has a show of wisdom, has certain exhortations enjoined on him by the apostle: \"That ye put on the new man, which after God is renewed in righteousness and true holiness. Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man truth. Neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole, steal no more; but rather let him labour, working that which is good\" (and to work is to labour in seeking the truth; for it is accompanied with rational well-doing), \"that ye may have to give to him that has need,\"[fn-52-P5200_1566721:207-nf] both of worldly wealth and of divine wisdom. For he wishes both that the word be taught, and that the money be put into the bank, accurately tested, to accumulate interest. Whence he adds, \"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,\"-that is \"corrupt communication\" which proceeds out of conceit,-\"but that which is good for the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.\" And the word of the good God must needs be good.

First then in order to our receiving eternal life which shall be given at the last, there comes to us a gift from God's goodness from the beginning of our faith, to wit, the remission of sins. For while they remain, there remains in some sort enmity against God, and alienation from Him, which comes from what is evil in us; since Scripture does not speak falsely, which says, \"Your sins separate between you and God.\"[fn-39-P3945_1705645:59-nf] He does not then bestow on us His good things, except He take away our evil things. And the former increase in proportion as the latter are diminished; nor will the one be perfected, till the other be brought to an end. But now that the Lord Jesus forgives sins by the Holy Ghost, just as by the Holy Ghost He casts out devils, may be understood by this, that after His Resurrection from the dead, when He had said to His disciples, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost,\" He immediately subjoined, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-39-P3946_1706270:60-nf] For that regeneration also, in which there is a remission of all past sins, is wrought by the Holy Ghost, as the Lord saith, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-39-P3947_1706509:61-nf] But it is one thing to be born of the Spirit, another to be nourished by the Spirit; just as it is one thing to be born of the flesh, which happens when the mother is delivered of her child; another to be nourished by the flesh, which happens when she gives suck to her infant, who turns himself that he may drink with pleasure thither whence he was born, to have life; that he may receive the support of life from thence, whence he received the beginning of his birth. We must believe then that the first blessing of God's goodness in the Holy Ghost is the remission of sins. Whence the preaching of John the Baptist, who was sent as the forerunner of the Lord, also begins with it. For thus it is written, \"In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3948_1707369:62-nf] Hence too the beginning of our Lord's preaching, as we read, \"From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3949_1707549:63-nf] Now John, amongst the other things which he spake tothose who came to be baptized by him, said, \"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\"[fn-39-P3950_1707856:64-nf] The Lord also said, \"John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence,\"[fn-39-P3951_1707996:65-nf] even at Pentecost. Now as to John's expression, \"with fire,\" though tribulation also might be understood, which believers were to suffer for the name of Christ; yet may we reasonably think that the same Holy Spirit is signified also under the name of \"fire.\"[fn-39-P3952_1708271:66-nf] Wherefore when He came it is said, \"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.\"[fn-39-P3953_1708468:67-nf] Hence also the Lord Himself said, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-39-P3954_1708558:68-nf] Hence also the Apostle saith, \"Fervent in the spirit;\"[fn-39-P3955_1708632:69-nf] for from Him comes the fervour of love. \"For it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\"[fn-39-P3956_1708772:70-nf] And the contrary to this fervour is what the Lord said, \"The love of many shall wax cold.\"[fn-39-P3957_1708879:71-nf] Now perfect love is the perfect gift of the Holy Spirit. But the first \"gift\" is that which is concerned with the remission of sins; by which blessing \"we are delivered from the power of darkness;\"[fn-39-P3958_1709098:72-nf] and the prince of this world,[fn-39-P3959_1709145:73-nf] who worketh in the children of disobedience\"[fn-39-P3960_1709209:74-nf] by no other power than the fellowship and the bond of sin, is \"cast out\" by our faith.

For though the Son bearing flesh, was there conversing with men on earth, He was not the less on that account in the Bosom of the Father also as the Only-Be-gotten Word, when that Voice came out of the cloud; nor could it be either wisely and through the Spirit[fn-40-P4001_1724567:107-nf] believed, that God the Father separated the operation of these audible and passing words from the co-operation of His Wisdom and His Spirit. In the same way when we say most rightly, that not the Father, nor the Holy Spirit, but the Son walked upon the sea, who only had that flesh and those feet which rested on the waves;[fn-40-P4002_1724913:108-nf] yet who would deny that the Father and the Holy Spirit co-operated in the work of so great a miracle? For so again we say most truly that the Son only took this our flesh, not the Father, nor the Holy Spirit, and yet he hath no true wisdom who denies that the Father, or the Holy Spirit co-operated in the work of His Incarnation which belongeth only to the Son. So also we say that neither the Father, nor the Son, but the Holy Spirit only appeared both in the \"form of a dove,\"[fn-40-P4003_1725416:109-nf] and in \"tongues as it were of fire;\"[fn-40-P4004_1725475:110-nf] and gave to those to whom He came the power to tell in many and various tongues \"the wonderful works of God;\" and yet from this miracle which regards the Holy Spirit only, we cannot separate the co-operation of the Father and the Only-Begotten Word. So also the Whole Trinity work the works of each several Person in the Trinity, the Two co-operating in the work of the Other, through a perfect harmony of operation in the Three, and not through any deficiency of the power to work effectually in One. And since this is so, hence it is that the Lord Jesus cast out devils in the Holy Spirit. Not that He was not able to accomplish this alone, or that He assumed that aid as being insufficient for this work; but it was meet that the spirit who is divided against himself should be driven out by that Spirit, which the Father and the Son who are not divided in themselves have in common.","title":"Sermon XXI.

And since this is so, remission of sins, seeing it is not given but by the Holy Spirit, can only be given in that Church which hath the Holy Spirit. For this is the effect of the remission of sins, that the prince of sin, the spirit who is divided against himself, should no more reign in us, and that being delivered from the power of the unclean spirit, we should thenceforward be made the temple of the Holy Spirit, and receive Him, by whom we are cleansed through receiving pardon, to dwell in us, to work, increase, and perfect righteousness. For at His first coming, when they who had received Him spake with the tongues of all nations, and the Apostle Peter addressed those who were present in amazement, they were pricked in heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles, \"Men and brethren, what shall we do?\" show us. \"And Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-40-P4031_1735425:131-nf] In the Church truly in which was the Holy Ghost, were both brought to pass, that is, both the remission of sins, and the receiving of this gift.

For they never can be pronounced together, whereas they can never exist, except together. But as I have already said, and not once only, the remission of sins, whereby the kingdom of the spirit which is divided against himself is overthrown and driven out, and the fellowship of the unity of the Church of God, out of which this remission of sins is not, are regarded as the peculiar work of the Holy Spirit, with the cooperation doubtless of the Father and the Son, because the Holy Spirit is Himself in some sort the fellowship of the Father and the Son. For the Father is not possessed[fn-40-P4034_1736913:134-nf] as Father by the Son and the Holy Spirit in common; because He is not the Father of Both.

And since we seem to have divided all spiritual baptism in a threefold manner, let us come also to the proof of the statement proposed, that we may not appear to have done this of our own judgment, and with rashness. For John says of our Lord in his epistle, teaching us: \"This is He who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood: and it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. For three bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three are one; \"[fn-107-P10783_3421951:48-nf] -that we may gather from these words both that water is wont to confer the Spirit, and that men's own blood is wont to confer the Spirit, and that the Spirit Himself also is wont to confer the Spirit. For since water is poured forth even as blood, the Spirit also was poured out by the Lord upon all who believed. Assuredly both in water, and none the less in their own blood, and then especially in the Holy Spirit, men may be baptized. For Peter says: \"But this is that which was spoken by the prophet; It shall come to pass in the last days, saith the Lord, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh: and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy, and their young men shall see visions, and their old men shall dream dreams: and upon my servants, and upon my handmaidens, will I pour out of my Spirit; \"[fn-107-P10784_3422779:49-nf] -which Spirit we discover to have been communicated in the Old Testament, not indeed everywhere nor at large, but with other gifts; or, moreover, to have sprung of His own will into certain men, or to have invested them, or to have been upon them, even as we observe that it was said by the Lord to Moses, about the seventy elders, \"And I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them.\"[fn-107-P10785_3423212:50-nf] For which reason also, according to His promise, God put upon them from another of the Spirit which had been upon Moses, and they prophesied in the camp. And Moses, as a spiritual man, rejoiced that this had so happened, although he was unwillingly persuaded by Jesus the son of Nave to oppose this thing, and was not thereby induced. Further, also in the book of Judges, and in the books of Kings too, we observe that upon several, there either was the Spirit of the Lord, or that He came unto them, as upon Gothoniel, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, Saul, David, and many others. Which comes to this result, that the Lord has taught us most plainly by them the liberty and power of the Holy Spirit, approaching of His own will, saying, \"The Spirit breathes where He will; and thou hearest His voice, and knowest not whence He cometh or whither He goeth.\"[fn-107-P10786_3424081:51-nf] So that the same Spirit is, moreover, sometimes found to be upon those who are unworthy of Him; not certainly in vain or without reason, but for the sake of some needful operation; as He was upon Saul, upon whom came the Spirit of God, and he prophesied. However, in later days, after the Spirit of the Lord departed from him, and after a malign spirit from the Lord vexed him, because then he had come, after the messengers whom he had previously sent before with care, with intent to kill David; and they therefore fell into the chorus of the prophets, and they prophesied, so that they neither were able nor willing to do what they had been bidden. And we believe that the Spirit which was upon them all effected this with an admirable wisdom, by the will of God. Which Spirit also filled John the Baptist even from his mother's womb; and it fell upon those who were with Cornelius the centurion before they were baptized with water. Thus, cleaving to the baptism of men, the Holy Spirit either goes before or follows it; or failing the baptism of water, it falls upon those who believe. We are counselled that either we ought duly to maintain the integrity of baptism, or if by chance baptism is given by any one in the name of Jesus Christ, we ought to supplement it, guarding the most holy invocation of the name of Jesus Christ, as we have most abundantly set forth; guarding, moreover, the custom and authority which so much claim our veneration for so long a time and for such great men.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"209","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"72.

This then I consider the sense of this passage, and that, a very ecclesiastical sense[fn-55-P5589_2216936:248-nf] . However, there is another way in which one might remark upon it, giving the same sense in a parallel way; viz. that, though it does not speak of the exaltation of the Word Himself, so far as He is Word[fn-55-P5590_2217207:249-nf] (for He is, as was just now said, most high and like His Father), yet by reason of His becoming man it indicates His resurrection from the dead. For after saying, `He hath humbled Himself even unto death,' He immediately added, `Wherefore He hath highly exalted Him;' wishing to shew, that, although as man He is said to have died, yet, as being Life, He was exalted on the resurrection; for `He who descended, is the same also who rose again[fn-55-P5591_2217671:250-nf] .' He descended in body, and He rose again because He was God Himself in the body. And this again is the reason why according to this meaning he brought in the conjunction `Wherefore;' not as a reward of virtue nor of advancement, but to signify the cause why the resurrection took place; and why, while all other men from Adam down to this time have died and remained dead, He only rose in integrity from the dead. The cause is this, which He Himself has already taught us, that, being God, He has become man. For all other men, being merely born of Adam, died, and death reigned over them; but He, the Second Man, is from heaven, for `the Word was made flesh[fn-55-P5592_2218376:251-nf] ,' and this Man is said to be from heaven and heavenly[fn-55-P5593_2218450:252-nf] , because the Word descended from heaven; wherefore He was not held under death. For though He humbled Himself, yielding His own Body to come unto death, in that it was capable of death[fn-55-P5594_2218659:253-nf] , yet He was highly exalted from earth, because He was God's Son in a body. Accordingly what is here said, `Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him,' answers to Peter's words in the Acts, `Whom God raised up, having loosed the bonds of death, because it was not possible that He should be holden of it[fn-55-P5595_2220186:254-nf] .' For as Paul has written, `Since being in form of God He became man, and humbled Himself unto death, therefore God also hath highly exalted Him,' so also Peter says, `Since, being God, He became man, and signs and wonders proved Him to beholders to be God, therefore it was not possible that He should be holden of death.' To alan it was not possible to succeed in this; for death belongs to man; wherefore, the Word, being God, became flesh, that, being put to death in the flesh, He might quicken all men by His own power.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"102","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"53.

But although they might have learned from what is said above, had they not utterly lost their power of apprehension, that the Son is not from nothing nor in the number of things originate at all, the Truth witnessing[fn-58-P5805_2312194:4-nf] it (for, being God, He cannot be a work, and it is impious to call Him a creature, and it is of creatures and works that we say, `out of nothing,' and `it was not before its generation'), yet since, as if dreading to desert their own fiction, they are accustomed to allege the aforesaid passages of divine Scripture, which have a good meaning, but are by them practised on, let us proceed afresh to take up the question of the sense of these, to remind the faithful, and to shew from each of these passages that they have no knowledge at all of Christianity. Were it otherwise, they would not have shut themselves up in the unbelief[fn-58-P5806_2312853:5-nf] of the present Jews[fn-58-P5807_2312893:6-nf] , but would have inquired and learned[fn-58-P5808_2313227:7-nf] that, whereas `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,' in consequence, it was when at the good pleasure of the Father the Word became man, that it was said of Him, as by John, `The Word became flesh[fn-58-P5809_2313562:8-nf] ;' so by Peter, `He hath made Him Lord and Christ[fn-58-P5810_2313627:9-nf] ';-as by means of Solomon in the Person of the Lord Himself, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways for His works[fn-58-P5811_2313764:10-nf] ;' so by Paul, `Become so much better than the Angels[fn-58-P5812_2313839:11-nf] ;' and again, `He emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant[fn-58-P5813_2313930:12-nf] ;' and again, `Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Jesus, who was faithful to Him that made Him[fn-58-P5814_2314125:13-nf] .' For all these texts have the same force and meaning, a religious one, declarative of the divinity of the Word, even those of them which speak humanly concerning Him, as having become the Son of man. But, though this distinction is sufficient for their refutation, still, since from a misconception of the Apostle's words (to mention them first), they consider the Word of God to be one of the works, because of its being written, `Who was faithful to Him that made Him,' I have thought it needful to silence this further argument of theirs, taking in hand[fn-58-P5815_2314728:14-nf] , as before, their statement.

But here they must have the same answer as before, and first be told that the Word is a Son, as has been said above[fn-58-P5880_2347921:64-nf] , and not a work, and that such terms are not to be understood of His Godhead, but the reason and manner of them investigated. To persons who so inquire, the human Economy will plainly present itself, which He undertook for our sake. For Peter, after saying, `He hath made Lord and Christ,' straightway added, `this Jesus whom ye crucified;' which makes it plain to any one, even, if so be, to them, provided they attend to the context, that not the Essence of the Word, but He according to His manhood is said to have been made. For what was crucified but the body? and how could be signified what was bodily in the Word, except by saying `He made?' Especially has that phrase, `He made,' a meaning consistent with orthodoxy; in that he has not said, as I observed before, `He made Him Word,' but `He made Him Lord,' nor that in general terms[fn-58-P5881_2348783:65-nf] , but `towards' us, and `in the midst of' us, as much as to say, `He manifested Him.' And this Peter himself, when he began this primary teaching, carefully[fn-58-P5882_2348952:66-nf] expressed, when he said to them, `Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man manifested of God towards you by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by Him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves know[fn-58-P5883_2349252:67-nf] .' Consequently the term which he uses in the end, `made', this He has explained in the beginning by `manifested,' for by the signs and wonders which the Lord did, He was manifested to be not merely man, but God in a body and Lord also, the Christ. Such also is the passage in the Gospel according to John, `Therefore the more did the Jews persecute Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but said also that God was His own Father, making Himself equal with God[fn-58-P5884_2349738:68-nf] .' For the Lord did not then fashion Himself to be God, nor indeed is a made God conceivable, but He manifested it by the works, saying, `Though ye believe not Me, believe My works, that ye may know that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me[fn-58-P5885_2350012:69-nf] .' Thus then the Father has `made' Him Lord and King in the midst of us, and towards us who were once disobedient; and it is plain that He who is now displayed as Lord and King, does not then begin to be King and Lord, but begins to shew His Lordship, and to extend it even over the disobedient.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_170_polycrates_bishop_of_ephesus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Our author belonged to a family in which he was the eighth Christian bishop; and he presided over the church of Ephesus, in which the traditions of St. John were yet fresh in men's minds at the date of his birth.

We are therefore to understand that he who loves has already the Holy Spirit, and by what he has becomes worthy of a fuller possession, that by having the more he may love the more. Already, therefore, had the disciples that Holy Spirit whom the Lord promised, for without Him they could not call Him Lord; but they had Him not as yet in the way promised by the Lord. Accordingly they both had, and had Him not, inasmuch as they had Him not as yet to the same extent as He was afterwards to be possessed. They had Him, therefore, in a more limited sense: He was yet to be given them in an ampler measure. They had Him in a hidden way, they were yet to receive Him in a way that was manifest; for this present possession had also a bearing on that fuller gift of the Holy Spirit, that they might come to a conscious knowledge of what they had. It is in speaking of this gift that the apostle says: \"Now we have received, not the spirit of this world, but the spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-27-P2756_1608492:6-nf] For that same manifest bestowal of the Holy Spirit the Lord made, not once, but on two separate occasions. For close on the back of His resurrection from the dead He breathed on them and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-27-P2757_1608733:7-nf] And because He then gave [the Spirit], did He on that account fail in afterwards sending Him according to His promise?

Accordingly, the promise is no vain one, either to him who has not [the Holy Spirit], or to him who has. For it is made to him who has not, in order that he may have; and to him who has, that he may have moreabundantly. For were it not that He was possessed by some in smaller measure than byothers, St. Elisha would not have said to St. Elijah, \"Let the spirit that is in thee be in a twofold measure in me.[fn-27-P2759_1610162:9-nf] ","title":"Tractate LXXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"ANF-06","text":"36.

And so it is that your king, Antichrist, has despatched you in a similar character, and as it were destined to death, to us who are a people placed under the administration of the good and holy King. And this I do not say inconsiderately or without due inquiry; but from the fact that I see you perform no miracle, I hold myself entitled to entertain such sentiments concerning you.

Not thus is it with the Holy Spirit: God forbid; but He divides to all, and knows all kinds of tongues, and has understanding of all things, and is made all things to all men, so that the very thoughts of the heart cannot escape His cognizance.

But let us not be supposed to have so spoken as if on such grounds we might possibly arrive at an equality with Christ the Lord, if for His sake we have undergone witness-bearing even unto blood. He had power to lay down His life, and to take it again;[fn-29-P2944_1682230:4-nf] but we have no power to live as long as we wish; and die we must, however unwilling: He, by dying, straightway slew death in Himself; we, by His death, are delivered from death: His flesh saw no corruption;[fn-29-P2945_1682453:5-nf] ours, after corruption, shall in the end of the world be clothed by Him with incorruption: He had no need of us, in order to work out our salvation; we, without Him, can do nothing: He gave Himself as the vine, to us the branches; we, apart from Him, can have no life. Lastly, although brethren die for brethren, yet no martyr's blood is ever shed for the remission of the sins of brethren, as was the case in what He did for us; and in this respect He bestowed not on us aught for imitation, but something for congratulation. In as far, then, as the martyrs have shed their blood for the brethren, so far have they exhibited such tokens of love as they themselves perceived at the table of the Lord.

And well it is that he is admonished in that passage of the Proverbs, which immediately goes on to say, \"But if thy greed is too great, be not desirous of his dainties; for it is better that thou take nothing thereof, than that thou shouldst take more than is befitting.

And so it is said,\" For such have a deceiving life.\" There is only One who could at once have human flesh and be free from sin. Appropriately are we commanded that which follows; and such a word and proverb is well adapted to human weakness, when it is said, \"Lay not thyself out, seeing thou art poor, against him that is rich.\" For the rich man is Christ, who was never obnoxious to punishment either through hereditary or personal debt and is righteous Himself, and justifies others. Lay not thyself out against Him, thou who art so poor, that thou art manifestly to the eyes of all the daily beggar that thou art in thy prayer for the remission of sins. \"But keep thyself,\" he says, \"from thine own counsel\" [\"cease from thine own wisdom\"-E.

For He, indeed, inasmuch as He is not only man but also God, can never be chargeable with evil. \"For if thou turn thine eye upon Him, He will nowhere be visible.\" \"Thine eye,\" that is, the human eye, wherewith thou distinguishest that which is human; \"if thou turn it upon Him, He will nowhere be visible,\" because He cannot be seen with such organs of sight as are thine. \"For He will provide Himself wings like an eagle's, and will depart to the house of His overseer,\"[fn-29-P2947_1685753:7-nf] from which, at all events, He came to us, and found us not such as He Himself was who came.
