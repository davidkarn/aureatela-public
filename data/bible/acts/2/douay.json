{"verses":["And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were\nall together in one place:","And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind\ncoming:  and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.","And there appeared to them parted tongues, as it were of fire:  and\nit sat upon every one of them.","And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost:  and they began to\nspeak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to\nspeak.","Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of\nevery nation under heaven.","And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and\nwere confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his\nown tongue.","And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying:  Behold, are not\nall these that speak Galilean?","And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were\nborn?","Parthians and Medes and Elamites and inhabitants of Mesopotamia,\nJudea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,","Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene,\nand strangers of Rome,","Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Arabians:  we have heard\nthem speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.","And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to\nanother:  What meaneth this?","But others mocking, said:  These men are full of new wine.","But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and\nspoke to them:  Ye men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be\nthis known to you and with your ears receive my words.","For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the\nthird hour of the day:","But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:","And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith the Lord), I\nwill pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh:  and your sons and your\ndaughters shall prophesy:  and your young men shall see visions, and\nyour old men shall dream dreams.","And upon my servants indeed and upon my handmaids will I pour out\nin those days of my spirit:  and they shall prophesy.","And I will shew wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the\nearth beneath:  blood and fire, and vapour of smoke.","The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood,\nbefore the great and manifest day of the Lord to come.","And it shalt come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the\nname of the Lord shall be saved.","Ye men of Israel, hear these words:  Jesus of Nazareth, a man\napproved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God\ndid by him, in the midst of you, as you also know:","This same being delivered up, by the determinate counsel and\nforeknowledge of God, you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and\nslain.","Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of hell, as it\nwas impossible that he should be holden by it.","For David saith concerning him:  I foresaw the Lord before my\nface:  because he is at my right hand, that I may not be moved.","For this my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced:\nmoreover my flesh also shall rest in hope.","Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell:  nor suffer thy Holy\nOne to see corruption.","Thou hast made known to me the ways of life:  thou shalt make me\nfull of joy with thy countenance.","Ye men, brethren, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch\nDavid:  that he died and was buried; and his sepulchre is with us to\nthis present say.","Whereas therefore he was a prophet and knew that God hath sworn\nto him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon\nhis throne.","Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ.  For\nneither was he left in hell:  neither did his flesh see corruption.","This Jesus hath God raised again, whereof all we are witnesses.","Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God and having\nreceived of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured\nforth this which you see and hear.","For David ascended not into heaven; but he himself said:  The Lord\nsaid to my Lord:  Sit thou on my right hand,","Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.","Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly that\nGod hath made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus, whom you have\ncrucified.","Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in\ntheir heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles:  What\nshall we do, men and brethren?","But Peter said to them:  Do penance:  and be baptized every one of\nyou in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins.

And the Lord\nincreased daily together such as should be saved."]}
