Behold, he says, one like the Son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He did not say, like the Son of God, but the Son of man, that he might show that He had[fn-12-P1291_558265:118-nf] to be clothed with flesh on the earth, that having assumed the form of a man and the condition of mortality, He might teach men righteousness; and when, having completed the commands of God, He had revealed the truth to the nations, He might also suffer death, that He might overcome and lay open[fn-12-P1292_558697:119-nf] the other world also, and thus at length rising again, He might proceed to His Father borne aloft on a cloud.[fn-12-P1293_558834:120-nf] For the prophet said in addition: And came even to the Ancient of days, and was presented to Him. He called the Most High God the Ancient of days, whose age and origin cannot be comprehended; for He alone was from generations, and He will be always to generations.[fn-12-P1294_559160:121-nf] But that Christ, after His passion and resurrection, was about to ascend to God the Father, David bore witness in these words in the cixth Psalm:[fn-12-P1295_559324:122-nf] \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\" Whom could this prophet, being himself a king, call his Lord, who sat at the right hand of God, but Christ the Son of God, who is King of kings and Lord of lords? And this is more plainly shown by Isaiah,[fn-12-P1296_559646:123-nf] when he says: \"Thus saith the Lord God to my Lord Christ, whose right hand I have holden; I will subdue nations before Him, and will break the strength of kings. I will open before Him gates, and the cities shall not be closed. I will go before Thee, and will make the mountains level; and I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and shatter the bars of iron; and I will give Thee the hidden and invisible treasures, that Thou mayest know that I am the Lord God, which call Thee by Thy name, the God of Israel.\" Lastly, on account of the goodness and faithfulness which He displayed towards God on earth, there was given to Him a kingdom, and glory, and dominion; and all people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him; and His dominion is everlasting, and that which shall never pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed. And this is understood in two ways: that even now He has an everlasting dominion, when all nations and all languages adore His name, confess His majesty, follow His teaching, and imitate His goodness: He has power and glory, in that all tribes of the earth obey His precepts. And also, when He shall come again with majesty and glory to judge every soul, and to restore the righteous to life, then He shall truly have the government of the whole earth: then, every evil having been removed from the affairs of men, a golden age (as the poets call it), that is, a time of righteousness and peace, will arise. But we will speak of these things more fully in the last book, when we shall speak of His second advent; now let us treat of His first advent, as we began.","title":"Book IV.

Genesis, we shall be told, needs no explanation; its topics are too simple-the birth of the world, the origin of the human race,[fn-20-P2064_512271:1446-nf] the division of the earth,[fn-20-P2065_512316:1447-nf] the confusion of tongues,[fn-20-P2066_512357:1448-nf] and the descent of the Hebrews into Egypt![fn-20-P2067_512416:1449-nf] Exodus, no doubt, is equally plain, containing as it does merely an account of the ten plagues,[fn-20-P2068_512530:1450-nf] the decalogue,[fn-20-P2069_512567:1451-nf] and sundry mysterious and divine precepts! The meaning of Leviticus is of course self-evident, although every sacrifice that it describes, nay more every word that it contains, the description of Aaron's vestments,[fn-20-P2070_512798:1452-nf] and all the regulations connected with the Levites are symbols of things heavenly! The book of Numbers too-are not its very figures,[fn-20-P2071_512949:1453-nf] and Balaam's prophecy,[fn-20-P2072_512990:1454-nf] and the forty-two camping places in the wilderness[fn-20-P2073_513068:1455-nf] so many mysteries? Deuteronomy also, that is the second law or the foreshadowing of the law of the gospel,-does it not, while exhibiting things known before, put old truths in a new light? So far the `five words' of the Pentateuch, with which the apostle boasts his wish to speak in the Church.[fn-20-P2074_513403:1456-nf] Then, as for Job,[fn-20-P2075_513446:1457-nf] that pattern of patience, what mysteries are there not contained in his discourses? Commencing in prose the book soon glides into verse and at the end once more reverts to prose. By the way in which it lays down propositions, assumes postulates, adduces proofs, and draws inferences, it illustrates all the laws of logic. Single words occurring in the book are full of meaning. To say nothing of other topics, it prophesies the resurrection of men's bodies at once with more clearness and with more caution than any one has yet shewn. \"I know,\" Job says, \"that my redeemer liveth, and that at the last day I shall rise again from the earth; and I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. This my hope is stored up in my own bosom.\"[fn-20-P2076_514427:1458-nf] I will pass on to Jesus the son of Nave[fn-20-P2077_514498:1459-nf] -a type of the Lord in name as well as in deed-who crossed over Jordan, subdued hostile kingdoms, divided the land among the conquering people and who, in every city, village, mountain, river, hill-torrent, and boundary which he dealt with, marked out the spiritual realms of the heavenly Jerusalem, that is, of the church.[fn-20-P2078_514923:1460-nf] In the book of Judges every one of the popular leaders is a type. Ruth the Moabitess fulfils the prophecy of Isaiah:-\"Send thou a lamb, O Lord, as ruler of the land from the rock of the wilderness to the mount of the daughter of Zion.\"[fn-20-P2079_515181:1461-nf] Under the figures of Eli's death and the slaying of Saul Samuel shews the abolition of the old law. Again in Zadok and in David he bears witness to the mysteries of the new priesthood and of the new royalty. The third and fourth books of Kings called in Hebrew Malachim give the history of the kingdom of Judah from Solomon to Jeconiah,[fn-20-P2080_515583:1462-nf] and of that of Israel from Jeroboam the son of Nebat to Hoshea who was carried away into Assyria. If you merely regard the narrative, the words are simple enough, but if you look beneath the surface at the hidden meaning of it, you find a description of the small numbers of the church and of the wars which the heretics wage against it. The twelve prophets whose writings are compressed within the narrow limits of a single volume,[fn-20-P2081_516060:1463-nf] have typical meanings far different from their literal ones. Hosea speaks many times of Ephraim, of Samaria, of Joseph, of Jezreel, of a wife of whoredoms and of children of whoredoms,[fn-20-P2082_516313:1464-nf] of an adulteress shut up within the chamber of her husband, sitting for a long time in widowhood and in the garb of mourning, awaiting the time when her husband will return to her.[fn-20-P2083_516514:1465-nf] Joel the son of Pethuel describes the land of the twelve tribes as spoiled and devastated by the palmerworm the canker-worm, the locust, and the blight,[fn-20-P2084_516695:1466-nf] and predicts that after the overthrow of the former people the Holy Spirit shall be poured out upon God's servants and handmaids;[fn-20-P2085_516845:1467-nf] the same spirit, that is, which was to be poured out in the upper chamber at Zion upon the one hundred and twenty believers.[fn-20-P2086_516992:1468-nf] These believers rising by gradual and regular gradations from one to fifteen form the steps to which there is a mystical allusion in the \"psalms of degrees.\"[fn-20-P2087_517183:1469-nf] Amos, although he is only \"an herdman\" from the country, \"a gatherer of sycomore fruit,\"[fn-20-P2088_517386:1470-nf] cannot be explained in a few words. For who can adequately speak of the three transgressions and the four of Damascus, of Gaza, of Tyre, of Idumaea, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, and in the seventh and eighth place of Judah and of Israel? He speaks to the fat kine that are in the mountain of Samaria,[fn-20-P2089_517716:1471-nf] and bears witness that the great house and the little house shall fall.[fn-20-P2090_517809:1472-nf] He sees now the maker of the grasshopper,[fn-20-P2091_517873:1473-nf] now the Lord, standing upon a wall[fn-20-P2092_517930:1474-nf] daubed[fn-20-P2093_517959:1475-nf] or made of adamant,[fn-20-P2094_518004:1476-nf] now a basket of apples[fn-20-P2095_518048:1477-nf] that brings doom to the transgressors, and now a famine upon the earth \"not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\"[fn-20-P2096_518229:1478-nf] Obadiah, whose name means the servant of God, thunders against Edom red with blood and against the creature born of earth.[fn-20-P2097_518376:1479-nf] He smites him with the spear of the spirit because of his continual rivalry with his brother Jacob. Jonah, fairest of doves, whose shipwreck shews in a figure the passion of the Lord, recalls the world to penitence, and while he preaches to Nineveh, announces salvation to all the heathen. Micah the Morasthite a joint heir with Christ[fn-20-P2098_518792:1480-nf] announces the spoiling of the daughter of the robber and lays siege against her, because she has smitten the jawbone of the judge of Israel.[fn-20-P2099_519018:1481-nf] Nahum, the consoler of the world, rebukes \"the bloody city\"[fn-21-P2100_519104:1482-nf] and when it is overthrown cries: -\"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.\"[fn-21-P2101_519247:1483-nf] Habakkuk, like a strong and unyielding wrestler,[fn-21-P2102_519318:1484-nf] stands upon his watch and sets his foot upon the tower[fn-21-P2103_519419:1485-nf] that he may contemplate Christ upon the cross and say \"His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.\"[fn-21-P2104_519677:1486-nf] Zephaniah, that is the bodyguard and knower of the secrets of the Lord,[fn-21-P2105_519784:1487-nf] hears \"a cry from the fishgate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.\"[fn-21-P2106_519938:1488-nf] He proclaims \"howling to the inhabitants of the mortar;[fn-21-P2107_520016:1489-nf] for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.\"[fn-21-P2108_520161:1490-nf] Haggai, that is he who is glad or joyful, who has sown in tears to reap in joy,[fn-21-P2109_520267:1491-nf] is occupied with the rebuilding of the temple. He represents the Lord(the Father, that is) as saying \"Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations and he who is desired[fn-21-P2110_520552:1492-nf] of all nations shall come'[fn-21-P2111_520616:1493-nf] Zechariah, he that is mindful of his Lord,[fn-21-P2112_520692:1494-nf] gives us many prophecies. He sees Jesus,[fn-21-P2113_520776:1495-nf] \"clothed with filthy garments,\"[fn-21-P2114_520847:1496-nf] a stone with seven eyes,[fn-21-P2115_520895:1497-nf] a candle-stick all of gold with lamps as many as the eyes, and two olivetrees on the right side of the bowl[fn-21-P2116_521026:1498-nf] and on the left. After he has described the horses, red, black, white, and grisled,[fn-21-P2117_521145:1499-nf] and the cutting off of the chariot from Ephraim and of the horse from Jerusalem[fn-21-P2118_521249:1500-nf] he goes on to prophesy and predict a king who shall be a poor man and who shall sit \"upon a colt the foal of an ass.\"[fn-21-P2119_521390:1501-nf] Malachi, the last of all the prophets, speaks openly of the rejection of Israel and the calling of the nations. \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles: and in every place incense[fn-21-P2120_521758:1502-nf] is offered unto my name, and a pure offering.\"[fn-21-P2121_521844:1503-nf] As for Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, who can fully understand or adequately explain them? The first of them seems to compose not a prophecy but a gospel. The second speaks of a rod of an almond tree[fn-21-P2122_522089:1504-nf] and of a seething pot with its face toward the north,[fn-21-P2123_522164:1505-nf] and of a leopard which has changed its spots.[fn-21-P2124_522231:1506-nf] He also goes four times through the alphabet in different metres.[fn-21-P2125_522321:1507-nf] The beginning and ending of Ezekiel, the third of the four, are involved in so great obscurity that like the commencement of Genesis they are not studied by the Hebrews until they are thirty years old.

Genesis, we shall be told, needs no explanation; its topics are too simple-the birth of the world, the origin of the human race,[fn-20-P2064_512271:1446-nf] the division of the earth,[fn-20-P2065_512316:1447-nf] the confusion of tongues,[fn-20-P2066_512357:1448-nf] and the descent of the Hebrews into Egypt![fn-20-P2067_512416:1449-nf] Exodus, no doubt, is equally plain, containing as it does merely an account of the ten plagues,[fn-20-P2068_512530:1450-nf] the decalogue,[fn-20-P2069_512567:1451-nf] and sundry mysterious and divine precepts! The meaning of Leviticus is of course self-evident, although every sacrifice that it describes, nay more every word that it contains, the description of Aaron's vestments,[fn-20-P2070_512798:1452-nf] and all the regulations connected with the Levites are symbols of things heavenly! The book of Numbers too-are not its very figures,[fn-20-P2071_512949:1453-nf] and Balaam's prophecy,[fn-20-P2072_512990:1454-nf] and the forty-two camping places in the wilderness[fn-20-P2073_513068:1455-nf] so many mysteries? Deuteronomy also, that is the second law or the foreshadowing of the law of the gospel,-does it not, while exhibiting things known before, put old truths in a new light? So far the `five words' of the Pentateuch, with which the apostle boasts his wish to speak in the Church.[fn-20-P2074_513403:1456-nf] Then, as for Job,[fn-20-P2075_513446:1457-nf] that pattern of patience, what mysteries are there not contained in his discourses? Commencing in prose the book soon glides into verse and at the end once more reverts to prose. By the way in which it lays down propositions, assumes postulates, adduces proofs, and draws inferences, it illustrates all the laws of logic. Single words occurring in the book are full of meaning. To say nothing of other topics, it prophesies the resurrection of men's bodies at once with more clearness and with more caution than any one has yet shewn. \"I know,\" Job says, \"that my redeemer liveth, and that at the last day I shall rise again from the earth; and I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. This my hope is stored up in my own bosom.\"[fn-20-P2076_514427:1458-nf] I will pass on to Jesus the son of Nave[fn-20-P2077_514498:1459-nf] -a type of the Lord in name as well as in deed-who crossed over Jordan, subdued hostile kingdoms, divided the land among the conquering people and who, in every city, village, mountain, river, hill-torrent, and boundary which he dealt with, marked out the spiritual realms of the heavenly Jerusalem, that is, of the church.[fn-20-P2078_514923:1460-nf] In the book of Judges every one of the popular leaders is a type. Ruth the Moabitess fulfils the prophecy of Isaiah:-\"Send thou a lamb, O Lord, as ruler of the land from the rock of the wilderness to the mount of the daughter of Zion.\"[fn-20-P2079_515181:1461-nf] Under the figures of Eli's death and the slaying of Saul Samuel shews the abolition of the old law. Again in Zadok and in David he bears witness to the mysteries of the new priesthood and of the new royalty. The third and fourth books of Kings called in Hebrew Malachim give the history of the kingdom of Judah from Solomon to Jeconiah,[fn-20-P2080_515583:1462-nf] and of that of Israel from Jeroboam the son of Nebat to Hoshea who was carried away into Assyria. If you merely regard the narrative, the words are simple enough, but if you look beneath the surface at the hidden meaning of it, you find a description of the small numbers of the church and of the wars which the heretics wage against it. The twelve prophets whose writings are compressed within the narrow limits of a single volume,[fn-20-P2081_516060:1463-nf] have typical meanings far different from their literal ones. Hosea speaks many times of Ephraim, of Samaria, of Joseph, of Jezreel, of a wife of whoredoms and of children of whoredoms,[fn-20-P2082_516313:1464-nf] of an adulteress shut up within the chamber of her husband, sitting for a long time in widowhood and in the garb of mourning, awaiting the time when her husband will return to her.[fn-20-P2083_516514:1465-nf] Joel the son of Pethuel describes the land of the twelve tribes as spoiled and devastated by the palmerworm the canker-worm, the locust, and the blight,[fn-20-P2084_516695:1466-nf] and predicts that after the overthrow of the former people the Holy Spirit shall be poured out upon God's servants and handmaids;[fn-20-P2085_516845:1467-nf] the same spirit, that is, which was to be poured out in the upper chamber at Zion upon the one hundred and twenty believers.[fn-20-P2086_516992:1468-nf] These believers rising by gradual and regular gradations from one to fifteen form the steps to which there is a mystical allusion in the \"psalms of degrees.\"[fn-20-P2087_517183:1469-nf] Amos, although he is only \"an herdman\" from the country, \"a gatherer of sycomore fruit,\"[fn-20-P2088_517386:1470-nf] cannot be explained in a few words. For who can adequately speak of the three transgressions and the four of Damascus, of Gaza, of Tyre, of Idumaea, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, and in the seventh and eighth place of Judah and of Israel? He speaks to the fat kine that are in the mountain of Samaria,[fn-20-P2089_517716:1471-nf] and bears witness that the great house and the little house shall fall.[fn-20-P2090_517809:1472-nf] He sees now the maker of the grasshopper,[fn-20-P2091_517873:1473-nf] now the Lord, standing upon a wall[fn-20-P2092_517930:1474-nf] daubed[fn-20-P2093_517959:1475-nf] or made of adamant,[fn-20-P2094_518004:1476-nf] now a basket of apples[fn-20-P2095_518048:1477-nf] that brings doom to the transgressors, and now a famine upon the earth \"not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\"[fn-20-P2096_518229:1478-nf] Obadiah, whose name means the servant of God, thunders against Edom red with blood and against the creature born of earth.[fn-20-P2097_518376:1479-nf] He smites him with the spear of the spirit because of his continual rivalry with his brother Jacob. Jonah, fairest of doves, whose shipwreck shews in a figure the passion of the Lord, recalls the world to penitence, and while he preaches to Nineveh, announces salvation to all the heathen. Micah the Morasthite a joint heir with Christ[fn-20-P2098_518792:1480-nf] announces the spoiling of the daughter of the robber and lays siege against her, because she has smitten the jawbone of the judge of Israel.[fn-20-P2099_519018:1481-nf] Nahum, the consoler of the world, rebukes \"the bloody city\"[fn-21-P2100_519104:1482-nf] and when it is overthrown cries: -\"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.\"[fn-21-P2101_519247:1483-nf] Habakkuk, like a strong and unyielding wrestler,[fn-21-P2102_519318:1484-nf] stands upon his watch and sets his foot upon the tower[fn-21-P2103_519419:1485-nf] that he may contemplate Christ upon the cross and say \"His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.\"[fn-21-P2104_519677:1486-nf] Zephaniah, that is the bodyguard and knower of the secrets of the Lord,[fn-21-P2105_519784:1487-nf] hears \"a cry from the fishgate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.\"[fn-21-P2106_519938:1488-nf] He proclaims \"howling to the inhabitants of the mortar;[fn-21-P2107_520016:1489-nf] for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.\"[fn-21-P2108_520161:1490-nf] Haggai, that is he who is glad or joyful, who has sown in tears to reap in joy,[fn-21-P2109_520267:1491-nf] is occupied with the rebuilding of the temple. He represents the Lord(the Father, that is) as saying \"Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations and he who is desired[fn-21-P2110_520552:1492-nf] of all nations shall come'[fn-21-P2111_520616:1493-nf] Zechariah, he that is mindful of his Lord,[fn-21-P2112_520692:1494-nf] gives us many prophecies. He sees Jesus,[fn-21-P2113_520776:1495-nf] \"clothed with filthy garments,\"[fn-21-P2114_520847:1496-nf] a stone with seven eyes,[fn-21-P2115_520895:1497-nf] a candle-stick all of gold with lamps as many as the eyes, and two olivetrees on the right side of the bowl[fn-21-P2116_521026:1498-nf] and on the left. After he has described the horses, red, black, white, and grisled,[fn-21-P2117_521145:1499-nf] and the cutting off of the chariot from Ephraim and of the horse from Jerusalem[fn-21-P2118_521249:1500-nf] he goes on to prophesy and predict a king who shall be a poor man and who shall sit \"upon a colt the foal of an ass.\"[fn-21-P2119_521390:1501-nf] Malachi, the last of all the prophets, speaks openly of the rejection of Israel and the calling of the nations. \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles: and in every place incense[fn-21-P2120_521758:1502-nf] is offered unto my name, and a pure offering.\"[fn-21-P2121_521844:1503-nf] As for Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, who can fully understand or adequately explain them? The first of them seems to compose not a prophecy but a gospel. The second speaks of a rod of an almond tree[fn-21-P2122_522089:1504-nf] and of a seething pot with its face toward the north,[fn-21-P2123_522164:1505-nf] and of a leopard which has changed its spots.[fn-21-P2124_522231:1506-nf] He also goes four times through the alphabet in different metres.[fn-21-P2125_522321:1507-nf] The beginning and ending of Ezekiel, the third of the four, are involved in so great obscurity that like the commencement of Genesis they are not studied by the Hebrews until they are thirty years old. Daniel, the fourth and last of the four prophets, having knowledge of the times and being interested in the whole world, in clear language proclaims the stone cut out of the mountain without hands that overthrows all kingdoms.[fn-21-P2126_522852:1508-nf] David, who is our Simonides, Pindar, and Alcaeus, our Horace, our Catullus, and our Serenus all in one, sings of Christ to his lyre; and on a psaltery with ten strings calls him from the lower world to rise again. Solomon, a lover of peace[fn-21-P2127_523114:1509-nf] and of the Lord, corrects morals, teaches nature, unites Christ and the church, and sings a sweet marriage song[fn-21-P2128_523258:1510-nf] to celebrate that holy bridal. Esther, a type of the church, frees her people from danger and, after having slain Haman whose name means iniquity, hands down to posterity a memorable day and a great feast.[fn-21-P2129_523492:1511-nf] The book of things omitted[fn-21-P2130_523569:1512-nf] or epitome of the old dispensation[fn-21-P2131_523683:1513-nf] is of such importance and value that without it any one who should claim to himself a knowledge of the scriptures would make himself a laughing stock in his own eyes.

Now when we have reason to be doubtful about a point, we need not doubt that we are right in doubting. There is no doubt but that we ought to doubt things that are doubtful. For instance, the Apostle has no doubt about doubting whether he was in the body or out of the body when he was carried up into the third heaven.[fn-55-P5501_1532243:3907-nf] Whether it was thus or thus, he says, I know not; God knows. Why may not I, then, so long as I have no light, doubt whether my soul comes to me by generation or unengendered? Why may I not be doubtful about this, so long as I do not doubt that in either case it is the work of God most high? Why may I not say; \"I know that my soul owes its existence to God and is altogether His handiwork; but whether it comes by generation, as the body does, or unengendered, as was Adam's soul, I know not; God knows.\" You wish me to assert positively one view or the other. I might do so if I knew which was right. You may have some light on the point, and if so you will find me keener to learn what I know not than to teach what I know. But if, like myself, you are in the dark, you should pray, as I do, that either through one of His servants, or with His own lips, He would teach us who said to His disciples: \"Be not ye called masters; for one is your master, even Christ.\"[fn-55-P5502_1533235:3908-nf] Yet such knowledge is only expedient for us when He knows it to be expedient who knows both what He has to teach and what we ought to learn. Nevertheless, to you, my dear friend, I confess my eagerness. Still much as I desire to know this after which you seek, I would sooner know when the desire of all nations shall come and when the kingdom of the saints will be set up, than how my soul has come to its earthly abode. But when His disciples (who are our apostles) put this question to the all-knowing Christ, they were told: \"It is not yours to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power.\"[fn-55-P5503_1533885:3909-nf] What if Christ, who knows what is expedient for us, knows this knowledge not to be expedient? Through Him I know that it is not ours to know the times which God has placed in His own power; but concerning the origin of souls, I am ignorant whether it is or is not ours to know. If I could be sure that such knowledge is not for us, I should cease not only to dogmatize, but even to inquire. As it is, though the subject is so deep and dark that my fear of becoming a rash teacher is almost greater than my eagerness to learn the truth, I still wish to know it if I can do so. It may be that the knowledge for which the psalmist prays: \"Lord, make me to know mine end,\"[fn-55-P5504_1534574:3910-nf] is much more necessary; yet I would that my beginning also might be revealed to me.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_13_npnf1_13_06_preface","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"NPNF1-13","text":"Ver. 6.6 \"I marvel that ye are so quickly[fn-2-P242_46139:13-nf] removing[fn-2-P243_46311:14-nf] from Him that called you in the grace of Christ, unto a different Gospel.\"","title":"Preface","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_06_book_i_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"167","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"3 Matthias,[fn-8-P883_434820:196-nf] also, who was numbered with the apostles in the place of Judas, and the one who was honored by being made a candidate with him,[fn-8-P884_435498:197-nf] are like-wise said to have been deemed worthy of the same calling with the seventy.

For as a king is shown by the royal chariot, so was the royal chariot sent for Him. [\"Behold, two men, etc.] That they may vent no sorrowful exclamations, and that it might not be with them as it was with Elisha, (2 Kings ii. 12) who, when his master was taken up, rent his mantle.

The Lord, when promising that He would send the Holy Spirit, said, \"When He is come, He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.\" What does it mean? Is it that the Lord Jesus Christ did not reprove the world of sin, when He said, \"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin\"? And that no one may take it to his head to say that this applied properly to the Jews, and not to the world, did He not say in another place, \"If ye were of the world, the world would love his own\"?[fn-31-P3158_1768257:1-nf] Did He not reprove it of righteousness, when He said, \"O righteous Father, the world hath not known Thee\"?[fn-31-P3159_1768385:2-nf] And did He not reprove it of judgment when He declared that He would say to those on the left hand, \"Depart ye into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels\"?[fn-31-P3160_1768579:3-nf] And many other passages are to be found in the holy evangel, where Christ reproveth the world of these things. Why is it, then, He attributeth this to the Holy Spirit, as if it were His proper prerogative? Is it that, because Christ spake only among the nation of the Jews, He does not appear to have reproved the world, inasmuch as one may be understood to be reproved who actually hears the reprover; while the Holy Spirit, who was in His disciples when scattered throughout the whole world, is to be understood as having reproved not one nation, but the world? For mark what He said to them when about to ascend into heaven: \"It is not for you to know the times or the moments, which the Father hath put in His own power. But ye shall receive the power of the Holy Spirit, that cometh upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\"[fn-31-P3161_1769520:4-nf] Surely this is to reprove the world.

Let us see then what Manichaeeus teaches me; and particularly let us examine that treatment which he calls the Fundamental Epistle, in which almost all that you believe is contained. For in that unhappy time when we read it we were in your opinion enlightened. The epistle begins thus:-\" Manichaeus, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the providence of God the Father. These are wholesome words from the perennial and living fountain.\" Now, if you please, patiently give heed to my inquiry. I do not believe Manichaeus to be an apostle of Christ. Do not, I beg of you, be enraged and begin to curse. For you know that it is my rule to believe none of your statements without consideration. Therefore I ask, who is this Manichaeus? You will reply, An apostle of Christ. I do not believe it. Now you are at a loss what to say or do; for you promised to give knowledge of the truth, and here you are forcing me to believe what I have no knowledge of. Perhaps you will read the gospel to me, and will attempt to find there a testimony to Manichaeus. But should you meet with a person not yet believing the gospel, how would you reply to him were he to say, I do not believe? For my part, I should not believe the gospel except as moved by the authority of the Catholic Church.[fn-9-P974_495338:5-nf] So when those on whose authority I have consented to believe in the gospel tell me not to believe in Manichaeus, how can I but consent? Take your choice. If you say, Believe the Catholics: their advice to me is to put no faith in you; so that, believing them, I am precluded from believing you;-If you say, Do not believe the Catholics: you cannot fairly use the gospel in bringing me to faith in Manichaeus; for it was at the command of the Catholics that I believed the gospel;-Again, if you say, You were right in believing the Catholics when they praised the gospel, but wrong in believing their vituperation of Manichaeus: do you think me such a fool as to believe or not to believe as you like or dislike, without any reason? It is therefore fairer and safer by far for me, having in one instance put faith in the Catholics, not to go over to you, till, instead of bidding me believe, you make me understand something in the clearest and most open manner. To convince me, then, you must put aside the gospel. If you keep to the gospel, I will keep to those who commanded me to believe the gospel; and, in obedience to them, I will not believe you at all. But if haply you should succeed in finding in the gospel an incontrovertible testimony to the apostleship of Manichaeus, you will weaken my regard for the authority of the Catholics who bid me not to believe you; and the effect of that will be, that I shall no longer be able to believe the gospel either, for it was through the Catholics that I got my faith in it; and so, whatever you bring from the gospel will no longer have any weight with me. Wherefore, if no clear proof of the apostleship of Manichaeus is found in the gospel, I will believe the Catholics rather than you. But if you read thence some passage clearly in favor of Manichaeus, I will believe neither them nor you: not them, for they lied to me about you; nor you, for you quote to me that Scripture which I had believed on the authority of those liars. But far be it that I should not believe the gospel; for believing it, I find no way of believing you too. For the names of the apostles, as there recorded,[fn-9-P975_497608:6-nf] do not include the name of Manichaeus. And who the successor of Christ's betrayer was we read in the Acts of the Apostles;[fn-9-P976_497781:7-nf] which book I must needs believe if I believe the gospel, since both writings alike Catholic authority commends to me. The same book contains the well-known narrative of the calling and apostleship of Paul.[fn-9-P977_498002:8-nf] Read me now, if you can, in the gospel where Manichaeus is called an apostle, or in any other book in which I have professed to believe. Will you read the passage where the Lord promised the Holy Spirit as a Paraclete, to the apostles? Concerning which passage, behold how many and how great are the things that restrain and deter me from believing in Manichaeus.","title":"Against the Epistle of Manichaeus Called Fundamental.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_12_against_the_epistle_of_manichaeus_called_fundamental_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"10. Perhaps you will say to me, When, then, did the Paraclete promised by the Lord come? As regards this, had I nothing else to believe on the subject, I should rather look for the Paraclete as still to come, than allow that He came in Manichaeus. But seeing that the advent of the Holy Spirit is narrated with perfect clearness in the Acts of the Apostles, where is the necessity of my so gratuitously running the risk of believing heretics? For in the Acts it is written as follows: \"The former treatise have we made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, in the day in which He chose the apostles by the Holy Spirit, and commanded them to preach the gospel. By those to whom He showed Himself alive after His passion by many proofs in the daytime, He was seen forty days, teaching concerning the kingdom of God. And how He conversed with them, and commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith He, ye have heard of me. For John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall begin to be baptized with the Holy Spirit, whom also ye shall receive after not many days, that is, at Pentecost. When they had come, they asked him, saying, Lord, wilt Thou at this time manifest Thyself? And when will be the kingdom of Israel? And He said unto them, No one can know the time which the Father hath put in His own power. But ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.\"[fn-9-P992_507495:11-nf] Behold you have here the Lord reminding His disciples of the promise of the Father, which they had heard from His mouth, of the coming of the Holy Spirit. Let us now see when He was sent; for shortly after we read as follows: \"And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. And when the sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because every man heard them speak in his own language. And they were all amazed, and marvelled, saying one to another, Are not all these which speak Galilaeans? and how heard we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Armenia, and in Cappadocia, in Pontus, Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the regions of Africa about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews, natives, Cretes, and Arabians, they heard them speak in their own tongues the wonderful works of God. And they were all amazed, and were in doubt on account of what had happened, saying, What meaneth this? But others, mocking, said, These men are full of new wine.\"[fn-9-P993_509057:12-nf] You see when the Holy Spirit came. What more do you wish? If the Scriptures are credible, should not I believe most readily in these Acts, which have the strongest testimony in their support, and which have had the advantage of becoming generally known, and of being handed down and of being publicly taught along with the gospel itself, which contains the promise of the Holy Spirit, which also we believe?On reading, then, these Acts of the Apostles, which stand, as regards authority, on a level with the gospel, I find that not only was the Holy Spirit promised to these true apostles, but that He was also sent so manifestly, that no room was left for errors on this subject.","title":"Against the Epistle of Manichaeus Called Fundamental.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_08_the_perpetual_virginity_of_blessed_mary","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"13.

The emperor Constantine was induced by Eusebius and his party to send for Arius. Upon his arrival, the emperor asked him whether he held the faith of the Catholic church. Arius then swore that his faith was orthodox, and presented a written summary of his belief; concealing, however, the reasons of his ejection from the Church by the bishop Alexander, and making a dishonest use of the language of Holy Scripture. When, therefore, he had declared upon oath that he did not hold the errors for which he had been expelled from the Church by Alexander, Constantine dismissed him, saying, `If thy faith is orthodox, thou hast well sworn; but if thy faith is impious and yet thou hast sworn, let God from heaven judge thee.' When he quitted the emperor, the partizans of Eusebius, with their usual violence, desired to conduct him into the church; but Alexander, of blessed memory, bishop of Constantinople, refused his permission, alleging that the inventor of the heresy ought not to be admitted into communion. Then at last the partizans of Eusebius pronounced the threat: `As, against your will, we succeeded in prevailing on the emperor to send for Arius, so now, even if you forbid it, shall Arius join in communion[fn-12-P1205_272954:144-nf] with us in this church to-morrow.' It was on Saturday that they said this. The bishop Alexander, deeply grieved at what he had heard, went into the church and poured forth his lamentations, raising his hands in supplication to God, and throwing himself on his face on the pavement in the sanctuary[fn-12-P1206_273539:145-nf] , prayed. Macarius went in with him, prayed with him, and heard his prayers. He asked one of two things. `If Arius,' said he, `is to be joined to the Church to-morrow, let me Thy servant departs and do not destroy the pious with the impious. If Thou wilt spare Thy Church, and I know that Thou dost spare her, look upon the words of the followers of Eusebius, and give not over Thy heritage to destruction and to shame. Remove Arius, lest if he come into the Church, heresy seem to come in with him, and impiety be hereafter deemed piety.' Having thus prayed, the bishop left the church deeply anxious, and then a horrible and extraordinary catastrophe ensued. The followers of Eusebius had launched out into threats, while the bishop had recourse to prayer. Arius, emboldened by the protection of his party, delivered many trifling and foolish speeches, when he was suddenly compelled by a call of nature to retire, and immediately, as it is written, `falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst[fn-12-P1207_274686:146-nf] ,' and gave up the ghost, being deprived at once both of communion and of life. This, then, was the end of Arius[fn-12-P1208_274818:147-nf] . The followers of Eusebius were covered with shame, and buried him whose belief they shared. The blessed Alexander completed the celebration, rejoicing with the Church in piety and orthodoxy, praying with all the brethren and greatly glorifying God. This was not because he rejoiced at the death of Arius-God forbid; for `it is appointed unto all men once to die[fn-12-P1209_275420:148-nf] ;' but because the event plainly transcended any human condemnation. For the Lord Himself passing judgment upon the menaces of the followers of Eusebius, and the prayer of Alexander, condemned the Arian heresy, and shewed that it was unworthy of being received into the communion of the Church; thus manifesting to all that, even if it received the countenance and support of the emperor, and of all men, yet by truth itself it stood condemned.\"","title":"Book I.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_104_tractate_xcix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"7.

By the name, therefore, which they each also hold in common, it was requisite that He should be distinctly called, who is not the one nor the other of them, but in whom what is common to both becomes apparent. Why, then, should we not believe that the Holy Spirit proceedeth also from the Son, seeing that He is likewise the Spirit of the Son? For did He not so proceed, He could not, when showing Himself to His disciples after the resurrection, have breathed sport them, and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-33-P3309_1842334:29-nf] For what else was signified by such a breathing upon them, but that from Him also the Holy Spirit proceedeth?

For, say the [holy] oracles, \"This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like manner as ye have seen Him go unto heaven.\"[fn-21-P2173_364438:25-nf] But if they say that He will come at the end of the world without a body, how shall those \"see Him that pierced Him,\"[fn-21-P2174_364573:26-nf] and when they recognise Him, \"mourn for themselves? \"[fn-21-P2175_364643:27-nf] For incorporeal beings have neither form nor figure, nor the aspect[fn-21-P2176_364731:28-nf] of an animal possessed of shape, because their nature is in itself simple.","title":"The Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans","author":"Ignatius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But to say that the Son has no part in His Father's royal throne argues an extraordinary amount of research into the oracles of God on the part of Eunomius, who, after his extreme devotion to the inspired Scriptures, has not yet heard, \"Seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God[fn-10-P1025_551923:56-nf] ,\" and many similar passages, of which it would not be easy to reckon up the number, but which Eunomius has never learnt, and so denies that the Son is enthroned together with the Father. Again the phrase, \"not having lot in his power,\" we should rather pass by as un-meaning than confute as ungodly. For what sense is attached to the term \"having lot\" is not easy to discover from the common use of the word. Those cast lots, as the Scripture tells us, for the Lord's vesture, who were unwilling to rend His garment, but disposed to make it over to that one of their number in whose favour the lot should decide[fn-10-P1026_552554:57-nf] . They then who thus cast lots among themselves for the \"coat\" may be said, perhaps, to \"have had lot\" in it. But here in the case of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as Their power resides in Their nature (for the Holy Spirit breathes \"where He listeth[fn-10-P1027_552865:58-nf] ,\" and \"worketh all in all as He will[fn-10-P1028_552924:59-nf] ,\" and the Son, by Whom all things were made, visible and invisible, in heaven and in earth, \"did all things whatsoever He pleased[fn-10-P1029_553098:60-nf] ,\" and \"quickeneth whom He will[fn-10-P1030_553149:61-nf] ,\" and the Father put \"the times in His own powers[fn-10-P1031_553220:62-nf] ,\" while from the mention of \"times\" we conclude that all things done in time are subject to the power I of the Father), if, I say, it has been demonstrated that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit alike are in a position of power to do what They will, it is impossible to see what sense there can be in the phrase \"having lot in His power.\" For the heir of all things, the maker of the ages[fn-10-P1032_553633:63-nf] , He Who shines with the Father's glory and expresses in Himself the Father's person, has all things that the Father Himself has, and is possessor of all His power, not that the right is transferred from the Father to the Son, but that it at once remains in the Father and resides in the Son. For He Who is in the Father is manifestly in the Father with all His own might, and He Who has the Father in Himself includes all the power and might of the Father. For He has in Himself all the Father, and not merely a part of Him: and He Who has Him entirely assuredly has His power as well. With what meaning, then, Eunomius asserts that the Father has \"none who has lot in His power,\" those perhaps can tell who are disciples of his folly one who knows how to appreciate language confesses that he cannot understand phrases divorced from meaning. The Father, he says, \"has none Who has lot in His power.\" Why, who is there that says that the Father and Son contend together for power and cast lots to decide the matter? But the holy Eunomius comes as mediator between them and by a friendly agreement without lot assigns to the Father the superiority in power.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_106_tractate_ci_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4.

For what does He mean by the words, \"And in that day ye shall ask me nothing\"? The verb to ask, used here, means not only to beg of, but also to question; and the Greek Gospel, of which this is a translation, has a word that may also be understood in both senses, so that by it the ambiguity is not removed;[fn-33-P3350_1861336:6-nf] and even though it were so, every difficulty would not thereby disappear. For we read that the Lord Christ, after He rose again, was both questioned and petitioned. He was asked by the disciples, on the eve of His ascension into heaven, when He would be manifested, and when the kingdom of Israel would come;[fn-33-P3351_1861668:7-nf] and even when already in heaven, He was petitioned [asked] by St. Stephen to receive his spirit.[fn-33-P3352_1861779:8-nf] And who dare either think or say that Christ ought not to be asked, sitting as He does in heaven, and yet was asked while He abode on earth? or that He ought not to be asked in His state of immortality, although it was men's duty to ask Him while still in His state of subjection to death?

And on this account, therefore, His words did not mean that He was about to die, and to be withdrawn from their view till His resurrection; but that He was about to go to the Father, which He did after His resurrection, and when, after holding intercourse with them for forty days, He ascended into heaven.[fn-33-P3362_1865982:16-nf] He therefore addressed the words, \"A little while, and ye shall no more see me,\" to those who saw Him at the time in bodily form; because He was about to go to the Father, and never thereafter to be seen in that mortal state wherein they now beheld Him when so addressing them. But the words that He added, \"And again a little while, and ye shall see me,\" He gave as a promise to the Church universal: just as to it, also, He gave the other promise, \"Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-33-P3363_1866509:17-nf] The Lord is not slack concerning His promise: a little while, and we shall see Him, where we shall have no more any requests to make, any questions to put; for nothing shall remain to be desired, nothing lie hid to be inquired about. This little while appears long to us, because it is still in continuance; when it is over, we shall then feel what a little while it was. Let not, then, our joy be like that of the world, whereof it is said, \"But the world shall rejoice;\" and yet let not our sorrow in travailing in birth with such a desire be unmingled with joy; but, as the apostle says, be \"rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation;\"[fn-33-P3364_1867171:18-nf] for even the woman in travail, to whom we are compared, has herself more joy over the offspring that is soon to be, than sorrow over her present pains.

In few words he shows the whole mystery of the resurrection, that is, both the reality of the flesh and the growth in glory. And the meaning is: Who is he that cometh up from the earth, cometh up from blood? According to the[fn-71-P7131_2353827:97-nf] prophecy of Jacob, He has bound His foal to the vine, and has trodden the wine-press alone, and His garments are red with new wine from Bosor, that is from flesh, or from the tribulation of the world: for He Himself[fn-71-P7132_2354063:98-nf] has conquered the world. And, therefore, His garments are red and shining, because He is[fn-71-P7133_2354171:99-nf] beauteous in form more than the sons of men, and on account of the glory of His triumph they have been changed into a white robe; and then, in truth, as concerns Christ's flesh, were fulfilled the words,[fn-71-P7134_2354395:100-nf] \"Who is this that cometh up all in white, leaning upon her beloved?\" And that which is written in the same book:[fn-71-P7135_2354530:101-nf] \"My beloved is white and ruddy.\" These men are his true followers who have not[fn-71-P7136_2354629:102-nf] defiled their garments with women, for they have continued virgins, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.

Then shall the sheep which was[fn-71-P7138_2355146:104-nf] lost, and was wandering in the lower world, be carried whole on the Saviour's shoulders, and the sheep which was sick with sin shall be supported by the mercy of the Judge. Then shall they see him who pierced Him, who shouted,[fn-71-P7139_2355395:105-nf] \"Crucify Him, crucify Him.\" Again and again shall they beat their breasts, they and their women, those women to whom our Lord said, as He carried His cross,[fn-71-P7140_2355572:106-nf] \"Ye daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves, and for your children.\" Then shall be fulfilled the prophecy of the angels, who said to the stupefied Apostles,[fn-71-P7141_2355776:107-nf] \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking with astonishment into heaven? This Jesus who is taken from you into heaven, shall come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\" But what are we to think of a man saying that our Lord[fn-71-P7142_2356031:108-nf] ate with the Apostles for forty days after His resurrection in order that they might not think Him to be a phantom, and then asserting that it was a phantom which did this very thing, which ate and which was seen by many in the flesh. That which was seen is either real, or false. If it is real, it follows that He really ate, and really had members. But if it is false, how could He be willing to give false impressions in order to prove the truth of His resurrection? For no one proves what is true by means of what is false. You will say, are we then going to eat after our resurrection? I know not. Scripture does not tell us; and yet, if the question be asked, I do not think we shall eat. For I have read that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, while it promises[fn-71-P7143_2356821:109-nf] such things as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man. Moses fasted forty days and forty nights. Human nature does not allow of this, but what is impossible with men is not impossible with God. Just as, in foretelling the future, it matters not whether a person announces what will take place after ten years or after a hundred, since the knowledge of futurity is all one; so he who can fast for forty days and yet live,-not, indeed, that he can of himself fast, but that he lives by the power of God,-will also be able to live for ever without food and drink. Why did our Lord eat an honeycomb? To prove the resurrection: not to give your palate the pleasure of tasting of honey. He asked for a fish broiled on the coals that He might[fn-71-P7144_2357612:110-nf] confirm the doubting Apostles, who did not dare approach Him because they thought they saw not a body, but a spirit.[fn-71-P7145_2357749:111-nf] The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue was raised to life and took food.[fn-71-P7146_2357841:112-nf] Lazarus, who had been four days dead, rose again, and comes before us at a dinner; not because he was accustomed to eat in the lower world, but because a case which presented such difficulties challenged the believer's criticism. As He showed them real hands and a real side, so He really ate with His disciples; really walked with Cleophas; conversed with men with a real tongue; really reclined at supper; with real hands took bread, blessed and brake it, and was offering it to them. And as for His suddenly vanishing out of their sight, that is the power of God, not of a shadowy phantom. Besides, even before His resurrection, when they had led Him out from Nazareth that they might cast Him down headlong from the brow of the hill, He passed through the midst of them, that is, escaped out of their hands. Can we follow Marcion, and say that because, when He was held fast, He escaped in a manner contrary to nature, therefore His birth must have been only apparent? Has not the Lord a privilege which is conceded to magicians? It is related of Apollonius of Tyana that, when standing in court before Domitian, he all at once disappeared. Do not put the power of the Lord on a level with the tricks of magicians, so that He may appear to have been what He was not, and may be thought to have eaten without teeth, walked without feet, broken bread without hands, spoken without a tongue, and showed a side which had no ribs.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_13_book_i_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"45.

And when she meant to ask him whence he came, and for what reason he had come to Jerusalem, behold, all the disciples of the Lord, except Thomas who is called Didymus, were brought by a cloud to the door of the chamber of the blessed Mary. They stood and went in, and saluted the queen with the following words, and adored her: Hail, Mary, full of grace! the Lord be with thee. And she eagerly rose quickly, and bowed herself, and kissed them, and gave thanks to God. These are the names of the disciples of the Lord who were brought thither in the cloud: John the evangelist and James his brother, Peter and Paul, Andrew, Philip, Luke, Barnabas, Bartholomew and Matthew, Matthias who is called Justus,[fn-86-P8689_2830539:12-nf] Simon the Chananaean, Judas and his brother, Nicodemus and Maximianus, and many others who cannot be numbered. Then the blessed Mary said to her brethren: What is this, that you have all come to Jerusalem? Peter, answering, said to her: We had need to ask this of thee, and dost thou question us? Certainly, as I think, none of us knows why we have come here to-day with such rapidity. I was at Antioch, and now I am here. All declared plainly the place where they had been that day. And they all wondered that they were there when they heard these things. The blessed Mary said to them: I asked my Son, before He endured the passion, that He and you should be at my death; and He granted me this gift. Whence you may know that my departure will be to-morrow.[fn-86-P8690_2831396:13-nf] Watch and pray with me, that when the Lord comes to receive my soul, He may find you watching. Then all promised that they would watch. And they watched and prayed the whole night, with psalms and chants, with great illuminations.","title":"First Latin Form.","author":"Apocrypha of the New Testament"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_16_book_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"75. The Son is ignorant, then, of nothing which the Father knows, nor does it follow because the Father alone knows, that the Son does not know. Father and Son abide in unity of nature, and the ignorance of the Son belongs to the divine Plan of silence seeing that in Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. This the Lord Himself testified, when He answered the question of the Apostles concerning the times, It is not yours to know times or moments, which the Father hath set within His own authority[fn-19-P1945_1275062:136-nf] . The knowledge is denied them, and not only that, but the anxiety to learn is forbidden, because it is not theirs to know these times. Yet now that He is risen, they ask again, though their question on the former occasion had been met with the reply, that not even the Son knew. They cannot possibly have understood literally that the Son did not know, for they ask Him again as though He did know. They perceived in the mystery of His ignorance a divine Plan of silence, and now, after His resurrection, they renew the question, thinking that the time has come to speak. And the Son no longer denies that He knows, but tells them that it is not theirs to know, because the Father has set it within His own authority. If then, the Apostles attributed it to the divine Plan, and not to weakness, that the Son did not know the day, shall we say that the Son knew not the day for the simple reason that He was not God? Remember, God the Father set the day within His authority, that it might not come to the knowledge of man, and the Son, when asked before, replied that He did not know, but now, no longer denying His knowledge, replies that it is theirs not to know, for the Father has set the times not in His own knowledge, but in His own authority. The day and the moment are included in the word `times': can it be, then, that He, Who was to restore Israel to its kingdom, did not Himself know the day and the moment of that restoration? He instructs us to see an evidence of His birth in this exclusive prerogative of the Father, yet He does not deny that He knows: and while He proclaims that the possession of this knowledge is withheld from ourselves, He asserts that it belongs to the mystery of the Father's authority.","title":"Book IX.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_23_book_xvii","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"About His resurrection also the oracles of the Psalms are by no means silent. For what else is it that is sung in His person in the 3d Psalm, \"I laid me down and took a sleep, [and] I awaked, for the Lord shall sustain me?\"[fn-32-P3202_1761061:118-nf] Is there perchance any one so stupid as to believe that the prophet chose to point it out to us as something great that He had slept and risen up, unless that sleep had been death, and that awaking the resurrection, which behoved to be thus prophesied concerning Christ? For in the 41st Psalm also it is shown much more clearly, where in the person of the Mediator, in the usual way, things are narrated as if past which were prophesied as yet to come, since these things which were yet to come were in the predestination and foreknowledge of God as if they were done, because they were certain. He says, \"Mine enemies speak evil of me; When shall he die, and his name perish? And if he came in to see me, his heart spake vain things: he gathered iniquity to himself. He went out of doors, and uttered it all at once. Against me all mine enemies whisper together: against me do they devise evil They have planned an unjust thing against me. Shall not he that sleeps also rise again?\"[fn-32-P3203_1762065:119-nf] These words are certainly so set down here that he may be understood to say nothing else than if he said, Shall not He that died recover life again? The previous words clearly show that His enemies have mediated and planned His death, and that this was executed by him who came in to see, and went out to betray. But to whom does not Judas here occur, who, from being His disciple, became His betrayer? Therefore because they were about to do what they had plotted,-that is, were about to kill Him,-he, to show them that with useless malice they were about to kill Him who should rise again, so adds this verse, as if he, said, What vain thing are you doing? What will be your crime will be my sleep. \"Shall not He that sleeps also rise again?\" And yet he indicates in the following verses that they should not commit so great an impiety with impunity, saying,\" Yea, the man of my peace in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, hath enlarged the heel over me;\"[fn-32-P3204_1763044:120-nf] that is, hath trampled me under foot. \"But Thou,\" he saith, \"O Lord, he merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.\"[fn-32-P3205_1763197:121-nf] Who can now deny this who sees the Jews, after the passion and resurrection of Christ, utterly rooted up from their abodes by warlike slaughter and destruction? For, being slain by them, He has risen again, and has requited them meanwhile by temporary discipline, save that for those who are not corrected He keeps it in store for the time when He shall judge the quick and the dead.[fn-32-P3206_1763601:122-nf] For the Lord Jesus Himself, in pointing out that very man to the apostles as His betrayer, quoted this very verse of this psalm, and said it was fulfilled in Himself: \"He that ate my bread enlarged the heel over me.\" But what he says, \"In whom I trusted,\" does not suit the head but the body. For the Saviour Himself was not ignorant of him concerning whom He had already said before, \"One of you is a devil.\"[fn-32-P3207_1764047:123-nf] But He is wont to assume the person of His members, and to ascribe to Himself what should be said of them, because the head and the body is one Christ;[fn-32-P3208_1764219:124-nf] whence that saying in the Gospel, \"I was an hungered, and ye gave me to eat.\"[fn-32-P3209_1764321:125-nf] Expounding which, He says, \"Since ye did it to one of the least of mine, ye did it to me.\"[fn-32-P3210_1764434:126-nf] Therefore He said that He had trusted, because his disciples then had trusted concerning Judas; for he was numbered with the apostles.[fn-32-P3211_1764592:127-nf] ","title":"Book XVII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_24_book_xviii","source_chapter":52,"source_paragraph":"208","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Then was fulfilled that prophecy, \"Out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem;\"[fn-35-P3572_1935907:107-nf] and the prediction of the Lord Christ Himself, when, after the resurrection, \"He opened the understanding\" of His amazed disciples \"that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, that thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\"[fn-35-P3573_1936343:108-nf] And again, when, in reply to their questioning about the day of His last coming, He said, \"It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power; but ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even unto the ends of the earth.\"[fn-35-P3574_1936742:109-nf] First of all, the Church spread herself abroad from Jerusalem; and when very many in Judea and Samaria had believed, she also went into other nations by those who announced the gospel, whom, as lights, He Himself had both prepared by His word and kindled by His Holy Spirit. For He had said to them, \"Fear ye not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.\"[fn-35-P3575_1937139:110-nf] And that they might not be frozen with fear, they burned with the fire of charity. Finally, the gospel of Christ was preached in the whole world, not only by those who had seen and heard Him both before His passion and after His resurrection, but also after their death by their successors, amid the horrible persecutions, diverse torments and deaths of the martyrs, God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost,[fn-35-P3576_1937635:111-nf] that the people of the nations, believing in Him who was crucified for their redemption, might venerate with Christian love the blood of the martyrs which they had poured forth with devilish fury, and the very kings by whose laws the Church had been laid waste might become profitably subject to that name they had cruelly striven to take away from the earth, and might begin to persecute the false gods for whose sake the worshippers of the true God had formerly been persecuted.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_24_book_xviii","source_chapter":55,"source_paragraph":"215","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Truly Jesus Himself shall extinguish by His presence that last persecution which is to be made by Antichrist.

But this is quite unreasonable. For had it been profitable for us to know this, by whom could it better have been told than by God Himself, the Master, when the disciples questioned Him? For they were not silent when with Him, but inquired of Him, saying, \"Lord, wilt Thou at this time present the kingdom to Israel, or when?\"[fn-35-P3596_1948819:121-nf] But He said, \"It is not for you to know the times, which the Father hath put in His own power.\" When they got that answer, they had not at all questioned Him about the hour, or day, or year, but about the time.

Before all things, the Teacher of peace and the Master of unity would not have prayer to be made singly and individually, as for one who prays to pray for himself alone. For we say not \"My Father, which art in heaven,\" nor \"Give me this day my daily bread; \"nor does each one ask that only his own debt should be forgiven him; nor does he request for himself alone that he may not be led into temptation, and delivered from evil. Our prayer is public and common; and when we pray, we pray not for one, but for the whole people, because we the whole people are one. The God of peace and the Teacher of concord, who taught unity, willed that one should thus pray for all, even as He Himself bore us all in one.[fn-71-P7157_2343788:17-nf] This law of prayer the three children observed when they were shut up in the fiery furnace, speaking together in prayer, and being of one heart in the agreement of the spirit; and this the faith of the sacred Scripture assures us, and in telling us how such as these prayed, gives an example which we ought to follow in our prayers, in order that we may be such as they were: \"Then these three,\" it says, \"as if from one mouth sang an hymn, and blessed the Lord.\"[fn-71-P7158_2344309:18-nf] They spoke as if from one mouth, although Christ had not yet taught them how to pray. And therefore, as they prayed, their speech was availing and effectual, because a peaceful, and sincere, and spiritual prayer deserved well of the Lord.

All these have clearly taught that the only begotten Son of God and everlasting God, ineffably begotten of the Father, is one Son; and that after the incarnation He was called both Son of man and man, not because He was changed into manhood, for His nature is immutable, but because He took what was ours. They teach too that He was both impassible and immortal as God, and mortal and passible as man; but after the resurrection even in relation to His humanity He received impassibility and immortality, for, though the body remained a body, still it is impassible and immortal, verily a divine body and glorified with divine glory. This is distinctly told us by the blessed Paul in the words \"For our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto the body of His glory.\"[fn-63-P6328_1618781:426-nf] He does not say to \"His glory\" but to\"the body of His glory,\" and the Lord Himself, when He had said to His apostles \"There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in His Father's glory,\"[fn-63-P6329_1619058:427-nf] took them after six days into an exceeding high mountain, and was transfigured before them, and His face became as the sun, and His raiment was bright like the light.[fn-63-P6330_1619282:428-nf] By these means He shewed the manner of the second advent. He taught that the assumed nature is not uncircumscribed (for this is characteristic of the Godhead alone) but that it shall send forth flashes of the divine glory, and emit rays of light transcending the powers of the sense of sight. With this glory He was taken up; with this the angels said that He should come; for their words were \"He who was taken from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.\"[fn-63-P6331_1619812:429-nf] When moreover He was seen by the divine apostles after the resurrection, He shewed them both hands and feet; and to Thomas He shewed also His side and the wounds of the nails and of the spear. For on account of those men who positively deny the assumption of the flesh, and further of those others who assert that after the resurrection the nature of the body was changed into the nature of Godhead, He preserved unaltered the prints of the nails and of the spear. And while raising all other bodies free from every disfigurement,[fn-63-P6332_1620362:430-nf] in His own body He left the marks of His sufferings. to the end that deniers of the assumption of the body may be convicted of their error by means of His sufferings; and holders of the notion that His body was changed into another nature may be taught by the print of the nails that it abides in its own proper qualities. Suppose any one to imagine that he has a proof that the body of the Lord did not remain a body after the resurrection in the fact that He came in to the disciples when the doors were shut, let such an one remember how He walked upon the sea while His body was still mortal, how He was born after keeping the seals of virginity intact, and how again when encircled by them that were plotting against Him He frequently escaped from their hands. But why need I mention the Lord, who was not only man, but God before the ages, and to whom it was easy to do whatsoever He would? Let them tell how Habakkuk was translated from Judaea into Babylon in a moment of time and passed through the covering of the den, and brought the food to Daniel, and returned again. without destroying the seals of the den.[fn-63-P6333_1621505:431-nf] It is sheer foolishness to enquire into the manner of the miracles of the Lord, but in addition to what has been said it ought also to be known that after the resurrection our bodies also will be incorruptible and immortal, and being released from what is earthly will become light and aethereal. This moreover is distinctly taught us by the divine Paul in the words \"It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption, it is sown in weakness it is raised in power; it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory; it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body\"[fn-63-P6334_1622111:432-nf] and in another place \"We shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.\"[fn-63-P6335_1622238:433-nf] If then the bodies of the saints become light and aethereal and easily travel through the air, we cannot wonder that the Lord's body united to the Godhead of the only begotten, when, after the resurrection, it had become immortal, entered in when the doors were shut.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"492","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"On account of this difference of term He is said by the divine Paul to be \"without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life.\"[fn-65-P6599_1708537:625-nf] He is without father as touching His humanity; for as man He was born of a mother alone.

But as man He had both a beginning of days, for He was born in the reign of Augustus Caesar, and an end of life, for He was crucified in the reign of Tiberius Caesar.

That this number, then, is a sign of that laborious period in which, under the discipline of Christ the King, we have to fight against the devil, is also indicated by the fact that both the law and the prophets solemnized a fast of forty days,-that is to say, a humbling of the soul,-in the person of Moses and Elias, who fasted each for a space of forty days.[fn-13-P1390_556730:31-nf] And what else does the Gospel narrative shadow forth under the fast of the Lord Himself, during which forty days He was also tempted of the devil,[fn-13-P1391_556915:32-nf] than that condition of temptation which appertains to us through all the space of this age, and which He bore in the flesh which He condescended to take to Himself from our mortality? After the resurrection also, it was His will to remain with His disciples on the earth not longer than forty days,[fn-13-P1392_557235:33-nf] continuing to mingle for that space of time with this life of theirs in the way of human intercourse, and partaking along with them of the food needful for mortal men, although He Himself was to die no more; and all this was done with the view of signifying to them through these forty days, that although His presence should be hidden from their eyes, He would yet fulfil what He promised when He said, \"Lo, I am with you, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-13-P1393_557706:34-nf] And in explanation of the circumstance that this particular number should denote this temporal and earthly life, what suggests itself most immediately in the meantime, although there may be another and subtler method of accounting for it, is the consideration that the seasons of the years also revolve in four successive alternations, and that the world itself has its bounds determined by four divisions, which Scripture sometimes designates by the names of the winds,-East and West, Aquilo [or North] and Meridian [or South].[fn-13-P1394_558258:35-nf] But the number forty is equivalent to four times ten.

Taking, then, not only the reports presented by the four evangelists, but also the statement given by the Apostle Paul, we shall endeavour to bring the whole into a single connected narrative, and exhibit the order in which all these incidents may have taken place, comprehending all the Lord's appearances to the male disciples, and leaving out His earlier declarations to the women. Now, in the entire number of the men, Peter is understood to be the one to whom Christ showed Himself first. At least, this holds good so far as regards all the individuals who are actually mentioned by the four evangelists, and by the Apostle Paul. But, at the same time, who would be bold enough either to affirm or to deny that He may have appeared to some one among them before He showed Himself to Peter, although all these writers pass the matter over in silence? For the statement which Paul also gives is not in the form, \"He was seen first of Cephas.\" But it runs thus: \"He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once.\" And thus it is not made clear who these twelve were, just as we are not informed who these five hundred were. It is quite possible, indeed, that the twelve here instanced were some unknown twelve belonging to the multitude of the disciples. For now the apostle might speak of those whom the Lord designated apostles, not as the twelve, but as the eleven. Some codices, indeed, contain this very reading. I take that, however, to be an emendation introduced by men who were perplexed by the text, supposing it to refer to those twelve apostles who, by the time when Judas disappeared, were really only eleven. It may be the case, then, that those are the more correct codices which contain the reading \"eleven;\" or it may be that Paul intended some other twelve disciples to be understood by that phrase;[fn-26-P2655_1165212:296-nf] or, once more, the fact may be that he meant that consecrated number[fn-26-P2656_1165395:297-nf] to remain as before, although the circle had been reduced to eleven: for this number twelve, as it was used of the apostles, had so mystical an importance, that, in order to keep the spiritual symbol of the same number, there could be but a single individual, namely, Matthias, elected to fill the place of Judas[fn-26-P2657_1165728:298-nf] But whichever of these several views may be adopted, nothing necessarily results which can appear to be inconsistent with truth, or at variance with any one most trustworthy historian among them. Still, it remains the probable supposition, that, after He was seen of Peter, He appeared next to those two, of whom Cleophas was one, and regarding whom Luke presents us with a complete narrative, while Mark gives us only a very brief notice. The latter evangelist[fn-26-P2658_1166211:299-nf] reports the same incident in these concise terms: \"And after that He appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked and went to a country-seat.\"[fn-26-P2659_1166385:300-nf] For it is not unreasonable for us to suppose that the place of residence[fn-26-P2660_1166476:301-nf] referred to may also have been styled a country-seat;[fn-26-P2661_1166545:302-nf] just as Bethlehem itself, which formerly was called a city, is even at the present time also named a village, although its honour has now been made so much the greater since the name of this Lord, who was born in it, has been proclaimed so extensively throughout the Churches of all nations. In the Greek codices, indeed, the reading which we discover is rather \"estate\"[fn-26-P2662_1166977:303-nf] than \"country-seat.\" But that term was employed not only of residences,[fn-26-P2663_1167066:304-nf] but also of free towns[fn-26-P2664_1167107:305-nf] and colonies beyond the city, which is the head and mother of the rest, and is therefore called the metropolis.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"128","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"74. Luke next proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: \"And as they thus spake, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you: it is I; be not afraid.[fn-26-P2673_1173657:311-nf] But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. And He said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. And when He had thus spoken, He showed them His hands and His feet.\"[fn-26-P2674_1174081:312-nf] It is to this act, by which the Lord showed Himself after His resurrection, that John is also understood to refer when he discourses as follows: \"Then, when it was late on the first day of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus, and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when He had so said, He showed unto them His hands and His side.\"[fn-26-P2675_1174537:313-nf] Thus, too, we may connect with these words of John certain matters which Luke reports, but which John Himself omits. For Luke continues in these terms: \"And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, He said unto them, Have ye here any meat? And they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. And when He had eaten before them, He took what remained,[fn-26-P2676_1174935:314-nf] and gave it unto them.\"[fn-26-P2677_1175024:315-nf] Again, a passage which Luke omits, but which John presents, may next be connected with these words. It is to the following effect: \"Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord. Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.\"[fn-26-P2678_1175537:316-nf] Once more, we may attach to the above section another which John has left out, but which Luke inserts. It runs thus: \"And He said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me. Then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things. And I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be endued with power from on high.\"[fn-26-P2679_1176368:317-nf] Observe, then, how Luke has here referred to that promise of the Holy Spirit which we do not elsewhere find made by the Lord, save in John's Gospel.[fn-26-P2680_1176758:318-nf] And this deserves something more than a passing notice, in order that we may bear in mind how the evangelists attest each other's truth, even on subjects which some of them may not themselves record, but which they nevertheless know to have been reported. After these matters, Luke passes over in silence all else that happened, and introduces nothing into his narrative beyond the occasion when Jesus ascended into heaven. And at the same time he appends this [statement of the ascension], just as if it followed immediately upon these words which the Lord spake, at the same time with those other transactions on the first day of the week, that is to say, on the day on which the Lord rose again; whereas, in the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-26-P2681_1177525:319-nf] the self-same Luke tells us that the event really took place on the fortieth day after His resurrection. Finally, as regards the fact that John states that the Apostle Thomas was not present with these others on the occasion under review, whereas, according to Luke, the two disciples, of whom Cleophas was one, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven assembled and those who were with them, it admits of little doubt that we must suppose Thomas simply to have left the company before the Lord showed Himself to the brethren when they were talking in the terms noticed above.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"131","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"77. In what follows we have a further recommendation to take this to have been the last manifestation of Himself in bodily fashion which the Lord gave to the apostles. For the same Mark continues in these terms: \"And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\"[fn-26-P2689_1186731:324-nf] Then he appends this statement: \"So then, after the Lord had spoken unto them, He was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by signs following.\"[fn-26-P2690_1187020:325-nf] Now, when he says, \"So then, after the Lord had spoken unto them, He was received up into heaven,\" he appears probably enough to indicate that this was the last discourse He held with them upon the earth. At the same time, the words do not seem to shut us up to that idea absolutely. For what he says is not, \"after He had spoken these things unto them,\" but simply, \"after He had spoken unto them;\" and hence it would be quite admissible, were there any necessity for such a theory, to suppose that this was not the last discourse, and that was not the last day on which He was present with them upon the earth, but that all the matters regarding which He spake with them in all these days may be referred to in the sentence,\" After He had spoken unto them, He was received up into heaven.\" But, inasmuch as the considerations which we have detailed above lead us rather to conclude that this was the last day, than to suppose that the allusion is specifically to the eleven at a time when, in consequence of the absence of Thomas, they were only ten, we are of opinion that after this discourse which Mark mentions, and with which we have to connect in their proper order those other words, whether of the disciples or of the Lord Himself, which are recorded in the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-26-P2691_1188336:326-nf] we must believe the Lord to have been received up into heaven, to wit, on the fortieth day after the day of His resurrection.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"84. At the same time, all is not recorded, as John plainly declares.[fn-27-P2718_1205870:346-nf] For He had frequent intercourse with His disciples during the forty days which preceded His ascension into heaven.[fn-27-P2719_1206006:347-nf] He had not, however, showed Himself to them throughout all these forty days without interruption. For John tells us, that after the first day of His resurrection-life, there elapsed other eight days, at the end of which space He appeared to them again. The appearance which is identified [in John] as the third-namely, the one by the sea of Tiberias-may perhaps have taken place on an immediately succeeding day; for there is nothing antagonistic to that. And then He showed Himself when it seethed the proper time to Him, as He had appointed with them (which appointment had also been conveyed in the previous prophetic announcement) to go before them into Galilee. And all throughout these forty days, He appeared on occasions, and to individuals, and in modes, just asHe was minded. To these appearances Peter alludes when, in the discourse which he delivered before Cornelius and those who were withhim, he says, \"Even to us who did eat and drinkwith Him after He rose from the dead, for the space of forty days.\"[fn-27-P2720_1207042:348-nf] It is not meant, however, that they had eaten and drunk with Him daily throughout these forty days. For that would becontrary to John's statement, who has interposed the space of eight days, during which He was not seen, and makes His third appearance take place by the sea of Tiberias. At the same time, even although He [should be supposed to have] manifested Himself to them and lived with them every day after that period, that would not come into antagonism with anything in the narrative. And, perhaps, this expression, \"for the space of forty days,\" which is equivalent to four times ten, and may thus sustain a mystical reference to the whole world or the whole temporal age, has been used just because those first ten days, within which the said eight fall, may not incongruously be reckoned, in accordance with the practice of the Scriptures, on the principle of dealing with the part in general terms as the whole.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_15_book_iv_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"9. Next in succession, therefore, let is now go over the Gospel of Luke in regular order. We shall omit, however, those passages which he has in common with Matthew and Mark. For all these have been already handled. Luke, then, begins his narrative in the following fashion: \"Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of these things which have been fulfilled[fn-27-P2795_1236542:32-nf] among us, even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and ministers of the word; it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order[fn-27-P2796_1236830:33-nf] most excellent Theophilus, that thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.\"[fn-27-P2797_1237110:34-nf] This beginning does not pertain immediately to the narrative presented in the Gospel. But it suggests to us to be cognizant of the fact, that this same Luke is also the writer of the other book which bears the name of the Acts of the Apostles. Our ground for holding this opinion is not merely the circumstance that the name of Theophilus occurs there as well as here. For it might quite well happen that there was a second person with the name of Theophilus; and even if it was one and the same person that was referred to in both cases, still another composition might have been addressed to him by a different individual, just as the Gospel was written in his behoof by Luke. We base our view of the identity of authorship, however, on the fact that this second book commences in the following strain: \"The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, until the day in which He,[fn-27-P2798_1238054:35-nf] through the Holy Ghost, gave commandment unto the apostles whom He chose to preach the gospel.\"[fn-27-P2799_1238305:36-nf] This statement gives us to understand that, previous to this, he had written one of those four books of the gospel which are held in the loftiest authority in the Church. At the same time, when he tells us that he had composed a treatise of all that Jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which He gave commandment to the apostles, we are not to take this to mean that he actually has given us a full account in his Gospel of all that Jesus did and said when He lived with His apostles on earth. For that would be contrary to what John affirms when he says that there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, the world itself could not contain the books.[fn-28-P2800_1239041:37-nf] And besides, it is the admitted fact that not a few things have been narrated by the other evangelists, which Luke himself has not touched upon in his history. The sense therefore is, that he wrote a treatise of all these things, in so far as he made a selection out of the whole mass of materials for his narrative, and introduced those facts which he judged fit and suitable for the satisfactory discharge of the responsible duty laid upon him. Again, when he speaks of many who had \"taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which have been fulfilled among us,\" he seems to refer to certain parties who had not been able to complete the task which they had assumed. Hence he also says that it seemed good to him also to \"write carefully in order, forasmuch as many have taken in hand,\" etc. The allusion here, however, we ought to take to be to those writers who have attained to no authority in the Church, just because they were utterly incompetent rightly to carry out what they took in hand. Moreover, the author at present before us has not confined himself to the task of bringing down his narrative to the events of the Lord's resurrection and assumption; neither has it been his aim simply to have a place commensurate in honour with his labours in the company of the four writers of the Gospel Scriptures. But he has also undertaken a record of what was done subsequently by the hands of the apostles; and relating as many of those events as he believed to be needful and helpful to the edification of the faith of readers or hearers, he has given us a narrative so faithful, that his is the only book that has been reckoned worthy of acceptance in the Church as a history of the Acts of the Apostles; while all these other writers who attempted, although deficient in the trustworthiness which was the first requisite, to compose an account of the doings and sayings of the apostles, have met with rejection. And, further, Mark and Luke certainly wrote at a time when it was quite possible to put them to the test not only by the Church of Christ, but also by the apostles themselves who were still alive in the flesh.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_27_jerome_lives_of_illustrious_men_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"290","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Paul,[fn-71-P7100_1824945:36-nf] formerly called Saul, an apostle outside the number of the twelve apostles, was of the tribe of Benjamin and the town of Giscalis[fn-71-P7101_1825118:37-nf] in Judea. When this was taken by the Romans he removed with his parents to Tarsus in Cilicia. Sent by them to Jerusalem to study law he was educated by Gamaliel a most learned man whom Luke mentions. But after he had been present at the death of the martyr Stephen and had received letters from the high priest of the temple for the persecution of those who believed in Christ, he proceeded to Damascus, where constrained to faith by a revelation, as it is written in the Acts of the apostles, he was transformed from a persecutor into an elect vessel. As Sergius Paulus Proconsul of Cyprus was the first to believe on his preaching, he took his name from him because he had subdued him to faith in Christ, and having been joined by Barnabas, after traversing many cities, he returned to Jerusalem and was ordained apostle to the Gentiles by Peter, James and John. And because a full account of his life is given in the Acts of the Apostles, I only say this, that the twenty-fifth year after our Lord's passion, that is the second of Nero, at the time when Fetus Procurator of Judea succeeded Felix, he was sent bound to Rome, and remaining for two years in free custody, disputed daily with the Jews concerning the advent of Christ. It ought to be said that at the first defence, the power of Nero having not yet been confirmed, nor his wickedness broken forth to such a degree as the histories relate concerning him, Paul was dismissed by Nero, that the gospel of Christ might be preached also in the West. As he himself writes in the second epistle to Timothy, at the time when he was about to be put to death dictating his epistle as he did while in chains; \"At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account. But the Lord stood by[fn-71-P7102_1827037:38-nf] me and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and that all the Gentiles might hear, and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion\"[fn-71-P7103_1827254:39-nf] -clearly indicating Nero as lion on account of his cruelty. And directly following he says \"The Lord delivered me from the month of the lion\" and again shortly \"The Lord delivered me[fn-71-P7104_1827465:40-nf] from every evil work and saved me unto his heavenly kingdom,\"[fn-71-P7105_1827758:41-nf] for indeed he felt within himself that his martyrdom was near at hand, for in the same epistle he announced \"for I am already being offered and the time of my departure is at hand.\"[fn-71-P7106_1827977:42-nf] He then, in the fourteenth year of Nero on the same day with Peter, was beheaded at Rome for Christ's sake and was buried in the Ostian way, the twenty-seventh year after our Lord's passion. He wrote nine epistles to seven churches: To the Romans one, To the Corinthians two, To the Galatians one, To the Ephesians one, To the Philippians one, To the Colossians one, To the Thessalonians two; and besides these to his disciples, To Timothy two, To Titus one, To Philemon one. The epistle which is called the Epistle to the Hebrews is not considered his, on account of its difference from the others in style and language, but it is reckoned, either according to Tertullian to be the work of Barnabas, or according to others, to be by Luke the Evangelist or Clement afterwards bishop of the church at Rome, who, they say, arranged and adorned the ideas of Paul in his own language, though to be sure, since Paul was writing to Hebrews and was indisrepute among them he may have omittedhis name from the salvation on this account.He being a Hebrew wrote Hebrew, that ishis own tongue and most fluently while the things which were eloquently written in Hebrew were more eloquently turned into Greek[fn-71-P7107_1829206:43-nf] and this is the reason why it seems todiffer from other epistles of Paul.

Remember then, that Jechonias, rejected without any fault of his, ceased to reign, and passed over unto the Gentiles, when the carrying away unto Babylon took place. Now observe the figure hereby manifested beforehand, of things to come in the Lord Jesus Christ. For the Jews would not that our Lord Jesus Christ should reign over them, yet found they no fault in Him. He was rejected in His own person, and in that of His servants also, and so they passed over unto the Gentiles as into Babylon in a figure. For this also did Jeremiah prophesy, that the Lord commanded them to go into Babylon: and whatever other prophets told the people not to go into Babylon, them he reproved as false prophets.[fn-29-P2944_1302934:37-nf] Let those who read the Scriptures, remember this as we do; and let those who do not, give us credit. Jeremiah then on the part of God threatened those who would not go into Babylon, whereas to them who should go he promised rest there, and a sort of happiness in the cultivation of their vines, and planting of their gardens, and the abundance of their fruits. How then does the people of Israel, not now in figure but in verity, pass over unto Babylon? Whence came the Apostles? Were they not of the nation of the Jews? Whence came Paul himself?for he saith, \"I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.\"[fn-29-P2945_1303587:38-nf] Many of the Jews then believed in the Lord; from them were the Apostles chosen; of them were the more than five hundred brethren, to whom it was vouchsafed[fn-29-P2946_1303760:39-nf] to see the Lord after His resurrection;[fn-29-P2947_1303816:40-nf] of them were the hundred and twenty in the house,[fn-29-P2948_1303885:41-nf] when the Holy Ghost came down. But what saith the Apostle in the Acts of the Apostles, when the Jews refused the word of truth? \"We were sent unto you, but seeing ye have rejected the word of God, lo! we turn unto the Gentiles.\"[fn-29-P2949_1304131:42-nf] The true passing over then into Babylon, which was then prefigured in the time of Jeremiah, took place in the spiritual dispensation of the time of the Lord's Incarnation. But what saith Jeremiah of these Babylonians, to those who were passing over to them? \"For in their peace shall be your peace.\"[fn-29-P2950_1304451:43-nf] When Israel then passed over also into Babylon by Christ and the Apostles, that is, when the Gospel came unto the Gentiles, what saith the Apostle, as though by the mouth of Jeremiah of old? \"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men. For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.\"[fn-29-P2951_1304904:44-nf] For they were not yet Christian kings, yet he prayed for them. Israel then praying in Babylon hath been heard; the prayers of the Church have been heard, and the kings have become Christian, and you see now fulfilled what was then spoken in figure; \"In their peace shall be your peace,\" for they have received the peace of Christ, and have left off to persecute Christians, that now in the secure quiet of peace, the Churches might be built up, and peoples planted in the garden[fn-29-P2952_1305405:45-nf] of God, and that all nations might bring forth fruit in faith, and hope, and love, which is in Christ.","title":"Sermon I.

Now, in the generations which Matthew enumerates, the predominant[fn-30-P3041_1344897:116-nf] number is forty.

Now this number signifies the life wherein we labour in this world, as long as we are absent from the Lord, during which the temporal dispensation of the preaching of the truth is necessary. For the number ten, by which the perfection of blessedness is signified, multiplied four times, because of the fourfold divisions of the seasons, and the fourfold divisions of the world, will make the number forty.[fn-30-P3044_1345756:119-nf] Wherefore Moses and Elias, and the Mediator Himself, our Lord Jesus Christ, fasted forty days, because in the time of this life, continence from the enticements of the body is necessary.

Then they say: If Moses is believed on account of his word and his works, and has no need of any witnesses to announce him beforehand, and if the prophets were received, every one of them, by these people, as messengers from God, how should not one who is much greater than Moses and the prophets accomplish His mission and benefit the human race, without prophets to bear witness about Him? They regard it as superfluous that He should have been foretold by the prophets, since the prophets were concerned, as these opponents would say, that those who believed in Christ should not receive Him as a new God, and therefore did what they could to bring them to that same God whom Moses and the prophets taught before Jesus. To this we must say that as there are many causes which may lead men to believe, since men who are not moved by one argument may be by another, so God is able to provide for men a number of occasions, any of which may cause their minds to open to the truth that God, who is over all, has taken on Himself human nature. It is manifest to all, how some are brought by the prophetic writings to the admiration of Christ. They are astounded at the voices of so many prophets before Him, which establish the place of His birth, the country of His upbringing, the power of His teaching, His working of wonderful works, and His human passion brought to a close by His resurrection. We must notice, too, that Christ's stupendous acts of power were able to bring to the faith those of Christ's own time, but that they lost their demonstrative force with the lapse of years and began to be regarded as mythical. Greater evidential value than that of the miracles then performed attaches to the comparison which we now make between these miracles and the prophecy of them; this makes it impossible for the student to cast any doubt on the former. The prophetic testimonies do not declare merely the advent of the Messiah; it is by no means the case that they teach this and nothing else. They teach a great deal of theology. The relation of the Father to the Son and of the Son to the Father may be learned not less from what the prophets announce about Christ, than from the Apostles narrating the splendours of the Son of God. A parallel case, which we may venture to adduce, is that of the martyrs, who were honoured by the witness they bore Him, and by no means conferred any favour on Him by their witnessing for the Son of God. And how is it if, as many of Christ's true disciples were honoured by having thus to witness for Him, so the prophets received from God as their special gift that of understanding about Christ and announcing Him before, and that they taught not only those living after Christ's advent how they should regard the Son of God, but those also who lived in the generations before Him? As he who in these times does not know the Son has not the Father either,[fn-66-P6610_1148110:104-nf] so also we are to understand it was in these earlier times. Hence \"Abraham rejoiced to see the day of Christ, and he saw it and was glad.\"[fn-66-P6611_1148271:105-nf] He, therefore, who declares that they are not to testify about Christ is seeking to deprive the chorus of the prophets of the greatest gift they have; for what office of equal importance would be left to prophecy, inspired as it is by the Holy Spirit, if all connection with the economy of our Lord and Master were taken away from it? For as these have their faith well ordered who approach the God of the universe through Mediator and High-Priest and Paraclete, and as his religion is a halting one who does not go in through the door to the Father, so also in the case of men of old time. Their religion was sanctified and made acceptable to God by their knowledge and faith and expectation of Christ. For we have observed that God declares Himself to be a witness and exhorts them all to declare the same about Christ, and to be imitators of Him, bearing witness of Him to all who require it. For he says,[fn-66-P6612_1149202:106-nf] \"Be witnesses for Me, and I am witness, saith the Lord God, and My servant whom I have chosen.\" Now every one who bears witness to the truth, whether he support it by words or deeds, or in whatever way, may properly be called a witness (martyr); but it has come to be the custom of the brotherhood, since they are struck with admiration of those who have contended to the death for truth and valour, to keep the name of martyr more properly for those who have borne witness to the mystery of godliness by shedding their blood for it. The Saviour gives the name of martyr to every one who bears witness to the truth He declares; thus at the Ascension He says to His disciples:[fn-66-P6613_1149901:107-nf] \"You shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judaea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.\" The leper who was cleansed[fn-66-P6614_1150059:108-nf] had still to bring the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony to those who did not believe in the Christ. In the same way the martyrs bear witness for a testimony to the unbelieving, and so do all the saints whose deeds shine before men. They spend their life rejoicing in the cross of Christ and bearing witness to the true light.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We must after all this turn our attention to those scriptures also which forbid our belief in such a resurrection as is held by your Animalists (for I will not call them Spiritualists),[fn-98-P9874_2728553:129-nf] that it is either to be assumed as taking place now, as soon as men come to the knowledge of the truth, or else that it is accomplished immediately after their departure from this life.

For after He had declared that \"Jerusalem was to be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles should be fulfilled,\"[fn-98-P9876_2730138:131-nf] -meaning, of course, those which were to be chosen of God, and gathered in with the remnant of Israel-He then goes on to proclaim, against this world and dispensation (even as Joel had done, and Daniel, and all the prophets with one consent[fn-98-P9877_2730400:132-nf] ), that \"there should be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars, distress of nations with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.\"[fn-98-P9878_2730691:133-nf] \"For,\" says He, \"the powers of heaven shall be shaken; and then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.\"[fn-98-P9879_2730978:134-nf] He spake of its \"drawing nigh,\" not of its being present already; and of \"those things beginning to come to pass,\" not of their having happened: because when they have come to pass, then our redemption shall be at hand, which is said to be approaching up to that time, raising and exciting our minds to what is then the proximate harvest of our hope. He immediately annexes a parable of this in \"the trees which are tenderly sprouting into a flower-stalk, and then developing the flower, which is the precursor of the fruit.\"[fn-98-P9880_2731524:135-nf] \"So likewise ye,\" (He adds), \"when ye shall see all these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand.\"[fn-98-P9881_2731696:136-nf] \"Watch ye, therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all those things, and to stand before the Son of man; \"[fn-98-P9882_2731870:137-nf] that is, no doubt, at the resurrection, after all these things have been previously transacted. Therefore, although there is a sprouting in the acknowledgment of all this mystery, yet it is only in the actual presence of the Lord that the flower is developed and the fruit borne. Who is it then, that has aroused the Lord, now at God's right hand so unseasonably and with such severity \"shake terribly\" (as Isaiah[fn-98-P9883_2732305:138-nf] expresses it (\"that earth,\" which, I suppose, is as yet unshattered?

For as \"He has given to us the earnest of the Spirit, \"[fn-102-P10215_2850512:383-nf] so has He received from us the earnest of the flesh, and has carried it with Him into heaven as a pledge of that complete entirety which is one day to be restored to it. Be not disquieted, O flesh and blood, with any care; in Christ you have acquired both heaven and the kingdom of God. Otherwise, if they say that you are not in Christ, let them also say that Christ is not in heaven, since they have denied you heaven. Likewise \"neither shall corruption,\" says he, \"inherit incorruption.[fn-102-P10216_2851022:384-nf] This he says, not that you may take flesh and blood to be corruption, for they are themselves rather the subjects of corruption,-I mean through death, since death does not so much corrupt, as actually consume, our flesh and blood. But inasmuch as he had plainly said that the works of the flesh and blood could not obtain the kingdom of God, with the view of stating this with accumulated stress, he deprived corruption itself-that is, death, which profits so largely by the works of the flesh and blood-from all inheritance of incorruption. For a little afterwards, he has described what is, as it were, the death of death itself: \"Death,\" says he, \"is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin \"-here is the corruption; \"and the strength of sin is the law\"[fn-102-P10217_2851872:385-nf] -that other law, no doubt, which he has described \"in his members as warring against the law of his mind,\"[fn-102-P10218_2852004:386-nf] -meaning, of course, the actual power of sinning against his will. Now he says in a previous passage (of our Epistle to the Corinthians), that \"the last enemy to be destroyed is death.\"[fn-102-P10219_2852211:387-nf] In this way, then, it is that corruption shall not inherit incorruption; in other words, death shall not continue. When and how shall it cease? In that \"moment, that twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, when the dead shall rise incorruptible.\"[fn-102-P10220_2852480:388-nf] But what are these, if not they who were corruptible before-that is, our bodies; in other words, our flesh and blood? And we undergo the change. But in what condition, if not in that wherein we shall be found? \"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-102-P10221_2852796:389-nf] What mortal is this but the flesh? what corruptible but the blood. Moreover, that you may not suppose the apostle to have any other meaning, in his care to teach you, and that you may understand him seriously to apply his statement to the flesh, when he says \"this corruptible\" and \"this mortal,\" he utters the words while touching the surface of his own body.[fn-102-P10222_2853174:390-nf] He certainly could not have pronounced these phrases except in reference to an object which was palpable and apparent. The expression indicates a bodily exhibition. Moreover, a corruptible body is one thing, and corruption is another; so a mortal body is one thing, and mortality is another. For that which suffers is one thing, and that which causes it to suffer is another. Consequently, those things which are subject to corruption and mortality, even the flesh and blood, must needs also be susceptible of incorruption and immortality.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"ANF-03","text":"However, if you persist in pushing your views further, I shall find means of answering you with greater stringency, and of meeting you with the exclamation of the Lord Himself, so as to challenge you with the question, What is your inquiry and reasoning about that?

Finally, also, at the time of the flood, when all flesh had corrupter their way before God, it is recorded that God spoke thus, as of undeserving men and sinners: \"My Spirit shall not abide with those men for ever, because they are flesh.\"[fn-63-P6361_1168520:80-nf] By which, it is clearly shown that the Spirit of God is taken away from all who are unworthy. In the Psalms also it is written: \"Thou wilt take away their spirit, and they will die, and return to their earth. Thou wilt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and Thou wilt renew the face of the earth; \"[fn-63-P6362_1168851:81-nf] which is manifestly intended of the Holy Spirit, who, after sinners and unworthy persons have been taken away and destroyed, creates for Himself a new people, and renews the face of the earth, when, laying aside, through the grace of the Spirit, the old map with his deeds, they begin to walk in newness of life. And therefore the expression is competently applied to the Holy Spirit, because He will take up His dwelling, not in all men, nor in those who are flesh, but in those whose land[fn-63-P6363_1169364:82-nf] has been renewed. Lastly, for this reason was the grace and revelation of the Holy Spirit bestowed by the imposition of the apostles' hands after baptism. Our Saviour also, after the resurrection, when old things had already passed away, and all things had become new, Himself a new man, and the first-born from the dead, His apostles also being renewed by faith in His resurrection, says, \"Receive the Holy Spirit; \"[fn-63-P6364_1169794:83-nf] This is doubtless what the Lord the Saviour meant to convey in the Gospel, when He said that new wine cannot be put into old bottles, but commanded that the bottles should be made new, i.e., that men should walk in newness of life, that they might receive the new wine, i.e., the newness of grace of the Holy Spirit. In this manner, then, is the working of the power of God the Father and of the Son extended without distinction to every creature; but a share in the Holy Spirit we find possessed only by the saints. And therefore it is said, \"No man can say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-63-P6365_1170415:84-nf] And on one occasion, scarcely even the apostles themselves are deemed worthy to hear the words, \"Ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you.\"[fn-63-P6366_1170595:85-nf] For this reason, also, I think it follows that he who has committed a sin against the Son of man is deserving of forgiveness; because if he who is a participator of the word or reason of God cease to live agreeably to reason, he seems to have fallen into a state of ignorance or folly, and therefore to deserve forgiveness; whereas he who has been deemed worthy to have a portion of the Holy Spirit, and who has relapsed, is, by this very act and work, said to be guilty of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Let no one indeed suppose that we, from having said that the Holy Spirit is conferred upon the saints alone, but that the benefits or operations of the Father and of the Son extend to good and bad, to just and unjust, by so doing give a preference to the Holy Spirit over the Father and the Son, or assert that His dignity is greater, which certainly would be a very illogical conclusion. For it is the peculiarity of His grace and operations that we have been describing. Moreover, nothing in the Trinity can be called greater or less, since the fountain of divinity alone contains all things by His word and reason, and by the Spirit of His mouth sanctifies all things which are worthy of sanctification, as it is written in the Psalm: \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens strengthened, and all their power by the Spirit of His mouth.\"[fn-63-P6367_1171964:86-nf] There is also a special working of God the Father, besides that by which He bestowed upon all things the gift of natural life. There is also a special ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ to those upon whom he confers by nature the gift of reason, by means of which they are enabled to be rightly what they are. There is also another grace of the Holy Spirit, which is bestowed upon the deserving, through the ministry of Christ and the working of the Father, in proportion to the merits of those who are rendered capable of receiving it. This is most clearly pointed out by the Apostle Paul, when demonstrating that the power of the Trinity is one and the same, in the words, \"There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit; there are diversities of administrations, but the same Lord; and there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit: withal.\"[fn-63-P6368_1172939:87-nf] From which it most clearly follows that there is no difference in the Trinity, but that which is called the gift of the Spirit is made known through the Son, and operated by God the Father. \"But all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every one severally as He will.\"[fn-63-P6369_1173254:88-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_49_on_baptism_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The Passover affords a more than usually solemn day for baptism; when, withal, the Lord's passion, in which we are baptized, was completed.

First then in order to our receiving eternal life which shall be given at the last, there comes to us a gift from God's goodness from the beginning of our faith, to wit, the remission of sins. For while they remain, there remains in some sort enmity against God, and alienation from Him, which comes from what is evil in us; since Scripture does not speak falsely, which says, \"Your sins separate between you and God.\"[fn-39-P3945_1705645:59-nf] He does not then bestow on us His good things, except He take away our evil things. And the former increase in proportion as the latter are diminished; nor will the one be perfected, till the other be brought to an end. But now that the Lord Jesus forgives sins by the Holy Ghost, just as by the Holy Ghost He casts out devils, may be understood by this, that after His Resurrection from the dead, when He had said to His disciples, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost,\" He immediately subjoined, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-39-P3946_1706270:60-nf] For that regeneration also, in which there is a remission of all past sins, is wrought by the Holy Ghost, as the Lord saith, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-39-P3947_1706509:61-nf] But it is one thing to be born of the Spirit, another to be nourished by the Spirit; just as it is one thing to be born of the flesh, which happens when the mother is delivered of her child; another to be nourished by the flesh, which happens when she gives suck to her infant, who turns himself that he may drink with pleasure thither whence he was born, to have life; that he may receive the support of life from thence, whence he received the beginning of his birth. We must believe then that the first blessing of God's goodness in the Holy Ghost is the remission of sins. Whence the preaching of John the Baptist, who was sent as the forerunner of the Lord, also begins with it. For thus it is written, \"In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3948_1707369:62-nf] Hence too the beginning of our Lord's preaching, as we read, \"From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3949_1707549:63-nf] Now John, amongst the other things which he spake tothose who came to be baptized by him, said, \"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\"[fn-39-P3950_1707856:64-nf] The Lord also said, \"John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence,\"[fn-39-P3951_1707996:65-nf] even at Pentecost. Now as to John's expression, \"with fire,\" though tribulation also might be understood, which believers were to suffer for the name of Christ; yet may we reasonably think that the same Holy Spirit is signified also under the name of \"fire.\"[fn-39-P3952_1708271:66-nf] Wherefore when He came it is said, \"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.\"[fn-39-P3953_1708468:67-nf] Hence also the Lord Himself said, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-39-P3954_1708558:68-nf] Hence also the Apostle saith, \"Fervent in the spirit;\"[fn-39-P3955_1708632:69-nf] for from Him comes the fervour of love. \"For it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\"[fn-39-P3956_1708772:70-nf] And the contrary to this fervour is what the Lord said, \"The love of many shall wax cold.\"[fn-39-P3957_1708879:71-nf] Now perfect love is the perfect gift of the Holy Spirit. But the first \"gift\" is that which is concerned with the remission of sins; by which blessing \"we are delivered from the power of darkness;\"[fn-39-P3958_1709098:72-nf] and the prince of this world,[fn-39-P3959_1709145:73-nf] who worketh in the children of disobedience\"[fn-39-P3960_1709209:74-nf] by no other power than the fellowship and the bond of sin, is \"cast out\" by our faith.

Our Lord Jesus Christ, then, ascending into heaven on the fortieth day, did for this reason commend to us His Body where it would continue to lie, because He saw that many would honor Him for that He is ascended into heaven: and saw that their honoring Him is useless if they trample upon His members here on earth. And lest any one should err, and, while he adored the Head in heaven should trample upon the feet on earth, He told us where would be His members. For being about to ascend, He spake His last words on earth: after those same words He spake no more on earth. The Head about to ascend into heaven commended to us His members on earth and departed. Thenceforth thou findest not Christ speaking on earth; thou findest Him speaking, but from heaven. And even from heaven, why? Because His members on earth were trodden upon. For to the persecutor Saul He said from on high, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\"[fn-46-P4676_2516132:47-nf] I am ascended into heaven, but still I lie on earth: here I sit at the right hand of the Father, but there I yet hunger, thirst, and am a stranger.

For I ascend, because I am the Head: my Body lies yet beneath. Where lies? Throughout the whole earth. Beware thou strike not, beware thou hurt not, beware thou trample not: these be the last words of Christ about to go into heaven. Look at a sick man languishing on his bed, lying in his house, and worn out with sickness, at death's door, his soul as it were even now between his teeth: who, anxious, it may be, about something that is dear to him, which he greatly loves, and it comes into his mind, calls his heirs, and says to them, I pray you, do this. He, as it were, detains his soul by a violent effort, that it may not depart ere those words be made sure. When he has dictated those last words, he breathes out his soul, he is borne a corpse to the sepulchre. His heirs, how do they remember the last words of the dying man? How, if one should stand up and say to them, Do it not: what would they say? \"What shall I not do that which my father, in the act of breathing out his soul, commanded me with his last breath, the last word of his that sounded in my ears when my father was departing this life? Whatever other words of his I may not regard, his last have a stronger hold upon me: since which I never saw him more, never more heard speech of his. Brethren, think with Christian hearts; if to the heirs of a man, his words spoken when about to go to the tomb are so sweet, so grateful, so weighty, what must we account of the last words of Christ, spoken not when about to go back to the tomb, but to ascend into heaven! As for the man who lived and is dead, his soul is hurried off to other places, his body is laid in the earth, and whether these words of his be done or not, makes no difference to him: he has now something else to do, or something else to suffer: either in Abraham's bosom he rejoices, or in eternal fire he longs for a drop of water, while his corpse lies there senseless in the sepulchre; and yet the last words of the dying man are kept. What have those to look for, who keep not the last words of Him that sitteth in heaven, who seeth from on high whether they be despised or not despised?

It seems that what follows has some reference to this: \"If you think that a Divine Spirit has descended from God to announce divine things to men, it is doubtless this same Spirit that reveals these truths; and it was under the same influence that men of old made known many important truths.\" But he does not know how great is the difference between those things and the clear and certain teaching of those who say to us, \"Thine incorruptible spirit is in all things, wherefore God chasteneth them by little and little that offend; \"[fn-111-P11127_3006707:130-nf] and of those who, among their other instructions, teach us that words, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost,\"[fn-111-P11128_3006831:131-nf] refer to a degree of spiritual influence higher than that in the passage, \"Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.\"[fn-111-P11129_3006989:132-nf] But it is a difficult matter, even after much careful consideration, to perceive the difference between those who have received a knowledge of the truth and a notion of God at different intervals and for short periods of time, and those who are more fully inspired by God, who have constant communion with Him, and are always led by His Spirit. Had Celsus set himself to understand this, he would not have reproached as with ignorance, or forbidden us to characterize as \"blind\" those who believe that religion shows itself in such products of man's mechanical art as images. For every one who sees with eyes of his soul serves the Divine Being in no other way than in that which leads him ever to have regard to the Creator of all, to address his prayers to Him alone, and to do all things as in the sight of God, who sees us altogether, even to our thoughts. Our earnest desire then is both to see for ourselves, and to be leaders of the blind, to bring them to the Word of God, that He may take away from their minds the blindness of ignorance.

To such, then, as approach to a discussion of saving and modern, that is, of spiritual and evangelical baptism, there occurs first of all the announcement universally well known, made and begun by John the Baptist, who, somewhat departing from the law, that is, from the most ancient baptism of Moses, and preparing the way of the new and true grace, both preoccupied the ears of the Jews gradually by the baptism of water and of repentance which for the time he practised, and took possession of them with the announcement of a spiritual baptism that was to come, exhorting them, and saying, \"He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire; \"[fn-107-P10727_3379862:5-nf] and for this reason we also ought to make a beginning of this discourse from this point. For in the Acts of the Apostles, the Lord after His resurrection, confirming this same word of John, \"commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for that promise of the Father which, saith He, ye have heard from me; for John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.\"[fn-107-P10728_3380313:6-nf] And Peter also related these same words of the Lord, when he gave an account of himself to the apostles, saying: \"And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell upon them as on us at the beginning; and I remembered the word of the Lord, how that He said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. If, therefore, He gave them a like gift as to us, who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand the Lord? \"[fn-107-P10729_3380796:7-nf] And again: \"Men and brethren, ye know how from ancient days God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the Gospel, and believe. And God, who knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as He did unto us.\"[fn-107-P10730_3381086:8-nf] And on this account we ought to consider what is the force and power of this saying. For the Lord says to them who would have to be subsequently baptized because they should believe, that they must be baptized not in like manner as by Him in water, unto repentance, but in the Holy Ghost. And of this announcement, as assuredly none of us can doubt it, it is plain on what principle men were baptized in the Holy Spirit. For it was peculiarly in the Holy Spirit Himself alone that they who believed were baptized. For John distinguished, and said that he indeed baptized in water, but that one should come who would baptize in the Holy Ghost, by the grace and power of God; and they are so by the Spirit's bestowal and operation of hidden results. Moreover, they are so no less in the baptism of the Spirit and of water. They are so, besides, also in the baptism of every one in his own proper blood[fn-107-P10731_3382004:9-nf] Even as the Holy Scriptures declare to us, from which we shall adduce evident proofs throughout each individual instance of those things which we shall narrate.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_148_a_treatise_on_re_baptism_by_an_anonymous_writer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-05","text":"19.

Lastly, when you wished to prove that the Holy Spirit was given by Christ, and had brought forward as a proof from the gospel, that Jesus on rising from the dead breathed into the face of His disciples, saying, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost;\"[fn-49-P4971_2438469:113-nf] and when you wished to prove that that last fire which was named in connection with baptism was found in the tongues of fire which were displayed on the coming of the Holy Ghost, how came it into your head to say, \"And the Comforter Himself came upon the apostles as a fire burning with rustling flames,\" as though there were one Holy Spirit whom He gave by breathing on the face of His disciples, and another who, after His ascension, came on the apostles? Are we to suppose, therefore, that there are two Holy Spirits? Who will be found so utterly mad as to assert this? Christ therefore Himself gave the same Holy Spirit, whether by breathing on the face of the disciples, or by sending Him down from heaven on the day of Pentecost, with undoubted commendation of His holy sacrament. Accordingly it was not that Christ gave the Holy Spirit, and the Comforter gave the fire, that the saying might be fulfilled, \"With the Holy Spirit, and with fire;\" but the same Christ Himself gave the Holy Spirit in both cases, making it manifest while He was yet on earth by His breathing, and when He was ascended into heaven by the tongues of flame. For that you may know that the words of John, \"He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost,\" were not fulfilled at the time when He breathed on His disciples face, so that they should require to be baptized, when the Comforter should come, not with the Spirit any longer, but with fire, I would have you remember the most outspoken words of Scripture, and see what the Lord Himself said to them when He ascended into heaven: \"John truly baptized you with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, whom ye shall receive not many days hence at Pentecost.[fn-49-P4972_2440192:114-nf] What could be plainer than this testimony? But according to your interpretation, what He should have said was this: John verily baptized you with water; but ye were baptized with the Holy Spirit when I breathed on your faces; and next in due order shall ye be baptized with fire, which ye shall receive not many days hence;-in order that by this means the three stages should be completed, in which you say that the one baptism was consecrated. And so it proves to be the case that you are still ignorant of the meaning of the words, \"He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire;\" and you are rash enough to be williing to teach what you do not know yourselves.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"222","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"82. Augustin answered: In these few words of yours two errors are involved; and one of them, indeed, has no great bearing on the question which is being discussed between us, but yet it helps to convict you of want of skill. For the Holy Spirit came upon a hundred and twenty men, without the laying on of any person's hands, and again upon Cornelius the centurion and those who were with him, even before they were baptized.[fn-49-P4988_2447540:118-nf] But the second error in these words of yours entirely overthrows your whole case. For you say that the water of a pure conscience must necessarily precede to give new birth, before the Holy Spirit can follow on it. Accordingly, either all the water consecrated in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is water of a pure conscience, not for the merits of those by whom it is administered, or by whom it is received, but in virtue of the stainless merits of Him who instituted this baptism; or else if only a pure conscience on the part both of the ministrant and the recipient can produce the water of a pure conscience, what do you make of those whom you find to have been baptized by men who bore a conscience stained with as yet undiscovered guilt, especially if there exist among the said baptized persons any one that should confess that he at the time when he was baptized had a bad conscience, in that he might possbily have desired to use that opportunity for the accomplishment of some sinful act? When, therefore, it shall be made clear to you that neither the man who administered baptism, nor the man who received it, had a pure conscience, will you give your judgment that he ought to be baptized afresh? You will assuredly neither say nor do anything of the sort. The purity therefore of baptism is entirely unconnected with the purity or impurity of the conscience either of the giver or the recipient. Will you therefore dare to say that the deceiver, or the robber, or the oppressor of the fatherless and widows, or the sunderer of marriages, or the betrayer, the seller, the divider of the patrimony of other men,[fn-49-P4989_2449230:119-nf] was a man of pure conscience? Or will you further dare to say that those were men of pure conscience, whom it is hard to imagine wanting in such times, men who made interest with the man I have described, that they might be baptized, not for the sake of Christ, nor for the sake of eternal life, but to conciliate earthly friendships, and to satisfy earthly desires? Further, if you do not venture to say that these were men of pure conscience, then if you find any of their number who have been baptized, give to them the water of a pure conscience, which they as yet have not received; and if you will not do this, then leave off casting in our teeth a matter which you do not understand, lest you should be forced to answer in reply to us about a matter which you know full well.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":39,"source_paragraph":"234","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"91.

In the first place, because you did the deed, and they suffered them; and secondly, because, according to the rule of this righteousness, you are found to be inferior. For they were driven from the ancient palaces by Catholic emperors acting through judges, while you are not even driven forth by the mandates of the emperors themselves from the basilicas of unity.

We are not saying, If you have not placed confidence in a man and in a prince, when you said to a pagan and apostate emperor, that \"in him justice only found a place,\" seeing that the party of Donatus has universally employed the prayers and the rescript in which those words occur, as is proved by the records of the audience; much less ought we to be accused by you, as though we put our confidence in any man or prince, if without any blasphemous flattery we obtained any request from Constantine or from the other Christian emperors; or if they themselves, without our asking for it, but remembering the account which they shall render to the Lord, under whose words they tremble when they hear what you yourself have quoted, \"Be wise now therefore, O ye kings,\" etc., and many other sayings of the sort, make any ordinance of their own accord in support of the unity of the Catholic Church. But I say nothing about Constantine. It is Christ and Julian that we contrast before you; nay, more than this, it is God and man, the Son of God and the son of hell, the Saviour of our souls and the destroyer of his own. Why do you maintain the rescript of Julian in the occupation of the basilicas, and yet not maintain the gospel of Christ in embracing the peace of the Church? We too cry out, \"Let all things that have been done amiss be restored to their ancient condition.\" The gospel of Christ is of greater antiquity than the rescript of Julian; the unity of Christ is of greater antiquity than the party of Donatus; the prayers of the Church to the Lord on behalf of the unity of the Church are of greater antiquity than the prayers of Rogatianus, and Pontius, and Cassianus, to Julian on behalf of the party of Donatus. Are proceedings wrongly taken when kings forbid division? and are they not wrongly taken when bishops divide unity? Is that wrong action when kings minister to the witness of Christ in defence of the Church? and is it not wrong action when bishops contradict the witness of Christ in order to deny the Church?

For where my purpose is not interfered with by any mistake which you make, or any false impression which you convey in quoting from the Scriptures, I do not concern myself about the matter. It is not then written, \"Whosoever shall lose his substance,\" but \"Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake.\"[fn-54-P5445_2635736:305-nf] And the passage about substance is not, \"Whosoever shall lose,\" but \"Every one that hath forsaken;\"[fn-54-P5446_2635858:306-nf] and that not only with reference to substance of money, but many other things besides. But you meanwhile have not lost your substance; but whether you have forsaken it, in that you so boast of poverty, I cannot say. And if by any chance my colleague Fortunatus may know this, being in the same city with you, he never told me, because I had never asked him. However, even if you had done this, you have yet yourself quoted the testimony of the apostle against yourself in this very epistle which you have written: \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-54-P5447_2636530:307-nf] For if you had charity, you would not bring charges against the whole world, which knows nothing of you, and of which you know no more,-no, not even such charges as are rounded on the proved offenses of the Africans. If you had charity, you would not picture to yourself a false unity in your calumnies, but you would learn to recognize the unity that is most clearly set forth in the words of the Lord: \"even in the whole earth.\"[fn-54-P5448_2636984:308-nf] But if you did not do this, why do you boast as though you had done it?

You perhaps are not aware of it, and therefore shout out in security, \"We stand in fear of riches.\" And hence I am surprised that that cry of yours has been allowed to pass Crispinus, so as to reach us. For between Constantina, where you are, and Hippo, where I am, lies Calama, where he is, nearer indeed to our side, but still between us. I wonder, therefore, how it was that he did not first intercept this cry, and strike it back so that it should not reach to our ears; and that he did not, in opposition to you, recite in much more copious phrase a eulogy on riches.

And as if one that desired to kidnap the children of others during the absence of their parents, should personate their appearance, and so putting a cheat on the affections of the offspring, should carry them far away and destroy them; in like manner this evil and wily spirit the devil, having no confidence in himself, and knowing the love which men bear to the truth, personates its appearance, and so spreads his own poison among those that follow after him.","title":"To the Bishops of Egypt","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_40_to_the_bishops_of_egypt","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"`But,' say they, `we are strong, and are able to defend our heresy by our many devices.'

For this is the \"going out\" of the Householder, the making himself known; forasmuch as he that is in the house is hidden, he is not seen by those who are without; but when he \"goeth out\" of the house, he is seen by those without. So Christ is in secret, as long as He is not known and acknowledged; but when He is acknowledged, He hath gone out to hire labourers. For now He hath come forth from a hidden place, to be known of men: everywhere Christ is known, Christ is preached; all places whatsoever under the heaven proclaim aloud the glory of Christ. He was in a manner the object of derision and contempt among the Jews, He appeared in low estate and was despised. For He hid His Majesty, and manifested His infirmity. That in Him which was manifested was despised, and that which was hidden was not known. \"For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\"[fn-46-P4641_1984115:12-nf] But is He still to be despised now that He sitteth in heaven, if He were despised when He was hanging on the tree?

For without this that theoretical purity of which we have spoken cannot be obtained, which those only,-who are perfected not by the words of others who teach them, but by the excellence of their own actions, can after much expenditure of effort and toil attain as a reward for it. For as they gain their knowledge not from meditation on the law but from the fruit of their labour, they sing with the Psalmist: \"From Thy commandments I have understanding;\" and having overcome all their passions, they say with confidence: \"I will sing, and I will understand in the undefiled way.\"[fn-54-P5496_1967282:22-nf] For he who is striving in an undefiled way in the course of a pure heart, as he sings the Psalm, understands the words which are chanted. And therefore if you would prepare in your heart a holy tabernacle of spiritual knowledge, purge yourselves from the stain of all sins, and rid yourselves of the cares of this world. For it is an impossibility for the soul which is taken up even to a small extent with worldly troubles, to gain the gift of knowledge or to become an author of spiritual interpretation, and diligent in reading holy things. Be careful therefore in the first place, and especially you, John, as your more youthful age requires you the rather to be careful about what I am going to say-that you may enjoin absolute silence on your lips, in order that your zeal for reading and the efforts of your purpose may not be destroyed by vain pride. For this is the first practical step towards learning, to receive the regulations and opinions of all the Elders with an earnest heart, and with lips that are dumb; and diligently to lay them up in your heart, and endeavour rather to perform than to teach them. For from teaching, the dangerous arrogance of vainglory, but from performing, the fruit of spiritual knowledge will flourish. And so you should never venture to say anything in the conference of the Elders unless some ignorance that might be injurious, or a matter which it is important to know leads you to ask a question; as some who are puffed up with vainglory, pretend that they ask, in order really to show off the knowledge which they perfectly possess. For it is an impossibility for one, who takes to the pursuit of reading with the purpose of gaining the praise of men, to be rewarded with the gift of true knowledge. For one who is bound by the chain of this passion, is sure to be also in bondage to other faults, and especially to that of pride: and so if he is baffled by his enCounter with practical and ethical knowledge, he will certainly not attain that spiritual knowledge which springs from it. Be then in all things \"swift to hear, but slow to speak,\"[fn-54-P5497_1969421:23-nf] lest there come upon you that which is noted by Solomon: \"If thou seest a man who is quick to speak, know that there is more hope of a fool than of him;[fn-54-P5498_1969595:24-nf] and do not presume to teach any one in words what you have not already performed in deed. For our Lord taught us by His own example that we ought to keep to this order, as of Him it is said: \"what Jesus began to do and to teach.\"[fn-54-P5499_1969853:25-nf] Take care then that you do not rush into teaching before doing, and so be reckoned among the number of those of whom the Lord speaks inthe gospel to the disciples: \"What they sayunto you, that observe and do, but not aftertheir words: for they say and do not. But they bind heavy burdens and grievous to beborne, and lay them on men's shoulders; butthey themselves will not move them with oneof their fingers.\"[fn-55-P5500_1970280:26-nf] For if he who shall \"breakone of these commands, and shall teach menso, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven,\"[fn-55-P5501_1970428:27-nf] it follows that one who has dared to despise many and greater commands and to teach men so, shall certainly be considered not least in the kingdom of heaven, but greatest in the punishment of hell. And therefore you must be careful not to be led on to teach by the example of those who have attained some skill in discussion and readiness in speech and because they can discourse on what they please elegantly and fully, are imagined to possess spiritual knowledge, by those who do not know how to distinguish its real force and character. For it is one thing to have a ready tongue and elegant language, and quite another to penetrate into the very heart and marrow of heavenly utterances and to gaze with pure eye of the soul on profound and hidden mysteries; for this can be gained by no learning of man's, nor condition of this world, only by purity of soul, by means of the illumination of the Holy Ghost.","title":"XIV.

By all means there is a sense, a true and strong sense, if somehow we can grasp it, in which \"the Father judgeth not any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son.\" For this is said because none will appear to men in the judgment but the Son. The Father will be hidden, the Son will be manifest. In what will the Son be manifest? In the form in which He ascended. For in the form of God He was hidden with the Father; in the form of a servant, manifest to men. Not therefore \"the Father judgeth any man, but all judgment hath He given to the Son:\" only the manifest judgment, in which manifest judgment the Son will judge, since the same will appear to them that are to be judged. The Scripture shows us more clearly that it is the Son that will appear. On the fortieth day after His resurrection He ascended into heaven, while His disciples were looking on; and they hear the angelic voice: \"Men of Galilee,\" saith it, \"why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same that is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him going into heaven.\"[fn-11-P1102_673918:16-nf] In what manner did they see Him go? In the flesh, which they touched, which they handled. the wounds even of which they proved by touching; in that body in which He went in and out with them for forty days, manifesting Himself to them in truth, not in falsity; not a phantom, or shadow, or ghost, but, as Himself said, not deceiving them, \"Handle and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\"[fn-11-P1103_674352:17-nf] That body is now indeed worthy of a heavenly habitation, not being subject to death, nor mutable by the lapse of ages. It is not as it had grown to that age from infancy, so from the age of manhood declines to old age: He remains as He ascended, to come to those to whom He willed His word to be preached before He comes. Thus will He come in human form, and this form the wicked will see; both they on the right shall see it, and they that are separated to the left shall see it: as it is written, \"They shall look on Him whom they pierced.\"[fn-11-P1104_674916:18-nf] If they shall look on Him whom they pierced, they shall look on that same body which they struck through with the spear; for a spear does not pierce the Word. This body, therefore, will the wicked be able to look on which they were able to wound. God hidden in the body they will not see: after the judgment He will be seen by those who will be on the right hand. This, then, is what He means when He saith, \"The Father judgeth not any man, but all judgment hath He given to the Son,\"-that the Son will come to judgment manifest, apparent to men in human body; saying to those on the right, \"Come, ye blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom;\" and to those on the left, \"Go into everlasting fire, which is prepared for the devil and his angels.\"[fn-11-P1105_675683:19-nf] ","title":"Tractate XXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_60_sermon_xliii_xciii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"8. \"Lo, at midnight there was a cry made.\"[fn-49-P4991_2131599:19-nf] What is, \"at midnight\"?

This was more manifestly proved by the marvellous event which now came to pass. One of these licentious youths ran into the Church, and ventured to sit down upon the throne; and as he sat there the wretched man uttered with a nasal sound some lascivious song. Then rising up he attempted to pull away the throne, and to drag it towards him; he knew not that he was drawing down vengeance upon himself. For as of old the inhabitants of Azotus, when they ventured to touch[fn-50-P5011_1982637:28-nf] the Ark, which it was not lawful for them even to look upon, were immediately destroyed by it, being first grievously tormented by emerods; so this unhappy person who presumed to drag the throne, drew it upon himself, and, as if Divine justice had sent the wood to punish him, he struck it into his own bowels; and instead of carrying out the throne, he brought out by his blow his own entrails; so that the throne took away his life, instead of his taking it away. For, as it is[fn-50-P5012_1983135:29-nf] written of Judas, his bowels gushed out; and he fell down and was carried away, and the day after he died. Another also entered the Church with boughs of trees[fn-50-P5013_1983312:30-nf] and, as in the Gentile manner he waved them in his hands and mocked, he was immediately struck with blindness, so as straightway to lose his sight, and to know no longer where he was; but as he was about to fall, he was taken by the hand and supported by his companions out of the place, and when on the following day he was with difficulty brought to his senses, he knew not either what he had done or suffered in consequence of his audacity.","title":"Part VII.","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_32_tractate_xxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"10. Then said the Lord Jesus: \"Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?\" Therefore, should He have said, \"I have chosen eleven:\" or is a devil also chosen, and among the elect? Persons are wont to be called \"elect\" by way of praise: or was man elected because some great good was done by him, without his will and knowledge? This belongs peculiarly to God; the contrary is characteristic of the wicked. For as wicked men make a bad use of the good works of God; so, on the contrary, God makes a good use of the evil works of wicked men. How good it is that the members of the body are, as they can be disposed only by God, their author and framer! Nevertheless what evil use doth wantonness make of the eyes? What ill use doth falsehood make of the tongue? Does not the false witness first both slay his own soul with his tongue, and then, after he has destroyed himself, endeavor to injure another? He makes an ill use of the tongue, but the tongue is not therefore an evil thing; the tongue is God's work, but iniquity makes an ill use of that good work of God. How do they use their feet who run into crimes? How do murderers employ their hands? And what ill use do wicked men make of those good creatures of God that lie outside of them? With gold they corrupt judgment and oppress the innocent. Bad men make a bad use of the very light; for by evil living they employ even the very light with which they see into the service of their villanies. A bad man, when going to do a bad deed, wishes the light to shine for him, lest he stumble; he who has already stumbled and fallen within; that which he is afraid of in his body has already befallen him in his heart. Hence, to avoid the tediousness of running through them separately, a bad man makes a bad use of all the good creatures of God: a good man, on the contrary, makes a good use of the evil deeds of wicked men. And what is so good as the one God? Since, indeed, the Lord Himself said, \"There is none good, but the one God.\"[fn-13-P1330_843786:11-nf] By how much He is better, then, by so much the better use He makes of our evil deeds. What worse than Judas? Among all that adhered to the Master, among the twelve, to him was committed the common purse; to him was allotted the dispensing for the poor. Unthankful for so great a favor, so great an honor, he took the money, and lost righteousness: being dead, he betrayed life: Him whom he followed as a disciple, he persecuted as an enemy. All this evil was Judas's; but the Lord employed his evil for good. He endured to be betrayed, to redeem us. Behold, Judas's evil was turned to good. How many martyrs has Satan persecuted! If Satan left off persecuting, we should not to-day be celebrating the very glorious crown of Saint Laurence. If then God employs the evil works of the devil himself for good, what the bad man effects, by making a bad use, is to hurt himself, not to contradict the goodness of God. The Master makes use of that man. And if He knew not how to make use of him, the Master contriver would not have permitted him to be. Therefore, He saith, \"One of you is a devil,\" whilst I have chosen you twelve. This saying, \"I have chosen you twelve,\" may be understood in this way, that twelve is a sacred number. For the honor of that number was not taken away because one was lost, for another was chosen into the place of the one that perished.[fn-13-P1331_845166:12-nf] The number remained a sacred number, a number containing twelve: because they were to make known the Trinity throughout the whole world, that is, throughout the four quarters of the world. That is the reason of the three times four. Judas, then only cut himself off, not profaned the number twelve: he abandoned his Teacher, for God appointed a successor to take his place.","title":"Tractate XXVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_66_sermon_xlix_xcix_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"11. Now why I have wished to bring this subject before you, give heed, Dearly Beloved. It was meet that God should first show that He worketh by the ministry of men; but afterwards by Himself, lest men should think, as Simon thought, that it was man's gift, and not God's. Though the disciples themselves knew this well already. For there were one hundred and twenty[fn-52-P5202_2218083:24-nf] men collected together, when without the imposition of any hand the Holy Ghost came upon them. For who had laid hands on them at that time? And yet He came, and filled them first. After that offence of Simon, what did God do? See Him teaching, not by words but by things. That same Philip, who had baptized the men, and the Holy Ghost had not come upon them, unless the Apostles had met together and laid their hands upon them, baptized the officer, that is, the eunuch of queen Candace, who had worshipped in Jerusalem, and returning thence was reading in his chariot Isaiah the Prophet,[fn-52-P5203_2218689:25-nf] and understood it not. Philip being admonished went up to his chariot, explained the Scripture, unfolded the faith, preached Christ.[fn-52-P5204_2218842:26-nf] The eunuch believed on Christ, and said when they came unto a certain water, \"See water, who doth hinder me to be baptized? Philip said to him, Dost thou believe on Jesus Christ? He answered, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. Immediately he went down with him into the water.\"[fn-52-P5205_2219152:27-nf] When the mystery and sacrament of Baptism had been accomplished, that the gift of the Holy Ghost might not be thought to be of men, there was no waiting, as in the other case, for the Apostles to come, but the Holy Ghost[fn-52-P5206_2219398:28-nf] came forthwith.

Therefore He who gave to Paul to know, much rather knew Himself; for since He spoke of the antecedents of the day, He also knew, as I said before, when the Day and when the Hour, and yet though knowing, He says, `No, not the Son knoweth.' Why then said He at that time `I know not,' what He as Lord[fn-69-P6905_2745912:346-nf] , knew? as we may by searching conjecture, for our profit[fn-69-P6906_2745995:347-nf] , as I think at least, did He this; and may He grant to what we are now proposing a true meaning! On both sides did the Saviour secure our advantage; for He has made known what comes before the end, that, as He said Himself, we might not be startled nor scared, when they happen, but from them may expect the end after them. And concerning the day and the hour He was not willing to say according to His divine nature, `I know,' but after the flesh, `I know not,' for the sake of the flesh which was ignorant[fn-69-P6907_2746771:348-nf] , as I have said before; lest they should ask Him further, and then either He should have to pain the disciples by not speaking, or by speaking might act to the prejudice of them and us all. For whatever He does, that altogether He does for our sakes, since also for us `the Word became flesh.' For us therefore He said `No, not the Son knoweth;' and neither was He untrue in thus saying (for He said humanly, as man, `I know not'), nor did He suffer the disciples to force Him to speak, for by saying `I know not' He stopped their inquiries. And so in the Acts of the Apostles it is written, when He went upon the Angels, ascending as man, and carrying up to heaven the flesh which He bore, on the disciples seeing this, and again asking, `When shall the end be, and when wilt Thou be present?' He said to them more clearly, `It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power[fn-69-P6908_2747719:349-nf] .' And He did not then say, `No, not the Son,' as He said before humanly, but, `It is not for you to know.' For now the flesh had risen and put off its mortality and been deified; and no longer did it become Him to answer after the flesh when He was going into the heavens; but henceforth to teach after a divine manner, `It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father hath put in His own power; but ye shall receive Power[fn-69-P6909_2748173:350-nf] .'

If thenwe can show that all that which you\nrefer to the Spirit, is His own, what remains but that we prove that He whom you therefore would have\ntaken to be a man, because as you say everything which He has is another's, is therefore God, because\neverything which He has is His own? And indeed we will prove this not only by discussion and\nargument, but by the voice of Divinity Itself: for nothing testifies of God better than things\ndivine. And because nothing knows itself better than the very glory of God, we believe nothing on the\nsubject of God with greater right than those writings in which God Himself is His own witness. First\nthen, as to this that you say that the Holy Spirit created His humanity; we might take it simply, if\nwe could acknowledge that you had not brought it forward in the interests of unbelief. For neither do\nwe deny that the flesh of the Lord was conceived by the Holy Ghost: but we assert that the body was\nconceived by the co-operation of the Holy Ghost in such a way that we can say that His\nHumanity[fn-75-P7542_2774807:43-nf] was created for Himself by the\nSon of God, as the Holy Spirit Itself says in holy Scripture, testifying that \"Wisdom hath builded\nfor Itself a house.\"[fn-75-P7543_2774977:44-nf] You see then that\nthat which was conceived by the Holy Ghost was built and perfected by the Son of God: not that the\nwork of the Son of God is one thing, and the work of the Holy Ghost another: but that through the\nunity of the Godhead and glory the operation of the Spirit is the building of the Son of God; and the\nbuilding of the Son of God is the co-operation of the Holy Ghost. And so we read not only that the\nHoly Ghost came upon the Virgin, but also that the power of the Most High overshadowed the Virgin;\nthat since Wisdom Itself is the fulness of the Godhead, no one might doubt that when Wisdom built\nItself a house all the fulness of the Godhead was present. But the wretched hardness of your\nblasphemy, while it tries to sever Christ from the Son of God, fails to see that it is entirely\nsevering the nature of the Godhead from Itself. Unless perhaps you believe that the house is\ntherefore built for Him by the Holy Ghost because He Himself was insufficient and incapable of\nbuilding for Himself an house. But it is as absurd as it is wild, to believe that He, whom we believe\nto have created the whole universe of things heavenly and earthly by His will, was unable to build\nfor Himself a body: especially as the power of the Holy Ghost is His power, and the Divinity and\nGlory of the Trinity are so united and inseparable, that we cannot think of anything at all in One\nPerson of the Trinity, which can be separated from the fulness of the Godhead. Therefore when this is\nlaid down and grasped; viz., that according to the faith of holy Scripture, when the Holy Ghost came\nupon (the Virgin) and the power of the Most High overshadowed her, Wisdom builded Itself an house;\nthe rest of the slanders of your blasphemy come to nothing. For neither is it doubtful that He made\nall things by Himself and in Himself, in whose name and faith, the faith even of believers can do\nanything. For neither did He need the aid of another, as neither have they needed it, who have\ntrusted in His power. And so as for your assertions that He was justified by the Spirit, and that the\nSpirit made Him to be feared by the devils, and that His flesh became the temple of the Holy Ghost,\nand that He was taken up by the Spirit into heaven, they are all blasphemous and wild: not because we\nare to believe that in all these things which He Himself did, the unity and cooperation of the Spirit\nwas wanting - since the Godhead is never wanting to Itself, and the [power of the Trinity was ever\npresent in the Saviour's works - but because you will have it that the Holy Ghost gave assistance to\nthe Lord Jesus Christ as if He had been feeble and powerless; and that He granted those things to\nHim, which He was unable to procure for Himself.

And now see how the disciples were terrified at His words. \"The disciples say unto Him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone Thee, and goest Thou thither again? Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? \"What means such. an answer? They said to Him, \"The Jews of late sought to stone Thee, and goest Thou thither again\" to be stoned? And the Lord, \"Are there not twelve hours in the day? if any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world: but if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.\" He spoke indeed of the day, but to our understanding as if it were still the night. Let us call upon the Day to chase away the night, and illuminate our hearts with the light. For what did the Lord mean? As far as I can judge, and as the height and depth of His meaning breaks into light, He wished to argue down their doubting and unbelief. For they wished by their counsel to keep the Lord from death, who had come to die, to save themselves from death. In a similar way also, in another passage, St. Peter, who loved the Lord, but did not yet fully understand the reason of His coming, was afraid of His dying, and so displeased the Life, to wit, the Lord Himself; for when He was intimating to the disciples what He was about to suffer at Jerusalem at the hands of the Jews, Peter made reply among the rest, and said, \"Far be it from Thee, Lord; pity Thyself: this shall not be unto Thee.\" And at once the Lord replied, \"Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.\" And yet a little before, in confessing the Son of God, he had merited commendation: for he heard the words, \"Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.\"[fn-21-P2118_1309626:10-nf] To whom He had said, \"Blessed art thou,\" He now says, \"Get thee behind me, Satan;\" because it was not of himself that he was blessed. But of what then? \"For flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven.\" See, this is how thou art blessed, not from anything that is thine own, but from that which is mine. Not that I am the Father, but that all things which the Father hath are mine.[fn-21-P2119_1310067:11-nf] But if his blessedness came from the Lord's own working, from whose [working] came he to be Satan? He there tells us: for He assigned the reason of such blessedness, when He said, \"Flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven:\" that is the cause of thy blessedness. But that I said, \"Get thee behind me, Satan, hear also its cause. For thou savorest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.\" Let no one then flatter himself: in that which is natural to himself he is Satan, in that which is of God he is blessed. For all that is of his own, whence comes it, but from his sin? Put away the sin, which is thine own. Righteousness, He saith, belongeth unto me. For what hast thou that thou didst not receive?[fn-21-P2120_1310845:12-nf] Accordingly, when men wished to give counsel to God. disciples to their Master, servants to their Lord, patients to their Physician, He reproved them by saying, \"Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not.\" Follow me, if ye would not stumble: give not counsel to me, from whom you ought to receive it. To what, then, refer the words, \"Are there not twelve hours in the day\"? Just that to point Himself out as the day, He made choice of twelve disciples. If I am the day, He says, and you the hours, is it for the hours to give counsel to the day? The day is followed by the hours, not the hours by the day. If these, then, were the hours, what in such a reckoning was Judas? Was he also among the twelve hours? If he was an hour, he had light; and if he had light, how was the Day betrayed by him to death? But the Lord, in so speaking, foresaw, not Judas himself, but his successor. For Judas, when he fell, was succeeded by Matthias, and the duodenary number preserved.[fn-21-P2121_1311877:13-nf] It was not, then, without a purpose that the Lord made choice of twelve disciples, but to indicate that He Himself is the spiritual Day. Let the hours then attend upon the Day, let them preach the Day, be made known and illuminated by the Day, and by the preaching of the hours may the world believe in the Day.

Look now, and learn that this Judas did not become perverted only at the time when he yielded to the bribery of the Jews and betrayed his Lord. For not a few, inattentive to the Gospel, suppose that Judas only perished when he accepted money from the Jews to betray the Lord. It was not then that he perished, but he was already a thief, and a reprobate, when following the Lord; for it was with his body and not with his heart that he followed. He made up the apostolic number of twelve, but had no part in the apostolic blessedness: he had been made the twelfth in semblance, and on his departure, and the succession of another, the apostolic reality was completed, and the entireness of the number conserved.[fn-22-P2203_1353903:14-nf] What lesson then, my brethren, did our Lord Jesus Christ wish to impress on His Church, when it pleased Him to have one castaway among the twelve, but this, that we should bear with the wicked, and refrain from dividing the body of Christ? Here you have Judas among the saints,-that Judas, mark you! who was a thief, yea-do not overlook it-not a thief of any ordinary type, but a thief and a sacrilegist: a robber of money bags, but of such as were the Lord's; of money bags, but of such as were sacred. If there is a distinction made in the public courts between such crimes as ordinary theft and peculation,-for by peculation we mean the theft of public property; and private theft is not visited with the same sentence as public,-how much more severe ought to be the sentence on the sacrilegious thief, who has dared to steal, not from places of any ordinary kind, but to steal from the Church? He who thieves from the Church, stands side by side with the castaway Judas. Such was this man Judas, and yet he went in and out with the eleven holy disciples. With them he came even to the table of the Lord: he was permitted to have intercourse with them, but he could not contaminate them. Of one bread did both Peter and Judas partake, and yet what communion had the believer with the infidel? Peter's partaking was unto life, but that of Judas unto death. For that good bread was just like the sweet savor. For as the sweet savor, so also does the good bread give life to the good, and bring death to the wicked. \"For he that eateth unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself:\"[fn-22-P2204_1355510:15-nf] \"judgment to himself,\" not to thee.

He indeed has lived evilly; but not evilly has the law ordered him. From a house-breaker he will be sentenced to the mines; from the labour of such how great works are constructed? That condemned man's punishment is the city's ornament. So then God knoweth where to place thee. Do not think that thou art disturbing the counsel of God, if thou art minded to be disorderly.

It becomes us, dearly beloved, to keep in view the orderly connection of our Lord's words. For after having previously said, but subsequently to Judas' departure, and his separation from even the outward communion of the saints, \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him;\"-whether He said so as pointing to His future kingdom, when the wicked shall be separated from the good, or that His resurrection was then to take place, that is, was not to be delayed, like ours, till the end of the world;-and having then added, \"If God is glorified in Him, God shall also glorify Him in Himself, and shall straightway glorify Him,\" whereby without any ambiguity He testified to the immediate fulfillment of His own resurrection; He proceeded to say, \"Little children, yet a little while I am with you.\" To keep them, therefore, from thinking that God was to glorify Him in such a way that He would never again be joined with them in earthly intercourse, He said, \"Yet a little while I am with you:\" as if He had said, Straightway indeed I shall be glorified in my resurrection; and yet I am not straightway to ascend into heaven, but \"yet a little while I am with you.\" For, as we find it written in the Acts of the Apostles, He spent forty days with them after His resurrection, going in and out, and eating and drinking:[fn-25-P2581_1522414:1-nf] not indeed that He had any experience of hunger and thirst, but even by such evidences confirmed the reality of His flesh, which no longer needed, but still possessed the power, to eat and to drink. Was it, then, these forty days He had in view when He said, \"Yet a little while I am with you,\" or something else? For it may also be understood in this way: \"Yet a little while I am with you;\" still, like you, I also am in this state of fleshly infirmity, that is, till He should die and rise again: for after He rose again He was with them, as has been said, for forty days in the full manifestation of His bodily presence; but He was no longer with them in the fellowship of human infirmity.","title":"Tractate LXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_81_tractate_lxxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3.

And, on this account, it is far better to understand Him as having intended to refer at once to that epoch, when He said, \"Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more,\" when in the end of the world He shall be taken away from the sight of the damned, that for the future He may be seen only of those with whom, as those that love Him, the Father and Himself are making their abode.

A better instructed faith then began to draw closer to a conception of the Son's equality with the Father without the necessity of handling the corporeal substance in Christ, whereby He is less than the Father, since, while the Nature of the glorified Body still remained the faith of believers was called upon to touch not with the hand of flesh, but with the spiritual understanding the Only-begotten, Who was equal with the Father. Hence comes that which the Lord said after His Resurrection, when Mary Magdalene, representing the Church, hastened to approach and touch Him: \"Touch Me not, for I have not yet ascended to My Father[fn-39-P3947_1005909:3-nf] :\" that is, I would not have you come to Me as to a human body, nor yet recognize Me by fleshly perceptions: I put thee off for higher things, I prepare greater things for thee: when I have ascended to My Father, then thou shall handle Me more perfectly and truly, for thou shall grasp what thou canst not touch and believe what thou canst not see. But when the disciples' eyes followed the ascending Lord tO heaven with upward gaze of earnest wonder, two angels stood by them in raiment shining with wondrous brightness, who also said, \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven? This Jesus Who was taken up from you into heaven shall so come as ye saw Him going into heaven[fn-39-P3948_1006613:4-nf] .\" By which words all the sons of the Church were taught to believe that Jesus Christ will come visibly in the same Flesh wherewith He ascended, and not to doubt that all things are subjected to Him on Whom the ministry of angels had waited from the first beginning of His Birth. For, as an angel announced to the blessed Virgin that Christ should be conceived by the Holy Ghost, so the voice of heavenly beings sang of His being born of the Virgin also to the shepherds. As messengers from above were the first to attest His having risen from the dead, so the service of angels was employed to foretell His coming in very Flesh to judge the world, that we might understand what great powers will come with Him as Judge, when such great ones ministered to Him even in being judged.","title":"Sermon LXXIV.

Which very thing, too, we observe to come from divine authority, that the priest should be chosen in the presence of the people under the eyes of all, and should be approved worthy and suitable by public judgment and testimony; as in the book of Numbers the Lord commanded Moses, saying, \"Take Aaron thy brother, and Eleazar his son, and place them in the mount, in the presence of all the assembly, and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and let Aaron die there, and be added to his people.\"[fn-61-P6127_1934277:14-nf] God commands a priest to be appointed in the presence of all the assembly; that is, He instructs and shows that the ordination of priests ought not to be solemnized except with the knowledge of the people standing near, that in the presence of the people either the crimes of the wicked may be disclosed, or the merits of the good may be declared, and the ordination, which shall have been examined by the suffrage and judgment of all, may be just and legitimate.[fn-61-P6128_1934763:15-nf] And this is subsequently observed, according to divine instruction, in the Acts of the Apostles, when Peter speaks to the people of ordaining an apostle in the place of Judas. \"Peter,\" it says, \"stood up in the midst of the disciples, and the multitude were in one place.\"[fn-61-P6129_1935062:16-nf] Neither do we observe that this was regarded by the apostles only in the ordinations of bishops and priests, but also in those of deacons, of which matter itself also it is written in their Acts: \"And they twelve called together,\" it says, \"the whole congregation of the disciples, and said to them; \"[fn-61-P6130_1935541:17-nf] which was done so diligently and carefully, with the calling together of the whole of the people, surely for this reason, that no unworthy person might creep into the ministry of the altar, or to the office of a priest.

Our Saviour's holy disciples, after getting beyond the limits of human thought, and then being purified by the word,[fn-27-P2701_907540:45-nf] are enquiring about the end, and longing to know the ultimate blessedness which our Lord declared to be unknown to His angels and to Himself. He calls all the exact comprehension of the purposes of God, a day; and the contemplation of the One-ness and Unity, knowledge of which He attributes to the Father alone, an hour. I apprehend, therefore, that God is said to know of Himself what is; and not to know what is not God, Who is, of His own nature, very righteousness and wisdom, is said to know righteousness and wisdom; but to be ignorant of unrighteousness and wickedness; for God who created us is not unrighteousness and wickedness. If, then, God is said to know about Himself that which is, and not to know that which is not; and if our Lord, according to the purpose of the Incarnation and the denser doctrine, is not the ultimate object of desire; then our Saviour does not know the end and the ultimate blessedness. But He says the angels do not know;[fn-27-P2702_908562:46-nf] that is to say, not even the contemplation which is in them, nor the methods of their ministries are the ultimate object of desire. For even their knowledge, when compared with the knowledge which is face to face, is dense.[fn-27-P2703_908806:47-nf] Only the Father, He says, knows, since He is Himself the end and the ultimate blessedness, for when we no longer know God in mirrors and not immediately,[fn-27-P2704_909839:48-nf] but approach Him as one and alone, then we shall know even the ultimate end. For all material knowledge is said to be the kingdom of Christ; while immaterial knowledge, and so to say the knowledge of actual Godhead, is that of God the Father. But our Lord is also Himself the end anti the ultimate blessedness according to the purpose of the Word; for what does He say in the Gospel? \"I will raise him up at the last day.\"[fn-27-P2705_910453:49-nf] He calls the transition from material knowledge to immaterial contemplation a resurrection, speaking of that knowledge after which there is no other, as the last day: for our intelligence is raised up and roused to a height of blessedness at the time when it contemplates the One-ness and Unity of the Word. But since our intelligence is made dense and bound to earth, it is both commingled with clay and incapable of gazing intently in pure contemplation, being led through adornments[fn-27-P2706_910957:50-nf] cognate to its own body. It considers the operations of the Creator, and judges of them meanwhile by their effects, to the end that growing little by little it may one day wax strong enough to approach even the actual unveiled Godhead. This is the meaning, I think, of the words \"my Father is greater than I,\"[fn-27-P2707_911834:51-nf] and also of the statement, \"It is not mine to give save to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.\"[fn-27-P2708_911957:52-nf] This too is what is meant by Christ's \"delivering up the kingdom to God even the Father;\"[fn-27-P2709_912091:53-nf] inasmuch as according to the denser doctrine which, as I said, is regarded relatively to us and not to the Son Himself, He is not the end but the first fruits. It is in accordance with this view that when His disciples asked Him again in the Acts of the Apostles, \"When wilt thou restore the kingdom of Israel?\" He replied, \"It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power.\"[fn-27-P2710_912532:54-nf] That is to say, the knowledge of such a kingdom is not for them that are bound in flesh and blood. This contemplation the Father hath put away in His own power, meaning by \"power\" those that are empowered, and by \"His own\" those who are not held down by the ignorance of things below. Do not, I beg you, have in mind times and seasons of sense but certain distinctions of knowledge made by the sun apprehended by mental perception. For our Lord's prayer must be carried out. It is Jesus Who prayed \"Grant that they may be one in us as I and Thou are one, Father.\"[fn-27-P2711_913115:55-nf] For when God, Who is one, is in each, He makes all out; and number is lost in the in-dwelling of Unity.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_71_letter_liii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2.
