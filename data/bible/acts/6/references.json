Instead of the three proofs from Holy Scripture which you said would satisfy you if I could produce them, behold I have given you seven. Who, then, will put up with the follies of Origen? I will not use a severer word and so make myself like him or his followers, who presume at the peril of their soul to assert dogmatically whatever first comes into their head, and to dictate to God, whereas they ought either to pray to Him or to learn the truth from Him. For some of them say that the image of God which Adam had previously received was lost when he sinned. Others surmise that the body which the Son of God was destined to take of Mary was the image of the Creator. Some identify this image with the soul, others with sensation, others with virtue. These make it baptism, those assert that it is in virtue of God's image that man exercises universal sway. Like drunkards in their cups, they ejaculate now this, now that, when they ought rather to have avoided so serious a risk, and to have obtained salvation by simple faith, not denying the words of God. To God they ought to have left the sure and exact knowledge of His own gift, and of the particular way in which He has created men in His image and after His likeness. Forsaking this course, they have involved themselves in many subtle questions, and through these they have been plunged into the mire of sin. But we, dearly beloved, believe the words of the Lord, and know that God's image remains in all men, and we leave it to Him to know in what respect man is created in His image. And let no one be deceived by that passage in the epistle of John, which some readers fail to understand, where he says: \"Now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall See Him as He is.\"[fn-18-P1856_455057:1301-nf] For this refers to the glory which is then to be revealed[fn-18-P1857_455139:1302-nf] to His saints; just as also in another place we read the words \"from glory to glory,\"[fn-18-P1858_455247:1303-nf] of which glory the saints have even in this world received an earnest and a small portion. At their head stands Moses, whose face shone exceedingly, and was bright with the brightness of the sun.[fn-18-P1859_455468:1304-nf] Next to him comes Elijah, who was caught up into heaven in a chariot of fire,[fn-18-P1860_455592:1305-nf] and did not feel the effects of the flame. Stephen, too, when he was being stoned, had the face of an angel visible to all.[fn-18-P1861_455741:1306-nf] And this which we have verified in a few cases is to be understood of all, that what is written may be fulfilled. \"Every one that sanctifieth himself shall be numbered among the blessed.\" For, \"blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-18-P1862_456013:1307-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1538","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1.

Writing to Titus the apostle says: \"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain presbyters[fn-55-P5539_1544004:3931-nf] in every city, as I had appointed thee: if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.

But you will say, how comes it then that at Rome a presbyter is only ordained on the recommendation of a deacon? To which I reply as follows. Why do you bring forward a custom which exists in one city only? Why do you oppose to the laws of the Church a paltry exception which has given rise to arrogance and pride? The rarer anything is the more it is sought after. In India pennyroyal is more costly than pepper. Their fewness makes deacons persons of consequence[fn-55-P5552_1547478:3943-nf] while presbyters are less thought of owing to their great numbers. But even in the church of Rome the deacons stand while the presbyters seat themselves, although bad habits have by degrees so far crept in that I have seen a deacon, in the absence of the bishop, seat himself among the presbyters and at social gatherings give his blessing to them.[fn-55-P5553_1547979:3944-nf] Those who act thus must learn that they are wrong and must give heed to the apostles words: \"it is not reason that we should leave the word of God and serve tables.\"[fn-55-P5554_1548198:3945-nf] They must consider the reasons which led to the appointment of deacons at the beginning.

For grave and serious as such sins are in themselves, they are trivial indeed when compared with those which I have now to narrate.

Yet you were squeezing your love-notes into the openings of what is now the altar, as it was once the manger, of the Lord, choosing this place in order that your unhappy victim might find and read them when she came to kneel and worship there.

Pray, art thou not aware that that body is subject to more diseases and assaults than this flesh of ours, is more quickly corrupted, and more slow to recover? and by those who have the healing of these bodies, divers medicines have been discovered, and an apparatus of different instruments, and diet suitable for the sick; and often the condition of the atmosphere is of itself enough for the recovery of a sick man; and there are instances of seasonable sleep having saved the physician all further labor. But in the case before us, it is impossible to take any of these things into consideration; nay there is but one method and way of healing appointed, after we have gone wrong, and that is, the powerful application of the Word. This is the one instrument, the only diet, the finest atmosphere. This takes the place of physic, cautery and cutting, and if it be needful to sear and amputate, this is the means which we must use, and if this be of no avail, all else is wasted; with this we both rouse the soul when it sleeps, and reduce it when it is inflamed; with this we cut off excesses, and fill up defects, and perform all manner of other operations which are requisite for the soul's health. Now as regards the ordering of our daily life for the best, it is true that the life of another may provoke us to emulation. But in the matter of spurious doctrine, when any soul is diseased thereby, then there is great need of the Word, not only in view of the safety of our own people, but in view of the enemy without. If, indeed, one had the sword of the spirit, and the shield of faith,[fn-4-P471_235063:25-nf] so as to be able to work miracles, and by means of these marvels to stop the mouths of impudent gainsayers, one would have little need of the assistance of the Word; still in the days of miracles the Word was by no means useless, but essentially necessary. For St. Paul made use of it himself, although he was everywhere so great an object of wonder for his miracles; and another[fn-4-P472_235466:26-nf] of those who belonged to the \"glorious company of the Apostles\" exhorts us to apply ourselves to acquiring this power, when he says: \"Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you,\" and they all, with one accord, committed the care of the poor widows to Stephen, for no other reason than that they themselves might have leisure \"for the ministry of the Word.\"[fn-4-P473_236031:27-nf] To this we ought equally to apply ourselves, unless indeed we are endued with a power of working miracles. But if there is not the least sign of such a power being left us, while on every side many enemies are constantly attacking us, why then it necessarily follows that we should arm ourselves with this weapon, both in order that we may not be wounded ourselves with the darts of the enemy, and in order that we may wound him.","title":"Book IV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":6,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"265","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"3 \"For in Asia also great lights have fallen asleep, which shall rise again on the last day, at the coming of the Lord, when he shall come with glory from heaven and shall seek out all the saints.

He, as one of the seven (that were chosen) for the diaconate,[fn-20-P2004_620803:101-nf] was appointed by the Apostles. (But Nicolaus) departed from correct doctrine, and was in the habit of inculcating indifferency of both life and food.[fn-20-P2005_621036:102-nf] And when the disciples (of Nicolaus) continued to offer insult to the Holy Spirit, John reproved them in the Apocalypse as fornicators and eaters of things offered unto idols.[fn-20-P2006_621281:103-nf] ","title":"Book VII.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":6,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"20. Accordingly, the word that sounds outwardly is the sign of the word that gives light inwardly; which latter has the greater claim to be called a word. For that which is uttered with the mouth of the flesh, is the articulate sound of a word; and is itself also called a word, on account of that to make which outwardly apparent it is itself assumed. For our word is so made in some way into an articulate sound of the body, by assuming that articulate sound by which it may be manifested to men's senses, as the Word of God was made flesh, by assuming that flesh in which itself also might be manifested to men's senses. And as our word becomes an articulate sound, yet is not changed into one; so the Word of God became flesh, but far be it from us to say He was changed into flesh, For both that word of ours became an articulate sound, and that other Word became flesh, by assuming it, not by consuming itself so as to be changed into it. And therefore whoever desires to arrive at any likeness, be it of what sort it may, of the Word of God, however in many respects unlike, must not regard the word of ours that, sounds in the ears, either when it is uttered in an articulate sound or when it is silently thought. For the words of all tongues that are uttered in sound are also silently thought, and the mind runs over verses while the bodily mouth is silent. And not only the numbers of syllables, but the tunes also of songs, since they are corporeal, and pertain to that sense of the body which is called hearing, are at hand by certain incorporeal images appropriate to them, to those who think of them, and who silently revolve all these things. But we must pass by this, in order to arrive at that word of man, by the likeness of which, be it of what sort it may, the Word of God may be somehow seen as in an enigma. Not that word which was spoken to this or that prophet, and of which it is said, \"Now the word of God grew and multiplied;\"[fn-19-P1983_1000529:43-nf] and again, \"Faith then cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ;\"[fn-19-P1984_1000625:44-nf] and again, \"When ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men but, as it is in truth, the word of God\"[fn-19-P1985_1000788:45-nf] (and there are countless other like sayings in the Scriptures respecting the word of God, which is disseminated in the sounds of many and diverse languages through the hearts and mouths of men; and which is therefore called the word of God, because the doctrine thai is delivered is not human, but divine);-but we are now seeking to see, in whatsoever way we can, by means of this likeness, that Word of God of which it is said, \"The Word was God;\" of which it is said, \"All things were made by Him;\" of which it is said, \"The Word became flesh;\" of which it is said \"The Word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom.\"[fn-19-P1986_1001430:46-nf] We must go on, then, to that word of man, to the word of the rational animal, to the word of that image of God, that is not born of God, but made by God; which is neither utterable in sound nor capable of being thought under the likeness of sound such as must needs be with the word of any tongue; but which precedes all the signs by which it is signified, and is begotten from the knowledge that continues in the mind, when that same knowledge is spoken inwardly according as it really is. For the sight of thinking is exceedingly like the sight of knowledge. For when it is uttered by sound, or by any bodily sign, it is not uttered according as it really is, but as it can be seen or heard by the body. When, therefore, that is in the word which is in the knowledge, then there is a true word, and truth, such as is looked for from man; such that what is in the knowledge is also in the word, and what is not in the knowledge is also not in the word. Here may be recognized, \"Yea, yea; nay, nay.\"[fn-19-P1987_1002449:47-nf] And so this likeness of the image that is made, approaches as nearly as is possible to that likeness of the image that is born, by which God the Son is declared to be in all things like in substance to the Father. We must notice in this enigma also another likeness of the word of God; viz. that, as it is said of that Word, \"All things were made by Him,\" where God is declared to have made the universe by His only-begotten Son, so there are no works of man that are not first spoken in his heart: whence it is written, \"A word is the beginning of every work.\"[fn-19-P1988_1003029:48-nf] But here also, it is when the word is true, that then it is the beginning of a good work. And a word is true when it is begotten from the knowledge of working good works, so that there too may be preserved the \"yea yea, nay nay;\" in order that whatever is in that knowledge by which we are to live, may be also in the word by which we are to work, and whatever is not in the one may not be in the other. Otherwise such a word will be a lie, not truth; and what comes thence will be a sin, and not a good work. There is yet this other likeness of the Word of God in this likeness of our word, that there can be a word of ours with no work following it, but there cannot be any work unless a word precedes; just as the Word of God could have existed though no creature existed, but no creature could exist unless by that Word by which all things are made. And therefore not God the Father, not the Holy Spirit, not the Trinity itself, but the Son only, which is the Word of God, was made flesh; although the Trinity was the maker: in order that we might live rightly through our word following and imitating His example, i.e. by having no lie in either the thought or the work of our word. But this perfection of this image is one to be at some time hereafter. In order to attain this it is that the good master teaches us by Christian faith, and by pious doctrine, that \"with face unveiled\" from the veil of the law, which is the shadow of things to come, \"beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,\" i.e. gazing at it through a glass, \"we may be transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord;\"[fn-19-P1989_1004688:49-nf] as we explained above.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_21_homily_xiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"But[fn-6-P674_532202:5-nf] let us look over again what has been spoken. \"Ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves.\"(Recapitulation, v. 35.)

With this view he throws out a hint himself, saying, \"For before. these days\" (v. 36): meaning, not many days before.

He does not pronounce upon it, either that, it is \"of men,\" or that it is \"of God;\" but he leaves the proof to the future. \"They were persuaded [by him].\" (v. 40.) Then why, it may be asked, do ye scourge them? Such was the incontrovertible justness of his speech, they could not look it in the face; nevertheless, they sated their own animosity; and again they expected to terrify them in this way. By the fact also of his saying these things not in the presence of the Apostles, he gained a hearing more than he would otherwise have done; and then the suavity of his discourse and the justness of what was said, helped to persuade them. in fact, this man all but preached the Gospel. \"[fn-6-P677_536060:8-nf] Ye were persuaded,\" one may say, \"that ye had not strength to overthrow it. Wherefore did ye not believe?\" Such is the witness borne even by enemies. There it is four hundred, there, four thousand: and here the first movers were twelve. Let not the number which added itself affright you. (ch. ii. 41; iv. 4.) He might also have mentioned another instance, that of the Egyptian, but what he has spoken is fully sufficient. And he closes his speech with an alarming topic: \"Lest haply,\" etc. And he does not pronounce upon it, lest he should seem to be pleading their cause; but he reasons by way of syllogism froth the issue of the matter. And he does not venture to pronounce that it is not of men, nor yet that it is of God; for bad he said that it was of God. they would have gainsaid him: but had he said that it was of men, they would again have taken prompt measures. Therefore he bids them wait for the end, saying, \"Refrain,\" But they once more threaten knowing indeed that they avail nothing, but doing after their manner. Such is the nature of wickedness: it attempts even impossibilities.-\"And after this man rose up Judas,\" etc. These things Josephus relates in detail. (Ant. xx. 8; ib. v. 2; xviii. 1. B. J. ii. 8. 1.) But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm: that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of persons![fn-6-P678_538091:9-nf] And he does not say, \"But if ye do not overthrow it, it is of God;\" but, \"If it be of God, it will not be overthrown.\" \"And to him they agreed.\" (v. 40.) They reverenced the high character of the man. \"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.\" (v. 41.) What miracles so wonderful as this? Nowhere is the like of this recorded of the old saints: for Jeremiah indeed was scourged for the word of God, and they threatened Elijah, and the rest: but in this case, even by this very thing, and not only by their miracles, these showed forth the power of God. He does not say, that they were not pained, but that though pained they rejoiced. How does this appear? From their boldness afterwards: they were so instant still, even after their beatings, in preaching the word. \"But in the temple,\" it says, \"and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\" (v. 42.) \"And in those days \"-when these things were done, when there were scourgings, when there were threatenings, when the disciples were multiplying-also, it says, \"there arose a murmuring.\" (ch. vi. 1.) And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict order in a multitude. \"There arose a murmuring,\"etc. to,-\"And[fn-6-P679_539639:10-nf] a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.-There arose murmuring against the Hebrews \"-for that description of people seemed to be more honorable-\" because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.\"[fn-6-P680_540664:11-nf] (v. 1-7.) So then there was a daily ministration for the widows. And observe how he calls it a \"ministration\" (diakonia), and not directly alms: extolling by this at once the doers, and those to whom it was done. \"Were neglected.\" This did not arise from malice, but perhaps from the carelessness of the multitude. And therefore he brought it forward openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it was a great evil that it existed.[fn-6-P681_541655:12-nf] \"Then the twelve,\" etc. (v. 2.) Do you observe[fn-6-P682_542527:13-nf] how outward concerns succeed to inward? They do not act at their own discretion, but plead for themselves to the congregation. So ought it to be done now. \"It is not reason,\" says he, \"that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\" First he puts to them the unreasonableness of the thing; that it is not possible for both things to be done with the same attention: just as when they were about to ordain Matthias, they first show the necessity of the thing, that one was deficient, and there must needs be twelve. And so here they showed the necessity; and they did it not sooner, but waited till the murmuring arose; nor, on the other hand, did they suffer this to spread far. And, lo! they leave the decision to them: those who pleased all, those who of all were honestly reputed, them they present:[fn-6-P683_543553:14-nf] not now twelve, but \"seven, full of the Spirit and of wisdom: well reported of\" for their conversation. (v. 3.) Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, \"Therefore must one of these men which have companied with us all the time\" (ch. i. 21): but not so here: for the case was not alike. And they do not now put it to the lot; they might indeed themselves have made the election, as moved by the Spirit: but nevertheless, they desire the testimony of the people. The fixing the number, and the ordaining them, and for this kind of business, rested with them: but the choice of the men they make over to the people, that they might not seem to act from favor: just as God also leaves it to Moses to choose as elders those whom he knew. (Num. xi. 16.) \"And of wisdom.\" For indeed there needs much wisdom in such ministrations. For think not, because he hath not the word committed unto him, that such an one has no need of wisdom: he does need it, and much too. \"But we,\" saith he, \"will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.\" (v. 4.) Again they plead for themselves, beginning and ending with this. \"Will give ourselves continually,\" he saith. For so it behooved, not just to do the mere acts, or in any chance way, but to be continually doing them. \"And the saying,\" we are told, \"pleased the whole multitude.\" (v. 5, 6.) This too was worthy of their wisdom. All approved of what was said so sensible was it. \"And they chose,\" it says (again it is the people (autoi) that choose,) \"Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.\" They separated them from the multitude, and it is the people (autoi) that draw them, not the Apostles that lead them. Observe how he avoids all that is superfluous: he does not tell in what way it was done, but that they were ordained (exeirotonhqhsan) with prayer: for this is the meaning of xeirotonia, (i.e. \"putting forth the hand,\") or ordination: the hand of the man is laid upon (the person,) but the whole work is of God, and it is His hand which toucheth the head of the one ordained, if he be duly ordained. \"And the word of God,\" it says, \"increased: and the number of the disciples multiplied.\" (v. 7.) It is not for nothing that he says this: it shows how great is the virtue of alms and good order. And as he is about in the sequel to enlarge (aucein) upon the affair of Stephen, he puts first the causes which led to it. \"And many,\" he says, \"of the priests were obedient to the faith.\" For[fn-6-P684_546413:15-nf] since they perceived such to be the mind of their ruler and teacher, they put the matter to the test of facts.-It is also a subject for wonder, how it was that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and how it was that the Apostles were not rejected by them. But what sort of rank these bore, and what sort of office they received, this is what we need to learn. Was it that of Deacons? And yet this is not the case in the Churches. But[fn-6-P685_547436:16-nf] is it to the Presbyters that the management belongs? And yet at present there was no Bishop, but the Apostles only. Whence I think it clearly and manifestily follows, that neither Deacons nor Presbyters is their designation: but it was for this particular purpose that they were ordained.[fn-6-P686_551764:17-nf] And this business was not simply handed over to them without further ceremony, but the Apostles prayed over them, that power might be given to them. But observe, I pray you, if there were need of seven men for this, great in proportion must have been the sums of money that flowed in, great in proportion also the number of widows. So then the prayers were not made in an off-hand way, but with much deliberate attention: and this office,[fn-6-P687_552972:18-nf] as well as preaching, was thus brought to good effect; for what they did, they effected mostly by the means of these (their prayers.) Thus they were enabled to give their attention to things spiritual; thus were these also free to undertake long journeys; thus were these put in trust with the word. But the writer does not say this, nor extol them, but that it was \"not reason\" that they should leave the work given to them. Thus they had been taught by Moses's example not to undertake the management of everything by themselves. (Num. xi. 14.) \"Only,\" it is said, \"that we should remember the poor.\" (Gal. ii. 10.) And[fn-6-P688_554824:19-nf] how did they bring these forward? They fasted. \"Look you out seven men,\" etc. (v. 3.) It is not simply, spiritual men, but, \"full of the Spirit and of wisdom, \"for it needed very great superiority of mind (filosofiaj) to bear the complainings of widows. For what profits it, that the dispenser of alms steal not, if nevertheless he waste all, or be harsh and easily provoked? \"And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost.\" (v. 5.) And in this regard Philip also was admirable: for it is of him that the writer says: \"And we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.\"-(ch. xxi. 8.) Dost thou mark how matters are ordered quite otherwise than after the matter of men? \"And the number of disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem.\" (v. 7.) In Jerusalem the multitude increased. Wonderful, where Christ was slain, there the preaching increased! And not only was it not the case that some were offended then in the manner of Ananias, but the awe became even greater: while these are scourged, those threatening, those tempting the Spirit, those murmuring. But I would have thee remark under what circumstances the multitude increased: after these trials, then it was that the multitude increased, and not before. Mark also how great the mercy of God. Of those chief-priests, of the very men who had indignation and sore displeasure and so cried out and said, \"He saved others, Himself He cannot save;\" of these same,\" Many,\" it says, \"were obedient unto the faith.\" (Matt. xxvii. 42.)

It is not for nothing that he says this: it shows how great is the virtue of alms and good order. And as he is about in the sequel to enlarge (aucein) upon the affair of Stephen, he puts first the causes which led to it. \"And many,\" he says, \"of the priests were obedient to the faith.\" For[fn-6-P684_546413:15-nf] since they perceived such to be the mind of their ruler and teacher, they put the matter to the test of facts.-It is also a subject for wonder, how it was that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and how it was that the Apostles were not rejected by them. But what sort of rank these bore, and what sort of office they received, this is what we need to learn. Was it that of Deacons? And yet this is not the case in the Churches. But[fn-6-P685_547436:16-nf] is it to the Presbyters that the management belongs? And yet at present there was no Bishop, but the Apostles only. Whence I think it clearly and manifestily follows, that neither Deacons nor Presbyters is their designation: but it was for this particular purpose that they were ordained.[fn-6-P686_551764:17-nf] And this business was not simply handed over to them without further ceremony, but the Apostles prayed over them, that power might be given to them. But observe, I pray you, if there were need of seven men for this, great in proportion must have been the sums of money that flowed in, great in proportion also the number of widows. So then the prayers were not made in an off-hand way, but with much deliberate attention: and this office,[fn-6-P687_552972:18-nf] as well as preaching, was thus brought to good effect; for what they did, they effected mostly by the means of these (their prayers.) Thus they were enabled to give their attention to things spiritual; thus were these also free to undertake long journeys; thus were these put in trust with the word. But the writer does not say this, nor extol them, but that it was \"not reason\" that they should leave the work given to them. Thus they had been taught by Moses's example not to undertake the management of everything by themselves. (Num. xi. 14.) \"Only,\" it is said, \"that we should remember the poor.\" (Gal. ii. 10.) And[fn-6-P688_554824:19-nf] how did they bring these forward? They fasted. \"Look you out seven men,\" etc. (v. 3.) It is not simply, spiritual men, but, \"full of the Spirit and of wisdom, \"for it needed very great superiority of mind (filosofiaj) to bear the complainings of widows. For what profits it, that the dispenser of alms steal not, if nevertheless he waste all, or be harsh and easily provoked? \"And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost.\" (v. 5.) And in this regard Philip also was admirable: for it is of him that the writer says: \"And we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.\"-(ch. xxi. 8.) Dost thou mark how matters are ordered quite otherwise than after the matter of men? \"And the number of disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem.\" (v. 7.) In Jerusalem the multitude increased. Wonderful, where Christ was slain, there the preaching increased! And not only was it not the case that some were offended then in the manner of Ananias, but the awe became even greater: while these are scourged, those threatening, those tempting the Spirit, those murmuring. But I would have thee remark under what circumstances the multitude increased: after these trials, then it was that the multitude increased, and not before. Mark also how great the mercy of God. Of those chief-priests, of the very men who had indignation and sore displeasure and so cried out and said, \"He saved others, Himself He cannot save;\" of these same,\" Many,\" it says, \"were obedient unto the faith.\" (Matt. xxvii. 42.)

See here, I pray you, how mildly Gamaliel reasons, and how he says but a few words to them, and does not recount ancient histories, although he might have done so, but more recent instances, which are most powerful to produce belief. With this view he throws out a hint himself, saying, \"For before. these days\" (v. 36): meaning, not many days before. Now had he at once said, \"Let these men go,\" both himself would have fallen into suspicion, and his speech would not have been so effective: but after the examples, it acquired its own proper force. And he mentions not one instance, but a second also: \"for,\" saith the Scripture, \"in the mouth of two witnesses\" (Matt. xviii. 16): and yet he had it in his power to mention even three. \"Refrain from these men.\" (v. 38.) See how mild his manner is, and his speech not long, but concise, and his mention even of those (impostors) how free from passion: \"And all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered.\" And[fn-6-P675_533550:6-nf] for all this he does not blaspheme Christ. They heard him, all these unbelievers, heard him, these Jews. [\"For if this council or this work be of men, it will come to naught.\"] Well then, since it did not come to nought, it is not of men. [\"But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it.\"] (v. 39.) Once more he checks them by the impossibility and the inexpediency of the thing, saying, \"Lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.\"[fn-6-P676_534552:7-nf] And he does not say, If Christ be God; but the work (itself) declares (this). He does not pronounce upon it, either that, it is \"of men,\" or that it is \"of God;\" but he leaves the proof to the future. \"They were persuaded [by him].\" (v. 40.) Then why, it may be asked, do ye scourge them? Such was the incontrovertible justness of his speech, they could not look it in the face; nevertheless, they sated their own animosity; and again they expected to terrify them in this way. By the fact also of his saying these things not in the presence of the Apostles, he gained a hearing more than he would otherwise have done; and then the suavity of his discourse and the justness of what was said, helped to persuade them. in fact, this man all but preached the Gospel. \"[fn-6-P677_536060:8-nf] Ye were persuaded,\" one may say, \"that ye had not strength to overthrow it. Wherefore did ye not believe?\" Such is the witness borne even by enemies. There it is four hundred, there, four thousand: and here the first movers were twelve. Let not the number which added itself affright you. (ch. ii. 41; iv. 4.) He might also have mentioned another instance, that of the Egyptian, but what he has spoken is fully sufficient. And he closes his speech with an alarming topic: \"Lest haply,\" etc. And he does not pronounce upon it, lest he should seem to be pleading their cause; but he reasons by way of syllogism froth the issue of the matter. And he does not venture to pronounce that it is not of men, nor yet that it is of God; for bad he said that it was of God. they would have gainsaid him: but had he said that it was of men, they would again have taken prompt measures. Therefore he bids them wait for the end, saying, \"Refrain,\" But they once more threaten knowing indeed that they avail nothing, but doing after their manner. Such is the nature of wickedness: it attempts even impossibilities.-\"And after this man rose up Judas,\" etc. These things Josephus relates in detail. (Ant. xx. 8; ib. v. 2; xviii. 1. B. J. ii. 8. 1.) But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm: that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of persons![fn-6-P678_538091:9-nf] And he does not say, \"But if ye do not overthrow it, it is of God;\" but, \"If it be of God, it will not be overthrown.\" \"And to him they agreed.\" (v. 40.) They reverenced the high character of the man. \"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.\" (v. 41.) What miracles so wonderful as this? Nowhere is the like of this recorded of the old saints: for Jeremiah indeed was scourged for the word of God, and they threatened Elijah, and the rest: but in this case, even by this very thing, and not only by their miracles, these showed forth the power of God. He does not say, that they were not pained, but that though pained they rejoiced. How does this appear? From their boldness afterwards: they were so instant still, even after their beatings, in preaching the word. \"But in the temple,\" it says, \"and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\" (v. 42.) \"And in those days \"-when these things were done, when there were scourgings, when there were threatenings, when the disciples were multiplying-also, it says, \"there arose a murmuring.\" (ch. vi. 1.) And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict order in a multitude. \"There arose a murmuring,\"etc. to,-\"And[fn-6-P679_539639:10-nf] a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.-There arose murmuring against the Hebrews \"-for that description of people seemed to be more honorable-\" because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.\"[fn-6-P680_540664:11-nf] (v. 1-7.) So then there was a daily ministration for the widows. And observe how he calls it a \"ministration\" (diakonia), and not directly alms: extolling by this at once the doers, and those to whom it was done. \"Were neglected.\" This did not arise from malice, but perhaps from the carelessness of the multitude. And therefore he brought it forward openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it was a great evil that it existed.[fn-6-P681_541655:12-nf] \"Then the twelve,\" etc. (v. 2.) Do you observe[fn-6-P682_542527:13-nf] how outward concerns succeed to inward? They do not act at their own discretion, but plead for themselves to the congregation. So ought it to be done now. \"It is not reason,\" says he, \"that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\" First he puts to them the unreasonableness of the thing; that it is not possible for both things to be done with the same attention: just as when they were about to ordain Matthias, they first show the necessity of the thing, that one was deficient, and there must needs be twelve. And so here they showed the necessity; and they did it not sooner, but waited till the murmuring arose; nor, on the other hand, did they suffer this to spread far. And, lo! they leave the decision to them: those who pleased all, those who of all were honestly reputed, them they present:[fn-6-P683_543553:14-nf] not now twelve, but \"seven, full of the Spirit and of wisdom: well reported of\" for their conversation. (v. 3.) Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, \"Therefore must one of these men which have companied with us all the time\" (ch. i. 21): but not so here: for the case was not alike. And they do not now put it to the lot; they might indeed themselves have made the election, as moved by the Spirit: but nevertheless, they desire the testimony of the people. The fixing the number, and the ordaining them, and for this kind of business, rested with them: but the choice of the men they make over to the people, that they might not seem to act from favor: just as God also leaves it to Moses to choose as elders those whom he knew. (Num. xi. 16.) \"And of wisdom.\" For indeed there needs much wisdom in such ministrations. For think not, because he hath not the word committed unto him, that such an one has no need of wisdom: he does need it, and much too. \"But we,\" saith he, \"will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.\" (v. 4.) Again they plead for themselves, beginning and ending with this. \"Will give ourselves continually,\" he saith. For so it behooved, not just to do the mere acts, or in any chance way, but to be continually doing them. \"And the saying,\" we are told, \"pleased the whole multitude.\" (v. 5, 6.) This too was worthy of their wisdom. All approved of what was said so sensible was it. \"And they chose,\" it says (again it is the people (autoi) that choose,) \"Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.\" They separated them from the multitude, and it is the people (autoi) that draw them, not the Apostles that lead them.

With this view he throws out a hint himself, saying, \"For before. these days\" (v. 36): meaning, not many days before. Now had he at once said, \"Let these men go,\" both himself would have fallen into suspicion, and his speech would not have been so effective: but after the examples, it acquired its own proper force. And he mentions not one instance, but a second also: \"for,\" saith the Scripture, \"in the mouth of two witnesses\" (Matt. xviii. 16): and yet he had it in his power to mention even three. \"Refrain from these men.\" (v. 38.)

He does not pronounce upon it, either that, it is \"of men,\" or that it is \"of God;\" but he leaves the proof to the future. \"They were persuaded [by him].\" (v. 40.) Then why, it may be asked, do ye scourge them? Such was the incontrovertible justness of his speech, they could not look it in the face; nevertheless, they sated their own animosity; and again they expected to terrify them in this way. By the fact also of his saying these things not in the presence of the Apostles, he gained a hearing more than he would otherwise have done; and then the suavity of his discourse and the justness of what was said, helped to persuade them. in fact, this man all but preached the Gospel. \"[fn-6-P677_536060:8-nf] Ye were persuaded,\" one may say, \"that ye had not strength to overthrow it. Wherefore did ye not believe?\" Such is the witness borne even by enemies. There it is four hundred, there, four thousand: and here the first movers were twelve. Let not the number which added itself affright you. (ch. ii. 41; iv. 4.) He might also have mentioned another instance, that of the Egyptian, but what he has spoken is fully sufficient. And he closes his speech with an alarming topic: \"Lest haply,\" etc. And he does not pronounce upon it, lest he should seem to be pleading their cause; but he reasons by way of syllogism froth the issue of the matter. And he does not venture to pronounce that it is not of men, nor yet that it is of God; for bad he said that it was of God. they would have gainsaid him: but had he said that it was of men, they would again have taken prompt measures. Therefore he bids them wait for the end, saying, \"Refrain,\" But they once more threaten knowing indeed that they avail nothing, but doing after their manner. Such is the nature of wickedness: it attempts even impossibilities.-\"And after this man rose up Judas,\" etc. These things Josephus relates in detail. (Ant. xx. 8; ib. v. 2; xviii. 1. B. J. ii. 8. 1.) But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm: that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of persons![fn-6-P678_538091:9-nf] And he does not say, \"But if ye do not overthrow it, it is of God;\" but, \"If it be of God, it will not be overthrown.\" \"And to him they agreed.\" (v. 40.) They reverenced the high character of the man. \"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.\" (v. 41.) What miracles so wonderful as this? Nowhere is the like of this recorded of the old saints: for Jeremiah indeed was scourged for the word of God, and they threatened Elijah, and the rest: but in this case, even by this very thing, and not only by their miracles, these showed forth the power of God. He does not say, that they were not pained, but that though pained they rejoiced. How does this appear? From their boldness afterwards: they were so instant still, even after their beatings, in preaching the word. \"But in the temple,\" it says, \"and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\" (v. 42.) \"And in those days \"-when these things were done, when there were scourgings, when there were threatenings, when the disciples were multiplying-also, it says, \"there arose a murmuring.\" (ch. vi. 1.) And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict order in a multitude. \"There arose a murmuring,\"etc. to,-\"And[fn-6-P679_539639:10-nf] a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.-There arose murmuring against the Hebrews \"-for that description of people seemed to be more honorable-\" because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.\"[fn-6-P680_540664:11-nf] (v. 1-7.) So then there was a daily ministration for the widows. And observe how he calls it a \"ministration\" (diakonia), and not directly alms: extolling by this at once the doers, and those to whom it was done. \"Were neglected.\" This did not arise from malice, but perhaps from the carelessness of the multitude. And therefore he brought it forward openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it was a great evil that it existed.[fn-6-P681_541655:12-nf] \"Then the twelve,\" etc. (v. 2.) Do you observe[fn-6-P682_542527:13-nf] how outward concerns succeed to inward? They do not act at their own discretion, but plead for themselves to the congregation. So ought it to be done now. \"It is not reason,\" says he, \"that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\" First he puts to them the unreasonableness of the thing; that it is not possible for both things to be done with the same attention: just as when they were about to ordain Matthias, they first show the necessity of the thing, that one was deficient, and there must needs be twelve. And so here they showed the necessity; and they did it not sooner, but waited till the murmuring arose; nor, on the other hand, did they suffer this to spread far. And, lo! they leave the decision to them: those who pleased all, those who of all were honestly reputed, them they present:[fn-6-P683_543553:14-nf] not now twelve, but \"seven, full of the Spirit and of wisdom: well reported of\" for their conversation. (v. 3.) Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, \"Therefore must one of these men which have companied with us all the time\" (ch. i. 21): but not so here: for the case was not alike. And they do not now put it to the lot; they might indeed themselves have made the election, as moved by the Spirit: but nevertheless, they desire the testimony of the people. The fixing the number, and the ordaining them, and for this kind of business, rested with them: but the choice of the men they make over to the people, that they might not seem to act from favor: just as God also leaves it to Moses to choose as elders those whom he knew. (Num. xi. 16.) \"And of wisdom.\" For indeed there needs much wisdom in such ministrations. For think not, because he hath not the word committed unto him, that such an one has no need of wisdom: he does need it, and much too. \"But we,\" saith he, \"will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.\" (v. 4.) Again they plead for themselves, beginning and ending with this. \"Will give ourselves continually,\" he saith. For so it behooved, not just to do the mere acts, or in any chance way, but to be continually doing them. \"And the saying,\" we are told, \"pleased the whole multitude.\" (v. 5, 6.) This too was worthy of their wisdom. All approved of what was said so sensible was it. \"And they chose,\" it says (again it is the people (autoi) that choose,) \"Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.\" They separated them from the multitude, and it is the people (autoi) that draw them, not the Apostles that lead them. Observe how he avoids all that is superfluous: he does not tell in what way it was done, but that they were ordained (exeirotonhqhsan) with prayer: for this is the meaning of xeirotonia, (i.e. \"putting forth the hand,\") or ordination: the hand of the man is laid upon (the person,) but the whole work is of God, and it is His hand which toucheth the head of the one ordained, if he be duly ordained. \"And the word of God,\" it says, \"increased: and the number of the disciples multiplied.\" (v. 7.) It is not for nothing that he says this: it shows how great is the virtue of alms and good order. And as he is about in the sequel to enlarge (aucein) upon the affair of Stephen, he puts first the causes which led to it. \"And many,\" he says, \"of the priests were obedient to the faith.\" For[fn-6-P684_546413:15-nf] since they perceived such to be the mind of their ruler and teacher, they put the matter to the test of facts.-It is also a subject for wonder, how it was that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and how it was that the Apostles were not rejected by them. But what sort of rank these bore, and what sort of office they received, this is what we need to learn. Was it that of Deacons? And yet this is not the case in the Churches. But[fn-6-P685_547436:16-nf] is it to the Presbyters that the management belongs? And yet at present there was no Bishop, but the Apostles only. Whence I think it clearly and manifestily follows, that neither Deacons nor Presbyters is their designation: but it was for this particular purpose that they were ordained.[fn-6-P686_551764:17-nf] And this business was not simply handed over to them without further ceremony, but the Apostles prayed over them, that power might be given to them. But observe, I pray you, if there were need of seven men for this, great in proportion must have been the sums of money that flowed in, great in proportion also the number of widows. So then the prayers were not made in an off-hand way, but with much deliberate attention: and this office,[fn-6-P687_552972:18-nf] as well as preaching, was thus brought to good effect; for what they did, they effected mostly by the means of these (their prayers.) Thus they were enabled to give their attention to things spiritual; thus were these also free to undertake long journeys; thus were these put in trust with the word. But the writer does not say this, nor extol them, but that it was \"not reason\" that they should leave the work given to them. Thus they had been taught by Moses's example not to undertake the management of everything by themselves. (Num. xi. 14.) \"Only,\" it is said, \"that we should remember the poor.\" (Gal. ii. 10.) And[fn-6-P688_554824:19-nf] how did they bring these forward? They fasted. \"Look you out seven men,\" etc. (v. 3.) It is not simply, spiritual men, but, \"full of the Spirit and of wisdom, \"for it needed very great superiority of mind (filosofiaj) to bear the complainings of widows. For what profits it, that the dispenser of alms steal not, if nevertheless he waste all, or be harsh and easily provoked? \"And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost.\" (v. 5.)

Such was the incontrovertible justness of his speech, they could not look it in the face; nevertheless, they sated their own animosity; and again they expected to terrify them in this way. By the fact also of his saying these things not in the presence of the Apostles, he gained a hearing more than he would otherwise have done; and then the suavity of his discourse and the justness of what was said, helped to persuade them. in fact, this man all but preached the Gospel. \"[fn-6-P677_536060:8-nf] Ye were persuaded,\" one may say, \"that ye had not strength to overthrow it. Wherefore did ye not believe?\" Such is the witness borne even by enemies. There it is four hundred, there, four thousand: and here the first movers were twelve. Let not the number which added itself affright you. (ch. ii. 41; iv. 4.) He might also have mentioned another instance, that of the Egyptian, but what he has spoken is fully sufficient. And he closes his speech with an alarming topic: \"Lest haply,\" etc. And he does not pronounce upon it, lest he should seem to be pleading their cause; but he reasons by way of syllogism froth the issue of the matter. And he does not venture to pronounce that it is not of men, nor yet that it is of God; for bad he said that it was of God. they would have gainsaid him: but had he said that it was of men, they would again have taken prompt measures. Therefore he bids them wait for the end, saying, \"Refrain,\" But they once more threaten knowing indeed that they avail nothing, but doing after their manner. Such is the nature of wickedness: it attempts even impossibilities.-\"And after this man rose up Judas,\" etc. These things Josephus relates in detail. (Ant. xx. 8; ib. v. 2; xviii. 1. B. J. ii. 8. 1.) But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm: that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of persons![fn-6-P678_538091:9-nf] And he does not say, \"But if ye do not overthrow it, it is of God;\" but, \"If it be of God, it will not be overthrown.\" \"And to him they agreed.\" (v. 40.) They reverenced the high character of the man. \"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.\" (v. 41.) What miracles so wonderful as this? Nowhere is the like of this recorded of the old saints: for Jeremiah indeed was scourged for the word of God, and they threatened Elijah, and the rest: but in this case, even by this very thing, and not only by their miracles, these showed forth the power of God. He does not say, that they were not pained, but that though pained they rejoiced. How does this appear? From their boldness afterwards: they were so instant still, even after their beatings, in preaching the word. \"But in the temple,\" it says, \"and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\" (v. 42.) \"And in those days \"-when these things were done, when there were scourgings, when there were threatenings, when the disciples were multiplying-also, it says, \"there arose a murmuring.\" (ch. vi. 1.) And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict order in a multitude. \"There arose a murmuring,\"etc. to,-\"And[fn-6-P679_539639:10-nf] a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.-There arose murmuring against the Hebrews \"-for that description of people seemed to be more honorable-\" because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.\"[fn-6-P680_540664:11-nf] (v. 1-7.) So then there was a daily ministration for the widows. And observe how he calls it a \"ministration\" (diakonia), and not directly alms: extolling by this at once the doers, and those to whom it was done. \"Were neglected.\" This did not arise from malice, but perhaps from the carelessness of the multitude. And therefore he brought it forward openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it was a great evil that it existed.[fn-6-P681_541655:12-nf] \"Then the twelve,\" etc. (v. 2.) Do you observe[fn-6-P682_542527:13-nf] how outward concerns succeed to inward? They do not act at their own discretion, but plead for themselves to the congregation. So ought it to be done now. \"It is not reason,\" says he, \"that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\" First he puts to them the unreasonableness of the thing; that it is not possible for both things to be done with the same attention: just as when they were about to ordain Matthias, they first show the necessity of the thing, that one was deficient, and there must needs be twelve. And so here they showed the necessity; and they did it not sooner, but waited till the murmuring arose; nor, on the other hand, did they suffer this to spread far. And, lo! they leave the decision to them: those who pleased all, those who of all were honestly reputed, them they present:[fn-6-P683_543553:14-nf] not now twelve, but \"seven, full of the Spirit and of wisdom: well reported of\" for their conversation. (v. 3.) Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, \"Therefore must one of these men which have companied with us all the time\" (ch. i. 21): but not so here: for the case was not alike. And they do not now put it to the lot; they might indeed themselves have made the election, as moved by the Spirit: but nevertheless, they desire the testimony of the people. The fixing the number, and the ordaining them, and for this kind of business, rested with them: but the choice of the men they make over to the people, that they might not seem to act from favor: just as God also leaves it to Moses to choose as elders those whom he knew. (Num. xi. 16.) \"And of wisdom.\" For indeed there needs much wisdom in such ministrations. For think not, because he hath not the word committed unto him, that such an one has no need of wisdom: he does need it, and much too. \"But we,\" saith he, \"will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.\" (v. 4.) Again they plead for themselves, beginning and ending with this. \"Will give ourselves continually,\" he saith. For so it behooved, not just to do the mere acts, or in any chance way, but to be continually doing them. \"And the saying,\" we are told, \"pleased the whole multitude.\" (v. 5, 6.) This too was worthy of their wisdom. All approved of what was said so sensible was it. \"And they chose,\" it says (again it is the people (autoi) that choose,) \"Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.\" They separated them from the multitude, and it is the people (autoi) that draw them, not the Apostles that lead them. Observe how he avoids all that is superfluous: he does not tell in what way it was done, but that they were ordained (exeirotonhqhsan) with prayer: for this is the meaning of xeirotonia, (i.e. \"putting forth the hand,\") or ordination: the hand of the man is laid upon (the person,) but the whole work is of God, and it is His hand which toucheth the head of the one ordained, if he be duly ordained. \"And the word of God,\" it says, \"increased: and the number of the disciples multiplied.\" (v. 7.) It is not for nothing that he says this: it shows how great is the virtue of alms and good order. And as he is about in the sequel to enlarge (aucein) upon the affair of Stephen, he puts first the causes which led to it. \"And many,\" he says, \"of the priests were obedient to the faith.\" For[fn-6-P684_546413:15-nf] since they perceived such to be the mind of their ruler and teacher, they put the matter to the test of facts.-It is also a subject for wonder, how it was that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and how it was that the Apostles were not rejected by them. But what sort of rank these bore, and what sort of office they received, this is what we need to learn. Was it that of Deacons? And yet this is not the case in the Churches. But[fn-6-P685_547436:16-nf] is it to the Presbyters that the management belongs? And yet at present there was no Bishop, but the Apostles only. Whence I think it clearly and manifestily follows, that neither Deacons nor Presbyters is their designation: but it was for this particular purpose that they were ordained.[fn-6-P686_551764:17-nf] And this business was not simply handed over to them without further ceremony, but the Apostles prayed over them, that power might be given to them. But observe, I pray you, if there were need of seven men for this, great in proportion must have been the sums of money that flowed in, great in proportion also the number of widows. So then the prayers were not made in an off-hand way, but with much deliberate attention: and this office,[fn-6-P687_552972:18-nf] as well as preaching, was thus brought to good effect; for what they did, they effected mostly by the means of these (their prayers.) Thus they were enabled to give their attention to things spiritual; thus were these also free to undertake long journeys; thus were these put in trust with the word. But the writer does not say this, nor extol them, but that it was \"not reason\" that they should leave the work given to them. Thus they had been taught by Moses's example not to undertake the management of everything by themselves. (Num. xi. 14.) \"Only,\" it is said, \"that we should remember the poor.\" (Gal. ii. 10.) And[fn-6-P688_554824:19-nf] how did they bring these forward? They fasted. \"Look you out seven men,\" etc. (v. 3.) It is not simply, spiritual men, but, \"full of the Spirit and of wisdom, \"for it needed very great superiority of mind (filosofiaj) to bear the complainings of widows. For what profits it, that the dispenser of alms steal not, if nevertheless he waste all, or be harsh and easily provoked? \"And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost.\" (v. 5.) And in this regard Philip also was admirable: for it is of him that the writer says: \"And we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.\"-(ch. xxi. 8.) Dost thou mark how matters are ordered quite otherwise than after the matter of men? \"And the number of disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem.\" (v. 7.) In Jerusalem the multitude increased. Wonderful, where Christ was slain, there the preaching increased! And not only was it not the case that some were offended then in the manner of Ananias, but the awe became even greater: while these are scourged, those threatening, those tempting the Spirit, those murmuring. But I would have thee remark under what circumstances the multitude increased: after these trials, then it was that the multitude increased, and not before. Mark also how great the mercy of God. Of those chief-priests, of the very men who had indignation and sore displeasure and so cried out and said, \"He saved others, Himself He cannot save;\" of these same,\" Many,\" it says, \"were obedient unto the faith.\" (Matt. xxvii. 42.)

And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict order in a multitude. \"There arose a murmuring,\"etc. to,-\"And[fn-6-P679_539639:10-nf] a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.-There arose murmuring against the Hebrews \"-for that description of people seemed to be more honorable-\" because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.\"[fn-6-P680_540664:11-nf] (v. 1-7.) So then there was a daily ministration for the widows. And observe how he calls it a \"ministration\" (diakonia), and not directly alms: extolling by this at once the doers, and those to whom it was done. \"Were neglected.\" This did not arise from malice, but perhaps from the carelessness of the multitude. And therefore he brought it forward openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it was a great evil that it existed.[fn-6-P681_541655:12-nf] \"Then the twelve,\" etc. (v. 2.) Do you observe[fn-6-P682_542527:13-nf] how outward concerns succeed to inward? They do not act at their own discretion, but plead for themselves to the congregation. So ought it to be done now. \"It is not reason,\" says he, \"that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\" First he puts to them the unreasonableness of the thing; that it is not possible for both things to be done with the same attention: just as when they were about to ordain Matthias, they first show the necessity of the thing, that one was deficient, and there must needs be twelve. And so here they showed the necessity; and they did it not sooner, but waited till the murmuring arose; nor, on the other hand, did they suffer this to spread far. And, lo! they leave the decision to them: those who pleased all, those who of all were honestly reputed, them they present:[fn-6-P683_543553:14-nf] not now twelve, but \"seven, full of the Spirit and of wisdom: well reported of\" for their conversation. (v. 3.) Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, \"Therefore must one of these men which have companied with us all the time\" (ch. i. 21): but not so here: for the case was not alike. And they do not now put it to the lot; they might indeed themselves have made the election, as moved by the Spirit: but nevertheless, they desire the testimony of the people. The fixing the number, and the ordaining them, and for this kind of business, rested with them: but the choice of the men they make over to the people, that they might not seem to act from favor: just as God also leaves it to Moses to choose as elders those whom he knew. (Num. xi. 16.) \"And of wisdom.\" For indeed there needs much wisdom in such ministrations. For think not, because he hath not the word committed unto him, that such an one has no need of wisdom: he does need it, and much too. \"But we,\" saith he, \"will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.\" (v. 4.) Again they plead for themselves, beginning and ending with this. \"Will give ourselves continually,\" he saith. For so it behooved, not just to do the mere acts, or in any chance way, but to be continually doing them. \"And the saying,\" we are told, \"pleased the whole multitude.\" (v. 5, 6.) This too was worthy of their wisdom. All approved of what was said so sensible was it. \"And they chose,\" it says (again it is the people (autoi) that choose,) \"Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.\" They separated them from the multitude, and it is the people (autoi) that draw them, not the Apostles that lead them. Observe how he avoids all that is superfluous: he does not tell in what way it was done, but that they were ordained (exeirotonhqhsan) with prayer: for this is the meaning of xeirotonia, (i.e. \"putting forth the hand,\") or ordination: the hand of the man is laid upon (the person,) but the whole work is of God, and it is His hand which toucheth the head of the one ordained, if he be duly ordained. \"And the word of God,\" it says, \"increased: and the number of the disciples multiplied.\" (v. 7.) It is not for nothing that he says this: it shows how great is the virtue of alms and good order. And as he is about in the sequel to enlarge (aucein) upon the affair of Stephen, he puts first the causes which led to it. \"And many,\" he says, \"of the priests were obedient to the faith.\" For[fn-6-P684_546413:15-nf] since they perceived such to be the mind of their ruler and teacher, they put the matter to the test of facts.-It is also a subject for wonder, how it was that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and how it was that the Apostles were not rejected by them. But what sort of rank these bore, and what sort of office they received, this is what we need to learn. Was it that of Deacons? And yet this is not the case in the Churches. But[fn-6-P685_547436:16-nf] is it to the Presbyters that the management belongs? And yet at present there was no Bishop, but the Apostles only. Whence I think it clearly and manifestily follows, that neither Deacons nor Presbyters is their designation: but it was for this particular purpose that they were ordained.[fn-6-P686_551764:17-nf] And this business was not simply handed over to them without further ceremony, but the Apostles prayed over them, that power might be given to them. But observe, I pray you, if there were need of seven men for this, great in proportion must have been the sums of money that flowed in, great in proportion also the number of widows. So then the prayers were not made in an off-hand way, but with much deliberate attention: and this office,[fn-6-P687_552972:18-nf] as well as preaching, was thus brought to good effect; for what they did, they effected mostly by the means of these (their prayers.) Thus they were enabled to give their attention to things spiritual; thus were these also free to undertake long journeys; thus were these put in trust with the word. But the writer does not say this, nor extol them, but that it was \"not reason\" that they should leave the work given to them. Thus they had been taught by Moses's example not to undertake the management of everything by themselves. (Num. xi. 14.) \"Only,\" it is said, \"that we should remember the poor.\" (Gal. ii. 10.) And[fn-6-P688_554824:19-nf] how did they bring these forward? They fasted. \"Look you out seven men,\" etc. (v. 3.) It is not simply, spiritual men, but, \"full of the Spirit and of wisdom, \"for it needed very great superiority of mind (filosofiaj) to bear the complainings of widows. For what profits it, that the dispenser of alms steal not, if nevertheless he waste all, or be harsh and easily provoked? \"And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost.\" (v. 5.) And in this regard Philip also was admirable: for it is of him that the writer says: \"And we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.\"-(ch. xxi. 8.) Dost thou mark how matters are ordered quite otherwise than after the matter of men? \"And the number of disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem.\" (v. 7.) In Jerusalem the multitude increased. Wonderful, where Christ was slain, there the preaching increased! And not only was it not the case that some were offended then in the manner of Ananias, but the awe became even greater: while these are scourged, those threatening, those tempting the Spirit, those murmuring. But I would have thee remark under what circumstances the multitude increased: after these trials, then it was that the multitude increased, and not before. Mark also how great the mercy of God. Of those chief-priests, of the very men who had indignation and sore displeasure and so cried out and said, \"He saved others, Himself He cannot save;\" of these same,\" Many,\" it says, \"were obedient unto the faith.\" (Matt. xxvii. 42.)

See here, I pray you, how mildly Gamaliel reasons, and how he says but a few words to them, and does not recount ancient histories, although he might have done so, but more recent instances, which are most powerful to produce belief. With this view he throws out a hint himself, saying, \"For before. these days\" (v. 36): meaning, not many days before. Now had he at once said, \"Let these men go,\" both himself would have fallen into suspicion, and his speech would not have been so effective: but after the examples, it acquired its own proper force. And he mentions not one instance, but a second also: \"for,\" saith the Scripture, \"in the mouth of two witnesses\" (Matt. xviii. 16): and yet he had it in his power to mention even three. \"Refrain from these men.\" (v. 38.) See how mild his manner is, and his speech not long, but concise, and his mention even of those (impostors) how free from passion: \"And all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered.\" And[fn-6-P675_533550:6-nf] for all this he does not blaspheme Christ. They heard him, all these unbelievers, heard him, these Jews. [\"For if this council or this work be of men, it will come to naught.\"] Well then, since it did not come to nought, it is not of men. [\"But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it.\"] (v. 39.) Once more he checks them by the impossibility and the inexpediency of the thing, saying, \"Lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.\"[fn-6-P676_534552:7-nf] And he does not say, If Christ be God; but the work (itself) declares (this). He does not pronounce upon it, either that, it is \"of men,\" or that it is \"of God;\" but he leaves the proof to the future. \"They were persuaded [by him].\" (v. 40.) Then why, it may be asked, do ye scourge them? Such was the incontrovertible justness of his speech, they could not look it in the face; nevertheless, they sated their own animosity; and again they expected to terrify them in this way. By the fact also of his saying these things not in the presence of the Apostles, he gained a hearing more than he would otherwise have done; and then the suavity of his discourse and the justness of what was said, helped to persuade them. in fact, this man all but preached the Gospel. \"[fn-6-P677_536060:8-nf] Ye were persuaded,\" one may say, \"that ye had not strength to overthrow it. Wherefore did ye not believe?\" Such is the witness borne even by enemies. There it is four hundred, there, four thousand: and here the first movers were twelve. Let not the number which added itself affright you. (ch. ii. 41; iv. 4.) He might also have mentioned another instance, that of the Egyptian, but what he has spoken is fully sufficient. And he closes his speech with an alarming topic: \"Lest haply,\" etc. And he does not pronounce upon it, lest he should seem to be pleading their cause; but he reasons by way of syllogism froth the issue of the matter. And he does not venture to pronounce that it is not of men, nor yet that it is of God; for bad he said that it was of God. they would have gainsaid him: but had he said that it was of men, they would again have taken prompt measures. Therefore he bids them wait for the end, saying, \"Refrain,\" But they once more threaten knowing indeed that they avail nothing, but doing after their manner. Such is the nature of wickedness: it attempts even impossibilities.-\"And after this man rose up Judas,\" etc. These things Josephus relates in detail. (Ant. xx. 8; ib. v. 2; xviii. 1. B. J. ii. 8. 1.) But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm: that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of persons![fn-6-P678_538091:9-nf] And he does not say, \"But if ye do not overthrow it, it is of God;\" but, \"If it be of God, it will not be overthrown.\" \"And to him they agreed.\" (v. 40.) They reverenced the high character of the man. \"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.\" (v. 41.) What miracles so wonderful as this? Nowhere is the like of this recorded of the old saints: for Jeremiah indeed was scourged for the word of God, and they threatened Elijah, and the rest: but in this case, even by this very thing, and not only by their miracles, these showed forth the power of God. He does not say, that they were not pained, but that though pained they rejoiced. How does this appear? From their boldness afterwards: they were so instant still, even after their beatings, in preaching the word. \"But in the temple,\" it says, \"and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\" (v. 42.) \"And in those days \"-when these things were done, when there were scourgings, when there were threatenings, when the disciples were multiplying-also, it says, \"there arose a murmuring.\" (ch. vi. 1.) And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict order in a multitude. \"There arose a murmuring,\"etc. to,-\"And[fn-6-P679_539639:10-nf] a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.-There arose murmuring against the Hebrews \"-for that description of people seemed to be more honorable-\" because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.\"[fn-6-P680_540664:11-nf] (v. 1-7.)

Accordingly it remains that if we are to believe that the Lord Jesus, in this prayer, prayed for all of His own who either then were or should thereafter be in this life, which is a state of trial upon earth,[fn-35-P3525_1955083:14-nf] we must so understand the expression, \"through their word,\" as to believe that it here signified the word of faith itself which they preached in the world, and that it was called their word because it was primarily and principally preached by them. For it was already in the course of being preached by them in the earth when Paul received that same word of theirs by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Whence also it came about that he compared the Gospel with them, lest by any means he had run, or should run, in vain; and they gave him their right hand because in him also they found, although not given him by them, their own word which they were already preaching, and in which they were now established.[fn-35-P3526_1955990:15-nf] And in regard to this word of the resurrection of Christ, it is said by the same apostle, \"Whether it were I, or they, so we preach, and so ye believed;\"[fn-35-P3527_1956164:16-nf] and again, \"This is the word of faith,\" he says, \"which we preach, that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth that Jesus is the Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\"[fn-35-P3528_1956412:17-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles we read that in Christ, God hath marked out [the ground of] faith unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead.[fn-35-P3529_1956585:18-nf] Accordingly, this word of faith, because principally and primarily preached by the apostles who adhered to Him, was called their word. Not, however, on that account does it cease to be the word of God because it is called their word; for the same apostle says that the Thessalonians received it from him \"not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God.\"[fn-35-P3530_1956977:19-nf] \"Of God,\" for the very reason that it was freely given by God; but called \"their word,\" because primarily and principally committed to them by God to be preached. In the same way also the thief mentioned above had in the matter of his own faith their word, which was called theirs precisely because the preaching of it primarily and principally pertained to the office they filled. And once more, when murmuring arose among the Grecian widows in reference to the serving of the tables, previous to the time when Paul was brought to the faith of Christ, the reply given by the apostles, who before then had adhered to the Lord, was: \"It is not good that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\"[fn-35-P3531_1957704:20-nf] Then it was that they provided for the ordination of deacons, that they themselves might not be drawn aside from the duty of preaching the word. Hence that was properly enough called their word which is the word of faith, whereby all, from whatever quarter they had heard it, believed on Christ, or, as yet to hear it, should thereafter believe. In this prayer, therefore, all whom He redeemed, whether then alive or thereafter to live in the flesh, were prayed for by our Redeemer when, praying for the apostles who were then with Him, He also conjoined those who were yet to believe on Him through their word. But what, after such conjunction, He then proceeds to say, must be reserved for discussion in another discourse.","title":"Tractate CIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_07_anf07_29_on_the_creation_of_the_world","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Behold the seven horns of the Lamb,[fn-45-P4519_1737565:25-nf] the seven eyes of God[fn-45-P4520_1737603:26-nf] -the seven eyes are the seven spirits of the Lamb;[fn-45-P4521_1737673:27-nf] seven torches burning before the throne of God[fn-45-P4522_1737737:28-nf] seven golden candlesticks,[fn-45-P4523_1737781:29-nf] seven young sheep,[fn-45-P4524_1737817:30-nf] the seven women in Isaiah,[fn-45-P4525_1737865:31-nf] the seven churches in Paul,[fn-45-P4526_1737910:32-nf] seven deacons,[fn-45-P4527_1737942:33-nf] seven angels,[fn-45-P4528_1737973:34-nf] seven trumpets,[fn-45-P4529_1738007:35-nf] seven seals to the book, seven periods of seven days with which Pentecost is completed, the seven weeks in Daniel,[fn-45-P4530_1738149:36-nf] also the forty-three weeks in Daniel;[fn-45-P4531_1738205:37-nf] with Noah, seven of all clean things in the ark;[fn-45-P4532_1738269:38-nf] seven revenges of Cain,[fn-45-P4533_1738311:39-nf] seven years for a debt to be acquitted,[fn-45-P4534_1738369:40-nf] the lamp with seven orifices,[fn-45-P4535_1738417:41-nf] seven pillars of wisdom in the house of Solomon.[fn-45-P4536_1738484:42-nf] ","title":"On the Creation of the World","author":"Victorinus"},{"chapter":6,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_07_anf07_29_on_the_creation_of_the_world","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"ANF-07","text":"Behold the seven horns of the Lamb,[fn-45-P4519_1737565:25-nf] the seven eyes of God[fn-45-P4520_1737603:26-nf] -the seven eyes are the seven spirits of the Lamb;[fn-45-P4521_1737673:27-nf] seven torches burning before the throne of God[fn-45-P4522_1737737:28-nf] seven golden candlesticks,[fn-45-P4523_1737781:29-nf] seven young sheep,[fn-45-P4524_1737817:30-nf] the seven women in Isaiah,[fn-45-P4525_1737865:31-nf] the seven churches in Paul,[fn-45-P4526_1737910:32-nf] seven deacons,[fn-45-P4527_1737942:33-nf] seven angels,[fn-45-P4528_1737973:34-nf] seven trumpets,[fn-45-P4529_1738007:35-nf] seven seals to the book, seven periods of seven days with which Pentecost is completed, the seven weeks in Daniel,[fn-45-P4530_1738149:36-nf] also the forty-three weeks in Daniel;[fn-45-P4531_1738205:37-nf] with Noah, seven of all clean things in the ark;[fn-45-P4532_1738269:38-nf] seven revenges of Cain,[fn-45-P4533_1738311:39-nf] seven years for a debt to be acquitted,[fn-45-P4534_1738369:40-nf] the lamp with seven orifices,[fn-45-P4535_1738417:41-nf] seven pillars of wisdom in the house of Solomon.[fn-45-P4536_1738484:42-nf] ","title":"On the Creation of the World","author":"Victorinus"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_32_similitude_ninth","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"89","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"And they who believed from the ninth mountain, which was deserted, and had in it creeping things and wild beasts which destroy men, were the following: they who had the stains as servants,[fn-9-P993_257323:43-nf] who discharged their duty ill, and who plundered widows and orphans of their livelihood, and gained possessions for themselves from the ministry, which they had received.[fn-9-P994_257556:44-nf] If, therefore, they remain under the dominion of the same desire, they are dead, and there is no hope of life for them; but if they repent, and finish their ministry in a holy manner, they shall be able to live.

We will therefore give a fuller explanation of the force and the reason of a change which (is so great, that it) almost suggests the presumption that it is a different flesh which is to rise again; as if, indeed, so great a change amounted to utter cessation, and a complete destruction of the former self. A distinction, however, must be made between a change, however great, and everything which has the character of destruction. For undergoing change is one thing, but being destroyed is another thing. Now this distinction would no longer exist, if the flesh were to suffer such a change as amounts to destruction. Destroyed, however, it must be by the change, unless it shall itself persistently remain throughout the altered condition which shall be exhibited in the resurrection. For precisely as it perishes, if it does not rise again, so also does it equally perish even if it does rise again, on the supposition that it is lost[fn-102-P10267_2871938:422-nf] in the change. It will as much fail of a future existence, as if it did not rise again at all. And how absurd is it to rise again for the purpose of not having a being, when it had it in its power not to rise again, and so lose airs being-because it had already begun its non-existence! Now, things which are absolutely different, as mutation and destruction are, will not admit of mixture and confusion; in their operations, too, they differ. One destroys, the other changes. Therefore, as that which is destroyed is not changed, so that which is changed is not destroyed. To perish is altogether to cease to be what a thing once was, whereas to be changed is to exist in another condition. Now, if a thing exists in another condition, it can still be the same thing itself; for since it does not perish, it has its existence still. A change, indeed, it has experienced, but not a destruction. A thing may undergo a complete change, and yet remain still the same thing. In like manner, a man also may be quite himself in substance even in the present life, and for all that undergo various changes-in habit, in bodily bulk, in health, in condition, in dignity, and in age-in taste, business, means, houses, laws and customs-and still lose nothing of his human nature, nor so to be made another man as to cease to be the same; indeed, I ought hardly to say another man, but another thing. This form of change even the Holy Scriptures give us instances of. The hand of Moses is changed, and it becomes like a dead one, bloodless, colourless, and stiff with cold; but on the recovery of heat, and on the restoration of its natural colour, it is again the same flesh and blood[fn-102-P10268_2873631:423-nf] Afterwards the face of the same Moses is changed,[fn-102-P10269_2873702:424-nf] with a brightness which eye could not bear. But he was Moses still, even when he was not visible. So also Stephen had already put on the appearance of an angel,[fn-102-P10270_2873889:425-nf] although they were none other than his human knees[fn-102-P10271_2873961:426-nf] which bent beneath the stoning. The Lord, again, in the retirement of the mount, had changed His raiment for a robe of light; but He still retained features which Peter could recognise.[fn-102-P10272_2874172:427-nf] In that same scene Moses also and Elias gave proof that the same condition of bodily existence may continue even in glory-the one in the likeness of a flesh which he had not yet recovered, the other in the reality of one which he had not yet put off.[fn-102-P10273_2874447:428-nf] It was as full of this splendid example that Paul said: \"Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.\"[fn-102-P10274_2874606:429-nf] But if you maintain that a transfiguration and a conversion amounts to the annihilation of any substance, then it follows that \"Saul, when changed into another man,\"[fn-102-P10275_2874794:430-nf] passed away from his own bodily substance; and that Satan himself, when \"transformed into an angel of light,\"[fn-102-P10276_2874924:431-nf] loses his own proper character. Such is not my opinion. So likewise changes, conversions and reformations will necessarily take place to bring about the resurrection, but the substance of the flesh will still be preserved safe.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_40_oration_xxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"11.

But as for such as are unmarried, it is the extremest scandal for them to be present at a banquet of men, especially men under the influence of wine. And let the men, fixing their eyes on the couch, and leaning without moving on their elbows, be present with their ears alone; and if they sit, let them not have their feet crossed, nor place one thigh on another, nor apply the hand to the chin. For it is vulgar not to bear one's self without support, and consequently a fault in a young man. And perpetually moving and changing one's position is a sign of frivolousness. It is the part of a temperate man also, in eating and drinking, to take a small portion, and deliberately, not eagerly, both at the beginning and during the courses and to leave off betimes, and so show his indifference. \"Eat,\" it is said, \"like a man what is set before you. Be the first to stop for the sake of regimen; and, if seated in the midst of several people, do not stretch out your hand before them.\"[fn-39-P3940_1202362:140-nf] You must never rush forward under the influence of gluttony; nor must you, though desirous, reach out your hand till some time, in as much as by greed one shows an uncontrolled appetite. Nor are you, in the midst of the repast, to exhibit yourselves hugging your food like wild beasts; nor helping yourselves to too much sauce, for man is not by nature a sauce-consumer, but a bread-eater. A temperate man, too, must rise before the general company, and retire quietly from the banquet. \"For at the time for rising,\" it is said, \"be not the last; haste home.\"[fn-39-P3941_1202950:141-nf] The twelve, having called together the multitude of the disciples, said, \"It is not meet for us to leave the word of God and serve tables.\"[fn-39-P3942_1203116:142-nf] If they avoided this, much more did they shun gluttony. And the apostles themselves, writing to the brethren at Antioch, and in Syria and Cilicia, said: \"It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no other burden than these necessary things, to abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication, from which, if you keep yourselves, ye shall do well.\"[fn-39-P3943_1203557:143-nf] But we must guard against drunkenness as against hemlock; for both drag down to death. We must also check excessive laughter and immoderate tears. For often people under the influence of wine, after laughing immoderately, then are, I know not how, by some impulse of intoxication moved to tears; for both effiminacy and violence are discordant with the word. And elderly people, looking on the young as children, may, though but very rarely, be playful with them, joking with them to train them in good behaviour. For example, before a bashful and silent youth, one might by way of pleasantry speak thus: \"This son of mine (I mean one who is silent) is perpetually talking.\" For a joke such as this enhances the youth's modesty, by showing the good qualities that belong to him playfully, by censure of the bad quantities, which do not. For this device is instructive, confirming as it does what is present by what is not present. Such, certainly, is the intention of him who says that a water-drinker and a sober man gets intoxicated and drunk. But if there are those who like to jest at people, we must be silent, and dispense with superfluous words like full cups. For such sport is dangerous. \"The mouth of the impetuous approaches to contrition.\"[fn-39-P3944_1204837:144-nf] \"Thou shalt not receive a foolish report, nor shall thou agree with an unjust person to be an unjust witness,\"[fn-39-P3945_1204968:145-nf] neither in calumnies nor in injurious speeches, much less evil practices. I also should think it right to impose a limit on the speech of rightly regulated persons, who are impelled to speak to one who maintains a conversation with them. \"For silence is the excellence of women, and the safe prize of the young; but good speech is characteristic of experienced, mature age. Speak, old man, at a banquet, for it is becoming to you. But speak without embarrassment, and with accuracy of knowledge. Youth, Wisdom also commands thee. Speak, if you must, with hesitation, on being twice asked; sum up your discourse in a few words.\"[fn-39-P3946_1205633:146-nf] But let both speakers regulate their discourse according to just proportion. For loudness of utterance is most insane; while an inaudible utterance is characteristic of a senseless man, for people will not hear: the one is the mark of pusillanimity, the other of arrogance. Let contentiousness in words, for the sake of a useless triumph, be banished; for our aim is to be free from perturbation. Such is the meaning of the phrase,[fn-39-P3947_1206097:147-nf] \"Peace to thee.\" Answer not a word before you hear. An enervated voice is the sign of effeminacy. But modulation in the voice is characteristic of a wise man, who keeps his utterance from loudness, from drawling, from rapidity, from prolixity. For we ought not to speak long or much, nor ought we to speak frivolously. Nor must we converse rapidly and rashly. For the voice itself, so to speak, ought to receive its just dues; and those who are vociferous and clamorous ought to be silenced.

They (the Jews) had therefore a law, a course of discipline, and a prophecy of future things. For God at the first, indeed, warning them by means of natural precepts, which from the beginning He had implanted in mankind, that is, by means of the Decalogue (which, if any one does not observe, he has no salvation), did then demand nothing more of them. As Moses says in Deuteronomy, \"These are all the words which the Lord spake to the whole assembly of the sons of Israel on the mount, and He added no more; and He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.\"[fn-82-P8243_2292624:172-nf] For this reason [He did so], that they who are willing to follow Him might keep these commandments. But when they turned themselves to make a calf, and had gone back in their minds to Egypt, desiring to be slaves instead of free-men, they were placed for the future in a state of servitude suited to their wish,-[a slavery] which did not indeed cut them off from God, but subjected them to the yoke of bondage; as Ezekiel the prophet, when stating the reasons for the giving of such a law, declares: \"And their eyes were after the desire of their heart; and I gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments in which they shall not live.\"[fn-82-P8244_2293288:173-nf] Luke also has recorded that Stephen, who was the first elected into the diaconate by the apostles,[fn-82-P8245_2293409:174-nf] and who was the first slain for the testimony of Christ, spoke regarding Moses as follows: \"This man did indeed receive the commandments of the living God to give to us, whom your fathers would not obey, but thrust [Him from them], and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; for we do not know what has happened to [this] Moses, who led us from the land of Egypt. And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifices to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their own hands. But God turned, and gave them up to worship the hosts of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets:[fn-82-P8246_2294152:175-nf] O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to Me sacrifices and oblations for forty years in the wilderness?

For unless our mind is strengthened by the power of His protection Who says in the gospel \"the kingdom of God is within you,\"[fn-61-P6111_2175480:23-nf] in vain do we fancy that we can defeat the plots of our airy foe by the aid of men who are living with us, or that we can avoid them by distance of place, or exclude them by the protection of walls. For though none of these things was wanting to Saint Paphnutius yet the tempter did not fail to find a way of access against him to attack him; nor did the encircling walls, or the solitude of the desert or the merits of all those saints in the congregation repulse that most foul spirit. But because the holy servant of God had fixed the hope of his heart not on those external things but on Him Who is the judge of all secrets, he could not be moved even by the machinations of such an assault as that. On the other hand did not the man whom envy had hurried into so grievous a sin enjoy the benefit of solitude and the protection of a retired dwelling, and intercourse with the blessed Abbot and Presbyter Isidore and other saints? And yet because the storm raised by the devil found him upon the sand, it not only drove in his house but actually overturned it. We need not then seek for our peace in externals, nor fancy that another person's patience can be of any use to the faults of our impatience. For just as \"the kingdom of God is within you,\" so \"a man's foes are they of his own household.\"[fn-61-P6112_2176806:24-nf] For no one is more my enemy than my own heart which is truly the one of my household closest to me. And therefore if we are careful, we cannot possibly be injured by intestine enemies. For where those of our own household are not opposed to us, there also the kingdom of God is secured in peace of heart. For if you diligently investigate the matter, I cannot be injured by any man however spiteful, if I do not fight against myself with warlike heart. But if I am injured, the fault is not owing to the other's attack, but to my own impatience. For as strong and solid food is good for a man in good health, so it is bad for a sick one. But it cannot hurt the man who takes it, unless the weakness of its recipient gives it its power to hurt. If then any similar temptation ever arises among brethren, we need never be shaken out of the even tenor of our ways and give an opening to the blasphemous snarls of men living in the world, nor wonder that some bad and detestable men have secretly found their way into the number of the saints, because so long as we are trodden down and trampled in the threshing floor of this world, the chaff which is destined for eternal fire is quite sure to be mingled with the choicest of the wheat. Finally if we bear in mind that Satan was chosen among the angels, and Judas among the apostles, and Nicholas the author of a detestable heresy among the deacons, it will be no wonder that the basest of men are found among the ranks of the saints. For although some maintain that this Nicholas was not the same man who was chosen for the work of the ministry by the Apostles,[fn-61-P6113_2178439:25-nf] nevertheless they cannot deny that he was of the number of the disciples, all of whom were clearly of such a character and so perfect as those few whom we can now with difficulty discover in the coenobia. Let us then bring forward not the fall of the above-mentioned brother, who fell in the desert with so grievous a collapse, nor that horrible stain which he afterwards wiped out by the copious tears of his penitence, but the example of the blessed Paphnutius; and let us not be destroyed by the ruin of the former, whose ingrained sin of envy was increased and made worse by his affected piety, but let us imitate with all our might the humility of the latter, which in his case was no sudden production of the quiet of the desert, but had been gained among men, and was consummated and perfected by solitude. However you should know that the evil of envy is harder to be cured than other faults, for I should almost say that a man whom it has once tainted with the mischief of its poison is without a remedy. For it is the plague of which it is figuratively said by the prophet: \"Behold I will send among you serpents, basilisks, against which there is no charm: and they shall bite you.\"[fn-61-P6114_2180237:26-nf] Rightly then are the stings of envy compared by the prophet to the deadly poison of basilisks, as by it the first author of all poisons and their chief perished and died. For he slew himself before him of whom he was envious, and destroyed himself before that he poured forth the poison of death against man: for \"by the envy of the devil death entered into the world: they therefore who are on his side follow him.\"[fn-61-P6115_2180674:27-nf] For just as he who was the first to be corrupted by the plague of that evil, admitted no remedy of penitence, nor any healing plaster, so those also who have given themselves up to be smitten by the same pricks, exclude all the aid of the sacred charmer, because as they are tormented not by the faults but by the prosperity of those of whom they are jealous, they are ashamed to display the real truth and look out for some external unnecessary and trifling causes of offence: and of these, because they are altogether false, vain is the hope of cure, while the deadly poison which they will not produce is lurking in their veins. Of which the wisest of men has fitly said: \"If a serpent bite without hissing, there is no supply for the charmer.\"[fn-61-P6116_2181444:28-nf] For those are silent bites, to which alone the medicine of the wise is no succour. For that evil is so far incurable that it is made worse by attentions, it is increased by services, is irritated by presents, because as the same Solomon says: \"envy endures nothing.\"[fn-61-P6117_2181728:29-nf] For just in proportion as another has made progress in humble submission or in the virtue of patience or in the merit of munificence, so is a man excited by worse pricks of envy, because he desires nothing less than the ruin or death of the man whom he envies. Lastly no submission on the part of their harmless brother could soften the envy of the eleven patriarchs, so that Scripture relates of them: \"But his brothers envied him because his father loved him, and they could not speak peaceably unto him\"[fn-61-P6118_2182256:30-nf] until their jealousy, which would not listen to any entreaties on the part of their obedient and submissive brother, desired his death, and would scarcely be satisfied with the sin of selling a brother. It is plain then thatenvy is worse than all faults, and harder to get rid of, as it is inflamed by those remedies by which the others are destroyed. For, for example, a man who is grieved by a loss that has been caused to him, is healed by a liberal compensation: one who is sore owing to a wrong done to him, is appeased by humble satisfaction being made. What can you do with one who is the more offended by the very fact that he sees you humbler and kinder, who is not aroused to anger by any greed which can be appeased by a bribe; or by any injurious attack or love of vengeance, which is overcome by obsequious services; but is only irritated by another's success and happiness? But who is there who in order to satisfy one who envies him, would wish to fall from his good fortune, or to lose his prosperity or to be involved in some calamity? Wherefore we must constantly implore the divine aid, to which nothing is impossible, in order that the serpent may not by a single bite of this evil destroy whatever is flourishing in us, and animated as it were by the life and quickening power of the Holy Ghost. For the other poisons of serpents, i.e., carnal sins and faults, in which human frailty is easily entangled and from which it is as easily purified, show some traces of their wounds in the flesh, whereby although the earthly body is most dangerously inflamed, yet if any charmer well skilled in divine incantations applies a cure and antidote or the remedy of words of salvation, the poisonous evil does not reach to the everlasting death of the soul. But the poison of envy as if emitted by the basilisk, destroys the very life of religion and faith, even before the wound is perceived in the body. For he does not raise himself up against men, but, in his blasphemy, against God, who carps at nothing in his brother except his felicity, and so blames no fault of man, but simply the judgment of God. This then is that \"root of bitterness springing up\"[fn-61-P6119_2184449:31-nf] which raises itself to heaven and tends to reproaching the very Author Who bestows good things on man. Nor shall anyone be disturbed because God threatens to send \"serpents, basilisks,\"[fn-61-P6120_2184654:32-nf] to bite those by whose crimes He is offended. For although it is certain that God cannot be the author of envy, yet it is fair and worthy of the divine judgment that, while good gifts are bestowed on the humble and refused to the proud and reprobate, those who, as the Apostle says, deserve to be given over \"to a reprobate mind,\"[fn-61-P6121_2185005:33-nf] should be smitten and consumed by envy sent as it were by Him, according to this passage: \"They have provoked me to jealousy by them that are no gods: and I will provoke them to jealousy by them that are no nation.\"[fn-61-P6122_2185238:34-nf] ","title":"XVIII.

For when the fury of the gentile potentates was raging against Christ's most chosen members, and attacked those especially who were of priestly rank, the wicked persecutor's wrath was vented on Laurentius the deacon, who was pre-eminent not only in the performance of the sacred rites, but also in the management of the church's property[fn-40-P4099_1051625:3-nf] , promising himself double spoil from one man's capture: for if he forced him to surrender the sacred treasures, he would also drive him out of the pale of true religion. And so this man, so greedy of money and such a foe to the truth, arms himself with double weapon: with avarice to plunder the gold; with impiety to carry off Christ. He demands of the guileless guardian of the sanctuary that the church wealth on which his greedy mind was set should be brought to him. But the holy deacon showed him where he had them stored, by pointing to the many troops of poor saints, in the feeding and clothing of whom he had a store of riches which he could hot lose, and which were the more entirely safe that the money had been spent on so holy a cause.","title":"Sermon LXXXV.
