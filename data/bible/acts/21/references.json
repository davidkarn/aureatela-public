The legends of the \"Wandering Jew\" have grown out of corresponding instincts among Christians. To me they appear like the profane \"Passion-plays\" lately revived among Christians,-a most unwarrantable form of teaching even truth. But as to the work itself, seeing it exists, I must acknowledge that it seems to me a valuable relic of antiquity, and an interesting specimen of the feelings and convictions of those believers over whom St. James presided in Jerusalem:[fn-2-P268_16416:10-nf] \"Israelites indeed,\" but \"zealous of the law.\" They were now convinced that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, with Moses and all the prophets, looked for the Messiah who had appeared in Jesus of Nazareth. The author of this book was anxious to show that the twelve patriarchs were twelve believers in the Paschal Lamb, and that they died in Christian penitence and faith.","title":"Introductory Notice to the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs","author":"The Twelve Patriarchs"},{"chapter":21,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_06_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"Chrysostom: But, my admirable and excellent Sir, this is the very reason why I took the precaution of saying that it was a good thing to employ this kind of deceit, not only in war, and in dealing with enemies, but also in peace, and in dealing with our dearest friends. For as a proof that it is beneficial not only to the deceivers, but also to those who are deceived; if you go to any of the physicians and ask them how they relieve their patients from disease, they will tell you that they do not depend upon their professional skill alone, but sometimes conduct the sick to health by availing themselves of deceit, and blending the assistance which they derive from it with their art. For when the waywardness of the patient and the obstinacy of the complaint baffle the counsels of the physicians, it is then necessary to put on the mask of deceit in order that, as on the stage, they may be able to hide what really takes place. But, if you please, I will relate to you one instance of stratagem out of many which I have heard of being contrived by the sons of the healing art.[fn-2-P297_104828:13-nf] A man was once suddenly attacked by a fever of great severity; the burning heat increased, and the patient rejected the remedies which could have reduced it and craved for a draught of pure wine, passionately entreating all who approached to give it him and enable him to satiate this deadly craving-I say deadly, for if any one had gratified this request he would not only have exasperated the fever, but also have driven the unhappy man frantic. Thereupon, professional skill being baffled, and at the end of its resources and utterly thrown away, stratagem stepped in and displayed its power in the way which I will now relate. For the physician took an earthen cup brought straight out of the furnace, and having steeped it in wine, then drew it out empty, filled it with water, and, having ordered the chamber where the sick man lay to be darkened with curtains that the light might not reveal the trick, he gave it him to drink, pretending that it was filled with undiluted wine. And the man, before he had taken it in his hands, being deceived by the smell, did not wait to examine what was given him, but convinced by the odor, and deceived by the darkness, eagerly gulped down the draught, and being satiated with it immediately shook off the feeling of suffocation and escaped the imminent peril.[fn-2-P298_106242:14-nf] Do you see the advantage of deceit? And if any one were to reckon up all the tricks of physicians the list would run on to an indefinite length. And not only those who heal the body but those also who attend to the diseases of the soul may be found continually making use of this remedy. Thus the blessed Paul attracted those multitudes of Jews:[fn-2-P299_106757:15-nf] with this purpose he circumcised Timothy,[fn-3-P300_106821:16-nf] although he warned the Galatians in his letter[fn-3-P301_106887:17-nf] that Christ would not profit those who were circumcised. For this cause he submitted to the law, although he reckoned the righteousness which came from the law but loss after receiving the faith in Christ.[fn-3-P302_107109:18-nf] For great is the value of deceit, provided it be not introduced with a mischievous intention. In fact action of this kind ought not to be called deceit, but rather a kind of good management, cleverness and skill, capable of finding out ways where resources fail, and making up for the defects of the mind. For I would not call Phinees a murderer, although he slew two human beings with one stroke:[fn-3-P303_107531:19-nf] nor yet Elias after the slaughter of the 100 soldiers, and the captain,[fn-3-P304_107624:20-nf] and the torrents of blood which he caused to be shed by the destruction of those who sacrificed to devils.[fn-3-P305_107754:21-nf] For if we were to concede this, and to examine the bare deeds in themselves apart from the intention of the doers, one might if he pleased judge Abraham guilty of child-murder[fn-3-P306_107956:22-nf] and accuse his grandson[fn-3-P307_108001:23-nf] and descendant[fn-3-P308_108037:24-nf] of wickedness and guile. For the one got possession of the birthright, and the other transferred the wealth of the Egyptians to the host of the Israelites. But this is not the case: away with the audacious thought! For we not only acquit them of blame, but also admire them because of these things, since even God commended them for the same. For that man would fairly deserve to be called a deceiver who made an unrighteous use of the practice, not one who did so with a salutary purpose. And often it is necessary to deceive, and to do the greatest benefits by means of this device, whereas he who has gone by a straight course has done great mischief to the person whom he has not deceived.

But what am I doing? Forgetful of my purpose and filled with admiration for this young man, I have spoken in terms of praise of mere worldly advantages; whereas I should rather have commended our virgin for having rejected all these, and for having determined to regard herself not as a wealthy or a high born lady, but simply as a woman like other women. Her strength of mind almost passes belief. Though she had silks and jewels freely at her disposal, and though she was surrounded by crowds of eunuchs and serving-women, a bustling household of flattering and attentive domestics, and though the daintiest feasts that the abundance of a large house could supply were daily set before her; she preferred to all these severe fasting, rough clothing, and frugal living. For she had read the words of the Lord: \"they that wear soft clothing are in kings\" houses.\"[fn-50-P5085_1401144:3624-nf] She was filled with admiration for the manner of life followed by Elijah and by John the Baptist; both of whom confined and mortified their loins with girdles of skin,[fn-50-P5086_1401334:3625-nf] while the second of them is said to have come in the spirit and power of Elijah as the forerunner of the Lord.[fn-50-P5087_1401482:3626-nf] As such he prophesied while still in his mother's womb,[fn-50-P5088_1401573:3627-nf] and before the day of judgment won the commendation of the Judge.[fn-50-P5089_1401660:3628-nf] She admired also the zeal of Anna the daughter of Phanuel, who continued even to extreme old age to serve the Lord in the temple with prayers and fastings.[fn-50-P5090_1401902:3629-nf] When she thought of the four virgins who were the daughters of Philip,[fn-50-P5091_1402008:3630-nf] she longed to join their band and to be numbered with those who by their virginal purity have attained the grace of prophecy. With these and similar meditations she fed her mind, dreading nothing so much as to offend her grandmother and her mother. Although she was encouraged by their example, she was discouraged by their expressed wish and desire; not indeed that they disapproved of her holy purpose, but that the prize was so great that they did not venture to hope for it, or to aspire to it. Thus this poor novice in Christ's service was sorely perplexed. She came to hate all her fine apparel and cried like Esther to the Lord: \"Thou knowest that I abhor the sign of my high estate\"-that is to say, the diadem which she wore as queen-\"and that I abhor it as a menstruous rag.\"[fn-50-P5092_1402815:3631-nf] Among the holy and highborn ladies who have seen and known her some have been driven by the tempest which has swept over Africa, from the shores of Gaul to a refuge in the holy places. These tell me that secretly night after night, though no one knew of it but the virgins dedicated to God in her mother's and grandmother's retinue, Demetrias, refusing sheets of linen and beds of down, spread a rug of goat's hair upon the ground and watered her face with ceaseless tears. Night after night she cast herself in thought at the Saviour's knees and implored him to accept her choice, to fulfil her aspiration, and to soften the hearts of her grandmother and of her mother.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":21,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_13_the_encyclical_epistle_of_the_church_at_smyrnam","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"ANF-01","text":"His pursuers then, along with horsemen, and taking the youth with them, went forth at supper-time on the day of the preparation[fn-9-P947_172779:12-nf] with their usual weapons, as if going out against a robber.[fn-9-P948_172864:13-nf] And being come about evening [to the place where he was], they found him lying down in the upper room of[fn-9-P949_172996:14-nf] a certain little house, from which he might have escaped into another place; but he refused, saying, \"The will of God[fn-9-P950_173129:15-nf] be done.\"[fn-9-P951_173165:16-nf] So when he heard that they were come, he went down and spake with them.

For so a certain individual, but a fugitive likewise has chosen to maintain, and others have done the same who are unwilling to understand the meaning of that declaration of the Lord, that they may use it as a cloak for their cowardice, although it has had its persons as well as its times and reasons to which it specially applies. \"When they begin,\" He says, \"to persecute you, flee from city to city,\"[fn-19-P1953_584694:17-nf] We maintain that this belongs specially to the persons of the apostles, and to their times and circumstances, as the following sentences will show, which are suitable only to the apostles: \"Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and into a city of the Samaritans do not enter: but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-19-P1954_585047:18-nf] But to us the way of the Gentiles is also open, as in it we in fact were found, and to the very last we walk; and no city has been excepted. So we preach throughout all the world; nay, no special care even for Israel has been laid upon us, save as also we are bound to preach to all nations, Yes, and if we are apprehended, we shall not be brought into Jewish councils, nor scourged in Jewish synagogues, but we shall certainly be cited before Roman magistrates and judgment-seats.[fn-19-P1955_585546:19-nf] So, then, the circumstances of the apostles even required the injunction to flee, their mission being to preach first to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. That, therefore, this preaching might be fully accomplished in the case of those among whom this behoved first of all to be carried out-that the sons might receive bread before the dogs, for that reason He commanded them to flee then for a time-not with the object of eluding danger, under the plea strictly speaking which persecution urges (rather He was in the habit of proclaiming that they would suffer persecutions, and of teaching that these must be endured); but in order to further the proclamation of the Gospel message, lest by their being at once put down, the diffusion of the Gospel too might be prevented. Neither were they to flee to any city as if by stealth, but as if everywhere about to proclaim their message; and for this, everywhere about to undergo persecutions, until they should fulfil their teaching. Accordingly the Saviour says, \"Ye will not go over all the cities of Israel.\"[fn-19-P1956_586629:20-nf] So the command to flee was restricted to the limits of Judea. But no command that shows Judea to be specially the sphere for preaching applies to us, now that the Holy Spirit has been poured out upon all flesh. Therefore Paul and the apostles themselves, mindful of the precept of the Lord, bear this solemn testimony before Israel, which they had now filled with their doctrine-saying, \"It was necessary that the word of God should have been first delivered to you; but seeing ye have rejected it, and have not thought yourselves worthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.\"[fn-19-P1957_587233:21-nf] And from that time they turned their steps away, as those who went before them had laid it down, and departed into the way of the Gentiles, and entered into the cities of the Samaritans; so that, in very deed, their sound went forth into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.[fn-19-P1958_587547:22-nf] If, therefore, the prohibition against setting foot in the way of the Gentiles, and entering into the cities of the Samaritans, has come to an end, why should not the command to flee, which was issued at the same time, have come also to an end? Accordingly, from the time when, Israel having had its full measure, the apostles went over to the Gentiles, they neither fled from city to city, nor hesitated to suffer. Nay, Paul too, who had submitted to deliverance from persecution by being let down from the wall, as to do so was at this time a matter of command, refused in like manner now at the close of his ministry, and after the injunction had come to an end, to give in to the anxieties of the disciples, eagerly entreating him that he would not risk himself at Jerusalem, because of the sufferings in store for him which Agabus had foretold; but doing the very opposite, it is thus he speaks, \"What do ye, weeping and disquieting my heart? For I could wish not only to suffer bonds, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of my Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-19-P1959_588624:23-nf] And so they all said, \"Let the will of the Lord be done.\" What was the will of the Lord? Certainly no longer to flee from persecution. Otherwise they who had wished him rather to avoid persecution, might also have adduced that prior will of the Lord, in which He had commanded flight. Therefore, seeing even in the days of the apostles themselves, the command to flee was temporary, as were those also relating to the other things at the same time enjoined, that [command] cannot continue with us which ceased with our teachers, even although it had not been issued specially for them; or if the Lord wished it to continue, the apostles did wrong who were not careful to keep fleeing to the last.","title":"IX.

Again, it is possible for a man with evil will to desire what God wills in His goodness: for example, if a bad son wishes his father to die, when this is also the will of God. It is plain that the former wishes what God does not wish, and that the latter wishes what God does wish; and yet the filial love of the former is more in harmony with the good will of God, though its desire is different from God's, than the wart of filial affection of the latter, though its desire is the same as God's. So necessary is it, in determining whether a man's desire is one to be approved or disapproved, to consider what it is proper for man, and what it is proper for God, to desire, and what is in each case the real motive of the will. For God accomplishes some of His purposes, which of course are all good, through the evil desires of wicked men: for example, it was through the wicked designs of the Jews, working out the good purpose of the Father, that Christ was slain and this event was so truly good, that when the Apostle Peter expressed his unwillingness that it should take place, he was designated Satan by Him who had come to be slain.[fn-26-P2696_1259005:204-nf] How good seemed the intentions of the pious believers who were unwilling that Paul should go up to Jerusalem lest the evils which Agabus had foretold should there befall him![fn-26-P2697_1259205:205-nf] And yet it was God's purpose that he should suffer these evils for preaching the faith of Christ, and thereby become a witness for Christ. And this purpose of His, which was good, God did not fulfill through the good counsels of the Christians, but through the evil counsels of the Jews; so that those who opposed His purpose were more truly His servants than those who were the willing instruments of its accomplishment.","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":21,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_25_homily_xviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"\"The[fn-8-P805_689821:12-nf] persecution,\" say you, \"gained strength.\" True, but at that very time to men possessed before (by a hostile power) it brought deliverance.

Therefore he says: \"Because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ, that they might bring us into bondage, to whom we gave place by subjection not even for an hour.\"[fn-72-P7235_2092836:87-nf] Let us only attend to the clear[fn-72-P7236_2092888:88-nf] sense and to the reason of the thing, and the perversion of the Scripture will be apparent. When he first says, \"Neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised,\" and then adds, \"And that because of false brethren unawares brought in,\"[fn-72-P7237_2093166:89-nf] etc., he gives us an insight into his reason[fn-72-P7238_2093231:90-nf] for acting in a clean contrary way,[fn-72-P7239_2093298:91-nf] showing us wherefore he did that which he would neither have done nor shown to us, if that had not happened which induced him to act as he did. But then[fn-72-P7240_2093517:92-nf] I want you to tell us whether they would have yielded to the subjection that was demanded,[fn-72-P7241_2093622:93-nf] if these false brethren had not crept in to spy out their liberty? I apprehend not. They therefore gave way (in a partial concession), because there were persons whose weak faith required consideration.[fn-72-P7242_2093864:94-nf] For their rudimentary belief, which was still in suspense about the observance of the law, deserved this concessive treatment,[fn-72-P7243_2094029:95-nf] when even the apostle himself had some suspicion that he might have run, and be still running, in vain.[fn-72-P7244_2095362:96-nf] Accordingly, the false brethren who were the spies of their Christian liberty must be thwarted in their efforts to bring it under the yoke of their own Judaism before that Paul discovered whether his labour had been in vain, before that those who preceded him in the apostolate gave him their right hands of fellowship, before that he entered on the office of preaching to the Gentiles, according to their arrangement with him.[fn-72-P7245_2095807:97-nf] He therefore made some concession, as was necessary, for a time; and this was the reason why he had Timothy circumcised,[fn-72-P7246_2095970:98-nf] and the Nazarites introduced into the temple,[fn-72-P7247_2096034:99-nf] which incidents are described in the Acts. Their truth may be inferred from their agreement with the apostle's own profession, how \"to the Jews he became as a Jew, that he might gain the Jews, and to them that were under the law, as under the law,\"-and so here with respect to those who come in secretly,-\"and lastly, how he became all things to all men, that he might gain all.\"[fn-72-P7248_2096438:100-nf] Now, inasmuch as the circumstances require such an interpretation as this, no one will refuse to admit that Paul preached that God and that Christ whose law he was excluding all the while, however much he allowed it, owing to the times, but which he would have had summarily to abolish if he had published a new god. Rightly, then, did Peter and James and John give their right hand of fellowship to Paul, and agree on such a division of their work, as that Paul should go to the heathen, and themselves to the circumcision.[fn-72-P7249_2096989:101-nf] Their agreement, also, \"to remember the poor\"[fn-72-P7250_2097054:102-nf] was in complete conformity with the law of the Creator, which cherished the poor and needy, as has been shown in our observations on your Gospel.[fn-72-P7251_2097220:103-nf] It is thus certain that the question was one which simply regarded the law, while at the same time it is apparent what portion of the law it was convenient to have observed. Paul, however, censures Peter for not walking straightforwardly according to the truth of the gospel. No doubt he blames him; but it was solely because of his inconsistency in the matter of \"eating,\"[fn-72-P7252_2097640:104-nf] which he varied according to the sort of persons (whom he associated with) \"fearing them which were of the circumcision,\"[fn-72-P7253_2097819:105-nf] but not on account of any perverse opinion touching another god. For if such a question had arisen, others also would have been \"resisted face to face\" by the man who had not even spared Peter on the comparatively small matter of his doubtful conversation. But what do the Marcionites wish to have believed (on the point)? For the rest, the apostle must (be permitted to) go on with his own statement, wherein he says that \"a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith: \"[fn-72-P7254_2098327:106-nf] faith, however, in the same God to whom belongs the law also. For of course he would have bestowed no labour on severing faith from the law, when the difference of the god would, if there had only been any, have of itself produced such a severance. Justly, therefore, did he refuse to \"build up again (the structure of the law) which he had overthrown.\"[fn-72-P7255_2098701:107-nf] The law, indeed, had to be overthrown, from the moment when John \"cried in the wilderness, Prepare ye the ways of the Lord,\" that valleys[fn-72-P7256_2098886:108-nf] and hills and mountains may be filled up and levelled, and the crooked and the rough ways be made straight and smooth[fn-72-P7257_2099040:109-nf] -in other words, that the difficulties of the law might be changed into the facilities of the gospel.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":21,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"395","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In the first Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians: \"Let women be silent in the church.

But this was all the better for Peter, who was thereby made more approved, and evinced his own manly courage. And it says, \"there was earnest prayer making.\" It was the prayer of (filial) affection: it was for a father they asked, a father mild. \"There was,\" it says, \"earnest prayer.\" Hear how they were affected to their teachers. No factions, no perturbation:[fn-10-P1094_1038002:12-nf] but they betook them to prayer, to that alliance which is indeed invincible, to this they betook them for refuge. They did not say, \"What? I, poor insignificant creature that I am, to pray for him!\" for, as they acted of love, they did not give these things a thought. And observe, it was during the feast, that (their enemies) brought these trials upon them, that their worth might be the more approved. \"And when Herod,\" etc. (v. 6.)

He also smote him; so deeply did he sleep. (a) \"Rise,\" says he, \"quickly:\" this is not to hurry him (qorubountoj) but to persuade him not to delay. (c) \"And\" immediately \"his chains fell off from his hands.\" (b) How? answer me: where are the heretics?-let them answer. \"And the Angel said unto him,\" etc. (v. 8) by this also convincing him that it is no fancy: to this end he bids him gird himself and put on his shoes, that he may shake off his sleep, and know that it is real. (a) (e) \"And he wist not that it was true that was done by the Angel, but thought he saw a vision\" (v. 9): (e) well he might, by reason of the excessive greatness (uperbolhn) of the things taking place.

When there was no hindrance, then the Angel departed. For Peter would not have gone along (prohlqen), there being so many hindrances. \"And when he came to himself:\" for in very truth, it was indeed an amazement (ekplhcij). \"Now,\" saith he, \"I know\"-now, not then, when I was in the prison,-\"that the Lord hath sent His Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.

Probably[fn-10-P1097_1042582:15-nf] he that was always with them: for this is why he adds his distinctive name (to parashmon), \"whose surname was Mark.\" But observe, \"praying\" in the night, how much they got by it: what a good thing affliction is; how wakeful it made them! Do you see how great the gain resulting from the death of Stephen? do you see how great the benefit accruing from this imprisonment? For it is not by taking vengeance upon those who wronged them that God shows the greatness of the Gospel: but in the wrong-doers themselves,[fn-10-P1098_1043369:16-nf] without any harm happening to those, he shows what a mighty thing the afflictions in themselves are, that we may not seek in any wise deliverance from them, nor the avenging of our wrongs.

He was now an object of more affectionate desire to the disciples, not only in consequence of his being saved, but by his sudden coming in upon them and straightway departing. Now, both his friends learn all clearly; and the aliens also learn, if they had a mind, but they had not. The same thing happened in the case of Christ. \"Tell these things,\" he says, \"to James, and to the brethren.\" How free from all vainglory! Nor did he say, Make known these things to people everywhere, but, \"to the brethren. And he withdrew to another place:\" for he did not tempt God, nor fling himself into temptation: since, when they were commanded to do this, then they did it. \"Go,\" it was said, \"speak in the temple to the people.\" (ch. v. 20.) But this the Angel said not (here); on the contrary, by silently removing him and bringing him out by night, he gave him free permission to withdraw-and this too is done, that we may learn that many things are providentially brought about after the manner of men-so that he should not again fall into peril.-For that they may not say, \"It was his Angel,\"[fn-11-P1101_1046838:19-nf] after he was gone, they say this first, and then they see himself overthrowing their notion of the matter.

A pleasing thing, bloodshed, and unrighteous bloodshed, wickedness, impiety![fn-10-P1092_1036490:10-nf] He ministered to their senseless (atopoij) lusts: for, whereas he ought to have done the contrary, to check their rage, he made them more eager, as if he were an executioner, and not a physician to their diseased minds. (And this) though he had numberless warnings in the case of both his grandfather and his father Herod, how the former in consequence of his putting the children to death suffered the greatest calamities, and the latter by slaying John raised up against himself a grievous war. But[fn-10-P1093_1037138:11-nf] as they thought * * He feared lest Peter, in consequence of the slaying of James, should withdraw; and wishing to have him in safe keeping, he put him in prison: \"and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers\" (v. 4): the stricter the custody, the more wondrous the display. \"Peter therefore was kept in prison.\" (v. 5.) But this was all the better for Peter, who was thereby made more approved, and evinced his own manly courage. And it says, \"there was earnest prayer making.\" It was the prayer of (filial) affection: it was for a father they asked, a father mild. \"There was,\" it says, \"earnest prayer.\" Hear how they were affected to their teachers. No factions, no perturbation:[fn-10-P1094_1038002:12-nf] but they betook them to prayer, to that alliance which is indeed invincible, to this they betook them for refuge. They did not say, \"What? I, poor insignificant creature that I am, to pray for him!\" for, as they acted of love, they did not give these things a thought. And observe, it was during the feast, that (their enemies) brought these trials upon them, that their worth might be the more approved. \"And when Herod,\" etc. (v. 6.) See Peter sleeping, and not in distress or fear! That same night, after which he was to be brought forth, he slept, having cast all upon God. \"Between two soldiers, bound with two chains.\" (comp. 1 Pet. v. 7.) Mark, how strict the ward! \"And says, Arise.\" (v. 7.) The guards were asleep with him, and therefore perceived nothing of what was happening. \"And a light shined.\" What was the light for? In order that Peter might see as well as hear, and not imagine it to be all fancy. And the command, \"Arise quickly,[fn-10-P1095_1039495:13-nf] \" that he may not be remiss. He also smote him; so deeply did he sleep. (a) \"Rise,\" says he, \"quickly:\" this is not to hurry him (qorubountoj) but to persuade him not to delay. (c) \"And\" immediately \"his chains fell off from his hands.\" (b) How? answer me: where are the heretics?-let them answer. \"And the Angel said unto him,\" etc. (v. 8) by this also convincing him that it is no fancy: to this end he bids him gird himself and put on his shoes, that he may shake off his sleep, and know that it is real. (a) (e) \"And he wist not that it was true that was done by the Angel, but thought he saw a vision\" (v. 9): (e) well he might, by reason of the excessive greatness (uperbolhn) of the things taking place. Do you mark what a thing it is for a miracle to be excessive (ekplhttei shmeiou)? how it amazes (ekplhttei) the beholder? how it will not let the thing be believed?[fn-10-P1096_1041330:14-nf] For if Peter \"thought he saw a vision,\" though he had girded himself and put on his shoes, what would have been the case with another? \"And,\" it says, \"when they had passed the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate, which opened unto them of its own accord\" (v. 10): and yet the things that had happened within (the prison) were more marvellous: but this was now more after the manner of man. \"And having gone out, they went along one street and immediately (all `until') the Angel departed from him.\" (v. 11.) When there was no hindrance, then the Angel departed. For Peter would not have gone along (prohlqen), there being so many hindrances. \"And when he came to himself:\" for in very truth, it was indeed an amazement (ekplhcij). \"Now,\" saith he, \"I know\"-now, not then, when I was in the prison,-\"that the Lord hath sent His Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. And when he had considered\" (v. 12), it says: viz. where he was, or, that he must not without more ado depart but requite his Benefactor: \"he came to the house of Mary the mother of John.\" Who is this John? Probably[fn-10-P1097_1042582:15-nf] he that was always with them: for this is why he adds his distinctive name (to parashmon), \"whose surname was Mark.\" But observe, \"praying\" in the night, how much they got by it: what a good thing affliction is; how wakeful it made them! Do you see how great the gain resulting from the death of Stephen? do you see how great the benefit accruing from this imprisonment? For it is not by taking vengeance upon those who wronged them that God shows the greatness of the Gospel: but in the wrong-doers themselves,[fn-10-P1098_1043369:16-nf] without any harm happening to those, he shows what a mighty thing the afflictions in themselves are, that we may not seek in any wise deliverance from them, nor the avenging of our wrongs. And mark how the very servant-girls were henceforth upon an equality with them. \"For joy,\" it says, \"she opened not.\" (v. 13, 14.) This too is well done, that they likewise may not be amazed by seeing him at once, and that they may be incredulous, and their minds may be exercised. \"But ran in,\" etc. just as we are wont to do, she was eager to be herself the bringer of the good tidings, for good news it was indeed. \"And they said unto her, Thou art mad: but she constantly affirmed that it was even so: then said they, It is his Angel.\" (v. 15.) This is a truth, that each man has an Angel.[fn-10-P1099_1044431:17-nf] And what would the Angel?[fn-11-P1100_1045326:18-nf] It was from the time (of night) that they surmised this. But when he \"continued knocking, and when they had opened, and saw him, they were astonished. But he beckoning to them with his hand\" (v. 16, 17), made them keep quiet, to hear all that had happened to him. He was now an object of more affectionate desire to the disciples, not only in consequence of his being saved, but by his sudden coming in upon them and straightway departing. Now, both his friends learn all clearly; and the aliens also learn, if they had a mind, but they had not. The same thing happened in the case of Christ. \"Tell these things,\" he says, \"to James, and to the brethren.\" How free from all vainglory! Nor did he say, Make known these things to people everywhere, but, \"to the brethren. And he withdrew to another place:\" for he did not tempt God, nor fling himself into temptation: since, when they were commanded to do this, then they did it. \"Go,\" it was said, \"speak in the temple to the people.\" (ch. v. 20.) But this the Angel said not (here); on the contrary, by silently removing him and bringing him out by night, he gave him free permission to withdraw-and this too is done, that we may learn that many things are providentially brought about after the manner of men-so that he should not again fall into peril.-For that they may not say, \"It was his Angel,\"[fn-11-P1101_1046838:19-nf] after he was gone, they say this first, and then they see himself overthrowing their notion of the matter. Had it been the Angel, he would have knocked at the door, would not have retired to another place.

And do we, (you say), in all respects guileless souls and doves merely, love to go astray? I should think from eagerness to live. But let it be so, that meaning departs from their epistles. And yet, that the apostles endured such sufferings, we know: the teaching is clear. This only I perceive in running through the Acts. I am not at all on the search. The prisons there, and the bonds, and the scourges, and the big stones, and the swords, and the onsets by the Jews, and the assemblies of the heathen, and the indictments by tribunes, and the hearing of causes by kings, and the judgment-seats of proconsuls and the name of Cµsar, do not need an interpreter. That Peter is struck,[fn-111-P11114_3155924:110-nf] that Stephen is overwhelmed by stones,[fn-111-P11115_3156174:111-nf] that James is slain[fn-111-P11116_3156215:112-nf] as is a victim at the altar, that Paul is beheaded has been written in their own blood. And if a heretic wishes his confidence to rest upon a public record, the archives of the empire will speak, as would the stones of Jerusalem. We read the lives of the Cµsars: At Rome Nero was the first who stained with blood the rising faith. Then is Peter girt by another,[fn-111-P11117_3156652:113-nf] when he is made fast to the cross. Then does Paul obtain a birth suited to Roman citizenship, when in Rome he springs to life again ennobled by martyrdom. Wherever I read of these occurrencer so soon as I do so, I learn to suffer; nor does it signify to me which I follow as teachers of martyrdom, whether the declarations or the deaths of the apostles, save that in their deaths I recall their declarations also. For they would not have suffered ought of a kind they had not previously known they had to suffer. When Agabus, making use of corresponding action too, had foretold that bonds awaited Paul, the disciples, weeping and entreating that he would not venture upon going to Jerusalem, entreated in vain.[fn-111-P11118_3157385:114-nf] As for him, having a mind to illustrate what he had always taught, he says, \"Why weep ye, and grieve my heart? But for my part, I could wish not only to suffer bonds, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of my Lord Jesus Christ.\" And so they yielded by saying, \"Let the will of the Lord be done; \"feeling sure, doubtless, that sufferings are included in the will of God. For they had tried to keep him back with the intention not of dissuading, but to show love for him; as yearning for (the preservation of) the apostle, not as counselling against martyrdom. And if even then a Prodicus or Valentinus stood by, suggesting that one must not confess on the earth before men, and must do so the less in truth, that God may not (seem to) thirst for blood, and Christ for a repayment of suffering, as though He besought it with the view of obtaining salvation by it for Himself also, he would have immediately heard from the servant of God what the devil had from the Lord: \"Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offence unto me. It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-111-P11119_3158523:115-nf] But even now it will be right that he hear it, seeing that, long after, he has poured forth these poisons, which not even thus are to injure readily any of the weak ones, if any one in faith will drink, before being hurt, or even immediately after, this draught of ours.

Lastly, let them be so far removed from this world's fashions as to remain altogether common property for the use of the servants of God. For whatever is claimed by one or a few among the servants of God and is not the common property of the whole body. of the brethren alike is either superfluous or vain, and for that reason to be considered harmful, and affording an appearance of vanity rather than virtue. And, therefore, whatever models we see were not taught either by the saints of old who laid the foundations of the monastic life, or by the fathers of our own time who in their turn keep up at the present day their customs, these we also should reject as superfluous and useless: wherefore they utterly disapproved of a robe of sackcloth as being visible to all and conspicuous, and what from this very fact will not only confer no benefit on the soul but rather minister to vanity and pride, and as being inconvenient and unsuitable for the performance of necessary work for which a monk ought always to go ready and unimpeded. But even if we hear of some respectable persons who have been dressed inthis garb, a rule for the monasteries is not, therefore, to be passed by us, nor should the ancient decrees of the holy fathers be upset because we do not think that a few men, presuming on the possession of other virtues, are to be blamed even in regard of those things which they have practised not in accordance with the Catholic rule. For the opinion of a few ought not to be preferred to or to interfere with the general rule for all. For we ought to give unhesitating allegiance and unquestioning obedience, not to those customs and rules which the will of a few have introduced, but to those which a long standing antiquity and numbers of the holy fathers have passed on by an unanimous decision to those that come after. Nor, indeed, ought this to influence us as a precedent for our daily life, that Joram, the wicked king of Israel, when surrounded by bands of his foes, rent his clothes, and is said to have had sackcloth inside them;[fn-19-P1923_859843:6-nf] or that the Ninevites, in order to mitigate the sentence of God, which had been pronounced against them by the prophet, were clothed in rough sackcloth.[fn-19-P1924_860471:7-nf] The former is shown to have been clothed with it secretly underneath, so that unless the upper garment had been rent it could not possibly have been known by any one, and the latter tolerated a covering of sackcloth at a time when, since all were mourning over the approaching destruction of the city and were clothed with the same garments, none could be accused of ostentation. For where there is no special difference and all are alike no harm is done.[fn-19-P1925_860946:8-nf] ","title":"Book I. Of the Dress of the Monks.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":21,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_56_book_ii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"ANF-04","text":"The first book of our answer to the treatise of Celsus, entitled A True Discourse, which concluded with the representation of the Jew addressing Jesus, having now extended to a sufficient length, we intend the present part as a reply to the charges brought by him against those who have been converted from Judaism to Christianity.[fn-79-P7999_1946124:1-nf] And we call attention, in the first place, to this special question, viz., why Celsus, when he had once resolved upon the introduction of individuals upon the stage of his book, did not represent the Jew as addressing the converts from heathenism rather than those from Judaism, seeing that his discourse, if directed to us, would have appeared more likely to produce an impression.[fn-80-P8000_1946576:2-nf] But probably this claimant to universal knowledge does not know what is appropriate in the matter of such representations; and therefore let us proceed to consider what he has to say to the converts from Judaism. He asserts that \"they have forsaken the law of their fathers, in consequence of their minds being led captive by Jesus; that they have been most ridiculously deceived, and that they have become deserters to another name and to another mode of life.\" Here he has not observed that the Jewish converts have not deserted the law of their fathers, inasmuch as they live according to its prescriptions, receiving their very name from the poverty of the law, according to the literal acceptation of the word; for Ebion signifies \"poor\" among the Jews,[fn-80-P8001_1947351:3-nf] and those Jews who have received Jesus as Christ are called by the name of Ebionites. Nay, Peter himself seems to have observed for a considerable time the Jewish observances enjoined by the law of Moses, not having yet learned from Jesus to ascend from the law that is regulated according to the letter, to that which is interpreted according to the spirit,-a fact which we learn from the Acts of the Apostles. For on the day after the angel of God appeared to Cornelius, suggesting to him \"to send to Joppa, to Simon surnamed Peter,\" Peter \"went up into the upper room to pray about the sixth hour. And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready he fell into a trance, and saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth; wherein were all manner of four-footed beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean. And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call thou not common.\"[fn-80-P8002_1948561:4-nf] Now observe how, by this instance, Peter is represented as still observing the Jewish customs respecting clean and unclean animals. And from the narrative that follows, it is manifest that he, as being yet a Jew, and living according to their traditions, and despising those who were beyond the pale of Judaism, stood in need of a vision to lead him to communicate to Cornelius (who was not an Israelite according to the flesh), and to those who were with him, the word of faith. Moreover, in the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul states that Peter, still from fear of the Jews, ceased upon the arrival of James to eat with the Gentiles, and \"separated himself from them, fearing them that were of the circumcision; \"[fn-80-P8003_1949297:5-nf] and the rest of the Jews, and Barnabas also, followed the same course. And certainly it was quite consistent that those should not abstain from the observance of Jewish usages who were sent to minister to the circumcision, when they who \"seemed to be pillars\" gave the right hand of fellowship to Paul and Barnabas, in order that, while devoting themselves to the circumcision, the latter might preach to the Gentiles. And why do I mention that they who preached to the circumcision withdrew and separated themselves from the heathen, when even Paul himself \"became as a Jew to the Jews, that he might gain the Jews? \"Wherefore also in the Acts of the Apostles it is related that he even brought an offering to the altar, that he might satisfy the Jews that he was no apostate from their law.[fn-80-P8004_1950111:6-nf] Now, if Celsus had been acquainted with all these circumstances, he would not have represented the Jew holding such language as this to the converts from Judaism: \"What induced you, my fellow-citizens, to abandon the law of your fathers, and to allow your minds to be led captive by him with whom we have just conversed, and thus be most ridiculously deluded, so as to become deserters from us to another name, and to the practices of another life? \"","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":21,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_67_xvii_the_second_conference_of_abbot_joseph_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Instructed by which examples, the blessed Apostle James also, and all the chief princes of the primitive Church urged the Apostle Paul in consequence of the weakness of feeble persons to condescend to a fictitious arrangement and insisted on his purifying himself according to the requirements of the law, and shaving his head and paying his vows, as they thought that the present harm which would come from this hypocrisy was of no account, but had regard rather to the gain which would result from his still continued preaching. For the gain to the Apostle Paul from his strictness would not have counterbalanced the loss to all nations from his speedy death. And this would certainly have been then incurred by the whole Church unless this good and salutary hypocrisy had preserved him for the preaching of the Gospel. For then we may rightly and pardonably acquiesce in the wrong of a lie, when, as we said, a greater harm depends on telling the truth, and when the good which results to us from speaking the truth cannot counterbalance the harm which will be caused by it. And elsewhere the blessed Apostle testifies in other words that he himself always observed this disposition; for when he says: \"To the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews; to those who were under the law as being under the law, though not myself under the law, that I might gain those who were under the law; to those who were without law, I became as without law, though I was not without the law of God but under the law of Christ, that I might gain those who were without law; to the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I became all things to all men, that I might save all;\"[fn-59-P5931_2099236:20-nf] what does he show but that according to the weakness and the capacity of those who were being instructed he always lowered himself and relaxed something of the vigour of perfection, and did not cling to what his own strict life might seem to demand, but rather preferred that which the good of the weak might require? And that we may trace these matters out more carefully and recount one by one the glories of the good deeds of the Apostles, some one may ask how the blessed Apostle can be proved to have suited himself to all men in all things. When did he to the Jews become as a Jew? Certainly in the case where, while he still kept in his inmost heart the opinion which he had maintained to the Galatians saying: \"Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing,\"[fn-59-P5932_2100068:21-nf] yet by circumcising Timothy he adopted a shadow as it were of Jewish superstition. And again, where did he become to those under the law, as under the law? There certainly where James and all the Elders of the Church, fearing lest he might be attacked by the multitude of Jewish believers, or rather of Judaizing Christians, who had received the faith of Christ in such a way as still to be bound by the rites of legal ceremonies, came to his rescue in his difficulty with this counsel and advice, and said: \"Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews, who have believed, and they are all zealots for the law. But they have heard of thee that thou teachest those Jews who are among the Gentiles to depart from Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children;\" and below: \"Do therefore this that we say unto thee: we have four men who have a vow on them. These take and sanctify thyself with them and bestow on them, that they may shave their heads; and all will know that the things which they have heard of thee are false, but that thou thyself also walkest keeping the law.\"[fn-59-P5933_2101198:22-nf] And so for the good of those who were under the law, he trode under foot for a while the strict view which he had expressed: \"For I through the law am dead unto the law that I may live unto God;\"[fn-59-P5934_2101416:23-nf] and was driven to shave his head, and be purified according to the law and pay his vows after the Mosaic rites in the Temple. Do you ask also where for the good of those who were utterly ignorant of the law of God, he himself became as if without law? Read the introduction to his sermon at Athens where heathen wickedness was flourishing: \"As I passed by,\" he says, \"I saw your idols and an altar on which was written: To the unknown God;\" and when he had thus started from their superstition, as if he himself also had been without law, under the cloke of that profane inscription he introduced the faith of Christ, saying: \"What therefore ye ignorantly worship, that declare I unto you.\" And after a little, as if he had known nothing whatever of the Divine law, he chose to bring forward a verse of a heathen poet rather than a saying of Moses or Christ, saying: \"As some also of your own poets have said: for we are also His offspring.\" And when he had thus approached them with their own authorities, which they could not reject, thus confirming the truth by things false, he added and said: \"Since then we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold or silver or stone sculptured by the art and device of man.\"[fn-59-P5935_2102689:24-nf] But to the weak he became weak, when, by way of permission, not of command, he allowed those who could not contain themselves to return together again,[fn-59-P5936_2102865:25-nf] or when he fed the Corinthians with milk and not with meat, and says that he was with them in weakness and fear and much trembling.[fn-59-P5937_2103021:26-nf] But he became all things to all men that he might save all, when he says: \"He that eateth let him not despise him that eateth not, and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth:\"and: \"He that giveth his virgin in marriage doeth well, and he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better;\" and elsewhere: \"Who,\" says he, \"is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?\" and in this way he fulfilled what he had commanded the Corinthians to do when he said: \"Be ye without offence to Jews and Greeks and the Church of Christ, as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit but that of the many, that they may be saved.\"[fn-59-P5938_2103712:27-nf] For it had certainly been profitable not to circumcise Timothy, not to shave his head, not to undergo Jewish purification, not to practice going barefoot,[fn-59-P5939_2103935:28-nf] not to pay legal vows; but he did all these things because he did not seek his own profit but that of the many. And although this was done with the full consideration of God, yet it was not free from dissimulation. For one who through the law of Christ was dead to the law that he might live to God, and who had made and treated that righteousness of the law in which he had lived blameless, as dung, that he might gain Christ, could not with true fervour of heart offer what belonged to the law; nor is it right to believe that he who had said: \"For if I again rebuild what I have destroyed, I make myself a transgressor,\"[fn-59-P5940_2104934:29-nf] would himself fall into what he had condemned. And to such an extent is account taken, not so much of the actual thing which is done as of the disposition of the doer, that on the other hand truth is sometimes found to have injured some, and a lie to have done them good. For when Saul was grumbling to his servants about David's flight, and saying: \"Will the son of Jesse give you all fields and vineyards, and make you all tribunes and centurions: that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one to inform me,\" did Doeg the Edomite say anything but the truth, when he told him: \"I saw the son of Jesse in Nob, with Abimelech the son of Ahitub the priest, who consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him also the sword of Goliath the Philistine?\"[fn-59-P5941_2105735:30-nf] For which true story he deserved to be rooted up out of the land of the living, and it is said of him by the prophet: \"Wherefore God shall destroy thee forever, and pluck thee up and tear thee out of thy tabernacle, and thy root from the land of the living:\"[fn-59-P5942_2106018:31-nf] He then for showing the truth is forever plucked and rooted up out of that land in which the harlot Rahab with her family is planted for her lie: just as also we remember that Samson most injuriously betrayed to his wicked wife the truth which he had hidden for a long time by a lie, and therefore the truth so inconside-rately disclosed was the cause of his own deception, because he had neglected to keep the command of the prophet: \"Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.\"[fn-59-P5943_2106543:32-nf] ","title":"XVII.

Thus in fact they put Stephen to death, thus they beat the Apostles, not taking them before rulers. Thus also they were about to put Paul to death, had not the chief captain thrown himself[fn-52-P5288_1717730:39-nf] [upon them].

By him, therefore, I salute your true and unfeigned love, and beseech you to pray for me more than ever now, when I stand in such need of the aid of your prayers. My health has suffered terribly from the journey to Pontus and my sickness is unendurable. One thing I have long been anxious to make known to you. I do not mean to say that I have been so affected by any other cause as to forget it, but now I wish to put you in mind to send some good man into Lycia, to enquire who are of the right faith, for peradventure they ought not to be neglected, if indeed the report is true, which has been brought to me by a pious traveller from thence, that they have become altogether alienated from the opinion of the Asiani[fn-52-P5246_1644868:2-nf] and wish to embrace communions with us. If any one is to go let him enquire at Corydala[fn-52-P5247_1645065:3-nf] for Alexander, the late monk, the bishop; at Limyra[fn-52-P5248_1645236:4-nf] for Diotimus, and at Myra[fn-52-P5249_1645278:5-nf] for Tatianus, Polemo,[fn-52-P5250_1645492:6-nf] and Macarius presbyters; at Patara[fn-52-P5251_1645606:7-nf] for Eudemus,[fn-52-P5252_1645639:8-nf] the bishop; at Telmessus[fn-52-P5253_1645693:9-nf] for Hilarius, the bishop: at Phelus for Lallianus, the bishop. Of these and of more besides I have been informed that they are sound in the faith, and I have been grateful to God that even any in the Asian region should be clear of the heretic's pest. If, then, it be possible, let us in the meanwhile make personal enquiry about them. When we have obtained information I am for writing a letter, and am anxious to invite one of them to meet me. God grant that all may go well with that Church at Iconium, which is so dear to me. Through you I salute all the honourable clergy and all who are associated with your reverence.","title":"Letter CCXVIII.","author":"St. Basil"}]
