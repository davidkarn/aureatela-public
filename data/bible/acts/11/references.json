In the use of this passage, however, we must be very specially on our guard, lest perchance, when we see any servant of God making provision that such necessaries shall not be wanting either to himself or to those with whose care he has been entrusted, we should decide that he is acting contrary to the Lord's precept, and is anxious for the morrow.[fn-8-P845_318746:168-nf] For the Lord Himself also, although angels ministered to Him,[fn-8-P846_319396:169-nf] yet for the sake of example, that no one might afterwards be scandalized when he observed any of His servants procuring such necessaries, condescended to have money bags, out of which whatever might be required for necessary uses might be provided; of which bags, as it is written, Judas, who betrayed Him, was the keeper and the thief.[fn-8-P847_319754:170-nf] In like manner, the Apostle Paul also may seem to have taken thought for the morrow, when he said: \"Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the saints of Galatia, even so do ye: upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store[fn-8-P848_320056:171-nf] what shall seem good unto him, that there be no gatherings when I conic. And when I come[fn-8-P849_320186:172-nf] whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. Now I will come unto you when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I shall pass through Macedonia. And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.\"[fn-8-P850_320744:173-nf] In the Acts of the Apostles also it is written, that such things as are necessary for food were provided for the future, on account of an impending famine. For we thus read: \"And in these days came prophets down from Jerusalem to Antioch,[fn-8-P851_321007:174-nf] and there was great rejoicing. And when we were gathered together,[fn-8-P852_321158:175-nf] there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar. Then the disciples, every one according to his ability, determined to send relief to the elders for the brethren which dwelt in Judaea, which also they did by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.\"[fn-8-P853_321614:176-nf] And in the case of the necessaries presented to him, wherewith the same Apostle Paul when setting sail was laden,[fn-8-P854_321818:177-nf] food seems to have been furnished for more than a single day. And when the same apostle writes, \"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working[fn-8-P855_322008:178-nf] with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth;\"[fn-8-P856_322131:179-nf] to those who misunderstand him he does not seem to keep the Lord's precept, which runs, \"Behold the fowls of the air; for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns;\" and, \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin;\" while he enjoins the parties in question to labour, working with their hands, that they may have something which they may be able to give to others also. And in what he often says of himself, that he wrought with his hands that he might not be burdensome;[fn-8-P857_322756:180-nf] and in what is written of him, that he joined himself to Aquila on account of the similarity of their occupation, in order that they might work together at that from which they might make a living;[fn-8-P858_322994:181-nf] he does not seem to have imitated the birds of the air and the lilies of the field. From these and such like passages of Scripture, it is sufficiently apparent that our Lord does not disapprove of it, when one looks after such things in the ordinary way that men do; but only when one enlists as a soldier of God for the sake of such things, so that in what he does he fixes his eye not on the kingdom of God, but on the acquisition of such things.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"9 During this time Paul was still persecuting the church, and entering the houses of believers was dragging men and women away and committing them to prison.[fn-9-P974_475836:22-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":11,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"3 But the divine grace being now poured out upon the rest of the nations Cornelius, of Caesarea in Palestine, with his whole house, through a divine revelation and the agency of Peter, first received faith in Christ;[fn-10-P1022_495217:53-nf] and after him a multitude of other Greeks in Antioch,[fn-10-P1023_495294:54-nf] to whom those who were scattered by the persecution of Stephen had preached the Gospel.

It is such whom the apostle foresaw through the Holy Spirit, when he said: \"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\"[fn-32-P3222_1801871:5-nf] For that mentioning of secrecy and theft, whereof it is said, \"Partake with pleasure of hidden bread and the sweetness of stolen waters,\" creates an itching in those who listen with ears that are lusting after spiritual fornication, just as by a kind of itching also of desire in the flesh the soundness of chastity is corrupted. Hear, therefore, how the apostle foresaw such things, and gave salutary admonition about avoiding them, when be said, \"Shun profane novelties of words; for they increase unto much ungodliness, and their speech insinuates itself as cloth a cancer.\"[fn-32-P3223_1802469:6-nf] He did not say novelties of words merely; but added, \"profane.\" For there are also novelties of words in perfect harmony with religious doctrine, as is told us in Scripture of the very name of Christians, when it began to be used. For itwas in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians after the Lord's ascension, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles:[fn-32-P3224_1802999:7-nf] and certain houses were afterwards called by the new names of hospices[fn-32-P3225_1803086:8-nf] and monasteries; but the things themselves existed prior to their names, and are confirmed by religious truth, which also forms their defense against the wicked. In opposition also to the impiety of Arian heretics, they coined the new term, Patris Homousios;[fn-32-P3226_1803399:9-nf] but there was nothing new signified by such a name; for what is called Homousios is just this: \"I and my Father are one,\"[fn-32-P3227_1803601:10-nf] to wit, of one and the same substance. For if every novelty were profane, as little should we have it said by the Lord, \"A new commandment I give unto. you;\"[fn-32-P3228_1803778:11-nf] nor would the Testament be called New, nor the new song be sung throughout the whole earth. But there is profanity in the novelties of words, when it is said by \"the foolish and audacious woman, Come and enjoy the tasting of hidden bread, and the sweetness of stolen waters.\" From such enticing words of false science the apostle also gives his prohibitory warning, in the passage where he says, \"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane novelties of expression, and oppositions of science falsely so called; which some professing, have erred concerning the faith.\"[fn-32-P3229_1804395:12-nf] For there is nothing that these men so love as to profess science, and to deride as utter silliness faith in those verities which the young are enjoined to believe.","title":"Tractate XCVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_10_book_i_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"\"But the insane folly of imagining that the Son of God came into being out of that which had no being, and that His sending forth took place in time, is plain from the words `which l had no being,' although the foolish are incapable of perceiving the folly of their own utterances.

If then it be true that all things were made by Him, it is evident that every age, time, all intervals of time, and that `when' in which `was not' has its place, were made by Him. And is it not absurd to say that there was a time when He who created all time, and ages, and seasons, with which the `was not' is confused, was not? For it would be the height of ignorance, and contrary indeed to all reason, to affirm that the cause of any created thing can be posterior to that caused by it. The interval during which they say the Son was still unbegotten of the Father was, according to their opinion, prior to the wisdom of God, by whom all things were created. They thus contradict the Scripture which declares Him to be `the firstborn of every creature[fn-10-P1010_193821:42-nf] .' In consonance with this doctrine, Paul with his usual mighty voice cries concerning Him; `whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds[fn-10-P1011_194005:43-nf] . `For by Him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him and for Him: and He is before all things'[fn-10-P1012_194562:44-nf] .' Since the hypothesis implied in the phrase `out of the non-existent' is manifestly impious, it follows that the Father is always Father.

But what wonder, if God foretold what was true, and man presumptuously imagined what was false? Assuredly in this denial of the Apostle Peter, which had now entered on its first stage, we ought to take notice that not only is Christ denied by one who says that He is not Christ, but by him also who, while really a Christian, himself denies that he is so. For the Lord said not to Peter, Thou shall deny that thou art my disciple; but, \"Thou shall deny me.\"[fn-36-P3630_2009161:6-nf] Him, therefore, he denied, when he denied that he was His disciple. And what else did such a form of denial imply, but that of his own Christianity?

Of course (his \"near\" friends), those in whom he had ever full confidence; fearing, with such an interest at stake, to entrust the matter to others. In my opinion, it was by Cornelius himself that both friends and kinsmen had been brought to a better mind. \"And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.\" (v. 25.) This, both to teach the others, and by way of giving thanks to God, and showing his own humility: thereby making it plain, that though he had been commanded, yet in himself he had great piety. What then did Peter? \"But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.\" (v. 26.) Do you mark how, before all else (the Apostles) teach them this lesson, not to think great things of them? \"And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.\" (v. 27, 28.) Observe, he straightway speaks of the mercy of God, and points out to them that it is a great grace that God has shown them. Observe also how while he utters great things, at the same time he speaks modestly. For he does not say, We, being men who do not deign to keep company with any (such), have come to you: but what says he? \"Ye know\" -God commanded this[fn-9-P991_908319:1-nf] -\" that it is against law to keep company with, or come unto, one of another nation.\" Then he goes on to say, \"And to me God has shown \"-this he says, that none may account the thanks due to him -\"that I should call no man\"-that it may not look like obsequiousness to him, \"no human being,\" says he-\"common or unclean.\"[fn-9-P992_909073:2-nf] (v. 29.) \"Wherefore also\"-that they may not think the affair a breach of the law on his part, nor (Cornelius) suppose that because he was in a station of command therfore he had complied, but that they may ascribe all to God,-\" wherefore also I came without gainsaying as soon as I was sent for:\" (though) not only to keep company, but even to come unto (him) was not permitted. \"I ask therefore, for what intent ye have sent for me.\" Already Peter had heard the whole matter from the soldiers also, but he wishes them first to confess, and to make them amenable to the Faith. What then does Cornelius? He does not say, Why, did not the soldiers tell thee? but observe again, how humbly he speaks. For he says, \"From the fourth day I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. And at the ninth hour,\" he says, \"I was praying.\" (v. 30, 31.) It seems to me, that this man had also fixed for himself set times of a life under stricter rule, and on certain days).[fn-9-P993_911906:3-nf] For this is why he hesays, \"From the fourth day.\"[fn-9-P994_916296:4-nf] See how great a thing prayer is! When he advanced in piety, then the Angel appears to him. \"From the fourth day:\" i.e. of the week; not \"four days ago.\" For, \"on the morrow Peter went away with them, and on the morrow after they entered into Caesarea:\" this is one day: and the day on which the persons sent came (to Joppa) one day: and on the third (the Angel) appeared: so that there are two days after that on which (Cornelius) had been praying. \"And, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing:\" he does not say, an Angel, so unassuming is he: \"and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter: he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the seaside: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.\" (v. 31-33.) (b) See[fn-9-P995_917808:5-nf] what faith, what piety! He knew that it was no word of man that Peter spake, when he said, \"God hath shown me.\" Then says the man, \"We are present to hear all things that are commanded thee of the Lord. (a) Therefore it was that Peter asked, \"For what intent have ye sent for me?\" on purpose that he might so speak these very words. (d) \"Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons: but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him.\" (v. 34, 35.) That is, be he uncircumcised or circumcised. (c) This also Paul declaring, saith, \"For there is no respect of persons with God.\"[fn-9-P996_920110:6-nf] (Rom. ii. 11.) (e) What then? (it may be asked) is the man yonder in Persia acceptable to Him? If he be worthy, in this regard he is acceptable, that it should be granted him to be brought unto faith (tw kataciwqhnai thj pistewj). The Eunuch from Ethiopia He overlooked not. \"What shall one say then of the religious men who have been overlooked?\" It is not the case, that any (such) ever was overlooked. But what he says is to this effect, that God rejects no man.[fn-9-P997_921057:7-nf] \"In every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousness:\" (by righteousness) he means, all virtue. Mark, how he subdues all elation of mind in him. That (the Jews) may not seem to be in the condition of persons cast off (he adds), \"The word which He sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: He is Lord of all (v. 36): this he says also for the sake of those present (of the Jews), that He may persuade them also: this is why he forces Cornelius to speak. \"He,\" saith he, \"is Lord of all.\" But observe at the very outset, \"The word,\" says he, \"which He sent unto the children of Israel;\" he gives them the preëminence. Then he adduces (these Gentiles) themselves as witnesses: \"ye know,\" says he, \"the matter which came to pass throughout all Judea, beginning at Galilee-then he confirms it from this also-\" after the baptism which John preached (v. 37)-(\"even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost and with power.\" (v. 38.) He does not mean, Ye know Jesus, for they did not know Him, but he speaks of the things done by Him:[fn-9-P998_922827:8-nf] \"Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: by this[fn-9-P999_923502:9-nf] he shows that many cases of lost senses or paralyzed limbs are the devil's work, and a wrench given to the body by him: as also Christ said. \"For God was with Him.\" Again, lowly terms. \"And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem\" (v. 39): both \"we,\" saith he, and ye. Then the Passion, and the reason why they do not believe: \"Whom also they slew, and hanged on a tree. Him God raised up the third day, and showed Him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with Him after He rose from the dead. (v. 40, 41.) This is a proof of the Resurrection. \"And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is He which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.\" (v. 42.) This is great. Then he adduces the testimony from the Prophets: \"To Him give all the prophets witness, that through His name, whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of sins. (v. 43.)

For so marvellous are the works of the sluggards, hindered that they want to have that very thing by Gospel, which the Apostle enjoined and did on purpose that the Gospel itself should not be hindered. And yet, if from the very words of the Gospel we should compel them to live agreeably with their way of understanding it, they will be the first to endeavor to persuade us how they are not to be understood so as they do understand them. For certainly, they say that they therefore ought not to work, for that the birds of the air neither sow nor reap, of which the Lord hath given us a similitude that we should take no thought about such necessaries. Then why do they not attend to that which follows? For it is not only said, that \"they sow not, neither reap;\"[fn-46-P4642_2288733:90-nf] but there is added, \"nor gather in apothecas.\" Now \"apothecae\" may be called either \"barns,\" or word for word, \"repositories.\" Then why do these persons want to have idle hands and full repositories? Why do they lay by and keep what they receive of the labors of others, that thereof may be every day somewhat forthcoming? Why, in short, do they grind and cook? For the birds do not this. Or, if they find some whom they may persuade to this work also, namely, to bring unto them day by day viands ready made; at least their water they either fetch them from springs, or from cisterns and wells draw and set it by: this the fowls do not. But if so please them, let it be the study of good believers and most devoted subjects of the Eternal King, to carry their service to His most valiant soldiers even to that length, that they shall not be forced even to fill a vessel of water for themselves, if now-a-days people have surpassed even them which at that time were at Jerusalem, in a new grade of righteousness, stepping out beyond them. To them, namely, by reason of famine being imminent, and foretold by the Prophets which were at that time,[fn-46-P4643_2289898:91-nf] good believers sent out of Greece supplies of corn; of which I suppose they made them bread, or at least procured to be made; which thing the birds do not. But if now-a-days these persons, as I began to say, have surpassed these in some grade of righteousness, and do altogether in things pertaining to the maintenance of this life, as do thee birds; let them show us men doing such service unto birds as they wish to be done unto them, except indeed birds caught and caged because they are not trusted, lest if they fly they come not back: and yet these would rather enjoy liberty and receive from the fields what is enough, than take their food by men laid before them and made ready.","title":"Of the Work of Monks.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_37_of_the_work_of_monks_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"31.

To such, then, as approach to a discussion of saving and modern, that is, of spiritual and evangelical baptism, there occurs first of all the announcement universally well known, made and begun by John the Baptist, who, somewhat departing from the law, that is, from the most ancient baptism of Moses, and preparing the way of the new and true grace, both preoccupied the ears of the Jews gradually by the baptism of water and of repentance which for the time he practised, and took possession of them with the announcement of a spiritual baptism that was to come, exhorting them, and saying, \"He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire; \"[fn-107-P10727_3379862:5-nf] and for this reason we also ought to make a beginning of this discourse from this point. For in the Acts of the Apostles, the Lord after His resurrection, confirming this same word of John, \"commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for that promise of the Father which, saith He, ye have heard from me; for John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.\"[fn-107-P10728_3380313:6-nf] And Peter also related these same words of the Lord, when he gave an account of himself to the apostles, saying: \"And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell upon them as on us at the beginning; and I remembered the word of the Lord, how that He said, John indeed baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. If, therefore, He gave them a like gift as to us, who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand the Lord? \"[fn-107-P10729_3380796:7-nf] And again: \"Men and brethren, ye know how from ancient days God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the Gospel, and believe. And God, who knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as He did unto us.\"[fn-107-P10730_3381086:8-nf] And on this account we ought to consider what is the force and power of this saying. For the Lord says to them who would have to be subsequently baptized because they should believe, that they must be baptized not in like manner as by Him in water, unto repentance, but in the Holy Ghost. And of this announcement, as assuredly none of us can doubt it, it is plain on what principle men were baptized in the Holy Spirit. For it was peculiarly in the Holy Spirit Himself alone that they who believed were baptized. For John distinguished, and said that he indeed baptized in water, but that one should come who would baptize in the Holy Ghost, by the grace and power of God; and they are so by the Spirit's bestowal and operation of hidden results. Moreover, they are so no less in the baptism of the Spirit and of water. They are so, besides, also in the baptism of every one in his own proper blood[fn-107-P10731_3382004:9-nf] Even as the Holy Scriptures declare to us, from which we shall adduce evident proofs throughout each individual instance of those things which we shall narrate.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":11,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_70_xviii_conference_of_abbot_piamun_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"And while the Christian religion was rejoicing in these two orders of monks though this system had begun by degrees to deteriorate, there arose afterwards that disgusting and unfaithful kind of monks; or rather, that baleful plant revived and sprang up again which when it first shot up in the persons of Ananias and Sapphira in the early Church was cut off by the severity of the Apostle Peter - a kind which among monks has been for a long while considered detestable and execrable, and which was adopted by no one any more, so long as there remained stamped on the memory of the faithful the dread of that very severe sentence, in which the blessed Apostle not merely refused to allow the aforesaid originators of the novel crime to be cured by penitence or any amends, but actually destroyed that most dangerous germ by their speedy death. When then that precedent, which was punished with Apostolical severity in the case of Ananias and Sapphira had by degrees faded from the minds of some, owing to long carelessness and forgetfulness from lapse of time, there arose the race of Sarabaites, who owing to the fact that they have broken away from the congregations of the coenobites and each look after their own affairs, are rightly named in the Egyptian language Sarabaites,[fn-60-P6061_2149356:9-nf] and these spring from the number of those, whom we have mentioned, who wanted to imitate rather than truly to aim at Evangelical perfection, urged thereto by rivalry or by the praises of those who preferred the complete poverty of Christ to all manner of riches. These then while in their feeble mind they make a pretence of the greatest goodness and are forced by necessity to join this order, while they are anxious to be reckoned by the name of monks without emulating their pursuits, in no sortof way practise discipline, or are subject to the will of the Elders, or, taught by their traditions, learn to govern their own wills or take up and properly learn any rule of sound discretion; but making their renunciation only as a public profession, i.e., before the face of men, either continue in their homes devoted to the same occupations as before, though dignified by this title, or building cells for themselves and calling them monasteries remain in them perfectly free and their own masters, never submitting to the precepts of the gospel, which forbid them to be busied with any anxiety for the day's food, or troubles about domestic matters: commands which those alone fulfil with no unbelieving doubt, who have freed themselves from all the goods of this world and subjected themselves to the superiors of the coenobia so that they cannot admit that they are at all their own masters. But those who, as we said, shirk the severity of the monastery, and live two or three together in their cells, not satisfied to be under the charge and rule of an Abbot, but arranging chiefly for this; viz., that they may get rid of the yoke of the Elders and have liberty to carry out their wishes and go and wander where they will, and do what they like, these men are more taken up both day and night in daily business than those who live in the coenobia, but not with the same faith and purpose. For these Sarabaites do it not to submit the fruits of their labours to the will of the steward, but to procure money to lay by. And see what a difference there is between them. For the others think nothing of the morrow, and offer to God the most acceptable fruits of their toil: while these extend their faithless anxiety not only to the morrow, but even to the space of many years, and so fancy that God is either false or impotent as He either could not or would not grant them the promised supply of food and clothing. The one seek this in all their prayers; viz., that they may gain a0kthmosu/nhn i.e., the deprivation of all things, and lasting poverty: the other that they may secure a rich quantity of all sorts of supplies. The one eagerly strive to go beyond the fixed rule of daily work that whatever is not wanted for the sacred purposes of the monastery, may be distributed at the will of the Abbot either among the prisons, or in the guest-chamber or in the infirmary or to the poor; the others that whatever the day's gorge leaves over, may be useful for extravagant wants or else laid by through the sin of covetousness. Lastly, if we grant that what has been collected by them with no good design, may be disposed of in better ways than we have men- tioned, yet not even thus do they rise to the merits of goodness and perfection. For the others bring in such returns to the monastery, and daily report to them, and continue in such humility and subjection that they are deprived of their rights over what they gain by their own efforts, just as they are of their rights over themselves, as they constantly renew the fervour of their original act of renunciation, while they daily deprive themselves of the fruits of their labours: but these are puffed up by the fact that they are bestowing something on the poor, and daily fall headlong into sin. The one party are by patience andthe strictness whereby they continue devoutly in the order which they have once embraced, so as never to fulfil their own will, crucified daily to this world and made living martyrs; the others are cast down into hell by the lukewarmness of their purpose. These two sorts of monks then vie with each other in almost equal numbers in this province; but in other provinces, which the need of the Catholic faith compelled me to visit, we have found that this third class of Sarabaites flourishes and is almost the only one, since in the time of Lucius who was a Bishop of Arian mis-belief[fn-60-P6062_2154430:10-nf] in the reign of Valens, while we carried alms[fn-60-P6063_2154942:11-nf] to our brethren; viz., those from Egypt and the Thebaid, who had been consigned to the mines of Pontus and Armenia[fn-60-P6064_2155233:12-nf] for their steadfastness in the Catholic faith, though we found the system of coenobia in some cities few and far between, yet we never made out that even the name of anchorites was heard among them.","title":"XVIII.
