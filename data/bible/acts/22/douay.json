{"verses":["Men, brethren and fathers, hear ye the account which I now give\nunto you.","(And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue,\nthey kept the more silence.)","And he saith:  I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought\nup in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the truth\nof the law of the fathers, zealous for the law, as also all you are\nthis day:","Who persecuted this way unto death, binding and delivering into\nprisons both men and women,","As the high priest doth bear me witness and all the ancients.\nFrom whom also receiving letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus,\nthat I might bring them bound from thence to Jerusalem to be punished.","And it came to pass, as I was going and drawing nigh to Damascus,\nat mid-day, that suddenly from heaven there shone round about me a\ngreat light:","And falling on the ground, I heard a voice saying to me:  Saul,\nSaul, why persecutest thou me?","And I answered:  Who art thou, Lord?  And he said to me:  I am\nJesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.","And they that were with me saw indeed the light:  but they heard\nnot the voice of him that spoke with me.","And I said:  What shall I do, Lord?  And the Lord said to me:\nArise and go to Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things\nthat thou must do.","And whereas I did not see for the brightness of that light,\nbeing led by the hand by my companions, I came to Damascus,","And one Ananias, a man according to the law, having testimony of\nall the Jews who dwelt there,","Coming to me and standing by me, said to me:  Brother Saul, look\nup.  And I, the same hour, looked upon him.","But he said:  The God of our fathers hath preordained thee that\nthou shouldst know his will and see the Just One and shouldst hear the\nvoice from his mouth.","For thou shalt be his witness to all men of those things which\nthou hast seen and heard.","And now why tarriest thou?  Rise up and be baptized and wash away\nthy sins, invoking his name.","And it came to pass, when I was come again to Jerusalem and was\npraying in the temple, that I was in a trance,","And saw him saying unto me:  Make haste and get thee quickly out\nof Jerusalem:  because they will not receive thy testimony concerning\nme.","And I said:  Lord, they know that I cast into prison and beat in\nevery synagogue them that believed in thee.","And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I stood by\nand consented:  and kept the garments of them that killed him.","And he said to me:  Go, for unto the Gentiles afar off will I\nsend thee.","And they heard him until this word and then lifted up their\nvoice, saying:  Away with such an one from the earth.  For it is not fit\nthat he should live.","And as they cried out and threw off their garments and cast dust\ninto the air,","The tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and\nthat he should be scourged and tortured:  to know for what cause they\ndid so cry out against him.","And when they had bound him with thongs, Paul saith to the\ncenturion that stood by him:  Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that\nis a Roman and uncondemned?","Which the centurion hearing, went to the tribune and told him,\nsaying:  What art thou about to do?  For this man is a Roman citizen.","And the tribune coming, said to him:  Tell me.  Art thou a Roman?\nBut he said:  Yea.","And the tribune answered:  I obtained the being free of this city\nwith a great sum.  And Paul said:  But I was born so.","Immediately therefore they departed from him that were about to\ntorture him.  The tribune also was afraid after he understood that he\nwas a Roman citizen and because he had bound him.","But on the next day, meaning to know more diligently for what\ncause he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him and commanded the\npriests to come together and all the council:  and, bringing forth Paul,\nhe set him before them."]}
