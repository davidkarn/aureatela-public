For this is the reading we find in the Greek copies, which are most worthy of confidence; though many Latin ones have only the word \"cheek,\" without the addition of \"right.\" Now the face is that by which any one is recognised; and we read in the apostle's writings, \"For ye suffer,[fn-4-P482_162321:170-nf] if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face:\" then immediately he adds, \"I speak as concerning reproach;\"[fn-4-P483_162553:171-nf] so that he explains what striking on the face is, viz. to be contemned and despised. Nor is this indeed said by the apostle for this reason, that they should not bear with those parties; but that they should bear with himself rather, who so loved them, that he was willing that he himself should be spent for them.[fn-4-P484_162894:172-nf] But since the face cannot be called right and left, and yet there may be a worth according to the estimate of God and according to the estimate of this world, it is so distributed as it were into the right and left cheek that whatever disciple of Christ might have to bear reproach for being a Christian, he should be much more ready to bear reproach in himself, if he possesses any of the honours of this world. Thus this same apostle, if he had kept silence respecting the dignity which he had in the world, when men were persecuting in him the Christian name, would not have presented the other cheek to those that were smiting the right one. For when he said, I am a Roman citizen,[fn-4-P485_163603:173-nf] he was not unprepared to submit to be despised, in that which he reckoned as least, by those who had despised in him so precious and life-giving a name. For did he at all the less on that account afterwards submit to the chains, which it was not lawful to put on Roman citizens, or did lie wish to accuse any one of this injury? And if any spared him on account of the name of Roman citizenship, yet he did not on that account refrain from offering an object they might strike at, since he wished by his patience to cure of so great perversity those whom he saw honouring in him what belonged to the left members rather than the right. For that point only is to be attended to, in what spirit he did everything, how benevolently and mildly he acted toward those from whom he was suffering such things. For when he was smitten with the hand by order of the high priest, what he seemed to say contumeliously when he affirms, \"God shall smite thee, thou whited wall,\" sounds like an insult to those who do not understand it; but to those who do, it is a prophecy. For a whited wall is hypocrisy, i.e. pretence holding forth the sacerdotal dignity before itself, and under this name, as under a white covering, concealing an inner and as it were sordid baseness. For what belonged to humility he wonderfully preserved, when, on its being said to him, \"Revilest thou the high priest?\"[fn-4-P486_165006:174-nf] he replied, \"I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shall not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.\"[fn-4-P487_165201:175-nf] And here he showed with what calmness he had spoken that which he seemed to have spoken in anger, because he answered so quickly and so mildly, which cannot be done by those who are indignant and thrown into confusion. And in that very statement he spoke the truth to those who understood him, \"I wist not that he was the high priest:\"[fn-4-P488_165561:176-nf] as if he said, I know another High Priest, for whose name I bear such things, whom it is not lawful to revile, and whom ye revile, since in me it is nothing else but His name that ye hate. Thus, therefore, it is necessary for one not to boast of such things in a hypocritical way, but to be prepared in the heart itself for all things, so that he can sing that prophetic word, \"My heart is prepared,[fn-4-P489_166115:177-nf] O God, my heart is prepared.\" For many have learned how to offer the other cheek, but do not know how to love him by whom they are struck. But in truth, the Lord Himself, who certainly was the first to fulfil the precepts which He taught, did not offer the other cheek to the servant of the high priest when smiting Him thereon; but, so far from that, said, \"If I have spoken evil, hear witness of the evil;[fn-4-P490_166568:178-nf] but if well, why smitest thou me?\"[fn-4-P491_166666:179-nf] Yet was He not on that account unprepared in heart, for the salvation of all, not merely to be smitten on the other cheek, but even to have His whole body crucified.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"14 In addition to these, Paul, that \"chosen vessel,\"[fn-9-P989_481199:33-nf] \"not of men neither through men, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ himself and of God the Father who raised him from the dead,\"[fn-9-P990_481349:34-nf] was appointed an apostle, being made worthy of the call by a vision and by a voice which was uttered in a revelation from heaven.[fn-9-P991_481495:35-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"14 In addition to these, Paul, that \"chosen vessel,\"[fn-9-P989_481199:33-nf] \"not of men neither through men, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ himself and of God the Father who raised him from the dead,\"[fn-9-P990_481349:34-nf] was appointed an apostle, being made worthy of the call by a vision and by a voice which was uttered in a revelation from heaven.[fn-9-P991_481495:35-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"14 In addition to these, Paul, that \"chosen vessel,\"[fn-9-P989_481199:33-nf] \"not of men neither through men, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ himself and of God the Father who raised him from the dead,\"[fn-9-P990_481349:34-nf] was appointed an apostle, being made worthy of the call by a vision and by a voice which was uttered in a revelation from heaven.[fn-9-P991_481495:35-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"14 In addition to these, Paul, that \"chosen vessel,\"[fn-9-P989_481199:33-nf] \"not of men neither through men, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ himself and of God the Father who raised him from the dead,\"[fn-9-P990_481349:34-nf] was appointed an apostle, being made worthy of the call by a vision and by a voice which was uttered in a revelation from heaven.[fn-9-P991_481495:35-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_07_book_ii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"14 In addition to these, Paul, that \"chosen vessel,\"[fn-9-P989_481199:33-nf] \"not of men neither through men, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ himself and of God the Father who raised him from the dead,\"[fn-9-P990_481349:34-nf] was appointed an apostle, being made worthy of the call by a vision and by a voice which was uttered in a revelation from heaven.[fn-9-P991_481495:35-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"275","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"6 He writes as follows: \"They came, therefore, and took the lead of every church[fn-20-P2086_977063:322-nf] as witnesses[fn-20-P2087_977101:323-nf] and as relatives of the Lord.

You describe the one as choosing the latter and plunging without hesitation into the deep, while the other, refusing both, shews quite as much abhorrence of the worship of idols as his companion, but declines to commit himself to the waves, and waits for this fate to be violently forced upon him. You have suggested these circumstances, and you ask which of these two took the better course. I think that you will agree with me that the latter was the more praiseworthy. No one ought to withdraw himself from life unbidden, but should await either a natural or a violent death. Our Lord gave us this lesson when He bade those that are persecuted in one city flee to another and again commanded them to quit even this and depart to another.[fn-53-P5347_1287315:5-nf] In obedience to this teaching the divine Apostle escaped the violence of the governor of the city, and had no hesitation in speaking of the manner of his flight, but spoke of the basket, the wall, and the window, and boasted and glorified in the act.[fn-53-P5348_1287583:6-nf] For what looks discreditable is made honourable by the divine command. In the same manner the Apostle called himself at one time a Pharisee[fn-53-P5349_1288112:7-nf] and at another a Roman,[fn-53-P5350_1288154:8-nf] not because he was afraid of death, but acting quite fairly in fight.[fn-53-P5351_1288242:9-nf] In the same way when he had learnt the Jews' plot against him he appealed to Caesar[fn-53-P5352_1288391:10-nf] and sent his sister's son to the chief captain to report the designs hatched against him, not because he clung to this present life, but in obedience to the divine law. For assuredly our Lord does not wish us to throw ourselves into obvious peril; and this is taught us by deed as well as by word, for more than once He avoided the murderous violence of the Jews. And the great Peter, first of the Apostles, when he was loosed from his chains and had escaped from the hands of Herod, came to the house of John, who was surnamed Mark, and after removing the anxiety of his friends by his visit and bidding them maintain silence, betook himself to another house in the endeavour to conceal himself more effectually by the removal.[fn-53-P5353_1289139:11-nf] And we shall find just the same kind of wisdom in the old Testament, for the famous Moses, after playing the man in his struggle with the Egyptian and finding out the next day that the homicide had become known, ran away, travelled a long journey, and arrived at the land of Midian.[fn-53-P5354_1289446:12-nf] In like manner the great Elias when he had learnt Jezebel's threats did not give himself up to them which wished to kill him, but left the world and hurried to the desert.[fn-53-P5355_1289641:13-nf] And if it is right and agreeable to God to escape the violence of our enemies, surely it is much more right to refuse to obey them when they order a man to become his own murderer. Our Lord did not give in to the devil when he bade Him throw Himself down,[fn-53-P5356_1289923:14-nf] and when he had armed against Him the hands of the Jews by means of the scourge and the thorns and the nails, and the creature was urging Him to bring wholesale destruction on His wicked foes, the Lord Himself forbade, because He knew that His Passion was bringing salvation to the world, and it was for this reason that just before His Passion He said to His Apostles \"Pray that ye enter not into temptation,\"[fn-53-P5357_1290352:15-nf] and taught us to pray \"Lead us not into temptation.\"[fn-53-P5358_1290426:16-nf] Now let us shift our ground a little, and we shall see our way more clearly. Let us eliminate the sea from the argument, and suppose the judge to have given each of the martyrs a sword, and ordered the one who refused to sacrifice to cut off his own head; who in his senses would have endured to redden his hand with his own blood, become his own headsman, lift his hand against himself, in obedience to the judge's order?","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":22,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"141","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"38.

Behold, then, I find both in the Gospels and in the (writings of the) apostles a visible and an invisible God (revealed to us), under a manifest and personal distinction in the condition of both. There is a certain emphatic saying by John: \"No man hath seen God at any time; \"[fn-105-P10594_2976311:172-nf] meaning, of course, at any previous time But he has indeed taken away all question of time, by saying that God had never been seen. The apostle confirms this statement; for, speaking of God, he says, \"Whom no man hath seen, nor can see; \"[fn-105-P10595_2976569:173-nf] because the man indeed would die who should see Him.[fn-105-P10596_2976644:174-nf] But the very same apostles testify that they had both seen and \"handled\" Christ.[fn-105-P10597_2976777:175-nf] Now, if Christ is Himself both the Father and the Son, how can He be both the Visible and the Invisible? In order, however, to reconcile this diversity between the Visible and the Invisible, will not some one on the other side argue that the two statements are quite correct: that He was visible indeed in the flesh, but was invisible before His appearance in the flesh; so that He who as the Father was invisible before the flesh, is the same as the Son who was visible in the flesh? If, however, He is the same who was invisible before the incarnation, how comes it that He was actually seen in ancient times before (coming in) the flesh? And by parity of reasoning, if He is the same who was visible after (coming in) the flesh, how happens it that He is now declared to be invisible by the apostles? How, I repeat, can all this be, unless it be that He is one, who anciently was visible only in mystery and enigma, and became more clearly visible by His incarnation, even the Word who was also made flesh; whilst He is another whom no man has seen at any time, being none else than the Father, even Him to whom the Word belongs? Let us, in short, examine who it is whom the apostles saw. \"That,\" says John, \"which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.\"[fn-105-P10598_2978120:176-nf] Now the Word of life became flesh, and was heard, and was seen, and was handled, because He was flesh who, before He came in the flesh, was the \"Word in the beginning with God\" the Father,[fn-105-P10599_2978329:177-nf] and not the Father with the Word. For although the Word was God, yet was He with God, because He is God of God; and being joined to the Father, is with the Father.[fn-106-P10600_2978514:178-nf] \"And we have seen His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father; \"[fn-106-P10601_2978630:179-nf] that is, of course, (the glory) of the Son, even Him who was visible, and was glorified by the invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the Word of God was God, in order that he might give no help to the presumption of the adversary, (which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself and in order to draw a distinction between the invisible Father and the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, ex abundanti as it were: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-106-P10602_2979142:180-nf] What God does he mean? The Word? But he has already said: \"Him we have seen and heard, and our hands have handled the Word of life.\" Well, (I must again ask, ) what God does he mean? It is of course the Father, with whom was the Word, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and has Himself declared Him.[fn-106-P10603_2979484:181-nf] He was both heard and seen and, that He might not be supposed to be a phantom, was actually handled. Him, too, did Paul behold; but yet he saw not the Father. \"Have I not,\" he says, \"seen Jesus Christ our Lord? \"[fn-106-P10604_2979716:182-nf] Moreover, he expressly called Christ God, saying: \"Of whom are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-106-P10605_2979902:183-nf] He shows us also that the Son of God, which is the Word of God, is visible, because He who became flesh was called Christ. Of the Father, however, he says to Timothy: \"Whom none among men hath seen, nor indeed can see; \"and he accumulates the description in still ampler terms: \"Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto.\"[fn-106-P10606_2980285:184-nf] It was of Him, too, that he had said in a previous passage: \"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to the only God; \"[fn-106-P10607_2980435:185-nf] so that we might apply even the contrary qualities to the Son Himself-mortality, accessibility-of whom the apostle testifies that \"He died according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-106-P10608_2980625:186-nf] and that \"He was seen by himself last of all,\"[fn-106-P10609_2980693:187-nf] -by means, of course, of the light which was accessible, although it was not without imperilling his sight that he experienced that light.[fn-106-P10610_2980847:188-nf] A like danger to which also befell Peter, and John, and James, (who confronted not the same light) without risking the loss of their reason and mind; and if they, who were unable to endure the glory of the Son,[fn-106-P10611_2981080:189-nf] had only seen the Father, they must have died then and there: \"For no man shall see God, and live.\"[fn-106-P10612_2981214:190-nf] This being the case, it is evident that He was always seen from the beginning, who became visible in the end; and that He, (on the contrary, ) was not seen in the end who had never been visible from the beginning; and that accordingly there are two-the Visible and the Invisible. It was the Son, therefore, who was always seen, and the Son who always conversed with men, and the Son who has always worked by the authority and will of the Father; because \"the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do\"[fn-106-P10613_2981760:191-nf] -\"do\" that is, in His mind and thought.[fn-106-P10614_2981819:192-nf] For the Father acts by mind and thought; whilst the Son, who is in the Father's mind and thought,[fn-106-P10615_2981934:193-nf] gives effect and form to what He sees. Thus all things were made by tile Son, and without Him was not anything made.[fn-106-P10616_2982167:194-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_33_on_our_lord_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"26. Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? He who had conquered His persecutors in the world below, and ruled over the angels in the world above, spoke from above with humble voice.

Now, our Lord denounced woe to His crucifiers, that He might teach His disciples not to be dismayed by His murderers. But our Lord spoke in humility from heaven, that in humility the heads of His church might speak, And if any one should say, \"Wherein did our Lord speak humbly with Paul? for lo! the eyes of Paul were grievously smitten;\" let him know that it was not from our merciful Lord that this chastisement proceeded, who spoke those words in humility; but from the vehement light that vehemently shone forth there.

It was grievous and violent towards the eyes of the flesh; and it was pleasant and lightful to those who are fire and spirit.[fn-37-P3767_1215834:28-nf] ","title":"On Our Lord.","author":"Ephraim Syrus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":25,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_54_the_martyrdom_of_the_holy_martyrs","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Rusticus the prefect pronounced sentence, saying, \"Let those who have refused to sacrifice to the gods and to yield to the command of the emperor be scourged,[fn-61-P6113_1359804:6-nf] and led away to suffer the punishment of decapitation, according to the laws.\" The holy martyrs having glorified God, and having gone forth to the accustomed place, were beheaded, and perfected their testimony in the confession of the Saviour.

But again, we allege the same against those who do not recognise Paul as an apostle: that they should either reject the other words of the Gospel which we have come to know through Luke alone, and not make use of them; or else, if they do receive all these, they must necessarily admit also that testimony concerning Paul, when he (Luke) tells us that the Lord spoke at first to him from heaven: \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me? I am Jesus Christ, whom thou persecutest; \"[fn-76-P7653_2076640:257-nf] and then to Ananias, saying regarding him: \"Go thy way; for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name among the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel. For I will show him, from this time, how great things he must suffer for My name's sake.\"[fn-76-P7654_2076927:258-nf] Those, therefore, who do not accept of him [asa teacher], who was chosen by God for this purpose, that he might boldly bear His name, as being sent to the forementioned nations, do despise the election of God, and separate themselves from the company of the apostles. For neither can they contend that Paul was no apostle, when he was chosen for this purpose; nor can they prove Luke guilty of falsehood, when he proclaims the truth to us with all diligence. It may be, indeed, that it was with this view that God set forth very many Gospel truths, through Luke's instrumentality, which all should esteem it necessary to use, in order that all persons, following his subsequent testimony, which treats upon the acts and the doctrine of the apostles, and holding the unadulterated rule of truth, may be saved. His testimony, therefore, is true, and the doctrine of the apostles is open and stedfast, holding nothing in reserve; nor did they teach one set of doctrines in private, and another in public.","title":"Book III.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":59,"source_paragraph":"295","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"132. Augustin answered: If those are not our opinions which you hold, neither were they your opinions which you received from the followers of Maximianus. But if they were therefore yours, because they were guilty of a sacrilegious schism in not communicating with the party of Donatus, take heed what ground you occupy, and with whose inheritance you refuse communion, and consider what answer you can make, not to the kings of this world, but to Christ your King. Of Him it is said, \"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"[fn-51-P5150_2507832:184-nf] From what river does it mean, save that where He was baptized, and where the dove descended on Him, that mighty token of charity and unity? But you refuse communion with this unity, and occupy as yet the place of unity; and you bring us into disfavor with the kings of this world in making use of the edicts of the proconsul to expel your schismatics from the place of the party of Donatus. These are not mere words flying at random through the empty void: the men are still alive, the states bear witness to the fact, the archives of the proconsuls and of the several towns are quoted in evidence of it. Let then the voice of calumny be at length silent, which would bring up against the whole earth the kings of this world, through whose proconsuls you, yourselves a fragment, would not spare the fragment which was separated from you. When then we say that you hold our opinions, we are not shown to be bearing false witness, unless you can show that we are not in the Church of Christ, which indeed you never cease alleging, but never will be able to establish; nay, in real truth, when you say this, you are bringing a charge of false witness no longer against us, but against the Lord Himself. For we are in the Church which was foretold by His own testimony, and where He bore witness to His witnesses, saying, \"Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even in the whole earth.\" But you show yourselves to be false witnesses not only from this, that you resist this truth, but also in the very trial in which you joined issue with the schism of Maximianus. For if you were acting according to the law of Christ, how much more consistently do certain Christian emperors frame ordinances in accordance with it, if even pagan proconsuls can follow its behests in passing judgment? But if you thought that even the laws of an earthly empire were to be summoned to your aid, we do not blame you for this. It is what Paul did when he bore witness before his adversaries that he was a Roman citizen.[fn-51-P5151_2509898:185-nf] But I would ask by what earthly laws it is ordained that the followers of Maximianus should be driven from their place? You will find no law whatever to this effect. But, in point of fact, you have chosen to expel them under laws which have been passed against heretics, and against yourselves among their number. You, as though by superior strength, have prevailed against the weak. Whence they, being wholly powerless, say that they are innocent, like the wolf in the power of the lion. Yet surely you could not use laws which were passed against yourselves as instruments against others, except by the aid of false witness. For if those laws are founded on truth, then do you come down from the position which you occupy; but if on falsehood, why did you use them to drive others from the Church? But how if they both are founded on truth, and could not be used by you for the expulsion of others except with the aid of falsehood? For that the judges might submit to their authority, they were willing to expel heretics from the Church, from which they ought first to have expelled yourselves; but you declared yourselves to be Catholics, that you might escape the severity of the laws which you employed to oppress others. It is for you to determine what you appear to yourselves among yourselves; at any rate, under those laws you are not Catholics.

He sought assistance, therefore, from the Christian emperor, not so much with any desire of revenging himself, as with the view of defending the Church entrusted to his charge. And if he had omitted to do this, he would have deserved not to be praised for his forbearance, but to be blamed for negligence. For neither was the Apostle Paul taking precautions on behalf of his own transitory life, but for the Church of God when he caused the plot of those who had conspired to slay him to be made known to the Roman captain, the effect of which was that he was conducted by an escort of armed soldiers to the place where they proposed to send him, that he might escape the ambush of his foes.[fn-59-P5981_2896182:59-nf] Nor did he for a moment hesitate to invoke the protection of the Roman laws, proclaiming that he was a Roman citizen, who at that time could not be scourged;[fn-59-P5982_2896364:60-nf] and again, that he might not be delivered to the Jews who sought to kill him, he appealed to Caesar,[fn-59-P5983_2896485:61-nf] -a Roman emperor, indeed, but not a Christian. And by this he showed sufficiently plainly what was afterwards to be the duty of the ministers of Christ, when in the midst of the dangers of the Church they found the emperors Christians. And hence therefore, it came about that a religious and pious emperor, when such matters were brought to his knowledge, thought it well, by the enactment of most pious laws, entirely to correct the error of this great impiety, and to bring those who bore the standards of Christ against the cause of Christ into the unity of the Catholic Church, even by terror and compulsion, rather than merely to take away their power of doing violence, and to leave them the freedom of going astray, and perishing in their error.","title":"A Treatise Concerning the Correction of the Donatists","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":22,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_18_part_ii_dogmatical_and_historical_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"98","folder":"ANF-05","text":"9.
