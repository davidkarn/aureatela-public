See to it that God say not some day of you: \"The virgin of Israel is fallen and there is none to raise her up.\"[fn-6-P636_120032:376-nf] I will say it boldly, though God can do all things He cannot raise up a virgin when once she has fallen.

Abraham, Moses, and Isaiah, Peter, James, and John, Paul, the \"chosen vessel,\"[fn-12-P1215_259477:812-nf] and even the Son of God Himself have all died; and are we vexed when a soul leaves its earthly tenement? Perhaps he is taken away, \"lest that wickedness should alter his understanding ...for his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to take him away from the people\"[fn-12-P1216_259767:813-nf] -lest in life's long journey he should lose his way in some trackless maze. We should indeed mourn for the dead, but only for him whom Gehenna receives, whom Tartarus devours, and for whose punishment the eternal fire burns. But we who, in departing, are accompanied by an escort of angels, and met by Christ Himself, should rather grieve that we have to tarry yet longer in this tabernacle of death.[fn-12-P1217_260204:814-nf] For \"whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.\"[fn-12-P1218_260294:815-nf] Our one longing should be that expressed by the psalmist: \"Woe is me that my pilgrimage is prolonged, that I have dwelt with them that dwell in Kedar, that my soul hath made a far pilgrimage.\"[fn-12-P1219_260507:816-nf] Kedar means darkness, and darkness stands for this present world (for, we are told, \"the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehendeth it not\"[fn-12-P1220_260690:817-nf] ). Therefore we should congratulate our dear Blaesilla that she has passed from darkness to light,[fn-12-P1221_260807:818-nf] and has in the first flush of her dawning faith received the crown of her completed work. Had she been cut off (as f pray that none may be) while her thoughts were full of worldly desires and passing pleasures, then mourning would indeed have been her due, and no tears shed for her would have been too many. As it is, by the mercy of Christ she, four months ago, renewed her baptism in her vow of widowhood, and for the rest of her days spurned the world, and thought only of the religions life. Have you no fear, then, lest the Saviour may say to you: \"Are you angry, Paula, that your daughter has become my daughter? Are you vexed at my decree, and do you, with rebellious tears, grudge me the possession of Blaesilla? You ought to know what my purpose is both for you and for yours. You deny yourself food, not to fast but to gratify your grief; and such abstinence is displeasing to me. Such fasts are my enemies. I receive no soul which forsakes the body against my will. A foolish philosophy may boast of martyrs of this kind; it may boast of a Zeno[fn-12-P1222_261882:819-nf] a Cleombrotus,[fn-12-P1223_262021:820-nf] or a Cato.[fn-12-P1224_262146:821-nf] My spirit rests only upon him \"that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembleth at my word.[fn-12-P1225_262374:822-nf] Is this the meaning of your vow to me that you would lead a religious life? Is it for this that you dress yourself differently from other matrons, and array yourself in the garb of a nun? Mourning is for those who wear silk dresses. In the midst of your tears the call will come, and you, too, must die; yet you flee from me as from a cruel judge, and fancy that you can avoid failing into my hands.

Oh! the madness and folly of those who have forsaken the teaching of the book of Proverbs, \"My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother,\"[fn-18-P1835_447291:1281-nf] and have turned to error, and say to the fool that he shall be their leader, and do not despise the foolish things which are said by the foolish man, even as the scripture bears witness, \"The foolish man speaketh foolishly, and his heart understandeth vanity.\"[fn-18-P1836_447575:1282-nf] I beseech you, dearly beloved, and by the love which I feel towards you, I implore you-as though it were my own members on which I would have pity[fn-18-P1837_447752:1283-nf] -by word and letter to fulfil that which is written, \"Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?\"[fn-18-P1838_447935:1284-nf] Origen's words are the words of an enemy, hateful and repugnant to God and to His saints; and not only those which I have quoted, but countless others. For it is not now my intention to argue against all his opinions. Origen has not lived in my day, nor has he robbed me. I have not conceived a dislike to him nor quarrelled with him because of an inheritance or of any worldly matter; but-to speak plainly-I grieve, and grieve bitterly, to see numbers of my brothers, and of those in particular who show the most promise, and have reached the highest rank in the sacred ministry,[fn-18-P1839_448541:1285-nf] deceived by his persuasive arguments, and made by his most perverse teaching the food of the devil, whereby the saying is fulfilled: \"He derides every stronghold, and his fare is choice, and he hath gathered captives as the sand.\"[fn-18-P1840_448794:1286-nf] But may God free you, my brother, and the holy people of Christ which is intrusted to you, and all the brothers who are with you, and especially the presbyter Rufinus, from the heresy of Origen, and other heresies, and from the perdition to which they lead. For, if for one word or for two opposed to the faith many heresies have been rejected by the Church, how much more shall he be held a heretic who has contrived such perverse interpretations and such mischievous doctrines to destroy the faith, and has in fact declared himself the enemy of the Church! For, among other wicked things, he has presumed to say this, too, that Adam lost the image of God, although Scripture nowhere declares that he did. Were it so, never would all the creatures in the world be subject to Adam's seed-that is, to the entire human race; yet, in the words of the apostle, everything \"is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind.\"[fn-18-P1841_449738:1287-nf] For never would all things be subjected to men if men had not-together with their authority over all-the image of God. But the divine Scripture conjoins and associates with this the grace of the blessing which was conferred upon Adam and upon the generations which descended from him. No one can by twisting the meaning of words presume to say that this grace of God was given to one only, and that he alone was made in the image of God (he and his wife, that is, for while he was formed of clay she was made of one of his ribs), but that those who were subsequently conceived in the womb and not born as was Adam did not possess God's image, for the Scripture immediately subjoins the following statement: \"And Adam lived two hundred and thirty years,[fn-18-P1842_450513:1288-nf] and knew Eve his wife, and she bare him a son in his image and after his likeness, and called his name Seth.\"[fn-18-P1843_450707:1289-nf] And again, in the tenth generation, two thousand two hundred and forty-two years afterwards,[fn-18-P1844_450845:1290-nf] God, to vindicate His own image and to show that the grace which He had given to men still continued in them, gives the following commandment: \"Flesh ...with the blood thereof shall ye not eat. And surely your blood will I require at the hand of every man that sheddeth it; for in the image of God have I made man.\"[fn-18-P1845_451264:1291-nf] From Noah to Abraham ten generations passed away,[fn-18-P1846_451362:1292-nf] and from Abraham's time to David's, fourteen more,[fn-18-P1847_451438:1293-nf] and these twenty-four generations make up, taken together, two thousand one hundred and seventeen years.[fn-18-P1848_451565:1294-nf] Yet the Holy Spirit in the thirty-ninth[fn-18-P1849_451663:1295-nf] psalm, while lamenting that all men walk in a vain show, and that they are subject to sins, speaks thus: \"For all that every man walk eth in the image.\"[fn-18-P1850_451891:1296-nf] Also after David's time, in the reign of Solomon his son, we read a somewhat similar reference to the divine likeness. For in the book of Wisdom, which is inscribed with his name, Solomon says: \"God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of His own eternity.\"[fn-18-P1851_452211:1297-nf] And again, about eleven hundred and eleven years afterwards, we read in the New Testament that men have not lost the image of God. For James, an apostle and brother of the Lord, whom I have mentioned above-that we may not be entangled in the snares of Origen-teaches us that man does possess God's image and likeness. For, after a somewhat discursive account of the human tongue, he has gone on to say of it: \"It is an unruly evil ...therewith bless we God, even the Father and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.\"[fn-18-P1852_452779:1298-nf] Paul, too, the \"chosen vessel,\"[fn-18-P1853_452836:1299-nf] who in his preaching has fully maintained the doctrine of the gospel, instructs us that man is made in the image and after the likeness of God. \"A man,\" he says, \"ought not to wear long hair, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God.\"[fn-18-P1854_453099:1300-nf] He speaks of \"the image\" simply, but explains the nature of the likeness by the word \"glory.\"","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":9,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"624","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2.

When the speech of Demosthenes against Aeschines was recited before the latter during his exile at Rhodes, amid all the admiration and applause he sighed \"if you could but have heard the brute deliver his own periods![fn-20-P2012_500929:1411-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":9,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"625","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3. I do not adduce these instances because I have anything in me from which you either can or will learn a lesson, but to show you that your zeal and eagerness to learn-even though you cannot rely on help from me-are in themselves worthy of praise. A mind willing to learn deserves commendation even when it has no teacher. What is of importance to me is not what you find but what you seek to find. Wax is soft and easy to mould even where the hands of craftsman and modeller are wanting to work it. It is already potentially all that it can be made. The apostle Paul learned the Law of Moses and the prophets at the feet of Gamaliel and was glad that he had done so, for armed with this spiritual armour, he was able to say boldly \"the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds;\" armed with these we war \"casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; and being in a readiness to revenge all disobedience.\"[fn-20-P2014_502088:1412-nf] He writes to Timothy who had been trained in the holy writings from a child exhorting him to study them diligently[fn-20-P2015_502227:1413-nf] and not to neglect the gift which was given him with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.[fn-20-P2016_502367:1414-nf] To Titus he gives commandment that among a bishop's other virtues (which he briefly describes) he should be careful to seek a knowledge of the scriptures: A bishop, he says, must hold fast \"the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.\"[fn-20-P2017_502708:1415-nf] In fact want of education in a clergyman[fn-20-P2018_502769:1416-nf] prevents him from doing good to any one but himself and much as the virtue of his life may build up Christ's church, he does it an injury as great by failing to resist those who are trying to pull it down. The prophet Haggai says-or rather the Lord says it by the mouth of Haggai-\"Ask now the priests concerning the law.\"[fn-20-P2019_503119:1417-nf] For such is the important function of the priesthood to give answers to those who question them concerning the law. And in Deuteronomy we read \"Ask thy father and he will shew thee; thy elders and they will tell thee.\"[fn-20-P2020_503360:1418-nf] Also in the one hundred and nineteenth psalm \"thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.\" David too, in the description of the righteous man whom he compares to the tree of life in paradise, amongst his other excellences speaks of this, \"His delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.\"[fn-20-P2021_503730:1419-nf] In the close of his most solemn vision Daniel declares that \"the righteous shall shine as the stars; and the wise, that is the learned, as the firmament.\"[fn-20-P2022_503904:1420-nf] You can see, therefore, how great is the difference between righteous ignorance and instructed righteousness. Those who have the first are compared with the stars, those who have the second with the heavens. Yet, according to the exact sense of the Hebrew, both statements may be understood of the learned, for it is to be read in this way:-\"They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.\" Why is the apostle Paul called a chosen vessel?[fn-20-P2023_504456:1421-nf] Assuredly because he is a repertory of the Law and of the holy scriptures. The learned teaching of our Lord strikes the Pharisees dumb with amazement, and they are filled with astonishment to find that Peter and John know the Law although they have not learned letters. For to these the Holy Ghost immediately suggested what comes to others by daily study and meditation; and, as it is written,[fn-20-P2024_504873:1422-nf] they were \"taught of God.\" The Saviour had only accomplished his twelfth year when the scene in the temple took place;[fn-20-P2025_505017:1423-nf] but when he interrogated the elders concerning the Law His wise questions conveyed rather than sought information.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":9,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"707","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"I. \"A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things,\"[fn-24-P2420_620518:1731-nf] and \"every tree is known by his fruit.\"[fn-24-P2421_620582:1732-nf] You measure me by the scale of your own virtues and because of your own greatness magnify my littleness.

At least that is what Solomon says: \"wisdom is the gray hair unto men.\"[fn-24-P2423_621277:1734-nf] Moses too in choosing the seventy elders is told to take those whom he knows to be elders indeed, and to select them not for their years but for their discretion.[fn-24-P2424_621462:1735-nf] And, as a boy, Daniel judges old men and in the flower of youth condemns the incontinence of age.[fn-24-P2425_621581:1736-nf] Do not, I repeat, weigh faith by years, nor suppose me better than yourself merely because I have enlisted under Christ's banner earlier than you.

The advice of the rhetoricians in such cases is that you should first search out the remote ancestors of the person to be eulogized and recount their exploits, and then come gradually to your hero; so as to make him more illustrious by the virtues of his forefathers, and to show either that he is a worthy successor of good men, or that he has conferred lustre upon a lineage in itself obscure. But as my duty is to sing the praises of the soul, I will not dwell upon those fleshly advantages which Nepotian for his part always despised.

Let me now fulfil the promise I made a little while ago and with all the skill of a rhetorician sing the praises of water and of baptism. In the beginning the earth was without form and void, there was no dazzling sun or pale moon, there were no glittering stars. There was nothing but matter inorganic and invisible, and even this was lost in abysmal depths and shrouded in a distorting gloom. The Spirit of God above moved, as a charioteer, over the face of the waters,[fn-28-P2879_762983:2051-nf] and produced from them the infant world, a type of the Christian child that is drawn from the laver of baptism. A firmament is constructed between heaven and earth, and to this is allotted the name heaven,-in the Hebrew Shamayim or `what comes out of the waters,'-[fn-28-P2880_763268:2052-nf] and the waters which are above the heavens are parted from the others to the praise of God.

You have, therefore, Salvina, those to nurse who may well represent to you your absent husband: \"Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord; and the fruit of the womb is his reward.\"[fn-33-P3354_879844:2434-nf] In the place of one husband you have received two children, and thus your affection has more objects than before. All that was due to him you can give to them. Temper grief with love, for if he is gone they are still with you. It is no small merit in God's eyes to bring up children well. Hear the apostle's counsel: \"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.\"[fn-33-P3355_880507:2435-nf] Here you learn the roll of the virtues which God requires of you, what is due to the name of widow which you bear, and by what good deeds you can attain to that second degree of chastity[fn-33-P3356_880730:2436-nf] which is still open to you. Do not be disturbed because the apostle allows none to be chosen as a widow under threescore years old, neither suppose that he intends to reject those who are still young. Believe that you are indeed chosen by him who said to his disciple, \"Let no man despise thy youth,\"[fn-33-P3357_881114:2437-nf] your want of age that is, not your want of continence. If this be not his meaning, all who become widows under threescore years will have to take husbands. He is training a church still untaught in Christ, and making provision for people of all stations but especially for the poor, the charge of whom had been committed to himself and Barnabas.[fn-33-P3358_881484:2438-nf] Thus he wishes only those to be supported by the exertions of the church who cannot labour with their own hands, and who are widows indeed,[fn-33-P3359_881658:2439-nf] approved by their years and by their lives. The faults of his children made Eli the priest an offence to God. On the other hand He is appeased by the virtues of such as \"continue in faith and charity and holiness with chastity.\"[fn-33-P3360_881913:2440-nf] \"O Timothy,\" cries the apostle, \"keep thyself pure.\"[fn-33-P3361_882029:2441-nf] Far be it from me to suspect you capable of doing anything wrong; still it is only a kindness to admonish one whose youth and opulence lead her into temptation. You must take what I am going to say as addressed not to you but to your girlish years. A widow \"that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.\"[fn-33-P3362_882361:2442-nf] So speaks the \"chosen vessel\"[fn-33-P3363_882413:2443-nf] and the words are brought out from his treasure who could boldly say: \"Do ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me?\"[fn-33-P3364_882552:2444-nf] Yet they are the words of one who in his own person admitted the weakness of the human body, saying: \"The good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not that I do.\"[fn-33-P3365_882760:2445-nf] And again: Therefore \"I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a castaway.\"[fn-33-P3366_882941:2446-nf] If Paul is afraid, which of us can venture to be confident? If David the friend of God and Solomon who loved God[fn-33-P3367_883078:2447-nf] were overcome like other men, if their fall is meant to warn us and their penitence to lead us to salvation, who in this slippery life can be sure of not falling? Never let pheasants be seen upon your table, or plump turtledoves or black cock from Ionia, or any of those birds so expensive that they fly away with the largest properties. And do not fancy that you eschew meat diet when you reject pork, hare, and venison and the savoury flesh of other quadrupeds.[fn-33-P3368_883564:2448-nf] It is not the number of feet that makes the difference but delicacy of flavour. I know that the apostle has said: \"every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving.\"[fn-33-P3369_883906:2449-nf] But the same apostle says: \"it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine,\"[fn-33-P3370_884009:2450-nf] and in another place: \"be not drunk with wine wherein is excess.\"[fn-33-P3371_884098:2451-nf] \"Every creature of God is good\"-the precept is intended for those who are careful how they may please their husbands.[fn-33-P3372_884237:2452-nf] Let those feed on flesh who serve the flesh, whose bodies boil with desire, who are tied to husbands, and who set their hearts on having offspring. Let those whose wombs are burthened cram their stomachs with flesh. But you have buried every indulgence in your husband's tomb: over his bier you have cleansed with tears a face stained with rouge and whitelead; you have exchanged a white robe and gilded buskins for a sombre tunic and black shoes; and only one thing more is needed, perseverance in fasting. Let paleness and squalor be henceforth your jewels. Do not pamper your youthful limbs with a bed of down or kindle your young blood with hot baths. Hear what words a heathen poet[fn-33-P3373_884949:2453-nf] puts into the mouth of a chaste widow:[fn-33-P3374_885022:2454-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":9,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1098","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8.

Yet, as though she were leaving strangers to go home to her own people, she whispered the verses of the psalmist: \"Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honour dwelleth,\"[fn-41-P4155_1123262:3000-nf] and \"How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord,\"[fn-41-P4156_1123419:3001-nf] and \"I had rather be an outcast in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.\"[fn-41-P4157_1123548:3002-nf] When I asked her why she remained silent refusing to answer my call,[fn-41-P4158_1123712:3003-nf] and whether she was in pain, she replied in Greek that she had no suffering and that all things were to her eyes calm and tranquil. After this she said no more but closed her eyes as though she already despised all mortal things, and kept repeating the verses just quoted down to the moment in which she breathed out her soul, but in a tone so low that we could scarcely hear what she said. Raising her finger also to her mouth she made the sign of the cross upon her lips. Then her breath failed her and she gasped for death; yet even when her soul was eager to break free, she turned the death-rattle (which comes at last to all) into the praise of the Lord. The bishop of Jerusalem and some from other cities were present, also a great number of the inferior clergy, both priests and levites.[fn-41-P4159_1124556:3004-nf] The entire monastery was filled with bodies of virgins and monks.

For it is written,[fn-58-P5858_1707514:33-nf] \"John came, who baptized in the wilderness, and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.\" And soon after,[fn-58-P5859_1707654:34-nf] \"And they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.\" For as he himself preceded Christ as His forerunner, so also his baptism was the prelude to the Lord's baptism.[fn-58-P5860_1707858:35-nf] \"He that is of the earth,\" he said, \"speaketh of the earth; he that cometh from heaven is above all.\" And again,[fn-58-P5861_1707990:36-nf] \"I indeed baptize you with water, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.\" But if John, as he himself confessed, did not baptize with the Spirit, it follows that he did not forgive sins either, for no man has his sins remitted without the Holy Ghost. Or if you contentiously argue that, because the baptism of John was from heaven, therefore sins were forgiven by it, show me what more there is for us to get in Christ's baptism. Because it forgives sins, it releases from Gehenna. Because it releases from Gehenna, it is perfect. But no baptism can be called perfect except that which depends on the cross and resurrection of Christ. Thus, although John himself said,[fn-58-P5862_1708681:37-nf] \"He must increase, but I must decrease,\" in your perverse scrupulosity you give more than is due to the baptism of the servant, and destroy that of the master to which you leave no more than to the other. What is the drift of your assertion? Just this-it does not strike you as strange that those who had been baptized by John, should afterwards by the laying on of hands receive the Holy Ghost, although it is evident that they did not obtain even remission of sins apart from the faith which was to follow. But you who receive a person baptized by the Arians and allow him to have perfect baptism, after that admission do you invoke the Holy Ghost as if this were still some slight defect, whereas there is no baptism of Christ without the Holy Ghost? But I have wandered too far, and when I might have met my opponent face to face and repelled his attack, I have only thrown a few light darts rom a distance. The baptism of John was so ar imperfect that it is plain they who had been baptized by him were afterwards baptized with the baptism of Christ. For thus the history relates[fn-58-P5863_1709785:38-nf] \"And it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples: and he said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye believed? And they said unto him, Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the Holy Ghost was given. And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism. And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on Him which should come after him, that is, on Jesus. And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus: And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, immediately the Holy Ghost fell on them.\" If then they were baptized with the true and lawful baptism of the Church, and thus received the Holy Ghost: do you follow the apostles and baptize those who have not had Christian baptism, and you will be able to invoke the Holy Ghost.","title":"The Dialogue Against the Luciferians","author":false},{"chapter":9,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_09_book_iv_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"It becomes us to enquire into the habits of the pious monks who have preceded us, in order that we may correct ourselves by their example: for undoubtedly very many excellent things have been said and done by them. One of them was accustomed to say, that `a drier and not irregular diet combined with love, would quickly conduct a monk into the haven of tranquillity.' The same individual freed one of his brethren from being troubled by apparitions at night, by enjoining him to minister while fasting to the sick. And being asked why he prescribed this: `Such affections,' said he, `are by nothing so effectually dissipated as by the exercise of compassion.' A certain philosopher of those times coming to Anthony the Just, said to him, `How can you endure, father, being deprived of the comfort of books?' `My book, O philosopher,' replied Anthony, `is the nature of things that are made, and it is present whenever I wish to read the words of God.' That `chosen vessel,'[fn-14-P1400_608469:59-nf] the aged Egyptian Macarius, asked me, why the strength of the faculty of memory is impaired by cherishing the remembrance of injury received from men; while by remembering those done us by devils it remains uninjured? And when I hesitated, scarcely knowing what answer to make, and begged him to account for it: `Because,' said he, `the former is an affection contrary to nature, and the latter is conformable to the nature of the mind.' Going on one occasion to the holy father Macarius about mid-day, and being overcome with the heat and thirst, I begged for some water to drink: `Content yourself with the shade,' was his reply, `for many who are now journeying by land, or sailing on the deep, are deprived even of this.' Discussing with him afterwards the subject of abstinence, `Take courage, my son,' said he: `for twenty years I have neither eaten, drunk, nor slept to satiety; my bread has always been weighed, my water measured, and what little sleep I have had has been stolen by reclining myself against a wall.'[fn-14-P1401_609513:60-nf] The death of his father was announced to one of the monks `Cease your blasphemy,' said he to the person that told him; `my father is immortal.' One of the brethren who possessed nothing but a copy of the Gospels, sold it, and distributed the price in food to the hungry, uttering this memorable saying-`I have sold the book which says, \"Sell that thou hast and give to the poor.\"'[fn-14-P1402_609929:61-nf] There is an island about the northern part of the city of Alexandria, beyond the lake called Maria, where a monk from Parembole[fn-14-P1403_610077:62-nf] dwells, in high repute among the Gnostics. This person was accustomed to say, that all the deeds of the monks were done for one of these five reasons;-on account of God, nature, custom, necessity, or manual labor. The same also said that there was only one virtue in nature, but that it assumes various characteristics according to the dispositions of the soul: just as the light of the sun is itself without form, but accommodates itself to the figure of that which receives it. Another of the monks said, `I withdraw myself from pleasures, in order to cut off the occasions of anger: for I know that it always contends for pleasures, disturbing my tranquillity of mind, and unfitting me for the attainment of knowledge.' One of the aged monks said that `Love knows not how to keep a deposit either of provisions or money.' He added, `I never remember to have been twice deceived by the devil in the same thing.' Thus wrote Evagrius in his book entitled Practice.[fn-14-P1404_611188:63-nf] And in that which he called The Gnostic he says, `We have learned from Gregory the Just, that there are four virtues, having distinct characteristics:-prudence and fortitude, temperance and justice. That it is the province of prudence to contemplate the sacred and intelligent powers apart from expression, because these are unfolded by wisdom: of fortitude to adhere to truth against all opposition, and never to turn aside to that which is unreal: of temperance to receive seed from the chief husbandman,[fn-14-P1405_611719:64-nf] but to repel him who would sow over it seed of another kind: and finally, of justice to adapt discourse to every one, according to their condition and capacity; stating some things obscurely, others in a figurative manner, and explaining others clearly for the instruction of the less intelligent.' That pillar of truth, Basil of Cappadocia, used to say that `the knowledge which men teach is perfected by constant study and exercise; but that which proceeds from the grace of God, by the practice of justice, patience, and mercy.' That the former indeed is often developed in persons who are still subject to the passions; whereas the latter is the portion of those only who are superior to their influence, and who during the season of devotion, contemplate that peculiar light of the mind which illumines them. That luminary of the Egyptians, holy Athanasius, assures us `that Moses was commanded to place the table on the north[fn-14-P1406_612672:65-nf] side. Let the Gnostics therefore understand what wind is contrary to them, and so nobly endure every temptation, and minister nourishment with a willing mind to those who apply to them.' Serapion, the angel of the church of the Thmuïtae, declared that `the mind is completely purified by drinking in spiritual knowledge': that `charity cures the inflammatory tendencies of the soul'; and that `the depraved lusts which spring up in it are restrained by abstinence.' `Exercise thyself continually,' said the great and enlightened teacher Didymus, `in reflecting on providence and judgment; and endeavor to bear in memory the material of whatever discourses thou mayst have heard on these topics, for almost all fail in this respect. Thou wilt find reasonings concerning judgment in the difference of created forms, and the constitution of the universe: sermons on providence comprehended in those means by which we are led from vice and ignorance to virtue and knowledge.'","title":"Book IV.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":9,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Come, now, if he had not \"wholly saddened\" so many persons in the first Epistle; if he had \"rebuked\" none, had \"terrified\"[fn-14-P1485_433467:150-nf] none; if he had \"smitten\" the incestuous man alone; if, for his cause, he had sent none into panic, had struck (no) \"inflated\" one with consternation,-would it not be better for you to suspect, and more believing for you to argue, that rather some one far different had been in the same predicament at that time among the Corinthians; so that, rebuked, and terrified, and already wounded with mourning, he therefore-the moderate nature of his fault permitting it-subsequently received pardon, than that you should interpret that (pardon as granted) to an incestuous fornicator?

Discipline governs a man, power sets a seal upon him; apart from the fact that power is the Spirit, but the Spirit is God. What, moreover, used (the Spirit) to teach? That there must be no communicating with the works of darkness.[fn-16-P1632_482253:266-nf] Observe what He bids. Who, moreover, was able to forgive sins? This is His alone prerogative: for \"who remitteth sins but God alone? \"[fn-16-P1633_482429:267-nf] and, of course, (who but He can remit) mortal sins, such as have been committed against Himself,[fn-16-P1634_482557:268-nf] and against His temple? For, as far as you are concerned, such as are chargeable with offence against you personally, you are commanded, in the person of Peter, to forgive even seventy times sevenfold.[fn-16-P1635_482802:269-nf] And so, if it were agreed that even the blessed apostles had granted any such indulgence (to any crime) the pardon of which (comes) from God, not from man, it would be competent (for them) to have done so, not in the exercise of discipline, but of power. For they both raised the dead,[fn-16-P1636_483112:270-nf] which God alone (can do), and restored the debilitated to their integrity,[fn-16-P1637_483226:271-nf] which none but Christ (can do); nay, they inflicted plagues too, which Christ would not do.

And in the Psalm it is read thus, \"Thou hast ascended up on high, Thou hast led captivity captive, Thou hast received gifts in men.\"[fn-20-P2059_1043058:85-nf] For so it stands in many Mss., especially in the Greek Mss., and so we have it translated from the Hebrew. The apostle therefore said gifts, as the prophet did, not gift. But whereas the prophet said, \"Thou hast received gifts in men,\" the apostle has preferred saying, \"He gave gifts to men:\" and this in order that the fullest sense may be gathered from both expressions, the one prophetic, the other apostolic; because both possess the authority of a divine utterance. For both are true, as well that He gave to men, as that He received in men. He gave to men, as the head to His own members: He Himself that gave, received in men, no doubt as in His own members; on account of which, namely, His own members, He cried from heaven, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\"[fn-20-P2060_1043853:86-nf] And of which, namely, His own members, He says, \"Since ye have done it to one of the least of these that are mine, ye have done it unto me.\"[fn-20-P2061_1044011:87-nf] Christ Himself, therefore, both gave from heaven and received on earth. And further, both prophet and apostle have said gifts for this reason, because many gifts, which are proper to each, are divided in common to all the members of Christ, by the Gift, which is the Holy Spirit. For each severally has not all, but some have these and some have those; although all have the Gift itself by which that which is proper to each is divided to Him, i.e. the Holy Spirit. For elsewhere also, when he had mentioned many gifts, \"All these,\" he says, \"worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to each severally as He will.\"[fn-20-P2062_1044657:88-nf] And this word is found also in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where it is written, \"God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts[fn-20-P2063_1044849:89-nf] of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-20-P2064_1044892:90-nf] And so here, when he had said, \"He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive, He gave gifts to men,\" he says further, \"But that He ascended, what is it but that He also first descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things. And He gave some apostles, some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors and doctors.\" (This we see is the reason why gifts are spoken of; because, as he says elsewhere, \"Are all apostles? are all prophets?\"[fn-20-P2065_1045454:91-nf] etc.) And here he has added, \"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ.\"[fn-20-P2066_1045613:92-nf] This is the house which, as the Psalm sings, is built up after the captivity;[fn-20-P2067_1045711:93-nf] since the house of Christ, which house is called His Church, is built up of those who have been rescued from the devil, by whom they were held captive. But He Himself led this captivity captive, who conquered the devil. And that he might not draw with him into eternal punishment those who were to become the members of the Holy Head, He bound him first by the bonds of righteousness, and then by those of might.

His seed also will I set for ever and ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.\"[fn-31-P3124_1730099:68-nf] Which words, when rightly understood, are all understood to be about the Lord Jesus Christ, under the name of David, on account of the form of a servant, which the same Mediator assumed[fn-31-P3125_1730310:69-nf] from the virgin of the seed of David.[fn-31-P3126_1730366:70-nf] For immediately something is said about the sins of his children, such as is set down in the Book of Samuel, and is more readily taken as if of Solomon. For there, that is, in the Book of Samuel, he says, \"And if he commit iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men; but my mercy will I not take away from him,\"[fn-31-P3127_1730758:71-nf] meaning by stripes the strokes of correction. Hence that saying, \"Touch ye not my christs.\"[fn-31-P3128_1730875:72-nf] For what else is that than, Do not harm them? But in the psalm, when speaking as if of David, He says something of the same kind there too. \"If his children,\" saith He, \"forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they profane my righteousnesses, and keep not my commandments; I will visit their iniquities with the rod, and their faults with stripes: but my mercy I will not make void from him.\"[fn-31-P3129_1731295:73-nf] a He did not say \"from them,\" although He spoke of his children, not of himself; but he said \"from him,\" which means the same thing if rightly understood. For of Christ Himself, who is the head of the Church, there could not be found any sins which required to be divinely restrained by human correction, mercy being still continued; but they are found in His body and members, which is His people. Therefore in the Book of Samuel it is said, \"iniquity of Him,\" but in the psalm, \"of His children,\" that we may understand that what is said of His body is in some way said of Himself. Wherefore also, when Saul persecuted His body, that is, His believing people, He Himself saith from heaven, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\"[fn-31-P3130_1732050:74-nf] Then in the following words of the psalm He says, \"Neither will I hurt in my truth, nor profane my covenant, and the things that proceed from my lips I will not disallow. Once have I sworn by my holiness, if I lie unto David,\"[fn-31-P3131_1732295:75-nf] -that is, I will in no wise lie unto David; for Scripture is wont to speak thus. But what that is in which He will not lie, He adds, saying, \"His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me, and as the moon perfected for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.\"[fn-31-P3132_1732603:76-nf] ","title":"Book XVII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":41,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_19_lecture_xiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"22.

In the Acts of the Apostles the faith of the fact is established; and that souls are delivered by almsgiving not only from the second, but from the first death, is discovered by the evidence of a matter accomplished and completed. When Tabitha, being greatly given to good works and to bestowing alms, fell sick and died, Peter was summoned to her lifeless body; and when he, with apostolic humanity, had come in haste, there stood around him widows weeping and entreating, showing the cloaks, and coats, and all the garments which they had previously received, and praying for the deceased not by their words, but by her own deeds. Peter felt that what was asked in such a way might be obtained, and that Christ's aid would not be wanting to the petitioners, since He Himself was clothed in the clothing of the widows. When, therefore, falling on his knees, he had prayed, and-fit advocate for the widows and poor-had brought to the Lord the prayers entrusted to him, turning to the body, which was now lying washed on the bier,[fn-75-P7503_2499112:20-nf] he said, \"Tabitha, in the name of Jesus Christ, arise!\"[fn-75-P7504_2499221:21-nf] Nor did He fail to bring aid to Peter, who had said in the Gospel, that whatever should be asked in His name should be given.

And so Peter and Paul occurred to them, I believe, just because in many places they chanced to see these two apostles represented in pictures as both in company with Him.[fn-11-P1120_440700:53-nf] For Rome, in a specially honourable and solemn manner,[fn-11-P1121_440796:54-nf] commends the merits of Peter and of Paul, for this reason among others, namely, that they suffered [martyrdom] on the same day.

We must see, however, whether this sentence must be supposed to stand in opposition to another of the Lord's sayings, namely, the one to this effect, \"He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.\"[fn-27-P2774_1226088:20-nf] For how was this man not against Him, who was notwith Him, and of whom John reported that he did not unite with them in following Him, if he is against Him who is not with Him? Or if the man was against Him, how does He say to the disciples, \"Forbid him not; for he that is not against you is on your side\"? Will any one aver that it is of consequence to observe that here He says to the disciples, \"He that is not against you is on your side;\" whereas, in the other passage, He spoke of Himself in the terms, \"He that is not with me is against me\"? That would make it appear, indeed, as if it were possible for one not to be with Him, although he was associated with those disciples of His who are, so to speak; His very members. Besides, how would the truth of such sayings as these stand then: \"He that receiveth you receiveth me;\"[fn-27-P2775_1226943:21-nf] and \"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me\"?[fn-27-P2776_1227064:22-nf] Or is it possible for one not to be against Him, although he may be against His disciples? Nay; for what shall we make then of words like these: \"He that despiseth you, despiseth me;\"[fn-27-P2777_1227268:23-nf] and, \"Inasmuch as ye did it not unto the least of mine, ye did it not unto me;\"[fn-27-P2778_1227365:24-nf] and, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me,\"[fn-27-P2779_1227429:25-nf] -although it was His disciples that Saul was persecuting? But, in good truth, the sense intended to be conveyed is just this, that, so far as a man is not with Him, so far is he against Him; and again, that, so far as a man is not against Him, so far is he with Him. For example, take this very case of the individual who was working miracles in the name of Christ, and yet was not in the company of Christ's disciples: so far as this man was working miracles in His name, so far was he with them, and so far he was not against them.[fn-27-P2780_1227980:26-nf] But, inasmuch as they had prohibited the man from doing a thing in which, so far forth, he was really with them, the Lord said to them,\" Forbid him not.\" For what they ought to have forbidden was what was outside their fellowship, so that they might bring him over to the unity of the Church, and not a thing like this, in which he was at one with them, that is to say, so far as he commended the name of their Master and Lord in the casting out of devils. And this is the principle on which the Catholic Church acts, not condemning common sacraments among heretics; for in these they are with us, and they are not against us. But she condemns and forbids division and separation, or any sentiment adverse to peace and truth. For therein they are against us, just because they are not with us in that, and because, not gathering with us, they are consequently scattering.

If, indeed, he had been, the remission of his sins which he would have received in that case from God would not have protected him from the sentence of public law, so far as appertained to the death of the body. What if, being already baptized, he had committed the crime and incurred the punishment of robbery and lawlessness, but yet received, by virtue of repentance added to his baptism, forgiveness of the sins which, though baptized, he had committed?

For in the account of him you have never read, either that he was never a Christian, or died a catechumen.

Some may say, Why did not Abraham's confidence in God prevent his being afraid to confess his wife? God could have warded off from him the death which he feared, and could have protected both him and his wife while among strangers, so that Sara, although very fair, should not have been desired by any one, nor Abraham killed on account of her. Of course, God could have done this; it would be absurd to deny it. But if, in reply to the people, Abraham had told them that Sara was his wife, his trust in God would have included both his own life and the chastity of Sara. Now it is part of sound doctrine, that when a man has any means in his power, he should not tempt the Lord his God. So it was not because the Saviour was unable to protect His disciples that He told them, \"When ye are persecuted in one city, flee to another.\"[fn-21-P2116_1260229:62-nf] And He Himself set the example. For though He had the power of laying down His own life, and did not lay it down till He chose to do so, still when an infant He fled to Egypt, carried by His parents;[fn-21-P2117_1260447:63-nf] and when He went up to the feast, He went not openly, but secretly, though at other times He spoke openly to the Jews, who in spite of their rage and hostility could not lay hands on Him, because His hour was not come,[fn-21-P2118_1260685:64-nf] -not the hour when He would be obliged to die, but the hour when He would consider it seasonable to be put to death. Thus He who displayed divine power by teaching and reproving openly, without allowing the rage of his enemies to hurt Him, did also, by escaping and concealing Himself, exhibit the conduct becoming the feebleness of men, that they should not tempt God when they have any means in their power of escaping threatened danger. So also in the apostle, it was not from despair of divine assistance and protection, or from loss of faith, that he was let down over the wall in a basket, in order to escape being taken by his enemies:[fn-21-P2119_1261351:65-nf] not from want of faith in God did he thus escape, but because not to escape, when this escape was possible, would have been tempting God. Accordingly, when Abraham was among strangers, and when, on account of the remarkable beauty of Sara, both his life and her chastity were in danger, since it was in his power to protect not both of these, but one only,-his life, namely,-to avoid tempting God he did what he could; and in what he could not do, he trusted to God. Unable to conceal his being a man, he concealed his being a husband, test he should be put to death; trusting to God to preserve his wife's purity.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":9,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"ANF-10","text":"It ought not to be forgotten that in such a Gospel as this there is embraced every good deed which was done to Jesus; as, for example, the story of the woman[fn-61-P6188_957985:59-nf] who had been a stalker and had repented, and who, having experienced a genuine recovery from her evil state, had grace to pour her ointment over Jesus so that every one in the house smelt the sweet savour. Hence, too, the words, \"Wherever this Gospel shall be preached among all the nations, there also this that she has done shall be spoken of, for a memorial of her.\" And it is clear that whatever is done to the disciples of Jesus is done to Him.

For how has the Lord commanded us to pray for those who persecute us? Do we pray thus that the grace of God may be recompensed them for the sake of their good will, and not rather that the evil will itself may be changed into a good one? Just as we believe that at that time the saints whom he was persecuting did not pray for Saul in vain, that his will might be converted to the faith which he was destroying. And indeed that his conversion was effected from above, appeared even by a manifest miracle. But how many enemies of Christ are at the present day suddenly drawn by God's secret grace to Christ! And if I had not set down this word from the gospel, what things would that man have said in this behalf concerning me, since even now he is stirring, not against me, but against Him who cries, \"No man can come to me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him\"![fn-52-P5218_2046306:82-nf] For He does not say, \"except He lead him,\" so that we can thus in any way understand that his will precedes. For who is \"drawn,\" if he was already willing? And yet no man comes unless he is willing. Therefore he is drawn in wondrous ways to will, by Him who knows how to work within the very hearts of men.

Such, we may believe, was that John the Monk, whom the elder Theodosius, the Emperor,\nconsulted concerning the issue of the civil war: seeing he had also the gift of prophecy. For that\nnot each several person has a several one of those gifts, but that one man may have more gifts than\none, I make no question. This John, then, when once a certain most religious woman desired to see\nhim, and to obtain this did through her husband make vehement entreaty, refused indeed this request\nbecause he had never allowed this to women, but \"Go,\" said be, \"tell thy wife, she shall see me this\nnight, but in her sleep.\" And so it came to pass: and he gave her advice, whatever was meet to be\ngiven to a wedded believing woman. And she, on her awaking, made known to her husband that she had\nseen a man of God, such as he knew him to be, and what she had been told by him. The person who\nlearned this from them, reported it to me, a grave man and a noble, and most worthy to be believed.\nBut if I myself had seen that holy monk, because (it is said) he was most patient in hearing\nquestions and most wise in answering, I would have sought of him, as touching our question, whether\nhe himself came to that woman in sleep, that is to say, his spirit in the form of his body, just as\nwe dream that we see ourselves in the form of our own body; or whether, while he himself was doing\nsomething else, or, if asleep, was dreaming of something else, it was either by an Angel or in some\nother way that such vision took place in the woman's dream; and that it would so be, as he promised,\nhe himself foreknew by the Spirit of prophecy revealing the same. For if he was himself present to\nher in her dream, of course it was by miraculous grace that he was enabled so to do, not by nature;\nand by God's gift, not by faculty of his own. But if, while he was doing some other thing or sleeping\nand occupied with other sights, the woman saw him in her sleep, then doubtless some such thing took\nplace, as that is which we read in the Acts of the Apostles, where the Lord Jesus speaks to Ananias\nconcerning Saul,[fn-49-P4932_2430043:66-nf] and informs him that Saul\nhas seen Ananias coming unto him, while Ananias himself wist not of it. The man of God would make\nanswer to me of these things as the case might be, and then about the Martyrs I should go on to ask\nof him, whether they be themselves present in dreams, or in whatever other way to those who see them\nin what shape they will; and above all when the demons in men confess themselves tormented by the\nMartyrs, and ask them to spare them; or whether these things be wrought through angelic powers, to\nthe honor and commendation of the Saints for men's profit, while those are in supreme rest, and\nwholly free for other far better sights, apart from us, and praying for us. For it chanced at Milan\nat (the tomb of) the holy Martyrs Protasius and Gervasius, that Ambrose the bishop, at that time\nliving, being expressly named, in like manner as were the dead whose names they were rehearsing, the\ndemons confessed him and besought him to spare them, he being the while otherwise engaged, and when\nthis was taking place, altogether unwitting of it. Or whether indeed these things are wrought,\nsomewhiles by very presence of the Martyrs, otherwhiles by that of Angels; and whether it be\npossible, or by what tokens possible, for us to discriminate these two cases; or whether to perceive\nand to judge of these things none be able, but he which hath that gift through God's Spirit,\n\"dividing unto every man severally as He will:\"[fn-49-P4933_2431508:67-nf] the same John, me-thinks, would discourse to me\nof all these matters, as I should wish; that either by his teaching I might learn, and what I should\nbe, told should know to be true and certain; or I should believe what I knew not, upon his telling me\nwhat things he knew. But if peradventure he should make answer out of holy Scripture, and say,\n\"Things higher than thou, seek thou not; and things stronger than thou, search thou not; but what the\nLord hath commanded thee, of those things bethink thee alway:\"[fn-49-P4934_2432040:68-nf] this also I should thankfully accept.

Thus the heavenly King arrayed Himself in armour of humility, and so conquered the bitter one, and drew from him a good answer as a sure pledge [of victory]. This is the armour concerning which Paul said, that by it we humble the loftiness that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God.[fn-37-P3763_1212409:25-nf] For Paul had received the proof of it in himself. For as he had been warring in pride, but was conquered in humility, so is to be conquered every lofty thing which exalteth itself against this humility. For Saul was journeying to subdue the disciples with hard words, but the Master of the disciples subdued him with a humble word. For when He to whom all things are possible manifested Himself to him, giving up all things else, He spoke to him in humility alone, that He might teach us that a soft tongue is more effectual than all things else against hard thoughts. For neither threats nor words of terror were heard by Paul, but weak words not able to avenge themselves: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?[fn-37-P3764_1213139:26-nf] But the words which were thought not even capable of avenging themselves, were found to be taking vengeance by drawing him away from the Jews and making him a goodly vessel.

When he was filled with the bitterness of the crucifiers, in his bitterness he made havoc of the churches. But when he was filled with the sweetness of the Crucified, he embittered the synagogues of the crucifiers. Our Lord then strove with humble voice with him, who had been warring against His churches with hard bonds. Thus Saul, who had been binding the disciples with bitter chains, was bound with pleasant persuasions; that he might not again cast the disciples into bonds; since he was bound by the Crucified, Who puts to silence evil voices, whom all they that were set against Him could not bind or injure. But when Paul ceased from binding the disciples, he himself was bound with chains by the persecutors.

We are not, however, to suppose that each individual has to contend against all these (adversaries). For it is impossible for any man, although he were a saint, to carry on a contest against all of them at the same time. If that indeed were by any means to be the case, as it is certainly impossible it should be so, human nature could not possibly bear it without undergoing entire destruction.[fn-71-P7154_1578414:302-nf] But as, for example, if fifty soldiers were to say that they were about to engage with fifty others, they would not be understood to mean that one of them had to contend against the whole fifty, but each one would rightly say that \"our battle was against fifty,\" all against all; so also this is to be understood as the apostle's meaning, that all the athletes and soldiers of Christ have to wrestle and struggle against all the adversaries enumerated,-the struggle having, indeed, to be maintained against all, but by single individuals either with individual powers, or at least in such manner as shall be determined by God, who is the just president of the struggle. For I am of opinion that there is a certain limit to the powers of human nature, although there may be a Paul, of whom it is said, \"He is a chosen vessel unto Me; \"[fn-71-P7155_1579286:303-nf] or a Peter, against whom the gates of hell do not prevail; or a Moses, the friend of God: yet not one of them could sustain, without destruction to himself,[fn-71-P7156_1579463:304-nf] the whole simultaneous assault of these opposing powers, unless indeed the might of Him alone were to work in him, who said, \"Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\"[fn-71-P7157_1579668:305-nf] And therefore Paul exclaims with confidence, \"I can do all things through Christ, who strengtheneth me; \"[fn-71-P7158_1579795:306-nf] and again, \"I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\"[fn-71-P7159_1579922:307-nf] On account, then, of this power, which certainly is not of human origin operating and speaking in him, Paul could say, \"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor power, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"[fn-71-P7160_1580342:308-nf] For I do not think that human nature can alone of itself maintain a contest with angels, and with the powers of the height and of the abyss,[fn-71-P7161_1580666:309-nf] and with any other creature; but when it feels the presence of the Lord dwelling within it, confidence in the divine help will lead it to say, \"The Lord is my light, and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the enemies draw near to me, to eat my flesh, my enemies who trouble me, they stumbled and fell. Though an host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in Him shall I be confident.\"[fn-71-P7162_1581188:310-nf] From which I infer that a man perhaps would never be able of himself to vanquish an opposing power, unless he had the benefit of divine assistance. Hence, also, the angel is said to have wrestled with Jacob. Here, however, I understand the writer to mean, that it was not the same thing for the angel to have wrestled with Jacob, and to have wrestled against him; but the angel that wrestles with him is he who was present with him in order to secure his safety, who, after knowing also his moral progress, gave him in addition the name of Israel, i.e., he is with him in the struggle, and assists him in the contest; seeing there was undoubtedly another angel against whom he contended, and against whom he had to carry on a contest. Finally, Paul has not said that we wrestle with princes, or with powers, but against principalities and powers. And hence, although Jacob wrestled, it was unquestionably against some one of those powers which, Paul declares, resist and contend with the human race, and especially with the saints. And therefore at last the Scripture says of him that \"he wrestled with the angel, and had power with God,\" so that the struggle is supported by help of the angel, but the prize of success conducts the conqueror to God.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":9,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_39_oration_xviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"14.

For the law of baptizing has been imposed, and the formula prescribed: \"Go,\" He saith, \"teach the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-116-P11650_3281719:139-nf] The comparison with this law of that definition, \"Unless a man have been reborn of water and Spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom of the heavens,\"[fn-116-P11651_3281913:140-nf] has tied faith to the necessity of baptism.

And lest any one should err, and, while he adored the Head in heaven should trample upon the feet on earth, He told us where would be His members. For being about to ascend, He spake His last words on earth: after those same words He spake no more on earth. The Head about to ascend into heaven commended to us His members on earth and departed. Thenceforth thou findest not Christ speaking on earth; thou findest Him speaking, but from heaven. And even from heaven, why? Because His members on earth were trodden upon.

He, as it were, detains his soul by a violent effort, that it may not depart ere those words be made sure. When he has dictated those last words, he breathes out his soul, he is borne a corpse to the sepulchre. His heirs, how do they remember the last words of the dying man? How, if one should stand up and say to them, Do it not: what would they say? \"What shall I not do that which my father, in the act of breathing out his soul, commanded me with his last breath, the last word of his that sounded in my ears when my father was departing this life? Whatever other words of his I may not regard, his last have a stronger hold upon me: since which I never saw him more, never more heard speech of his. Brethren, think with Christian hearts; if to the heirs of a man, his words spoken when about to go to the tomb are so sweet, so grateful, so weighty, what must we account of the last words of Christ, spoken not when about to go back to the tomb, but to ascend into heaven! As for the man who lived and is dead, his soul is hurried off to other places, his body is laid in the earth, and whether these words of his be done or not, makes no difference to him: he has now something else to do, or something else to suffer: either in Abraham's bosom he rejoices, or in eternal fire he longs for a drop of water, while his corpse lies there senseless in the sepulchre; and yet the last words of the dying man are kept. What have those to look for, who keep not the last words of Him that sitteth in heaven, who seeth from on high whether they be despised or not despised?

For when he was Saul, his name was derived from Saul: now Saul was a proud king; and in his reign he persecuted the humble David.[fn-42-P4237_1806856:6-nf] So when he who was afterwards Paul,[fn-42-P4238_1806913:7-nf] was Saul, he was proud, at that time a persecutor of the innocent, at that time a waster of the Church. For he had received letters from the chief priests (burning as he was with zeal for the synagogue, and persecuting the Christian name), that he might show up whatever Christians he should find, to be punished.[fn-42-P4239_1807243:8-nf] While he is on his way, while he is breathing out slaughter, while he is thirsting for blood, he is thrown to the ground by the voice of Christ from heaven the persecutor, he is raised up the preacher.

He gives pain, it is true; but he only gives pain, that he may bring the patient on to health. He gives pain; but if he did not, he would do no good. Christ then by one word laid Saul low, and raised up Paul; that is, He laid low the proud, and raised up the humble. For what was the reason of his change of name, that whereas he was afore called Saul, he chose afterwards to be called Paul; but that he acknowledged in himself that the name of Saul when he was a persecutor, had been a name of pride? He chose therefore a humble name; to be called Paul, that is, the least. For Paul is, \"the least.\" Paul is nothing else but little. And now glorying in this name, and giving us a lesson[fn-42-P4242_1808447:11-nf] of humility, he says, \"I am the least of the Apostles.\"[fn-42-P4243_1808520:12-nf] Whence then, whence was he, but of the people of the Jews?

In this chapter of the Gospel, brethren, our Lord Jesus Christ has most especially commended Himself to our faith in respect of His humanity. For indeed He always keeps in view, both in His words and deeds, that He should be believed to be God and man: God who made us, man who sought us; with the Father, always God; with us, man in time. For He would not have sought man whom He had made if Himself had not become that which He had made. But remember this, and do not let it slip from your hearts, that Christ became man in such manner that He ceased not to be God. While remaining God, He who made man took manhood. While, therefore, as man He concealed Himself, He must not be thought to have lost His power, but only to have offered an example to our infirmity. For He was detained when He willed to be, and He was put to death when he willed to be. But since there were to be His members, that is, His faithful ones,who would not have that power which He, our God, had; by His being hid, by His concealing Himself as if He would not be put to death, He indicated that His members would do this, in which members He Himself in fact was. For Christ is not simply in the head and not in the body, but Christ whole is in the head and body. What, therefore, His members are, that He is; but what He is, it does not necessarily follow that His members are. For if His members were not Himself, He would not have said, \"Saul, why persecutest thou me?\"[fn-13-P1342_850557:1-nf] For Saul was not persecuting Himself on earth, but His members, namely, His believers.

I think that you cannot fail to understand this too, that the word \"father\" is but a single term indeed, and yet one admitting of being understood in various ways. For one is called father, as being the parent of those children whom he has begotten in a natural way; another is called father, as being the guardian of children whom he has but brought up; and some, again, are called fathers in respect of the privileged standing accruing through time or age. Hence our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is said to have a variety of fathers: for David was called His father, and Joseph was reckoned to be His father, while neither of these two was His father in respect of the actuality of nature. For David is called His father as touching the prerogative of time and age,[fn-35-P3594_998366:322-nf] and Joseph is designated His father as concerning the law of upbringing; but God Himself is His only Father by nature, who was pleased to make all things manifest in short space[fn-35-P3595_998583:323-nf] to us by His word.

For which of us could have hoped that Paul, the persecutor and enemy of the Church, would prove its defender and guardian? Yea, and not that alone, but that he would become also its ruler, the founder and architect of the churches? Wherefore after him, and after those who were with Himself-that is, the disciples-we are not to look for the advent of any other (such), according to the Scriptures; for our Lord Jesus Christ says of this Paraclete, \"He shall receive of mine.\"[fn-36-P3601_1000524:329-nf] Him therefore He selected as an acceptable vessel; and He sent this Paul to us in the Spirit. Into him the Spirit was poured;[fn-36-P3602_1000671:330-nf] and as that Spirit could not abide upon all men, but only on Him who was born of Mary the mother of God, so that Spirit, the Paraclete, could not come into any other, but could only come upon the apostles and the sainted Paul. \"For he is a chosen vessel,\" He says, \"unto me, to bear my name before kings and the Gentiles.\"[fn-36-P3603_1001283:331-nf] The apostle himself, too, states the same thing in his first epistle, where he says: \"According to the grace that is given to me of God, that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering[fn-36-P3604_1001546:332-nf] the Gospel of God.\"[fn-36-P3605_1001624:333-nf] \"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-36-P3606_1001745:334-nf] And again: \"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me by word and deed.\"[fn-36-P3607_1001883:335-nf] \"I am the last of all the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle. But by the grace of God I am what I am.\"[fn-36-P3608_1002022:336-nf] And it, is his wish to have to deal with[fn-36-P3609_1002240:337-nf] those who sought the proof of that Christ who spake in him, for this reason, that the Paraclete was in him: and as having obtained His gift of grace, and as being enriched with magnificent, honour,[fn-36-P3610_1002458:338-nf] he says: \"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-36-P3611_1002714:339-nf] Again, that it was the Paraclete Himself who was in Paul, is indicated by our Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel, when He says: \"If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray my Father, and He shall give you another Comforter.\"[fn-36-P3612_1002971:340-nf] In these words He points to the Paraclete Himself, for He speaks of \"another\" Comforter. And hence we have given credit to Paul, and have hearkened to him when he says, \"Or[fn-36-P3613_1003169:341-nf] seek ye a proof of Christ i speaking in me? \"[fn-36-P3614_1003227:342-nf] and when he expresses himself in similar terms, of which we have already spoken above. Thus, too, he seals his testament for us as for his faithful heirs, and like a father he addresses us in these words in his Epistle to the Corintians: \"I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures; and that He was seen of Cephas, then of the eleven apostles:[fn-36-P3615_1003765:343-nf] after that He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that He was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all He was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. For I am the last of the apostles.\"[fn-36-P3616_1004100:344-nf] \"Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.\"[fn-36-P3617_1004213:345-nf] And again, in delivering over to his heirs that inheritance which he gained first himself, he says: \"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ,[fn-36-P3618_1004538:346-nf] whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another Spirit, which we have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. For I suppose that I did nothing less for you than the other apostles.\"[fn-36-P3619_1004791:347-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":9,"verse":40,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"ANF-06","text":"1.
