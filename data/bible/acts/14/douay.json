{"verses":["And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into\nthe synagogue of the Jews and so spoke that a very great multitude both\nof the Jews and of the Greeks did believe.","But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and incensed the minds of the\nGentiles against the brethren.","A long time therefore they abode there, dealing confidently in\nthe Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his grace, granting signs\nand wonders to be done by their hands.","And the multitude of the city was divided.  And some of them\nindeed held with the Jews, but some with the apostles.","And when there was an assault made by the Gentiles and the Jews\nwith their rulers, to use them contumeliously and to stone them:","They, understanding it, fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of\nLycaonia, and to the whole country round about:  and were there\npreaching the gospel.","And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, a\ncripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked.","This same heard Paul speaking.  Who looking upon him and seeing\nthat he had faith to be healed,","Said with a loud voice:  Stand upright on thy feet.  And he leaped\nup and walked.","And when the multitudes had seen what Paul had done, they lifted\nup their voice in the Lycaonian tongue, saying:  The gods are come down\nto us in the likeness of men.","And they called Barnabas, Jupiter:  but Paul, Mercury:  because he\nwas chief speaker.","The priest also of Jupiter that was before the city, bringing\noxen and garlands before the gate, would have offered sacrifice with\nthe people.","Which, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul had heard, rending\ntheir clothes, they leaped out among the people, crying,","And saying:  Ye men, why do ye these things?  We also are mortals,\nmen like unto you, preaching to you to be converted from these vain\nthings to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea\nand all things that are in them:","Who in times past, suffered all nations to walk in their own\nways.","Nevertheless he left not himself without testimony, doing good\nfrom heaven, giving rains and fruitful Seasons, filling our hearts with\nfood and gladness.","And speaking these things, they scarce restrained the people\nfrom sacrificing to them.","Now there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium:\nand, persuading the multitude and stoning Paul, drew him out of the\ncity, thinking him to be dead.","But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and\nentered into the city:  and the next day he departed with Barnabas to\nDerbe.","And when they had preached the gospel to that city and had\ntaught many, they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and to\nAntioch:","Confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to\ncontinue in the faith:  and that through many tribulations we must enter\ninto the kingdom of God.","And when they had ordained to them priests in every church and\nhad prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, in whom they\nbelieved.","And passing through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia.","And having spoken the word of the Lord in Perge, they went down\ninto Attalia.","And thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been\ndelivered to the grace of God, unto the work which they accomplished.","And when they were come and had assembled the church, they\nrelated what great things God had done with them and how he had opened\nthe door of faith to the Gentiles.","And they abode no small time with the disciples."]}
