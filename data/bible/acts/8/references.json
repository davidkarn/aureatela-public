As there were about five thousand monks in the neighborhood, living in as many separate cells, a council was held as to what should be done. Some said that the coins should be distributed among the poor; others that they should be given to the church, while others were for sending them hack to the relatives of the deceased.

Why should I not mourn, you say? Jacob lint on sackcloth for Joseph, and when all his family gathered round him, refused to be comforted. \"I will go down,\" he said, \"into the grave unto my son mourning.\"[fn-12-P1230_263754:826-nf] David also mourned for Absalom, covering his face, and crying: \"O my son, Absalom ...my son, Absalom! Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son!\"[fn-12-P1231_263929:827-nf] Moses,[fn-12-P1232_263961:828-nf] too, and Aaron,[fn-12-P1233_264000:829-nf] and the rest of the saints were mourned for with a solemn mourning. The answer to your reasoning issimple. Jacob, it is true, mourned for Joseph, whom he fancied slain, and thought tomeet only in the grave (his words were: \"I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning\"), but he only did so because Christ had not yet broken open the door of paradise, nor quenched with his blood the flaming sword and the whirling of the guardian cherubim.[fn-12-P1234_264466:830-nf] (Hence in the story of Dives and Lazarus, Abraham and the beggar, though really in a place of refreshment, are described as being in hell.[fn-12-P1235_264876:831-nf] ) And David, who, after interceding in vain for the life of his infant child, refused to weep for it, knowing that it had not sinned, did well to weep for a son who had been a parricide-in will, if not in deed.[fn-12-P1236_265121:832-nf] And when we read that, for Moses and Aaron, lamentation was made after ancient custom, this ought not to surprise us, for even in the Acts of the Apostles, in the full blaze of the gospel, we see that the brethren at Jerusalem made great lamentation for Stephen.[fn-12-P1237_265409:833-nf] This great lamentation, however, refers not to the mourners, but to the funeral procession and to the crowds which accompanied it. This is what the Scripture says of Jacob: \"Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, and all the house of Joseph and his brethren\"; and a few lines farther on: \"And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a great company.\" Finally, \"they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation.\"[fn-12-P1238_265980:834-nf] This solemn lamentation does not impose prolonged weeping upon the Egyptians, but simply describes the funeral ceremony.

Let me now fulfil the promise I made a little while ago and with all the skill of a rhetorician sing the praises of water and of baptism. In the beginning the earth was without form and void, there was no dazzling sun or pale moon, there were no glittering stars. There was nothing but matter inorganic and invisible, and even this was lost in abysmal depths and shrouded in a distorting gloom. The Spirit of God above moved, as a charioteer, over the face of the waters,[fn-28-P2879_762983:2051-nf] and produced from them the infant world, a type of the Christian child that is drawn from the laver of baptism. A firmament is constructed between heaven and earth, and to this is allotted the name heaven,-in the Hebrew Shamayim or `what comes out of the waters,'-[fn-28-P2880_763268:2052-nf] and the waters which are above the heavens are parted from the others to the praise of God. Wherefore also in the vision of the prophet Ezekiel there is seen above the cherubim a crystal stretched forth,[fn-28-P2881_763585:2053-nf] that is, the compressed and denser waters. The first living beings come out of the waters; and believers soar out of the layer with wings to heaven. Man is formed out of clay[fn-28-P2882_763782:2054-nf] and God holds the mystic waters in the hollow of his hand.[fn-28-P2883_763862:2055-nf] In Eden a garden[fn-28-P2884_763944:2056-nf] is planted, and a fountain in the midst of it parts into four heads.[fn-28-P2885_764033:2057-nf] This is the same fountain which Ezekiel later on describes as issuing out of the temple and flowing towards the rising of the sun, until it heals the bitter waters and quickens those that are dead.[fn-28-P2886_764265:2058-nf] When the world falls into sin nothing but a flood of waters can cleanse it again. But as soon as the foul bird of wickedness is driven away, the dove of the Holy Spirit comes to Noah[fn-28-P2887_764489:2059-nf] as it came afterwards to Christ in the Jordan,[fn-28-P2888_764574:2060-nf] and, carrying ill its beak a branch betokening restoration and light, brings tidings of peace to the whole world. Pharaoh and his host, loth to allow God's people to leave Egypt, are overwhelmed in the Red Sea figuring thereby our baptism. His destruction is thus described in the book of Psalms: \"Thou didst endow the sea with virtue through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters: thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces.\"[fn-28-P2889_765053:2061-nf] For this reason adders and scorpions haunt dry places[fn-28-P2890_765139:2062-nf] and whenever they come near water behave as if rabid or insane.[fn-28-P2891_765228:2063-nf] As wood sweetens Marah so that seventy palm-trees are watered by its streams, so the cross makes the waters of the law lifegiving to the seventy who are Christ's apostles.[fn-28-P2892_765444:2064-nf] It is Abraham and Isaac who dig wells, the Philistines who try to prevent them.[fn-28-P2893_765561:2065-nf] Beersheba too, the city of the oath,[fn-28-P2894_765637:2066-nf] and [Gihon], the scene of Solomon's coronation,[fn-28-P2895_765708:2067-nf] derive their names from springs. It is beside a well that Eliezer finds Rebekah.[fn-28-P2896_765833:2068-nf] Rachel too is a drawer of water and wins a kiss thereby[fn-28-P2897_765928:2069-nf] from the supplanter[fn-28-P2898_765987:2070-nf] Jacob. When the daughters of the priests of Midian are in a strait to reach the well, Moses opens a way for them and delivers them from outrage.[fn-28-P2899_766157:2071-nf] The Lord's forerunner at Salem (a name which means peace or perfection) makes ready the people for Christ with spring-water.[fn-29-P2900_766319:2072-nf] The Saviour Himself does not preach the kingdom of heaven until by His baptismal immersion He has cleansed the Jordan.[fn-29-P2901_766461:2073-nf] Water is the matter of His first miracle[fn-29-P2902_766542:2074-nf] and it is from a well that the Samaritan woman is bidden to slake her thirst.[fn-29-P2903_766699:2075-nf] To Nicodemus He secretly says:-\"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.\"[fn-29-P2904_766857:2076-nf] As His earthly course began with water, so it ended with it. His side is pierced by the spear, and blood and water flow forth, twin emblems of baptism and of martyrdom.[fn-29-P2905_767048:2077-nf] After His resurrection also, when sending His apostles to the Gentiles, He commands them to baptize these in the mystery of the Trinity.[fn-29-P2906_767263:2078-nf] The Jewish people repenting of their misdoing are sent forthwith by Peter to be baptized.[fn-29-P2907_767380:2079-nf] Before Sion travails she brings forth children, and a nation is born at once.[fn-29-P2908_767480:2080-nf] Paul the persecutor of the church, that ravening wolf out of Benjamin,[fn-29-P2909_767588:2081-nf] bows his head before Ananias one of Christ's sheep, and only recovers his sight when he applies the remedy of baptism.[fn-29-P2910_767731:2082-nf] By the reading of the prophet the eunuch of Candace the queen of Ethiopia is made ready for the baptism of Christ.[fn-29-P2911_767901:2083-nf] Though it is against nature the Ethiopian does change his skin and the leopard his spots.[fn-29-P2912_768018:2084-nf] Those who have received only John's baptism and have no knowledge of the Holy Spirit are baptized again, lest any should suppose that water unsanctified thereby could suffice for the salvation of either Jew or Gentile.[fn-29-P2913_768261:2085-nf] \"The voice of the Lord isupon the waters ...The Lord is uponmany waters ...the Lord maketh the flood to inhabit it.\"[fn-29-P2914_768398:2086-nf] His \"teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which came up from the washing; whereof everyone bear twins, and none is barren among them.\"[fn-29-P2915_768625:2087-nf] If none is barren among them, all of them must have udders filled with milk and be able to say with the apostle: \"Ye are my little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you;\"[fn-29-P2916_768853:2088-nf] and \"I have fed you with milk and not with meat.\"[fn-29-P2917_768925:2089-nf] And it is to the grace of baptism that the prophecy of Micah refers: \"He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us: he will subdue our iniquities, and will cast all our sins[fn-29-P2918_769130:2090-nf] into the depths of the sea.\"[fn-29-P2919_769207:2091-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":8,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1102","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"After this Paul, went a short distance down the hill to the tower of Edar,[fn-39-P3941_1064327:2807-nf] that is `of the flock,'[fn-39-P3942_1064373:2808-nf] near which Jacob fed his flocks, and where the shepherds keeping watch by night were privileged to hear the words: \"Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill toward men.\"[fn-39-P3943_1064581:2809-nf] While they were keeping their sheep they found the Lamb of God; whose fleece bright and clean was made wet with the dew of heaven when it was dry upon all the earth beside,[fn-39-P3944_1064779:2810-nf] and whose blood when sprinkled on the doorposts drove off the destroyer of Egypt[fn-39-P3945_1064881:2811-nf] and took away the sins of the world.[fn-39-P3946_1064942:2812-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":8,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1152","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3. You may perhaps in your secret thoughts find fault with me for thus assailing a man behind his back.

But whereas, in the same Trinity, some things severally are specially predicated, these are in no way said in reference to themselves in themselves, but either in mutual reference, or in respect to the creature; and, therefore, it is manifest that such things are spoken relatively, not in the way of substance. For the Trinity is called one God, great, good, eternal, omnipotent; and the same God Himself may be called His own deity, His own magnitude, His own goodness, His own, eternity, His own omnipotence: but the Trinity cannot in the same way be called the Father, except perhaps metaphorically, in respect to the creature, on account of the adoption of sons. For that which is written, \"Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord,\"[fn-10-P1066_428809:20-nf] ought certainly not to be understood as if the Son were excepted, or the Holy Spirit were excepted; which one Lord our God we rightly call also our Father, as regenerating us by His grace. Neither can the Trinity in any wise be called the Son, but it can be called, in its entirety, the Holy Spirit, according to that which is written, \"God is a Spirit;\"[fn-10-P1067_429182:21-nf] because both the Father is a spirit and the Son is a spirit, and the Father is holy and the Son is holy. Therefore, since the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are one God, and certainly God is holy, and God is a spirit, the Trinity can be called also the Holy Spirit. But yet that Holy Spirit, who is not the Trinity, but is understood as in the Trinity, is spoken of in His proper name of the Holy Spirit relatively, since He is referred both to the Father and to the Son, because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son. But the relation is not itself apparent in that name, but it is apparent when He is called the gift of God;[fn-10-P1068_429858:22-nf] for Heis the gift of the Father and of the Son, because \"He proceeds from the Father,\"[fn-10-P1069_429966:23-nf] as the Lord says; and because that which the apostle says, \"Now, if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His,\"[fn-10-P1070_430111:24-nf] he says certainly of the Holy Spirit Himself. When we say, therefore, the gift of the giver, and the giver of the gift, we speak in both cases relatively in reciprocal reference. Therefore the Holy Spirit is a certain unutterable communion of the Father and the Son; and on that account, perhaps, He is so called, because the same name is suitable to both the Father and the Son. For He Himself is called specially that which they are called in common; because both the Father is a spirit and the Son a spirit, both the Father is holy and the Son holy.[fn-10-P1071_430683:25-nf] In order, therefore, that the communion of both may be signified from a name which is suitable to both, the Holy Spirit is called the gift of both.

The Lord Himself, speaking by the Psalmist, says: \"As for my saints which are upon earth, He hath caused all my purposes to be admired in them.\"[fn-6-P620_419585:184-nf] Not their merits, but \"my purposes.\" For what is theirs except that which is afterwards mentioned,-\"their weaknesses are multiplied,\"[fn-6-P621_419738:185-nf] -above the weakness that they had? Moreover, the law also entered, that the offence might abound. But why does the Psalmist immediately add: \"They hastened after?\"[fn-6-P622_419921:186-nf] When their sorrows and infirmities multiplied (that is, when their offence abounded), they then sought the Physician more eagerly, in order that, where sin abounded, grace might much more abound. He then says: \"I will not gather their assemblies together [with their offerings] of blood;\" for by their many sacrifices of blood, when they gathered their assemblies into the tabernacle at first, and then into the temple, they were rather convicted as sinners than cleansed. I shall no longer, He says, gather their assemblies of blood-offerings together; because there is one blood-shedding given for many, whereby they may be truly cleansed. Then it follows: \"Neither will I make mention of their names with my lips,\" as if they were the names of renewed ones. For these were their names at first: children of the flesh, children of the world, children ofwrath, children of the devil, unclean, sinners, impious; but afterwards, children of God,-a new name to the new man, a new song to the singer of what is new, by means of the New Testament.

He it is that bears our weaknesses, and for us is involved in pains: and we accounted Him to be in pains, and in misfortune, and in punishment. But it was He who was wounded for our sins, was weakened for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and by His bruise we are healed. All we, as sheep, have gone astray; and the Lord delivered Him up for our sins. And although He was evilly entreated, yet He opened not His mouth: as a sheep was He led to the slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For His life shall be taken away from the earth, and for the iniquities of my people was He led to death. Therefore I will give the wicked for His burial, and the rich for His death; because He did no iniquity, nor deceit with His mouth. The Lord is pleased to purge Him from misfortune. If you could yourselves have given your soul on account of your sins, ye should see a seed of a long life. And the Lord is pleased to rescue His soul from pains, to show Him light, and to form it through His understanding; to justify the Just One, who serves many well; and He shall Himself bear their sins.

O. I do not deny that it is the practice of the Churches in the case of those who living far from the greater towns have been baptized by presbyters and deacons, for the bishop to visit them, and by the laying on of hands to invoke the Holy Ghost upon them. But how shall I describe your habit of applying the laws of the Church to heretics, and of exposing the virgin entrusted to you in the brothels of harlots? If a bishop lays his hands on men he lays them on those who have been baptized in the right faith, and who have believed that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are three persons, but one essence. But an Arian has no faith but this (close your ears, my hearers, that you may not be defiled by words so grossly impious), that the Father alone is very God, and that Jesus Christ our Saviour is a[fn-58-P5869_1713850:42-nf] creature, and[fn-58-P5870_1713986:43-nf] the Holy Ghost the Servant of both. How can he then receive the Holy Ghost from the Church, who has not yet obtained remission of sins? For the Holy Ghost must have a clean abode: nor will He become a dweller in that temple which has not for its chief priest the true faith. But if you now ask how it is that a person baptized in the Church does not receive the Holy Ghost, Whom we declare to be given in true baptism, except by the hands of the bishop, let me tell you that our authority for the rule is the fact that after our Lord's ascension the Holy Ghost descended upon the Apostles. And in many places we find it the practice, more by way of honouring the[fn-58-P5871_1714829:44-nf] episcopate than from any compulsory law. Otherwise, if the Holy Ghost descends only at the bishop's prayer, they are greatly to be pitied who in isolated houses, or in forts, or retired places, after being baptized by the presbyters and deacons have fallen asleep before the bishop's visitation. The well-being of a Church depends upon the dignity of its chief-priest, and unless some extraordinary and unique functions be assigned to him, we shall have as many schisms in the Churches as there are priests. Hence it is that without ordination and the bishop's license neither presbyter nor deacon has the power to baptize. And yet, if necessity so be, we know that even laymen may, and frequently do, baptize. For as a man receives, so too he can give; for it will hardly be said that we must believe that the eunuch whom Philip[fn-58-P5872_1715870:45-nf] baptized lacked the Holy Spirit. The Scripture thus speaks concerning him, \"And they both went down into the water; and Philip baptized him.\" And on leaving the water, \"The Holy Spirit fell upon the eunuch.\" You may perhaps think that we ought to set against this the passage in which we read, \"Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: who, when they were come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost: for as yet he was fallen upon none of them.\" But why this was, the context tells us,-\"Only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.\" And if you here say that you do the same, because the heretics have not baptized into the Holy Spirit, I must remind you that Philip was not separated from the Apostles, but belonged to the same Church and preached the same Lord Jesus Christ: that he was without question a deacon of those who afterwards laid their hands on his converts. But when you say that the Arians have not a Church, but a synagogue, and that their clergy do not worship God but creatures and idols, how can you maintain that you ought to act upon the same principle in cases so totally different?","title":"The Dialogue Against the Luciferians","author":false},{"chapter":8,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_07_the_dialogue_against_the_luciferians","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"23.

I think therefore that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is,\" Here our opponent goes utterly wild with exultation: this is his strongest battering-ram with which he shakes the wall of virginity. \"See,\" says he, \"the Apostle confesses that as regards virgins he has no commandment of the Lord, and he who had with authority laid down the law respecting husbands and wives, does not dare to command what the Lord has not enjoined. And rightly too. For what is enjoined is commanded, what is commanded must be done, and that which must be done implies punishment if it be not done. For it is useless to order a thing to be done and yet leave the individual free to do it or not do it. If the Lord had commanded virginity He would have seemed to condemn marriage, and to do away with the seed-plot of mankind, of which virginity itself is a growth. If He had cut off the root, how was He to expect fruit? If the foundations were not first laid, how was He to build the edifice, and put on the roof to cover all! Excavators toil hard to remove mountains; the bowels of the earth are pierced in the search for gold. And, when the tiny particles, first by the blast of the furnace, then by the hand of the cunning workman have been fashioned into an ornament, men do not call him blessed who has separated the gold from the dross, but him who wears the beautiful gold. Do not marvel then if, placed as we are, amid temptations of the flesh and incentives to vice, the angelic life be not exacted of us, but merely recommended. If advice be given, a man is free to proffer obedience; if there be a command, he is a servant bound to compliance. \"I have no commandment,\" he says, \"of the Lord: but I give my judgement, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.\" If you have no commandment of the Lord, how dare you give judgement without orders? The Apostle will reply: Do you wish me to give orders where the Lord has offered a favour rather than laid down a law? The great Creator and Fashioner, knowing the weakness of the vessel which he made, left virginity open to those whom He addressed; and shall I, the teacher of the Gentiles, who have become all things to all men that I might gain all, shall I lay upon the necks of weak believers from the very first the burden of perpetual chastity? Let them[fn-62-P6208_1883228:63-nf] begin with short periods of release from the marriage bond, and give themselves unto prayer, that when they have tasted the sweets of chastity they may desire the perpetual possession of that wherewith they were temporarily delighted. The Lord, when tempted by the Pharisees, and asked whether according to the law of Moses it was permitted to put away a wife, forbade the practice altogether. After weighing His words the disciples said to Him:[fn-62-P6209_1883732:64-nf] \"If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry. But He said unto them, all men cannot receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, which were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, which made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\" The reason is plain why the Apostle said, \"concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord.\" Surely; because the Lord had previously said \"All men cannot receive the word, but they to whom it is given,\" and \"He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\"[fn-62-P6210_1884446:65-nf] The Master of the Christian race offers the reward, invites candidates to the course, holds in His hand the prize of virginity, points to the fountain of purity, and cries aloud[fn-62-P6211_1884691:66-nf] \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.\" \"He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\" He does not say, you must drink, you must run, willing or unwilling: but whoever is willingand able to run and to drink, he shall conquer, he shall be satisfied. And therefore Christ loves virgins more than others, because they willingly give what was not commanded them. And it indicates greater grace to offer what you are not bound to give, than to render what is exacted of you. The apostles, contemplating the burden of a wife, exclaimed, \"If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.\" Our Lord thought well of their view. You rightly think, said He, that it is not expedient for a man who is hastening to the kingdom of heaven to take a wife: but it is a hard matter, and all men do not receive the saying, but they to whom it has been given. Some are eunuchs by nature, others by the violence of men. Those eunuchs please Me who are such not of necessity, but of free choice. Willingly do I take them into my bosom who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake, and in order to worship Me have renounced the condition of their birth. We must now explain the words, \"Those who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.\" If they who have made themselves eunuchs have the reward of the kingdom of heaven, it follows that they who have not made themselves such cannot be placed with those who have. He who is able, he says, to receive it, let him receive it. It is a mark of great faith and of great virtue, to be the pure temple of God, to offer oneself a whole burnt-offering, and, according to the same apostle, to be holy both in body and in spirit. These are the eunuchs, who thinking themselves dry trees because of their impotence, hear by the mouth of[fn-62-P6212_1886553:67-nf] Isaiah that they have a place prepared in heaven for sons and daughters. Their type is[fn-62-P6213_1886657:68-nf] Ebed-melech the eunuch in Jeremiah, and the eunuch of Queen Candace in the[fn-62-P6214_1886754:69-nf] Acts of the Apostles, who on account of the strength of his faith gained the name of a man. These are they to whom Clement, who was the successor of the Apostle Peter, and of whom the Apostle Paul makes mention, wrote letters, directing almost the whole of his discourse to the subject of virgin purity. After them there is a long series of apostolic men, martyrs, and men illustrious no less for holiness than for eloquence, with whom we may very easily become acquainted through their own writings.[fn-62-P6215_1887275:70-nf] \"I think, therefore,\" he says, \"that this is good for the present distress.\" What is this distress which, in contempt of the marriage tie, longs for the liberty of virginity?[fn-62-P6216_1887471:71-nf] \"Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days.\" We have not here a condemnation of harlots and brothels, of whose damnation there is no doubt, but of the swelling womb, and wailing infancy, the fruit as well as the work of marriage. \"For it is good for a man so to be.\" If it is good for a man so to be, it is bad for a man not so to be.[fn-62-P6217_1887864:72-nf] \"Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.\" Each one of us has his appointed bounds; let me have what is mine, and keep your own. If thou art bound to a wife, give her not a bill of divorce. If I am loosed from a wife, I will not seek a wife. As I do not dissolve marriages once contracted: so you should not bind what is loosed. And at the same time the meaning of the words must be taken into account. He who has a wife is regarded as a debtor, and is said to be uncircumcised, to be the servant of his wife, and like bad servants to be bound. But he who has no wife, in the first place owes no man anything, then is circumcised, thirdly is free, lastly, is loosed.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":8,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_14_homily_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Do you see what a great thing gentleness is? More than any vehemence, it pricks our hearts, inflicts a keener wound. For as in the case of bodies which have become callous the man that strikes upon them does not affect the sense so powerfully, but if he first mollify them and make them tender, then he pierces them effectually; so in this instance also, it is necessary first to mollify. But that which softens, is not wrath, not vehement accusation, not personal abuse; it is gentleness. The former indeed rather aggravate the callousness, this last alone removes it. If then you are desirous to reprove any delinquent, approach him with all possible mildness. For see here; he gently reminds them of the outrages they have committed, adding no comment; he declares the gift of God, he goes on to speak of the grace which bore testimony to the event, and so draws out his discourse to a still greater length. So they stood in awe of the gentleness of Peter, in that he, speaking to men who had crucified his Master, and breathed murder against himself and his companions, discoursed to them in the character of an affectionate father and teacher. Not merely were they persuaded; they even condemned themselves, they came to a sense of their past behavior. For he gave no room for their anger to be roused, and darken their judgment, but by means of humility he dispersed, as it were, the mist and darkness of their indignation, and then pointed out to them the daring outrage they had committed. For so it is; when we say of ourselves that we are injured, the opposite party endeavor to prove that they have not done the injury; but when we say, we have not been injured, but have rather done the wrong, the others take the contrary line. If, therefore, you wish to place your enemy (eij agwna) in the wrong, beware of accusing him; nay (agwnisai), plead for him, he will be sure to find himself guilty. There is a natural spirit of opposition in man. Such was the conduct of Peter. He did not accuse them harshly; on the contrary, he almost endeavored to plead for them, as far as was possible. And this was the very reason that he penetrated into their souls. You will ask, where is the proof that they were pricked? In their own words; for what say they? \"Men and brethren, what shall we do?\" Whom they had called deceivers, they call \"brethren:\" not that hereby they put themselves on an equality with them, but rather by way of attracting their brotherly affection and kindness: and besides,[fn-4-P445_281584:1-nf] because the Apostles had deigned to call them by this title. And, say they, \"What shall we do?\" They did not straightway say, Well then, we repent; but they surrendered themselves to the disciples. Just as a person on the point of shipwreck, upon seeing the pilot, or in sickness the physician, would put all into his hands, and do his bidding in everything; so have these also confessed that they are in extreme peril, and destitute of all hope of salvation. They did not say, How shall we be saved? but, \"What shall we do?\" Here again Peter, though the question is put to all, is the man to answer. \"Repent,\" says he, \"and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ.\" (v. 38.) He does not yet say, Believe, but, \"Be baptized every one of you.\" For[fn-4-P446_282697:2-nf] this they received in baptism. Then he speaks of the gain; \"For the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.\" If you are to receive a gift, if baptism conveys remission, why delay? He next gives a persuasive turn to his address, adding, \"For the promise is unto you\" (v. 39): for he had spoken of a promise above. \"And to your children,\" he says: the gift is greater, when these are to be heirs of the blessings. \"And to all,\" he continues, \"that are afar off:\" if to those that are afar off, much more to you that are near: \"even as many as the Lord our God shall call.\" Observe the time he takes for saying, \"To those that are afar off.\" It is when he finds them conciliated and self-accusing. For when the soul pronounces sentence against itself, no longer can it feel envy. \"And with many other words did he testify, and exhort, saying.\" (v. 40.) Observe how, throughout, the writer studies brevity, and how free he is from ambition and display. \"He testified and exhorted, saying.\" This is the perfection of teaching, comprising something of fear and something of love. \"Save yourselves from this untoward generation.\" He says nothing of the future, all is about the present, by which indeed men are chiefly swayed; he shows that the Gospel releases from present[fn-4-P447_284475:3-nf] evils as well. \"Then they that gladly received his word were baptized; and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.\" (v. 41.) Think you not this cheered the Apostles more than the miracle? \"And they continued steadfastly and with one accord in the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship.\"[fn-4-P448_285085:4-nf] (v. 42.) Here are two virtues, perseverance and concord. \"In the Apostles' doctrine,\" he says: for they again taught them; \"and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayer.\" All in common, all with perseverance. \"And fear came upon every soul\" (v. 43): of those that believed. For they did not despise the Apostles, like common men, nor did they fix their regard on that which was visible merely. Verily, their thoughts were kindled into a glow.[fn-4-P449_286172:5-nf] And as Peter had before spoken much, and declared the promises, and the things to come, well might they be beside themselves with fear. The wonders also bore witness to the words: \"Many wonders and signs were done by the Apostles.\" As was the case with Christ; first there were signs, then teaching, then wonders; so was it now. \"And all that believed were together, and had all things common.\" (v. 44.) Consider what an advance was here immediately! For the fellowship was not only in prayers, nor in doctrine alone, but also in (politeia) social relations. \"And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.\" See what fear was wrought in them! \"And they parted them,\" he says, showing the (to oionomikon) wise management: \"As every man had heed.\" Not recklessly, like some philosophers among the Greeks, of whom some gave up their land, others cast into the sea great quantities of money; but this was no contempt of riches, but only folly and madness. For universally the devil has made it his endeavor to disparage the creatures of God, as if it were impossible to make good use of riches. \"And continuing daily with one accord in the temple\" (v. 46), they enjoyed the benefit of teaching. Consider how these Jews did nothing else great or small, than assiduously attend at the temple. For, as having become more earnest, they had increased devotion also to the place. For the Apostles did not for the present pluck them away from this object, for fear of injuring them. \"And breaking bread from house to house, did take their portion of food with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favor with all the people.\" (v. 47.) It seems to me that in mentioning \"bread,\" he here signifies fasting and hard life; for they \"took their portion of food,\" not of dainty fare. \"With gladness,\" he says. Seest thou that not the dainty fare, but the (trofhj on trufhj) food made the enjoyment. For they that fare daintily are under punishment and pain; but not so these. Do you see that the words of Peter contain this also, namely, the regulation of life? [\"And singleness of heart.\"] For no gladness can exist where there is no simplicity. How had they \"favor with all the people?\" On account of their alms deeds. For do not look to the fact, that the chief priests for envy and spite rose up against them, but rather consider that \"they had favor with the people.\"-\" And the Lord added to the Church daily (epi to auto) [together] such as should be saved.-And[fn-4-P450_288811:6-nf] all that believed were together.\" Once more, the unanimity, the charity, which is the cause of all good things![fn-4-P451_289549:7-nf] ","title":"Homily VII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":8,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_11_lecture_vi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"14.

I may be permitted to use the actual words and terms with which magic rings again, that inventor of all these odd opinions-with its Ostanes, and Typhon, and Dardanus, and Damigeron, and Nectabis, and Berenice. There is a well-known popular bit of writing,[fn-30-P3067_1109741:328-nf] which undertakes to summon up from the abode of Hades the souls which have actually slept out their full age, and had passed away by an honourable death, and had even been buried with full rites and proper ceremony. What after this shall we say about magic? Say, to be sure, what almost everybody says of it-that it is an imposture. But it is not we Christians only whose notice this system of imposture does not escape. We, it is true, have discovered these spirits of evil, not, to be sure, by a complicity with them, but by a certain knowledge which is hostile to them; nor is it by any procedure which is attractive to them, but by a power which subjugates them that we handle (their wretched system)-that manifold pest of the mind of man, that artificer of all error, that destroyer of our salvation and our soul at one swoop.[fn-30-P3068_1110593:329-nf] In this way, even by magic, which is indeed only a second idolatry, wherein they pretend that after death they become demons, just as they were supposed in the first and literal idolatry to become gods (and why not? since the gods are but dead things), the before-mentioned Aori Biaeothanati are actually invoked,-and not unfairly,[fn-30-P3069_1111060:330-nf] if one grounds his faith on this principle, that it is clearly credible for those souls to be beyond all others addicted to violence and wrong, which with violence and wrong have been hurried away by a cruel and premature death and which would have a keen appetite for reprisals. Under cover, however, of these souls, demons operate, especially such as used to dwell in them when they were in life, and who had driven them, in fact, to the fate which had at last carried them off. For, as we have already suggested,[fn-30-P3070_1111590:331-nf] there is hardly a human being who is unattended by a demon; and it is well known to many, that premature and violent deaths, which men ascribe to accidents, are in fact brought about by demons. This imposture of the evil spirit lying concealed in the persons of the dead, we are able, if I mistake not, to prove by actual facts, when in cases of exorcism (the evil spirit) affirms himself sometimes to be one of the relatives[fn-30-P3071_1112052:332-nf] of the person possessed by him, sometimes a gladiator or a bestiarius,[fn-30-P3072_1112153:333-nf] and sometimes even a god; always making it one of his chief cares to extinguish the very truth which we are proclaiming, that men may not readily believe that all souls remove to Hades, and that they may overthrow faith in the resurrection and the judgment. And yet for all that, the demon, after trying to circumvent the bystanders, is vanquished by the pressure of divine grace, and sorely against his will confesses all the truth. So also in that other kind of magic, which is supposed to bring up from Hades the souls now resting there, and to exhibit them to public view, there is no other expedient of imposture ever resorted to which operates more powerfully. Of course, why a phantom becomes visible, is because a body is also attached to it; and it is no difficult matter to delude the external vision of a man whose mental eye it is so easy to blind. The serpents which emerged from the magicians' rods, certainly appeared to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians as bodily substances. It is true that the verity of Moses swallowed up their lying deceit.[fn-30-P3073_1113321:334-nf] Many attempts were also wrought against the apostles by the sorcerers Simon and Elymas,[fn-30-P3074_1113429:335-nf] but the blindness which struck (them) was no enchanter's trick. What novelty is there in the effort of an unclean spirit to counterfeit the truth? At this very time, even, the heretical dupes of this same Simon (Magus) are so much elated by the extravagant pretensions of their art, that they undertake to bring up from Hades the souls of the prophets themselves. And I suppose that they can do so under cover of a lying wonder. For, indeed, it was no less than this that was anciently permitted to the Pythonic (or ventriloquistic) spirit[fn-30-P3075_1114000:336-nf] -even to represent the soul of Samuel, when Saul consulted the dead, after (losing the living) God.[fn-30-P3076_1114147:337-nf] God forbid, however, that we should suppose that the soul of any saint, much less of a prophet, can be dragged out of (its resting-place in Hades) by a demon. We know that \"Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light\"[fn-30-P3077_1114401:338-nf] -much more into a man of light-and that at last he will \"show himself to be even God,\"[fn-30-P3078_1114510:339-nf] and will exhibit \"great signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible, he shall deceive the very elect.\"[fn-30-P3079_1114646:340-nf] He hardly[fn-30-P3080_1114679:341-nf] hesitated on the before-mentioned occasion to affirm himself to be a prophet of God, and especially to Saul, in whom he was then actually dwelling. You must not imagine that he who produced the phantom was one, and he who consulted it was another; but that it was one and the same spirit, both in the sorceress and in the apostate (king), which easily pretended an apparition of that which it had already prepared them to believe as real-(even the spirit) through whose evil influence Saul's heart was fixed where his treasure was, and where certainly God was not. Therefore it came about, that he saw him through whose aid he believed that he was going to see, because he believed him through whose help he saw. But we are met with the objection, that in visions of the night dead persons are not unfrequently seen, and that for a set purpose.[fn-30-P3081_1115539:342-nf] For instance, the Nasamones consult private oracles by frequent and lengthened visits to the sepulchres of their relatives, as one may find in Heraclides, or Nymphodorus, or Herodotus;[fn-30-P3082_1115744:343-nf] and the Celts, for the game purpose, stay away all night at the tombs of their brave chieftains, as Nicander affirms. Well, we admit apparitions of dead persons in dreams to be not more really true than those of living persons; but we apply the same estimate to all alike-to the dead and to the living, and indeed to all the phenomena which are seen. Now things are not true because they appear to be so, but because they are fully proved to be so. The truth of dreams is declared from the realization, not the aspect. Moreover, the fact that Hades is not in any case opened for (the escape of) any soul, has been firmly established by the Lord in the person of Abraham, in His representation of the poor man at rest and the rich man in torment.[fn-30-P3083_1116509:344-nf] No one, (he said, ) could possibly be despatched from those abodes to report to us how matters went in the nether regions,-a purpose which, (if any could be, ) might have been allowable on such an occasion, to persuade a belief in Moses and the prophets. The power of God has, no doubt, sometimes recalled men's souls to their bodies, as a proof of His own transcendent rights; but there must never be, because of this fact, any agreement supposed to be possible between the divine faith and the arrogant pretensions of sorcerers, and the imposture of dreams, and the licence of poets. But yet in all cases of a true resurrection, when the power of God recalls souls to their bodies, either by the agency of prophets, or of Christ, or of apostles, a complete presumption is afforded us, by the solid, palpable, and ascertained reality (of the revived body), that its true form must be such as to compel one's belief of the fraudulence of every incorporeal apparition of dead persons.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_23_ix_de_fuga_in_persecutione_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"ANF-04","text":"12. So far, my brother, as the question proposed by you is concerned, you have our opinion in answer and encouragement. But he who inquires whether persecution ought to be shunned by us must now be prepared to consider the following question also: Whether, if we should not flee from it, we should at least buy ourselves off from it. Going further than you expected, therefore, I will also on this point give you my advice, distinctly affirming that persecution, from which it is evident we must not flee, must in like manner not even be bought off. The difference lies in the payment; but as flight is a buying off without money, so buying off is money-flight. Assuredly you have here too the counselling of fear. Because you fear, you buy yourself off; and so you flee. As regards your feet, you have stood; in respect of the money you have paid, you have run away. Why, in this very standing of yours there was a fleeing from persecution, in the release from persecution which you bought; but that you should ransom with money a man whom Christ has ransomed with His blood, how unworthy is it of God and His ways of acting, who spared not His own Son for you, that He might be made a curse for us, because cursed is he that hangeth on a tree,[fn-19-P1990_603475:47-nf] -Him who was led as a sheep to be a sacrifice, and just as a lamb before its shearer, so opened He not His mouth;[fn-19-P1991_603623:48-nf] but gave His back to the scourges, nay, His cheeks to the hands of the smiter, and turned not away His face from spitting, and, being numbered with the transgressors, was delivered up to death, nay, the death of the cross. All this took place that He might redeem us from our sins. The sun ceded to us the day of our redemption; hell re-transferred the right it had in us, and our covenant is in heaven; the everlasting gates were lifted up, that the King of Glory, the Lord of might, might enter in,[fn-19-P1992_604143:49-nf] after having redeemed man from earth, nay, from hell, that he might attain to heaven. What, now, are we to think of the man who strives against that glorious One, nay, slights and defiles His goods, obtained at so great a ransom-no less, in truth, than His most precious blood? It appears, then, that it is better to flee than to fall in value, if a man will not lay out for himself as much as he cost Christ. And the Lord indeed ransomed him from the angelic powers which rule the world-from the spirits of wickedness, from the darkness of this life, from eternal judgment, from everlasting death. But you bargain for him with an informer, or a soldier or some paltry thief of a ruler-under, as they say, the folds of the tunic-as if he were stolen goods whom Christ purchased in the face of the whole world, yes, and set at liberty. Will you value, then, this free man at any price, and possess him at any price, but the one, as we have said, it cost the Lord,-namely, His own blood? (And if not,) why then do you purchase Christ in the man in whom He dwells, as though He were some human property? No otherwise did Simon even try to do, when he offered the apostles money for the Spirit of Christ. Therefore this man also, who in buying himself has bought the Spirit of Christ, will hear that word, \"Your money perish with you, since you have thought that the grace of God is to be had at a price!\"[fn-19-P1993_605563:50-nf] Yet who will despise him for being (what he is), a denier? For what says that extorter? Give me money: assuredly that he may not deliver him up, since he tries to sell you nothing else than that which he is going to give you for money. When you put that into his hands, it is certainly your wish not to be delivered up. But not delivered up, had you to be held up to public ridicule? While, then, in being unwilling to be delivered up, you are not willing to be thus exposed; by this unwillingness of yours you have denied that you are what you have been unwilling to have it made public that you are. Nay, you say, While I am unwilling to be held up to the public as being what I am, I have acknowledged that I am what I am unwilling to be so held up as being, that is, a Christian. Can Christ, therefore, claim that you, as a witness for Him, have stedfastly shown Him forth? He who buys himself off does nothing in that way. Before one it might, I doubt not, be said, You have confessed Him; so also, on the account of your unwillingness to confess Him before many you have denied Him. A man's very safety will pronounce that he has fallen while getting out of persecution's way. He has fallen, therefore, whose desire has been to escape. The refusal of martyrdom is denial. A Christian is preserved by his wealth, and for this end has his treasures, that he may not suffer, while he will be rich toward God. But it is the case that Christ was rich in blood for him. Blessed therefore are the poor, because, He says, the kingdom of heaven is theirs who have the soul only treasured up.[fn-19-P1994_607173:51-nf] If we cannot serve God and mammon, can we be redeemed both by God and by mammon? For who will serve mammon more than the man whom mammon has ransomed? Finally, of what example do you avail yourself to warrant your averting by money the giving of you up? When did the apostles, dealing with the matter, in any time of persecution trouble, extricate themselves by money? And money they certainly had from the prices of lands which were laid down at their feet,[fn-19-P1995_607649:52-nf] there being, without a doubt, many of the rich among those who believed-men, and also women, who were wont, too, to minister to their comfort. When did Onesimus, or Aquila, or Stephen,[fn-19-P1996_607856:53-nf] give them aid of this kind when they were persecuted? Paul indeed, when Felix the governor hoped that he should receive money for him from the disciples,[fn-19-P1997_608052:54-nf] about which matter he also dealt with the apostle in private, certainly neither paid it himself, nor did the disciples for him. Those disciples, at any rate. who wept because he was equally persistent in his determination to go to Jerusalem, and neglectful of all means to secure himself from the persecutions which had been foretold as about to occur there, at last say, \"Let the will of the Lord be done.\" What was that will? No doubt that he should suffer for the name of the Lord, not that he should be bought off. For as Christ laid down His life for us, so, too, we should do for Him; and not only for the Lord Himself, nay, but likewise for our brethren on His account. This, too, is the teaching of John when he declares, not that we should pay for our brethren, but rather that we should die for them. It makes no difference whether the thing not to be done by you is to buy off a Christian, or to buy one. And so the will of God accords with this. Look at the condition-certainly of God's ordaining, in whose hand the king's heart is-of kingdoms and empires. For increasing the treasury there are daily provided so many appliances-registerings of property, taxes in kind benevolences, taxes in money; but never up to this time has ought of the kind been provided by bringing Christians under some purchase-money for the person and the sect, although enormous gains could be reaped from numbers too great for any to be ignorant of them. Bought with blood, paid for with blood, we owe no money for our head, because Christ is our Head. It is not fit that Christ should cost us money. How could martyrdoms, too, take place to the glory of the Lord, if by tribute we should pay for the liberty of our sect? And so he who stipulates to have it at a price, opposes the divine appointment. Since, therefore, Caesar has imposed nothing on us after this fashion of a tributary sect-in fact, such an imposition never can be made,-with Antichrist now close at hand, and gaping for the blood, not for the money of Christians-how can it be pointed out to me that there is the command, \"Render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's? \"[fn-19-P1998_610207:55-nf] A soldier, be he an informer or an enemy, extorts money from me by threats, exacting nothing on Caesar's behalf; nay, doing the very opposite, when for a bribe he lets me go-Christian as I am, and by the laws of man a criminal. Of another sort is the denarius which I owe to Caesar, a thing belonging to him, about which the question then was started, it being a tribute coin due indeed by those subject to tribute, not by children. Or how shall I render to God the things which are God's,-certainly, therefore, His own likeness and money inscribed with His name, that is, a Christian man? But what do I owe God, as I do Caesar the denarius, but the blood which His own Son shed for me? Now if I owe God, indeed, a human being and my own blood; but I am now in this juncture, that a demand is made upon me for the payment of that debt, I am undoubtedly guilty of cheating God if I do my best to withhold payment. I have well kept the commandment, if, rendering to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, I refuse to God the things which are God's!","title":"IX.

There is no gift of God more excellent than this. It alone distinguishes the sons of the eternal kingdom and the sons of eternal perdition. Other gifts, too, are given by the Holy Spirit; but without love they profit nothing. Unless, therefore, the Holy Spirit is so far imparted to each, as to make him one who loves God and his neighbor, he is not removed from the left hand to the right. Nor is the Spirit specially called the Gift, unless on account of love. And he who has not this love, \"though he speak with the tongues of men and angels, is sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal; and though he have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and though he have all faith, so that he can remove mountains, he is nothing; and though he bestow all his goods to feed the poor, and though he give his body to be burned, it profiteth him nothing.\"[fn-20-P2047_1038464:77-nf] How great a good, then, is that without which goods so great bring no one to eternal life! But love or charity itself,-for they are two names for one thing,-if he have it that does not speak with tongues, nor has the gift of prophecy, nor knows all mysteries and all knowledge, nor gives all his goods to the poor, either because he has none to give or because some necessity hinders, nor delivers his body to be burned, if no trial of such a suffering overtakes him, brings that man to the kingdom, so that faith itself is only rendered profitable by love, since faith without love can indeed exist, but cannot profit.

And therefore most rightly is the Holy Spirit, although He is God, called also the gift of God.[fn-20-P2050_1039649:80-nf] And by that gift what else can properly be understood except love, which brings to God, and without which any other gift of God whatsoever does not bring to God?","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"88","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"35.

And the same Peter said to him, \"Thy money perish with thee: because thou hast thought to purchase for money the gift of God.\"[fn-20-P2070_1047042:95-nf] And in another place of the same book, when Peter was speaking to Cornelius, and to those who were with him, and was announcing and preaching Christ, the Scripture says, \"While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all them that heard the word; and they of the circumcision that believed, asmany as came with Peter, were astonished, because that upon the Gentiles also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.

But the reason why, after His resurrection, He both gave the Holy Spirit, first on earth,[fn-21-P2121_1072991:118-nf] and afterwards sent Him from heaven,[fn-21-P2122_1073048:119-nf] is in my judgment this: that \"love is shed abroad in our hearts,\"[fn-21-P2123_1073134:120-nf] by that Gift itself,whereby we love God and our neighbors, according to those two commandments,\"onwhich hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-21-P2124_1073292:121-nf] And Jesus Christ, in order to signify this,gave to them the Holy Spirit, once upon earth, on account of the love of our neighbor, and a second time from heaven, on account of the love of God. And if some other reason may perhaps be given for this double gift of the Holy Spirit, at any rate we ought not to doubt that the same Holy Spirit was given when Jesus breathed upon them, of whom He by and by says, \"Go, baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,\" where this Trinity is especially commended to us. It is therefore He who was also given from heaven on the day of Pentecost, i.e. ten days after the Lord ascended into heaven. How, therefore, is He not God, who gives the Holy Spirit? Nay, how great a God is He who gives God! For no one of His disciples gave the HolySpirit, since they prayed that He might come upon those upon whom they laid their hands: they did not give Him themselves. And the Church preserves this custom even now in the case of her rulers. Lastly, Simon Magus also, when he offered the apostles money, does not say, \"Give me also this power, that I may give\" the Holy Spirit; but, \"that on whomsoever I may lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.\" Because neither had the Scriptures said before, And Simon, seeing that the apostles gave the Holy Spirit; but it had said,\" And Simon, seeing that the Holy Spirit was given by the laying on of the apostles' hands.\"[fn-21-P2125_1074760:122-nf] Therefore also the Lord Jesus Christ Himself not only gave the Holy Spirit as God, but also received it as man, and therefore He is said to be full of grace,[fn-21-P2126_1074944:123-nf] and of the Holy Spirit.[fn-21-P2127_1074987:124-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles it is more plainly written of Him, \"Because God anointed Him With the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-21-P2128_1075133:125-nf] Certainly not with visible oil but with the gift of grace which is signified by the visible ointment wherewith the Church anoints the baptized. And Christ was certainly not then anointed with the Holy Spirit, when He, as a dove, descended upon Him at His baptism.[fn-21-P2129_1075416:126-nf] For at that time He deigned to prefigure His body, i.e. His Church, in which especially the baptized receive the Holy Spirit. But He is to be understood to have been then anointed with that mystical and invisible unction, when the Word of God was made flesh,[fn-21-P2130_1075697:127-nf] i.e. when human nature, without any precedent merits of good works, was joined to God the Word in the womb of the Virgin, so that with it it became one person. Therefore it is that we confess Him to have been born of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary. For it is most absurd to believe Him to have received the Holy Spirit when He was near thirty years old: for at that age He was baptized by John;[fn-21-P2131_1076118:128-nf] but that He came to baptism as without any sin at all, so not without the Holy Spirit. For if it was written of His servant and forerunner John himself, \"He shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb,\"[fn-21-P2132_1076367:129-nf] because, although generated by his father, yet he received the Holy Spirit when formed in the womb; what must be understood and believed of the man Christ, of whose flesh the very conception was not carnal, but spiritual? Both natures, too, as well the human as the divine, are shown in that also that is written of Him, that He received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, and shed forth the Holy Spirit:[fn-21-P2133_1076802:130-nf] seeing that He received as man, and shed forth as God.

Well, then, through the preaching of Philip the Samaritans believed; Samaria began to abound in believers. This Simon Magus was there. By his magical arts he had so befooled the people, that they fancied him to be the power of God. Impressed, however, by the signs which were done by Philip, he also believed; but in what manner he believed, the events that followed afterwards proved. And Simon also was baptized. The apostles, who were at Jerusalem, heard this. Peter and John were sent to those in Samaria; they found many baptized; and as none of them had as yet received the Holy Ghosts-in like manner as He at that time descended, so as that they on whom the Holy Spirit came should speak with tongues, for a manifest token that the nations would believe,-they laid their hands on them, praying for them, and they received the Holy Ghost. This Simon-who was not a dove but a raven in the Church, because he sought his own things, not the things which are Jesus Christ's; whence he loved the power which was in the Christians more than the righteousness-Simon, I say, saw that the Holy Spirit was given by the laying on of the hands of the apostles (not that it was given by them, but given in answer to their prayers), and he said to them, \"How much money will ye that I give you, so that by the laying on of my hands also, the Holy Ghost may be given? And Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou thoughtest that the gift of God was to be bought with money.\" To whom said he, \"Thy money perish with thee \"? Undoubtedly to one that was baptized. Baptism he had already; but he did not cleave to the bowels of the dove.

What did baptism profit him? Do not therefore boast of thy baptism, as if that were of itself enough for thy salvation. Be not angry, put away thy gall, come to the dove.

In the case of soul and body, which are of natures contemporary and naturally united, we are accustomed to make this distinction, describing the soul as simple, reasonable, and immortal, but the body as complex, passible, and mortal. We do not divide the union, nor cut one man in two. Far rather, then, in the case of the Godhead, begotten of the Father before the ages, and of the manhood assumed of David's seed, is it becoming to adopt a similar course, and distinctly to recognise the everlasting, eternal, simple, uncircumscribed, immortal, and invariable character of the one nature, and the recent, complex, circumscribed, and fluctuating nature of the other. We acknowledge the flesh to be now immortal and incorruptible, although before the resurrection it was susceptible of death and of passion; for how otherwise was it nailed to the tree, and committed to the tomb? And though we recognise the distinction of the natures, we are bound to worship one Son, and to acknowledge the same as Son of God and Son of man, form of God, and form of a servant, Son of David, and Lord of David, seed of Abraham, and creator of Abraham. The union causes the names to be common, but the community of names does not confound the natures. With them that are right-minded some names are plainly appropriate as to God, and others as to man; and in this way both the passible and the impassible are properly used of the Lord Christ, for in His humanity He suffered, while as God He remained impassible. If, according to the argument of the impious, it was in the Godhead that He suffered, then, I apprehend, the assumption of the flesh, was supererogatory; for suppose the divine nature to have been capable of undergoing passion, then He did not need the passible manhood. But grant that, as even their own argument contends, the Godhead was impassible, and the passion was real, let them beware of denying that which suffered, lest they deny with it the reality of the passion; for if that which suffers does not exist, then the passion is unreal. Now for any one who likes to open the quaternion[fn-61-P6162_1552027:335-nf] of the sacred evangelists, it is easy to perceive that the divine Scripture distinctly proclaims the passion of the body, and to learn from them how Joseph of Arimathaea came to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus; how Pilate ordered the body of Jesus to be delivered, how Joseph took down the body of Jesus from the tree and wrapped the body of Jesus in the linen cloth, and laid it in the new tomb. All this is described by the four evangelists with frequent mention of the body. But if our opponents adduce the words of the angel to Mary and her companions, \"Come where the Lord lay,\"[fn-61-P6163_1553067:336-nf] let them be referred to the passage in the Acts which states that devout men \"carried Stephen to his burial\"[fn-61-P6164_1553200:337-nf] and observe that it was not the soul, but the body, of the victorious Stephen, to which the customary rites were paid. And to this very day, when we approach the shrines of the victorious martyrs, we commonly enquire what is the name of him who is buried in the grave, and those who are acquainted with the facts reply peradventure\"Julian the martyr,\" or \"Romanus,\" or, \"Timotheus.\"[fn-61-P6165_1553604:338-nf] ","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":8,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"413","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"This is the unanimous teaching of the evangelists.

Similarly the blessed Jacob said to his sons \"Bury me with my fathers.\"[fn-62-P6280_1599046:392-nf] He did not say \"Bury my body.\" Then he went on \"There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.\"[fn-62-P6281_1599234:393-nf] He did not say \"their bodies.\" The names are common to bodies or souls, but nevertheless it is only the bodies which he called by the common names.

Of course (his \"near\" friends), those in whom he had ever full confidence; fearing, with such an interest at stake, to entrust the matter to others. In my opinion, it was by Cornelius himself that both friends and kinsmen had been brought to a better mind. \"And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.\" (v. 25.) This, both to teach the others, and by way of giving thanks to God, and showing his own humility: thereby making it plain, that though he had been commanded, yet in himself he had great piety. What then did Peter? \"But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.\" (v. 26.) Do you mark how, before all else (the Apostles) teach them this lesson, not to think great things of them? \"And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.\" (v. 27, 28.) Observe, he straightway speaks of the mercy of God, and points out to them that it is a great grace that God has shown them. Observe also how while he utters great things, at the same time he speaks modestly. For he does not say, We, being men who do not deign to keep company with any (such), have come to you: but what says he? \"Ye know\" -God commanded this[fn-9-P991_908319:1-nf] -\" that it is against law to keep company with, or come unto, one of another nation.\" Then he goes on to say, \"And to me God has shown \"-this he says, that none may account the thanks due to him -\"that I should call no man\"-that it may not look like obsequiousness to him, \"no human being,\" says he-\"common or unclean.\"[fn-9-P992_909073:2-nf] (v. 29.) \"Wherefore also\"-that they may not think the affair a breach of the law on his part, nor (Cornelius) suppose that because he was in a station of command therfore he had complied, but that they may ascribe all to God,-\" wherefore also I came without gainsaying as soon as I was sent for:\" (though) not only to keep company, but even to come unto (him) was not permitted. \"I ask therefore, for what intent ye have sent for me.\" Already Peter had heard the whole matter from the soldiers also, but he wishes them first to confess, and to make them amenable to the Faith. What then does Cornelius? He does not say, Why, did not the soldiers tell thee? but observe again, how humbly he speaks. For he says, \"From the fourth day I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. And at the ninth hour,\" he says, \"I was praying.\" (v. 30, 31.) It seems to me, that this man had also fixed for himself set times of a life under stricter rule, and on certain days).[fn-9-P993_911906:3-nf] For this is why he hesays, \"From the fourth day.\"[fn-9-P994_916296:4-nf] See how great a thing prayer is! When he advanced in piety, then the Angel appears to him. \"From the fourth day:\" i.e. of the week; not \"four days ago.\" For, \"on the morrow Peter went away with them, and on the morrow after they entered into Caesarea:\" this is one day: and the day on which the persons sent came (to Joppa) one day: and on the third (the Angel) appeared: so that there are two days after that on which (Cornelius) had been praying. \"And, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing:\" he does not say, an Angel, so unassuming is he: \"and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter: he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the seaside: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee. Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.\" (v. 31-33.) (b) See[fn-9-P995_917808:5-nf] what faith, what piety! He knew that it was no word of man that Peter spake, when he said, \"God hath shown me.\" Then says the man, \"We are present to hear all things that are commanded thee of the Lord. (a) Therefore it was that Peter asked, \"For what intent have ye sent for me?\" on purpose that he might so speak these very words. (d) \"Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons: but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him.\" (v. 34, 35.) That is, be he uncircumcised or circumcised. (c) This also Paul declaring, saith, \"For there is no respect of persons with God.\"[fn-9-P996_920110:6-nf] (Rom. ii. 11.) (e) What then? (it may be asked) is the man yonder in Persia acceptable to Him? If he be worthy, in this regard he is acceptable, that it should be granted him to be brought unto faith (tw kataciwqhnai thj pistewj). The Eunuch from Ethiopia He overlooked not. \"What shall one say then of the religious men who have been overlooked?\" It is not the case, that any (such) ever was overlooked. But what he says is to this effect, that God rejects no man.[fn-9-P997_921057:7-nf] \"In every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousness:\" (by righteousness) he means, all virtue. Mark, how he subdues all elation of mind in him. That (the Jews) may not seem to be in the condition of persons cast off (he adds), \"The word which He sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: He is Lord of all (v. 36): this he says also for the sake of those present (of the Jews), that He may persuade them also: this is why he forces Cornelius to speak. \"He,\" saith he, \"is Lord of all.\" But observe at the very outset, \"The word,\" says he, \"which He sent unto the children of Israel;\" he gives them the preëminence. Then he adduces (these Gentiles) themselves as witnesses: \"ye know,\" says he, \"the matter which came to pass throughout all Judea, beginning at Galilee-then he confirms it from this also-\" after the baptism which John preached (v. 37)-(\"even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost and with power.\" (v. 38.) He does not mean, Ye know Jesus, for they did not know Him, but he speaks of the things done by Him:[fn-9-P998_922827:8-nf] \"Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: by this[fn-9-P999_923502:9-nf] he shows that many cases of lost senses or paralyzed limbs are the devil's work, and a wrench given to the body by him: as also Christ said. \"For God was with Him.\" Again, lowly terms. \"And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem\" (v. 39): both \"we,\" saith he, and ye. Then the Passion, and the reason why they do not believe: \"Whom also they slew, and hanged on a tree. Him God raised up the third day, and showed Him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with Him after He rose from the dead. (v. 40, 41.) This is a proof of the Resurrection. \"And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is He which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.\" (v. 42.) This is great. Then he adduces the testimony from the Prophets: \"To Him give all the prophets witness, that through His name, whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of sins. (v. 43.) This is a proof of that which was about to be: this is the reason why he here cites the Prophets.","title":"Homily XXIII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":8,"verse":36,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"389","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In the Acts of the Apostles: \"Lo, here is water; what is there which hinders me from being baptized?

But those who have not the virtues of temperance must not be allowed to judge of the conduct of holy men, any more than those in fever of the sweetness and wholesomeness of food. Nourishment must be provided not by the dictates of the sickly taste, but rather by the judgment and direction of health, so as to cure the sickness. If our critics, then, wish to attain not a spurious and affected, but a genuine and sound moral health, let them find a cure in believing the Scripture record, that the honorable name of saint is given not without reason to men who had several wives; and that the reason is this, that the mind can exercise such control over the flesh as not to allow the appetite implanted in our nature by Providence to go beyond the limits of deliberate intention. By a similar misunderstanding, this criticism, which consists rather in dishonest slander than in honest judgment, might accuse the holy apostles too of preaching the gospel to so many people, not from the desire of begetting children to eternal life, but from the love of human praise. There was no lack of renown to these our fathers in the gospel, for their praise was spread in numerous tongues through the churches of Christ. In fact, no greater honor and glory could have been paid by men to their fellow-creatures. It was the sinful desire for this glory in the Church which led the reprobate Simon in his blindness to wish to purchase for money what was freely bestowed on the apostles by divine grace.[fn-21-P2143_1279681:77-nf] There must have been this desire of glory in the man whom the Lord in the Gospel checks in his desire to follow Him, saying, \"The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay His Head.\"[fn-21-P2144_1279941:78-nf] The Lord saw that his mind was darkened by false appearances and elated by sudden emotion, and that there was no ground of faith to afford a lodging to the Teacher of humility; for in Christ's discipleship the man sought not Christ's grace, but his own glory. By this love of glory those were led away whom the Apostle Paul characterizes as preaching Christ not sincerely, but of contention and envy; and yet the apostle rejoices in their preaching, knowing that it might happen that, while the preachers gratified their desire for human praise, believers might be born among their hearers,-not as the result of the envious feeling which made them wish to rival or surpass the fame of the apostles, but by means of the gospel which they preached, though not sincerely; so that God might bring good out of their evil. So a man may be induced to marry by sensual desire, and not to beget children; and yet a child may be born, a good work of God, due to the natural power, not to the misconduct of the parent. As, therefore, the holy apostles were gratified when their doctrine met with acceptance from their hearers, not because they were greedy for praise, but because they desired to spread the truth; so the holy patriarchs in their conjugal intercourse were actuated not by the love of pleasure, but by the intelligent desire for the continuance of their family. Thus the number of their hearers did not make the apostles ambitious; nor did the number of their wives make the patriarchs licentious. But why defend the husbands, to whose character the divine word bears the highest testimony, when it appears that the wives themselves looked upon their connection with their husbands only as a means of getting sons?

This we have already done in the case of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom God said that He was their God, as if the God of universal nature were the God of none besides them; not honoring them with an unmeaning title, but because He, who could alone have a full and perfect knowledge, knew the sincere and remarkable charity of these men; and because these three patriarchs united formed a notable type of the future people of God, in not only having free children by free women, as by Sarah, and Rebecca, and Leah, and Rachel, but also bond children, as of this same Rebecca was born Esau, to whom it was said, \"Thou shalt serve thy brother;\"[fn-22-P2248_1357079:148-nf] and in having by bond women not only bond children, as by Hagar, but also free children, as by Bilhah and Zilphah.

Thus the nature of the waters, sanctified by the Holy One, itself conceived withal the power of sanctifying. Let no one say, \"Why then, are we, pray, baptized with the very waters which then existed in the first beginning? \"Not with those waters, of course, except in so far as the genus indeed is one, but the species very many.

Albeit the similitude may be admitted to be suitable to the simple act; that, since we are defiled by sins, as it were by dirt, we should be washed from those stains in waters. But as sins do not show themselves in our flesh (inasmuch as no one carries on his skin the spot of idolatry, or fornication, or fraud), so persons of that kind are foul in the spirit, which is the author of the sin; for the spirit is lord, the flesh servant. Yet they each mutually share the guilt: the spirit, on the ground of command; the flesh, of subservience.

Just as though their party gained the power of generation in virtue of what constitutes its division, and not from what causes its union with the Church. For it is severed from the bond of peace and charity, but it is joined in one baptism. And so there is one Church which alone is called Catholic; and whenever it has anything of its own in these communions of different bodies which are separate from itself, it is most certainly in virtue of this which is its own in each of them that it, not they, has the power of generation. For neither is it their separation that generates, but what they have retained of the essence of the Church; and if they were to go on to abandon this, they would lose the power of generation. The generation, then, in each case proceeds from the Church, whose sacraments are retained, from which any such birth can alone in any case proceed,-although not all who receive its birth belong to its unity, which shall save those who persevere even to the end. Nor is it those only that do not belong to it who are openly guilty of the manifest sacrilege of schism, but also those who, being outwardly joined to its unity, are yet separated by a life of sin. For the Church had herself given birth to Simon Magus through the sacrament of baptism; and yet it was declared to him that he had no part in the inheritance of Christ.[fn-30-P3090_1811574:28-nf] Did he lack anything in respect of baptism, of the gospel, of the sacraments?

Was anything wanting to their birth to whom the apostle says, \"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat, even as babes in Christ\"? Yet he recalls them from the sacrilege of schism, into which they were rushing, because they were carnal: \"I have fed you,\" he says, \"with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?\"[fn-30-P3091_1812362:29-nf] For of these he says above: \"Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment. For it hath been declared unto, me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chlöe, that there are contentions among you. Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.

For the Holy Spirit is not only given by the laying on of hands amid the testimony of temporal sensible miracles, as He was given in former days to be the credentials of a rudimentary faith, and for the extension of the first beginnings of the Church. For who expects in these days that those on whom hands are laid that they may receive the Holy Spirit should forthwith begin to speak with tongues? but it is understood that invisibly and imperceptibly, on account of the bond of peace, divine love is breathed into their hearts, so that they may be able to say, \"Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\" But there are many operations of the Holy Spirit, which the same apostle commemorates in a certain passage at such length as he thinks sufficient, and then concludes: \"But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.\"[fn-33-P3361_1931216:38-nf] Since, then, the sacrament is one thing, which even Simon Magus could have;[fn-33-P3362_1931313:39-nf] and the operation of the Spirit is another thing, which is even often found in wicked men, as Saul had the gift of prophecy;[fn-33-P3363_1931458:40-nf] and that operation of the same Spirit is a third thing, which only the good can have, as \"the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:\"[fn-33-P3364_1931680:41-nf] whatever, therefore, may be received by heretics and schismatics, the charity which covereth the multitude of sins is the especial gift of Catholic unity and peace; nor is it found in all that are within that bond, since not all that are within it are of it, as we shall see in the proper place. At any rate, outside the bond that love cannot exist, without which all the other requisites, even if they can be recognized and approved, cannot profit or release from sin.

With regard to the objection brought against Cyprian, that the catechumens who were seized in martyrdom, and slain for Christ's name's sake, received a crown even without baptism, I do not quite see what it has to do with the matter, unless, indeed, they urged that heretics could much more be admitted with baptism to Christ's kingdom, to which catechumens were admitted without it, since He Himself has said, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-35-P3598_2017628:121-nf] Now, in this matter I do not hesitate for a moment to place the Catholic catechumen, who is burning with love for God, before the baptized heretic; nor yet do we thereby do dishonor to the sacrament of baptism which the latter has already received, the former not as yet; nor do we consider that the sacrament of the catechumen[fn-35-P3599_2017976:122-nf] is to be preferred to the sacrament of baptism, when we acknowledge that some catechumens are better and more faithful than some baptized persons. For the centurion Cornelius, before baptism, was better than Simon, who had been baptized. For Cornelius, even before his baptism, was filled with the Holy Spirit;[fn-36-P3600_2019026:123-nf] Simon, even after baptism, was puffed up with an unclean spirit.[fn-36-P3601_2019110:124-nf] Cornelius, however, would have been convicted of contempt for so holy a sacrament, if, even after he had received the Holy Ghost, he had refused to be baptized. But when he was baptized, he received in no wise a better sacrament than Simon; but the different merits of the men were made manifest under the equal holiness of the same sacrament-so true is it that the good or ill deserving of the recipient does not increase or diminish the holiness of baptism. But as baptism is wanting to a good catechumen to his receiving the kingdom of heaven, so true conversion is wanting to a bad man though baptized. For He who said, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit. he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,\" said also Himself, \"except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven:\"[fn-36-P3602_2020018:125-nf] For that the righteousness of the catechumens might not feel secure, it is written, \"Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\" And again, that the unrighteousness of the baptized might not feel secure because they had received baptism, it is written, \"Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.\" The one were too little without the other; the two make perfect the heir of that inheritance. As, then, we ought not to depreciate a man's righteousness, which begins to exist before he is joined to the Church, as the righteousness of Cornelius began to exist before he was in the body of Christian men,-which righteousness was not thought worthless, or the angel would not have said to him, \"Thy prayers and thine alms are come up as a memorial before God;\" nor did it yet suffice for his obtaining the kingdom of heaven, or he would not have been told to send to Peter,[fn-36-P3603_2021059:126-nf] -so neither ought we to depreciate the sacrament of baptism, even though it has been received outside the Church.

For Simon Magus also was born of water and of the Spirit,[fn-39-P3923_2141957:40-nf] and yet he did not enter into the kingdom of heaven; and this may possibly be the case with heretics as well. Or if only those are born of the Spirit who are changed with a true conversion, all \"who renounce the world in word and not in deed\" are assuredly not born of the Spirit, but of water only, and yet they are within the Church, according to the testimony of Cyprian. For we must perforce grant one of two things,-either those who renounce the world deceitfully are born of the Spirit, though it is to their destruction, not to salvation, and therefore heretics may be so born; or if what is written, that \"the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit,\"[fn-39-P3924_2142640:41-nf] extends to proving as much as this, that those who renounce the world deceitfully are not born of the Spirit, then a man may be baptized with water, and not born of the Spirit, and Nemesianus says in vain that neither the Spirit can work without the water, nor the water without the Spirit. Indeed it has been already often shown how it is possible that men should have one baptism in common who have not one Church, as it is possible that in the body of the Church herself those who are sanctified by their righteousness, and those who are polluted through their covetousness, may not have the same one Spirit, and yet have the same one baptism. For it is said \"one body,\" that is, the Church, just as it is said \"one Spirit\" and \"one baptism.\" The other arguments which he has adduced rather favor our position. For he has brought forward a proof from the gospel, in the words, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; for the Spirit is God, and born of God;\"[fn-39-P3925_2143669:42-nf] and he has advanced the argument that therefore all things that are done by any heretic or schismatic are carnal, as the apostle says, \"The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness;\" and so he goes through the list which the apostle there enumerates, amongst which he has reckoned heresies, since \"they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-39-P3926_2144082:43-nf] Then he goes on to add, that \"therefore the apostle condemns with all wicked men those also who cause division, that is, schismatics and heretics.\" And in this he does well, that when he enumerates the works of the flesh, among which are also heresies, he found and declared that the apostle condemns them all alike. Let him therefore question the holy Cyprian himself, and learn from him how many even within the Church live according to the evil works of the flesh, which the apostle condemns in common with the heresies, and yet these both baptize and are baptized. Why then are heretics alone said to be incapable of possessing baptism, which is possessed by the very partners in their condemnation?","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_52_oration_xl_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XXVI.

But since the first part of this argument seems to be unfolded, we ought to touch on its subsequent part, on account of the heretics; because it is very necessary not to pass over that discussion which once falls into our hands, lest perchance some heretic should dare, of his subtlety, to assail those of our brethren who are more simple. For because John said that we must be baptized in the Holy Ghost and in fire, from the fact that he went on to say and fire, some desperate men have dared to such an extent to carry their depravity, and therefore very crafty men seek how they can thus corrupt and violate, and even neutralize the baptism of holiness. Who derive the origin of their notion from Simon Magus, practising it with manifold perversity through various errors; to whom Simon Peter, in the Acts of the Apostles, said, \"Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the grace of God could be possessed by money; thou hast neither part nor lot in this work; for thy heart is not right with God.\"[fn-107-P10788_3426662:52-nf] And such men as these do all these things in the desire to deceive those who are more simple or more inquisitive. And some of them try to argue that they only administer a sound and perfect, not as we, a mutilated and curtailed baptism, which they are in such wise said to designate, that immediately they have descended into the water, fire at once appears upon the water. Which if it can be effected by any trick, as several tricks of this kind are affirmed to be-of Anaxilaus-whether it is anything natural, by means of which this may happen, or whether they think that they behold this, or whether the work and magical poison of some malignant being can force fire from the water; still they declare such a deceit and artifice to be a perfect baptism, which if faithful men have been forced to receive, there will assuredly be no doubt but that they have lost that which they had. Just as, if a soldier after taking an oath should desert his camp, and in the very different camp of the enemy should wish to take an oath of a far other kind, it is plain that in this way he is discharged from his old oath.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":8,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"15.

And if it so happen that certain ministers, being deceitful workers, seeking their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's, proclaiming the gospel not in purity, and preaching Christ of contention and envy, are to be called dead because of their unrighteousness, yet the sacrament of the living God does not die even in one that is dead.

Augustin answered: Any one that hears these words, without being acquainted with the Scriptures, and who does not believe that you are either so far astray as not to know what you are saying, or deceiving in such wise that he whom you have deceived should not know what he says, would believe that the prophet Jeremiah, wishing to be baptized, had taken precautions not to be baptized by impious men, and had used these words with this intent. For what was your object in saying, previous to your quotation of this passage, \"Imitate indeed the prophets, who feared to have their holy souls deceived with false baptism?\" Just as though, in the days of Jeremiah, any one were washed with the sacrament of baptism, except so far as the Pharisees almost every moment bathed themselves, and their couches and cups and platters, with the washings which the Lord condemned, as we read in the gospel.[fn-54-P5469_2645962:316-nf] How then could Jeremiah have said this, as though he desired to be baptized, and sought to avoid being baptized by impious men? He said it, then, when he was complaining of a faithless people, by the corruption of whose morals he was vexed, not wishing to associate with their deeds; and yet he did not separate himself bodily from their congregation, nor seek other sacraments than those which the people received as suitable to that time, according to the law of Moses. To this people, therefore, in their evil mode of life, he gave the name of \"a wound,\" with which the heart of the righteous man was grievously smitten, whether speaking thus of himself, or fore-shadowing in himself what he foresaw would come to pass. For he speaks as follows: \"O Lord, remember me, and visit me; make clear my innocence before those who persecute me in no spirit of long-suffering: know that for Thy sake I have suffered rebuke from those that scorn Thy words. Make their portion complete; and Thy word shall be unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, O Lord God of hosts. I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, but was afraid of the presence of Thy hand; I sat alone, because I was filled with bitterness. Why do those who make me sad prevail against me? My wound is grievous; whence shall I be healed? It is become unto me as lying water, that has no faith.\"[fn-54-P5470_2647369:317-nf] In all this it is manifest what the prophet wished to be understood, but manifest only to those who do not wish to distort to their own perverse cause the meaning of what they read. For Jeremiah says that his wound has become unto him as lying water, which cannot inspire faith; but he wished that by his wound those should be understood who made him sad by the evil conduct of their lives. Whence also the apostle says, \"Without were fightings, within were fears;\"[fn-54-P5471_2647867:318-nf] and again, \"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?\"[fn-54-P5472_2647967:319-nf] And because he had no hopes that they could be reformed, therefore he said, \"Whence shall I be healed?\" as though his own pain must needs continue so long as those among whom he was compelled to live continued what they were. But that a people is commonly understood under the appellation of water is shown in the Apocalypse, where we understand \"many waters\" to mean \"many peoples,\" not by any conjecture of our own, but by an express explanation in the place itself.[fn-54-P5473_2648458:320-nf] Abstain then from blaspheming the sacrament of baptism from any misunderstanding, or rather error, even when found in a man of most abandoned character; for not even in the lying Simon was the baptism which he received a lying water,[fn-54-P5474_2648714:321-nf] nor do all the liars of your party administer a lying water when they baptize in the name of the Trinity.

See now how Petilianus, to avoid answering this question, or to avoid being proved to be incapable of answering it, wanders off vainly into irrelevant matter in abuse of us, accusing us and proving nothing; and when he chances to make an endeavor to resist, with something like a show of fighting for his cause, he is everywhere overcome with the greatest ease. But yet he nowhere gives an answer of any kind to this one question which we ask: If the conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, by what means is he to be cleansed who received baptism while the conscience of the giver was polluted, without the knowledge of him who was to receive it? for in these words, which he quoted from my epistle, he set me forth as asking a question, while he showed himself as giving no answer. For after saying what I have just now recited, and when, on being brought into a great strait on every side, he had been compelled to say that the baptizer ought to be examined by the candidate for baptism, and the candidate in turn by the baptizer; and when he had tried to fortify this statement by the example of John, in hopes that he might find auditors either of the greatest negligence or of the greatest ignorance, he then went on to advance other testimonies of Scripture wholly irrelevant to the matter in hand, as the saying of the eunuch to Philip, \"See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?\"[fn-57-P5710_2758591:74-nf] \"inasmuch as he knew,\" says he, \"that those of abandoned character were prevented;\" arguing that the reason why Philip did not forbid him to be baptized was because he had proved, in his reading of the Scriptures, how far he believed in Christ,-as though he had prohibited Simon Magus. And again, he urges that the prophets were afraid of being deceived by false baptism, and that therefore Isaiah said, \"Lying water that has not faith,\"[fn-57-P5711_2759049:75-nf] as though showing that water among faithless men is lying; whereas it is not Isaiah but Jeremiah that says this of lying men, calling the people in a figure water, as is most clearly shown in the Apocalypse.[fn-57-P5712_2759306:76-nf] And again, he quotes as words of David, \"Let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head,\" when David has been speaking of the flattery of the smooth speaker deceiving with false praise, so as to lead the head of the man praised to wax great with pride. And this meaning is made manifest by the words immediately preceding in the same psalm. For he says, \"Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me: but the oil of the sinner shall not break my head.\"[fn-57-P5713_2759807:77-nf] What can be clearer than this sentence? what more manifest?

I suppose, brethren, that this is known in the Church, and that what we are saying is manifest by daily examples; but let us consider these things in the case of our fathers before us, how they also had these four kinds. Of the good, good; Ananias baptized Paul. How of the evil, evil? The apostle declares that there were certain preachers of the gospel, who, he says, did not use to preach the gospel with a pure motive, whom, however, he tolerates in the Christian society, saying, \"What then, notwithstanding every way, whether by occasion or in truth, Christ is preached, and in this I rejoice.\"[fn-7-P725_354405:18-nf] Was he therefore malevolent, and did he rejoice in another's evil? No, but rejoiced because through evil men the truth was preached, and by the mouths of evil men Christ was preached.

And, in this case how will that first statement of the Lord made about men after the fall stand: \"Behold, Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil?\"[fn-53-P5348_1915089:59-nf] For we cannot think that before, he was such as to be altogether ignorant of good. Otherwise we should have to admit that he was formed like some irrational and insensate beast: which is sufficiently absurd and altogether alien from the Catholic faith. Moreover as the wisest Solomon says: \"God made man upright,\" i.e., always to enjoy the knowledge of good only, \"But they have sought out many imaginations,\"[fn-53-P5349_1915518:60-nf] for they came, as has been said, to know good and evil. Adam therefore after the fall conceived a knowledge of evil which he had not previously, but did not lose the knowledge of good which he had before. Finally the Apostle's words very clearly show that mankind did not lose after the fall of Adam the knowledge of good: as he says: \"For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have not the law, are a law to themselves, as they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to these, and their thoughts within them either accusing or else excusing them, in the day in which God shall judge the secrets of men.\"[fn-53-P5350_1916254:61-nf] And with the same meaning the Lord rebukes by the prophet the unnatural but freely chosen blindness of the Jews, which they by their obstinacy brought upon themselves, saying: \"Hear ye deaf, and ye blind, behold that you may see. Who is deaf but My servant? and blind, but he to whom I have sent My messengers?\"[fn-53-P5351_1916588:62-nf] And that no one might ascribe this blindness of theirs to nature instead of to their own will, elsewhere He says: \"Bring forth the people that are blind and have eyes: that are deaf and have ears;\" and again: \"having eyes, but ye see not; and ears, but ye hear not.\"[fn-53-P5352_1916878:63-nf] The Lord also says in the gospel: \"Because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not neither do they understand.\"[fn-53-P5353_1917028:64-nf] And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: \"Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand: and seeing ye shall see and shall not see. For the heart of this people is waxed fat, and their ears are dull of hearing: and they have closed their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and be turned and I should heal them.\"[fn-53-P5354_1917450:65-nf] Finally in order to denote that the possibility of good was in them, in chiding the Pharisees, He says: \"But why of your own selves do ye not judge what is right?\"[fn-53-P5355_1917634:66-nf] And this he certainly would not have said to them, unless He knew that by their natural judgment they could discern what was fair. Wherefore we must take care not to refer all the merits of the saints to the Lord in such a way as to ascribe nothing but what is evil and perverse to human nature: in doing which we are confuted by the evidence of the most wise Solomon, or rather of the Lord Himself, Whose words these are; for when the building of the Temple was finished and he was praying, he spoke as follows: \"And David my father would have built a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel: and the Lord said to David my father: Whereas thou hast thought in thine heart to build a house to My name, thou hast well done in having this same thing in thy mind. Nevertheless thou shall not build a house to My name.\"[fn-53-P5356_1918476:67-nf] This thought then and this purpose of king David, are we to call it good and from God or bad and from man? For if that thought was good and from God, why did He by whom it was inspired refuse that it should be carried into effect? But if it is bad and from man, why is it praised by the Lord? It remains then that we must take it as good and from man. And in the same way we can take our own thoughts today. For it was not given only to David to think what is good of himself, nor is it denied to us naturally to think or imagine anything that is good. It cannot then be doubted that there are by nature some seeds of goodness in every soul implanted by the kindness of the Creator: but unless these are quickened by the assistance of God, they will not be able to attain to an increase of perfection, for, as the blessed Apostle says: \"Neither is he that planteth anything nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.\"[fn-53-P5357_1919433:68-nf] But that freedom of the will is to some degree in a man's own power is very clearly taught in the book termed the Pastor,[fn-53-P5358_1919575:69-nf] where two angels are said to be attached to each one of us, i.e., a good and a bad one, while it lies at a man's own option to choose which to follow. And therefore the will always remains free in man, and can either neglect or delight in the grace of God. For the Apostle would not have commanded saying: \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,\" had he not known that it could be advanced or neglected by us. But that men might not fancy that they had no need of Divine aid for the work of Salvation, he subjoins: \"For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of His good pleasure.\"[fn-53-P5359_1920216:70-nf] And therefore he warns Timothy and says: \"Neglect not the grace of God which is in thee;\" and again: \"For which cause I exhort thee to stir up the grace of God which is in thee.\"[fn-53-P5360_1920418:71-nf] Hence also in writing to the Corinthians he exhorts and warns them not through their unfruitful works to show themselves unworthy of the grace of God, saying: \"And we helping, exhort you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:\"[fn-53-P5361_1920685:72-nf] for the reception of saving grace was of no profit to Simon doubtless because he had received it in vain; for he would not obey the command of the blessed Peter who said: \"Repent of thine iniquity, and pray God if haply the thoughts of thine heart may be forgiven thee; for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity.\"[fn-53-P5362_1921057:73-nf] It prevents therefore the will of man, for it is said: \"My God will prevent me with His mercy;\"[fn-53-P5363_1921177:74-nf] and again when God waits and for our good delays, that He may put our desires to the test, our will precedes, for it is said: \"And in the morning my prayer shall prevent Thee;\" and again: \"I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;\" and: \"Mine eyes have prevented the morning.\"[fn-53-P5364_1921485:75-nf] For He calls and invites us, when He says: \"All the day long I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people;\"[fn-53-P5365_1921674:76-nf] and He is invited by us when we say to Him: \"All the day long I have stretched forth My hands unto Thee\"[fn-53-P5366_1921796:77-nf] He waits for us, when it is said by the prophet: \"Wherefore the Lord waiteth to have compassion upon us;\"[fn-53-P5367_1921937:78-nf] and He is waited for by us, when we say: \"I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto me;\" and: \"I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.\"[fn-53-P5368_1922104:79-nf] He strengthens us when He says: \"And I have chastised them, and strengthened their arms; and they have imagined evil against me;\"[fn-53-P5369_1922280:80-nf] and He exhorts us to strengthen ourselves when He says: \"Strengthen ye the weak hands, and make strong the feeble knees.\"[fn-53-P5370_1922422:81-nf] Jesus cries: \"If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink;\"[fn-53-P5371_1922504:82-nf] the prophet also cries to Him: \"I have laboured with crying, my jaws are become hoarse: mine eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.\"[fn-53-P5372_1922663:83-nf] The Lord seeks us, when He says: \"I sought and there was no man.

How many Bishops hid themselves when they saw these things! How many noble women retired to country places in consequence of the calumnies of the enemies of Christ! How many ascetics were made the objects of their plots! How many who were sojourning there, and had made that place their home, did they cause to be persecuted! How often and how strictly did they guard the harbour[fn-48-P4886_1940489:13-nf] and the approaches to the gates, lest any orthodox person should enter and visit Liberius! Rome also had trial of the enemies of Christ, and now experienced what before she would not believe, when she heard how the other Churches in every city were ravaged by them. It was the eunuchs who instigated these proceedings against all. And the most remarkable circumstance in the matter is this; that the Arian heresy which denies the Son of God, receives its support from eunuchs, who, as both their bodies are fruitless, and their souls barren of virtue, cannot bear even to hear the name of son. The Eunuch of Ethiopia indeed, though he understood not what he read[fn-48-P4887_1941199:14-nf] , believed the words of Philip, when he taught him concerning the Saviour; but the eunuchs of Constantius cannot endure the confession of Peter[fn-48-P4888_1941363:15-nf] , nay, they turn away when the Father manifests the Son, and madly rage against those who say, that the Son of God is His genuine Son, thus claiming as a heresy of eunuchs, that there is no genuine and true offspring of the Father. On these grounds it is that the law forbids such persons to be admitted into any ecclesiastical Council[fn-48-P4889_1941774:16-nf] ; notwithstanding which they have now regarded these as competent judges of ecclesiastical causes, and whatever seems good to them, that Constantius decrees, while men with the name of Bishops dissemble with them.

Moreover, if they say that the Son is by will, they should say also that He came to be by understanding; for I consider understanding and will to be the same.

Certainly the Saviour Himself has made them correspond, as being cognate, when He says, `Counsel is mine and security; mine is understanding, and mine strength[fn-70-P7048_2802245:464-nf] .'

To them then must be said what was said to Simon Magus; `the irreligion of Valentinus perish with you[fn-70-P7052_2803386:468-nf] ;' and let every one rather trust to Solomon, who says, that the Word is Wisdom and Understanding.

And as by the Word the heavens, so `He hath done whatsoever pleased Him.' And as the Apostle writes to Thessalonians, `the will of God is in Christ Jesus[fn-70-P7053_2803856:469-nf] .' The Son of God then, He is the `Word' and the `Wisdom;' He the `Understanding' and the Living `Counsel;' and in Him is the `Good Pleasure of the Father;' He is `Truth' and `Light' and `Power' of the Father. But if the Will of God is Wisdom and Understanding, and the Son is Wisdom, he who says that the Son is `by will,' says virtually that Wisdom has come into being in wisdom, and the Son is made in a son, and the Word created through the Word[fn-70-P7054_2804385:470-nf] ; which is incompatible with God and is opposed to His Scriptures. For the Apostle proclaims the Son to be the own Radiance and Expression, not of the Father's will[fn-70-P7055_2804590:471-nf] , but of His Essence[fn-70-P7056_2804636:472-nf] Itself, saying, `Who being the Radiance of His glory and the Expression of His Subsistence[fn-70-P7057_2805361:473-nf] .' But if, as we have said before, the Father's Essence and Subsistence be not from will, neither, as is very plain, is what is proper to the Father's Subsistence from will; for such as, and so as, that Blessed Subsistence, must also be the proper Offspring from It. And accordingly the Father Himself said not, `This is the Son originated at My will,' nor `the Son whom I have by My favour,' but simply `My Son,' and more than that, `in whom I am well pleased;' meaning by this, This is the Son by nature; and `in Him is lodged My will about what pleases Me.'","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":8,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_33_book_iii_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"137","folder":"ANF-08","text":"But Simon hearing this, and being smitten by his conscience, changed colour and became bloodless; for he was afraid, if he denied it, that his house would be searched, or that Peter in his indignation would betray him more openly, and so all would learn what he was.

Why then should not we bear with those whom, God suffers? Why should not we bear with fortitude the wrongs that they do to us, when He who is almighty does not take vengeance on them, that both His own goodness and the impiety of the wicked may be known? But if the wicked one had not found Simon to be his minister, he would doubtless have found another: for it is of necessity that in this life offences come, `but woe to that man by whom they come; '[fn-20-P2065_583052:28-nf] and therefore Simon is rather to be mourned over, because he has become a choice vessel for the wicked one, which undoubtedly would not have happened had he not received power over him for his former sins. For why should I further say that he once believed in our Jesus, and was persuaded that Souls are immortal?[fn-20-P2066_583386:29-nf] Although in this he is deluded by demons, yet he has persuaded himself that he has the soul of a murdered boy ministering to him in whatever he pleases to employ it in; in which truly, as I have said, he is deluded by demons, and therefore I spoke to him according to his own ideas: for he has learned from the Jews, that judgment and vengeance are to be brought forth against those who set themselves against the true faith, and do not repent.

Cyprian and others, to Stephen their brother, greeting. We have thought it necessary for the arranging of certain matters, dearest brother, and for their investigation by the examination of a common council, to gather together and to hold a council, at which many priests were assembled at once; at which, moreover, many things were brought forward and transacted. But the subject in regard to which we had chiefly to write to you, and to confer with your gravity and wisdom, is one that more especially pertains both to the priestly authority and to the unity, as well as the dignity, of the Catholic Church, arising as these do from the ordination of the divine appointment; to wit, that those who have been dipped abroad outside the Church, and have been stained among heretics and schismatics with the taint of profane water, when they come to us and to the Church which is one, ought to be baptized, for the reason that it is a small matter[fn-62-P6253_1978275:2-nf] to \"lay hands on them that they may receive the Holy Ghost,\" unless they receive also the baptism of the Church. For then finally can they be fully sanctified, and be the sons of God, if they be born of each sacrament;[fn-62-P6254_1978524:3-nf] since it is written, \"Except a man be born again of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-62-P6255_1979149:4-nf] For we find also, in the Acts of the Apostles, that this is maintained by the apostles, and kept in the truth of the saving faith, so that when, in the house of Cornelius the centurion, the Holy Ghost had descended upon the Gentiles who were there, fervent in the warmth of their faith, and believing in the Lord with their whole heart; and when, filled with the Spirit, they blessed God in divers tongues, still none the less the blessed Apostle Peter, mindful of the divine precept and the Gospel, commanded that those same men should be baptized who had already been filled with the Holy Spirit, that nothing might seem to be neglected to the observance by the apostolic instruction in all things of the law of the divine precept and Gospel.[fn-62-P6256_1979947:5-nf] But that that is not baptism which the heretics use; and that none of those who oppose Christ can profit by the grace of Christ; has lately been set forth with care in the letter which was written on that subject to Quintus, our colleague, established in Mauritania; as also in a letter which our colleagues previously wrote to our fellow-bishops presiding in Numidia, of both which letters I have subjoined copies.

If the allegation be true, let it be so no more. Let a better state of things begin. To the recipient of the bribe it must be said, as was said by the Apostles to him who was willing to give money to buy the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, \"Thy money perish with thee.[fn-33-P3393_1110600:4-nf] It is a lighter sin to wish in ignorance to buy, than it is to sell, the gift of God. A sale it was; and if you sell what you received as a free gift you will be deprived of the boon, as though you were yourself sold to Satan. You are obtruding the traffic of the huckster into spiritual things and into the Church where we are entrusted with the body and blood of Christ. These things mast not be. And I will mention wherein lies an ingenious contrivance. They think that there is no sin because they take the money not before but after the ordination; but to take is to take at whatever time.","title":"Letter LIII","author":"St. Basil"}]
