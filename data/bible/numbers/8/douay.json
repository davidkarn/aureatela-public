{"verses":["And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Speak to Aaron, and thou shalt say to him:  When thou shalt place\nthe seven lamps, let the candlestick be set up on the south side.  Give\norders therefore that the lamps look over against the north, towards\nthe table of the loaves of proposition, over against that part shall\nthey give light, towards which the candlestick looketh.","And Aaron did so, and he put the lamps upon the candlestick, as\nthe Lord had commanded Moses.","Now this was the work of the candlestick, it was of beaten gold,\nboth the shaft in the middle, and all that came out of both sides of\nthe branches:  according to the pattern which the Lord had shewn to\nMoses, so he made the candlestick.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Take the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, and\nthou shalt purify them,","According to this rite:  Let them be sprinkled with the water of\npurification, and let them shave all the hairs of their flesh.  And when\nthey shall have washed their garments, and are cleansed,","They shall take an ox of the herd, and for the offering thereof\nfine flour tempered with oil:  and thou shalt take another ox of the\nherd for a sin offering:","And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the\ncovenant, calling together all the multitude of the children of Israel:","And when the Levites are before the Lord, the children of Israel\nshall put their hands upon them:","And Aaron shall offer the Levites, as a gift in the sight of the\nLord from the children of Israel, that they may serve in his ministry.","The Levites also shall put their hands upon the heads of the\noxen, of which thou shalt sacrifice one for sin, and the other for a\nholocaust to the Lord, to pray for them.","And thou shalt set the Levites in the sight of Aaron and of his,\nand shalt consecrate them being offered to the Lord,","And shalt separate them from the midst of the children of Israel,\nto be mine.","And afterwards they shall enter into the tabernacle of the\ncovenant, to serve me.  And thus shalt thou purify and consecrate them\nfor an oblation of the Lord:  for as a gift they were given me by the\nchildren of Israel.","I have taken them instead of the firstborn that open every womb\nin Israel,","For all the firstborn of the children of Israel, both of men and\nof beasts, are mine.  From the day that I slew every firstborn in the\nland of Egypt, have I sanctified them to myself:","And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the\nchildren of Israel:","And have delivered them for a gift to Aaron and his sons out of\nthe midst of the people, to serve me for Israel in the tabernacle of\nthe covenant, and to pray for them, lest there should be a plague among\nthe people, if they should presume to approach unto my sanctuary.","And Moses and Aaron and all the multitude of the children of\nIsrael did with the Levites all that the Lord had commanded Moses","And they were purified, and washed their garments.  And Aaron\nlifted them up in the sight of the Lord, and prayed for them,","That being purified they might go into the tabernacle of the\ncovenant to do their services before Aaron and his sons.  As the Lord\nhad commanded Moses touching the Levites, so was it done.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","This is the law of the Levites:  From twenty-five years old and\nupwards, they shall go in to minister in the tabernacle of the\ncovenant.","And when they shall have accomplished the fiftieth year of their\nage, they shall cease to serve:","And they shall be the ministers of their brethren in the\ntabernacle of the covenant, to keep the things that are committed to\ntheir care, but not to do the works.  Thus shalt thou order the Levites\ntouching their charge."]}
