{"verses":["And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:","This is the observance of the victim, which the Lord hath\nordained.  Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee a\nred cow of full age, in which there is no blemish, and which hath not\ncarried the yoke:","And you shall deliver her to Eleazar the priest, who shall bring\nher forth without the camp, and shall immolate her in the sight of all:","And dipping his finger in her blood, shall sprinkle it over\nagainst the door of the tabernacle seven times,","And shall burn her in the sight of all delivering up to the fire\nher skin, and her flesh, and her blood, and her dung.","The priest shall also take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet\ntwice dyed, and cast it into the flame, with which the cow is consumed.","And then after washing his garments, and body, he shall enter\ninto the camp, and shall be unclean until the evening.","He also that hath burned her, shall wash his garments, and his\nbody, and shall be unclean until the evening.","And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the cow, and\nshall pour them forth without the camp in a most clean place, that they\nmay be reserved for the multitude of the children of Israel, and for a\nwater of aspersion:  because the cow was burnt for sin.","And when he that carried the ashes of the cow, hath washed his\ngarments, he shall be unclean until the evening.  The children of\nIsrael, and the strangers that dwell among them, shall observe this for\na holy thing by a perpetual ordinance.","He that toucheth the corpse of a man, and is therefore unclean\nseven days,","Shall be sprinkled with this water on the third day, and on the\nseventh, and so shall be cleansed.  If he were not sprinkled on the\nthird day, he cannot be cleansed on the seventh.","Every one that toucheth the corpse of a man, and is not\nsprinkled with this mixture, shall profane the tabernacle of the Lord,\nand shall perish out of Israel:  because he was not sprinkled with the\nwater of expiation, he shall be unclean, and his uncleanness shall\nremain upon him.","This is the law of a man that dieth in a tent:  All that go into\nhis tent and all the vessels that are there, shall be unclean seven\ndays.","The vessel that hath no cover, nor binding over it, shall be\nunclean.","If any man in the field touch the corpse of a man that was\nslain, or that died of himself, or his bone, or his grave, he shall be\nunclean seven days.","And they shall take of the ashes of the burning and of the sin\noffering, and shall pour living waters upon them into a vessel.","And a man that is clean shall dip hyssop in them, and shall\nsprinkle therewith all the tent, and all the furniture, and the men\nthat are defiled with touching any such thing:","And in this manner he that is clean shall purify the unclean on\nthe third and on the seventh day.  And being expiated the seventh day,\nhe shall wash both himself and his garments, and be unclean until the\nevening.","If any man be not expiated after this rite, his soul shall\nperish out of the midst of the church:  because he hath profaned the\nsanctuary of the Lord, and was not sprinkled with the water of\npurification.","This precept shall be an ordinance for ever.  He also that\nsprinkled the water, shall wash his garments.  Every one that shall\ntouch the waters of expiation, shall be unclean until the evening.","Whatsoever a person toucheth who is unclean, he shall make it\nunclean:  and the person that toucheth any of these things, shall be\nunclean until the evening."]}
