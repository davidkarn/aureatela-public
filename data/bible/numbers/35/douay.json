{"verses":["And the Lord spoke these things also to Moses in the plains of\nMoab by the Jordan, over against Jericho:","Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites out\nof their possessions,","Cities to dwell in, and their suburbs round about:  that they may\nabide in the towns, and the suburbs may be for them cattle and beasts:","Which suburbs shall reach from the walls of the cities outward, a\nthousand paces on every side:","Toward the east shall be two thousand cubits:  and toward the\nsouth in like manner shall be two thousand cubits:  toward the sea also,\nwhich looketh to the west, shall be the same extent:  and the north side\nshall be bounded with the like limits.  And the cities shall be in the\nmidst, and the suburbs without.","And among the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, six\nshall be separated for refuge to fugitives, that he who hath shed blood\nmay flee to them:  and besides these there shall be other forty-two\ncities,","That is, in all forty-eight with their suburbs.","And of these cities which shall be given out of the possessions\nof the children of Israel, from them that have more, more shall be\ntaken:  and from them that have less, fewer.  Each shall give towns to\nthe Levites according to the extent of their inheritance.","The Lord said to Moses:","Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:\nWhen you shall have passed over the Jordan into the land of Chanaan,","Determine what cities shall be for the refuge of fugitives, who\nhave shed blood against their will.","And when the fugitive shall be in them, the kinsman of him that\nis slain may not have power to kill him, until he stand before the\nmultitude, and his cause be judged.","And of those cities, that are separated for the refuge of\nfugitives,","Three shall be beyond the Jordan, and three in the land of\nChanaan,","As well for the children of Israel as for strangers and\nsojourners, that he may flee to them, who hath shed blood against his\nwill.","If any man strike with iron, and he die that was struck:  he\nshall be guilty of murder, and he himself shall die.","If he throw a stone, and he that is struck die:  he shall be\npunished in the same manner.","If he that is struck with wood die:  he shall be revenged by the\nblood of him that struck him.","The kinsman of him that was slain, shall kill the murderer:  as\nsoon as he apprehendeth him, he shall kill him.","If through hatred any one push a man, or fling any thing at him\nwith ill design:","Or being his enemy, strike him with his hand, and he die:  the\nstriker shall be guilty of murder:  the kinsman of him that was slain as\nsoon as he findeth him, shall kill him.","But if by chance medley, and without hatred,","And enmity, he do any of these things,","And this be proved in the hearing of the people, and the cause\nbe debated between him that struck, and the next of kin:","The innocent shall be delivered from the hand of the revenger,\nand shall be brought back by sentence into the city, to which he had\nfled, and he shall abide there until the death of the high priest, that\nis anointed with the holy oil.","If the murderer be found without the limits of the cities that\nare appointed for the banished,","And be struck by him that is the avenger of blood:  he shall not\nbe guilty that killed him.","For the fugitive ought to have stayed in the city until the\ndeath of the high priest:  and after he is dead, then shall the\nmanslayer return to his own country.","These things shall be perpetual, and for an ordinance in all\nyour dwellings.","The murderer shall be punished by witnesses:  none shall be\ncondemned upon the evidence of one man.","You shall not take money of him that is guilty of blood, but he\nshall die forthwith.","The banished and fugitives before the death of the high priest\nmay by no means return into their own cities.","Defile not the land of your habitation, which is stained with\nthe blood of the innocent:  neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by\nhis blood that hath shed the blood of another.","And thus shall your possession be cleansed, myself abiding with\nyou.  For I am the Lord that dwell among the children of Israel."]}
