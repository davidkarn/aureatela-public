Then God pitied them, and led them out, and freed them from the hand of the king of the Egyptians, after four hundred and thirty[fn-12-P1229_540390:66-nf] years, under the leadership of Moses, through whom the law was afterwards given to them by God; and in this leading out God displayed the power of His majesty. For He made His people to pass through the midst of the Red Sea, His angel[fn-12-P1230_540844:67-nf] going before and dividing the water, so that the people might walk over the dry land, of whom it might more truly be said (as the poet says[fn-12-P1231_541172:68-nf] ), that \"the wave, closing over him after the appearance of a mountain, stood around him.\" And when he heard of this, the tyrant of the Egyptians followed with this great host of his men, and rashly entering the sea which still lay open, was destroyed, together with his whole army, by the waves returning[fn-12-P1232_541703:69-nf] to their place. But the Hebrews, when they had entered into the wilderness, saw many wonderful deeds. For when they suffered thirst, a rock having been struck with a rod, a fountain of water sprung forth and refreshed the people. And again, when they were hungry, a shower[fn-12-P1233_542019:70-nf] of heavenly nourishment descended. Moreover, also, the wind[fn-12-P1234_542146:71-nf] brought quails into their camp, so that they were not only satisfied with heavenly bread, but also with more choice banquets. And yet, in return for these divine benefits, they did not pay honour to God; but when slavery had been now removed from them, and their thirst and hunger laid aside, they fell away into luxury, and transferred their minds to the profane rites of the Egyptians. For when Moses, their leader, had ascended into the mountain, and there tarried forty days, they made the head[fn-12-P1235_542667:72-nf] of an ox in gold, which they call Apis,[fn-12-P1236_542835:73-nf] that it might go before them as a standard.[fn-12-P1237_542959:74-nf] With which sin and crime God was offended, and justly visited the impious and ungrateful people with severe punishments, and made them subject to the law[fn-12-P1238_543128:75-nf] which He had given by Moses.","title":"Book IV.

Still we may approve these things as the swathing bands of an infant faith. He who has been a loyal soldier under a strange banner is sure to deserve the laurel when he comes to serve his own king. When Nepotian laid aside his baldrick and changed his dress, he bestowed upon the poor all the pay that he had received. For he had read the words: \"if thou wilt be perfect, sell that thou hast, and give to the poor and follow me,\"[fn-25-P2585_662084:1852-nf] and again: \"ye cannot serve two masters, God and Mammon.\"[fn-25-P2586_662166:1853-nf] He kept nothing for himself but a common tunic and cloak to cover him and to keep out the cold. Made in the fashion of his province his attire was not remarkable either for elegance or for squalor. He burned daily to make his way to the monasteries of Egypt, or to visit the communities of Mesopotamia, or at least to live a lonely life in the Dalmatian islands,[fn-25-P2587_662552:1854-nf] separated from the mainland only by the strait of Altinum. But he had not the heart to forsake his episcopal uncle in whom he beheld a pattern of many virtues and from whom he could take lessons without going abroad. In one and the same person he both found a monk to imitate and a bishop to revere. What so often happens did not happen here. Constant intimacy did not produce familiarity, nor did familiarity breed contempt. He revered him as a father and every day admired him for some new virtue. To be brief, he became a clergyman, and after passing through the usual stages was ordained a presbyter. Good Jesus! how he sighed and groaned! how he fasted and fled the eyes of all! For the first and only time he was angry with his uncle, complaining that the burthen laid upon him was too heavy for him and that his youth unfitted him for the priesthood. But the more he struggled against it, the more he drew to himself the hearts of all: his refusal did but prove him worthy of an office which he was reluctant to assume, and all the more worthy because he declared himself unworthy. We too in our day have our Timothy; we too have seen that wisdom which is as good as gray hairs;[fn-25-P2588_663778:1855-nf] our Moses has chosen an elder whom he has known to be an eider indeed.[fn-25-P2589_663871:1856-nf] Nepotian regarded the clerical state less as an honour than a burthen. He made it his first care to silence envy by humility, and his next to give no cause for scandal that such as assailed his youth might marvel at his continence. He helped the poor, visited the sick, stirred men up to hospitality, soothed them with soft words, rejoiced with those who rejoiced and wept with those who wept.[fn-25-P2590_664389:1857-nf] He was a staff to the blind, food to the hungry, hope to the dejected, consolation to the bereaved. Each single virtue was as conspicuous in him as if he possessed no other. Among his fellow-presbyters while ever foremost in work, he was ever satisfied with the lowest place. Any good that he did he ascribed to his uncle: but if the result did not correspond to his expectations, he would say that his uncle knew nothing of it, that it was his own mistake. In public he recognized him as a bishop; at home he looked upon him as a father. The seriousness of his disposition was mitigated by a cheerful expression. But while his laughter was joyous it was never loud. Christ's virgins and widows he honoured as mothers and exhorted as sisters \"with all purity.\"[fn-25-P2591_665173:1858-nf] When he returned home he used to leave the clergyman outside and to give himself over to the hard rule of a monk. Frequent in supplication and watchful in prayer he would offer his tears not to man but to God. His fasts he regulated-as a driver does the pace of his horses-according to the weariness or vigour of his body. When at his uncle's table he would just taste what was set before him, so as to avoid superstition and yet to preserve self-control. In conversing at entertainments his habit was to propose some topic from scripture, to listen modestly, to answer diffidently, to support the right, to refute the wrong, but both without bitterness; to instruct his opponent rather than to vanquish him. Such was the ingenuous modesty which adorned his youth that he would frankly confess from what sources his several arguments came; and in this way, while disclaiming a reputation for learning, he came to be held most learned. This he would say is the opinion of Tertullian, that of Cyprian; this of Lactantius, that of Hilary; to this effect speaks Minucius Felix, thus Victorinus, after this manner Arnobius. Myself too he would sometimes quote, for he loved me because of my intimacy with his uncle. Indeed by constant reading and long-continued meditation he had made his breast a library of Christ.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":11,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_11_book_v_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"15. But in their mutual relation to one another in the Trinity itself, if the begetter is a beginning in relation to that which he begets, the Father is a beginning in relation to the Son, because the begets Him; but whether the Father is also a beginning in relation to the Holy Spirit, since it is said, \"He proceeds from the Father,\" is no small question. Because, if it is so, He will not only be a beginning to that thing which He begets or makes, but also to that which He gives. And here, too, that question comes to light, as it can, which is wont to trouble many, Why the Holy Spirit is not also a son, since He, too, comes forth from the Father, as it is read in the Gospel.[fn-10-P1084_437829:29-nf] For the Spirit came forth, not as born, but as given; and so He is not called a son, because He was neither born, as the Only-begotten, nor made, so that by the grace of God He might be born into adoption, as we are. For that which is born of the Father, is referred to the Father only when called Son, and so the Son is the Son of the Father, and not also our Son; but that which is given is referred both to Him who gave, and to those to whom He gave; and so the Holy Spirit is not only the Spirit of the Father and of the Son who gave Him, but He is also called ours, who have received Him: as \"The salvation of the Lord,\"[fn-10-P1085_438473:30-nf] who gives salvation, is said also to be our salvation, who have received it. Therefore, the Spirit is both the Spirit of God who gave Him, and ours who have received Him. Not, indeed, that spirit of ours by which we are, because that is the spirit of a man which is in him; but this Spirit is ours in another mode, viz. that in which we also say, \"Give us this day our bread.\"[fn-10-P1086_438868:31-nf] Although certainly we have received that spirit also, which is called the spirit of a man. \"For what hast thou,\" he says, \"which thou didst not receive?\"[fn-10-P1087_439041:32-nf] But that is one thing, which we have received that we might be; another, that which we have received that we might be holy. Whence it is also written of John, that he \"came in the spirit and power of Elias;\"[fn-10-P1088_439268:33-nf] and by the spirit of Elias is meant the Holy Spirit, whom Elias received. And the same thing is to be understood of Moses, when the Lord says to him, \"And I will take of thy spirit, and will put it upon them;\"[fn-10-P1089_439496:34-nf] that is, I will give to them of the Holy Spirit, which I have already given to thee. If, therefore, that also which is given has him for a beginning by whom it is given, since it has received from no other source that which proceeds from him; it must be admitted that the Father and the Son are a Beginning of the Holy Spirit, not two Beginnings; but as the Father and Son are one God, and one Creator, and one Lord relatively to the creature, so are they one Beginning relatively to the Holy Spirit. But the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is one Beginning in respect to the creature, as also one Creator and one God.[fn-10-P1090_440139:35-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_15_book_vii_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"15.

Accordingly, in the introduction to his work, we find the following passage among others: \"When Gideon was startled by the message he had heard from God, that, though thousands of the people failed, yet through one man God would driver His people from their enemies, he brought forth a kid of the goats, and by direction of the angel laid it with unleavened cakes upon a rock, and poured the broth over it; and as soon as the angel of God touched it with the end of the staff that was in his hand, there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the offering.[fn-54-P5435_2883957:60-nf] Now this sign seems to indicate that the rock was a type of the body of Christ, for it is written, `They: drank of that spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ;'[fn-54-P5436_2884162:61-nf] this, of course, referring not to Christ's divine nature but to His flesh, whose ever-flowing fountain of blood has ever satisfied the hearts of His thirsting people. And so it was at that time declared in a mystery that the Lord Jesus, when crucified, should abolish in His flesh the sins of the whole world, and not their guilty acts merely, but the evil lusts of their hearts. For the kid's flesh refers to the guilt of the outward act, the broth to the allurement of lust within, as it is written, 'And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting; and the children of Israel also wept again and again and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?[fn-54-P5437_2884838:62-nf] When the angel, then, stretched out his staff and with the Spirit of God, should burn up all the sins of the human race. Whence also the lord says 'I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-54-P5438_2885041:63-nf] And in the same style he pursues the subject, devoting himself chiefly to proving and enforcing his point.[fn-54-P5439_2885167:64-nf] ","title":"Book IV","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":11,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":51,"source_paragraph":"355","folder":"ANF-01","text":"To this I replied, \"Do you not think that the same thing happened in the case of Joshua the son of Nave (Nun), who succeeded to the command of the people after Moses, when Moses was commanded to lay his hands on Joshua, and God said to him, `I will take of the spirit which is in thee, and put it on him?

For if you had understood what has been written by the prophets, you would not have denied that He was God, Son of the only, unbegotten, unutterable God. For Moses says somewhere in Exodus the following: `The Lord spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the Lord, and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, being their God; and my name I revealed not to them, and I established my covenant with them.'[fn-51-P5109_1157248:493-nf] And thus again he says, `A man wrestled with Jacob, '[fn-51-P5110_1157323:494-nf] and asserts it was God; narrating that Jacob said, `I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.' And it is recorded that he called the place where He wrestled with him, appeared to and blessed him, the Face of God (Peniel). And Moses says that God appeared also to Abraham near the oak in Mature, when he was sitting at the door of his tent at mid-day. Then he goes on to say: `And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, three men stood before him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them.'[fn-51-P5111_1157863:495-nf] a After a little, one of them promises a son to Abraham: `Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall. I of a surety bear a child, and I am old? Is anything impossible with God? At the time appointed I will return, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. And they went away from Abraham.'[fn-51-P5112_1158190:496-nf] Again he speaks of them thus: `And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom.'[fn-51-P5113_1158306:497-nf] Then to Abraham He who was and is again speaks: `I will not hide from Abraham, my servant, what I intend to do.'\"[fn-51-P5114_1158443:498-nf] And what follows in the writings of Moses I quoted and explained; \"from which I have demonstrated,\" I said, \"that He who is described as God appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and the other patriarchs, was appointed under the authority of the Father and Lord, and ministers to His will.\" Then I went on to say what I had not said before: \"And so, when the people desired to eat flesh, and Moses had lost faith in Him, who also there is called the Angel, and who promised that God would give them to satiety, He who is both God and the Angel, sent by the Father, is described as saying and doing these things. For thus the Scripture says: `And the Lord said to Moses Will the Lord's hand not be sufficient? thou shall know now whether my word shall conceal thee or not.'[fn-51-P5115_1159246:499-nf] And again, in other words, it thus says: `But the Lord spoke unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan: the Lord thy God, who goeth before thy face, He shall cut off the nations.'[fn-51-P5116_1159448:500-nf] ","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":11,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§12. Again I will remind thee, my beloved, also of that which is written. For thus it is\nwritten, that when it was a grievous burden to Moses to lead the camp alone, the Lord said to\nhim:-Lo! will take away of the Spirit that is upon thee, and will put it upon seventy men, elders\nof Israel.[fn-42-P4273_1418261:97-nf] But when He took away some\nof the Spirit of Moses, and the seventy men were filled with it, Moses nothing lacked, nor could it\nbe known that anything was taken away from his Spirit. Moreover the blessed apostle also said:-God\ndivided of the of Christ and sent it into the Prophets.[fn-42-P4274_1418561:98-nf] And Christ was in nothing injured, for it was\nnot by measure that His Father gave unto Him the Spirit.[fn-42-P4275_1418711:99-nf] By this reflection thou canst comprehend that\nChrist dwells in faithful men; yet Christ suffers no loss though He is divided among many. For the\nProphets received of the Spirit of Christ, each one of them as he was able to bear.

And since we seem to have divided all spiritual baptism in a threefold manner, let us come also to the proof of the statement proposed, that we may not appear to have done this of our own judgment, and with rashness. For John says of our Lord in his epistle, teaching us: \"This is He who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood: and it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. For three bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three are one; \"[fn-107-P10783_3421951:48-nf] -that we may gather from these words both that water is wont to confer the Spirit, and that men's own blood is wont to confer the Spirit, and that the Spirit Himself also is wont to confer the Spirit. For since water is poured forth even as blood, the Spirit also was poured out by the Lord upon all who believed. Assuredly both in water, and none the less in their own blood, and then especially in the Holy Spirit, men may be baptized. For Peter says: \"But this is that which was spoken by the prophet; It shall come to pass in the last days, saith the Lord, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh: and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy, and their young men shall see visions, and their old men shall dream dreams: and upon my servants, and upon my handmaidens, will I pour out of my Spirit; \"[fn-107-P10784_3422779:49-nf] -which Spirit we discover to have been communicated in the Old Testament, not indeed everywhere nor at large, but with other gifts; or, moreover, to have sprung of His own will into certain men, or to have invested them, or to have been upon them, even as we observe that it was said by the Lord to Moses, about the seventy elders, \"And I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them.\"[fn-107-P10785_3423212:50-nf] For which reason also, according to His promise, God put upon them from another of the Spirit which had been upon Moses, and they prophesied in the camp. And Moses, as a spiritual man, rejoiced that this had so happened, although he was unwillingly persuaded by Jesus the son of Nave to oppose this thing, and was not thereby induced. Further, also in the book of Judges, and in the books of Kings too, we observe that upon several, there either was the Spirit of the Lord, or that He came unto them, as upon Gothoniel, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, Saul, David, and many others. Which comes to this result, that the Lord has taught us most plainly by them the liberty and power of the Holy Spirit, approaching of His own will, saying, \"The Spirit breathes where He will; and thou hearest His voice, and knowest not whence He cometh or whither He goeth.\"[fn-107-P10786_3424081:51-nf] So that the same Spirit is, moreover, sometimes found to be upon those who are unworthy of Him; not certainly in vain or without reason, but for the sake of some needful operation; as He was upon Saul, upon whom came the Spirit of God, and he prophesied. However, in later days, after the Spirit of the Lord departed from him, and after a malign spirit from the Lord vexed him, because then he had come, after the messengers whom he had previously sent before with care, with intent to kill David; and they therefore fell into the chorus of the prophets, and they prophesied, so that they neither were able nor willing to do what they had been bidden. And we believe that the Spirit which was upon them all effected this with an admirable wisdom, by the will of God. Which Spirit also filled John the Baptist even from his mother's womb; and it fell upon those who were with Cornelius the centurion before they were baptized with water. Thus, cleaving to the baptism of men, the Holy Spirit either goes before or follows it; or failing the baptism of water, it falls upon those who believe. We are counselled that either we ought duly to maintain the integrity of baptism, or if by chance baptism is given by any one in the name of Jesus Christ, we ought to supplement it, guarding the most holy invocation of the name of Jesus Christ, as we have most abundantly set forth; guarding, moreover, the custom and authority which so much claim our veneration for so long a time and for such great men.","title":"A Treatise on Re-Baptism by an Anonymous Writer.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":11,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_31_book_i_","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"156","folder":"ANF-08","text":"\"These things therefore having been fore-arranged, He who was expected comes, bringing signs and miracles as His credentials by which He should be made manifest.

The Lord, by His promise, gave those whose hopes were resting on Himself a special ground of confidence, when He said, \"For I go to the Father; and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do it.\" His proceeding, therefore, to the Father, was not with any view of abandoning the needy, but of hearing and answering their petitions. But what is to be made of the words, \"Whatsoever ye shall ask,\" when we behold His faithful ones so often asking and not receiving? Is it, shall we say, for no other reason but that they ask amiss? For the Apostle James made this a ground of reproach when he said, \"Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.\"[fn-27-P2731_1595484:1-nf] What one, therefore, wishes to receive, in order to turn to an improper use, God in His mercy rather refuses to bestow. Nay, more, if a man asks what would, if answered, only tend to his injury, there is surely greater cause to fear, lest what God could not withhold with kindness, He should give in His anger. Do we not see how the Israelites got to their own hurt what their guilty lusting craved? For while it was raining manna on them from heaven, they desired to have flesh to eat.[fn-27-P2732_1595986:2-nf] They disdained what they had, and shamelessly sought what they had not: as if it were not better for them to have asked not to have their unbecoming desires gratified with the food that was wanting, but to have their own dislike removed, and be made themselves to receive aright the food that was provided. For when evil becomes our delight, and what is good the reverse, we ought to be entreating God rather to win us back to the love of the good, than to grant us the evil. Not that it is wrong to eat flesh, for the apostle, speakingof this very thing, says, \"Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused which is received with thanksgiving;[fn-27-P2733_1596660:3-nf] but because, as he also says, \"It is evil for thatman who eateth with offense;\"[fn-27-P2734_1596757:4-nf] and if so,with offense to man, how much more so if to God, to whom it was no light offense, on the part of the Israelites, to reject what wisdom was supplying, and ask for that which lust was craving: although they would not actually make the request, but murmured because itwas wanting. But to let us know that the wrong lies not with any creature of God, but with obstinate disobedience and inordinate desire, it was not in swine's flesh that the first man found death, but in an apple;[fn-27-P2735_1597263:5-nf] and it was not for a fowl, but for a dish of pottage, that Esau lost his birthright.[fn-27-P2736_1597364:6-nf] ","title":"Tractate LXXIII.","author":"Augustine"}]
