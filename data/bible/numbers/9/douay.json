{"verses":["The Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, the second year\nafter they were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first month,\nsaying:","Let the children of Israel make the phase in its due time,","The fourteenth day of this month in the evening, according to all\nthe ceremonies and justifications thereof.","And Moses commanded the children of Israel that they should make\nthe phase.","And they made it in its proper time:  the fourteenth day of the\nmonth at evening, in mount Sinai.  The children of Israel did according\nto all things that the Lord had commanded Moses.","But behold some who were unclean by occasion of the soul of a man,\nwho could not make the phase on that day, coming to Moses and Aaron,","Said to them:  We are unclean by occasion of the soul of a man.  Why\nare we kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to\nthe Lord among the children of Israel?","And Moses answered them:  Stay that I may consult the Lord what he\nwill ordain concerning you.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Say to the children of Israel:  The man that shall be unclean by\noccasion of one that is dead, or shall be in a journey afar off in your\nnation, let him make the phase to the Lord.","In the second month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the\nevening, they shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild lettuce:","They shall not leave any thing thereof until morning, nor break a\nbone thereof, they shall observe all the ceremonies of the phase.","But if any man is clean, and was not on a journey, and did not\nmake the phase, that soul shall be cut off from among his people,\nbecause he offered not sacrifice to the Lord in due season:  he shall\nbear his sin.","The sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you, shall\nmake the phase to the Lord according to the ceremonies and\njustifications thereof.  The same ordinances shall be with you both for\nthe stranger, and for him that was born in the land.","Now on the day that the tabernacle was reared up, a cloud covered\nit.  But from the evening there was over the tabernacle, as it were, the\nappearance of fire until the morning.","So it was always:  by day the cloud covered it, and by night as it\nwere the appearance of fire.","And when the cloud that covered the tabernacle was taken up, then\nthe children of Israel marched forward:  and in the place where the\ncloud stood still, there they camped.","At the commandment of the Lord they marched, and at his\ncommandment they pitched the tabernacle.  All the days that the cloud\nabode over the tabernacle, they remained in the same place:","And if it was so that it continued over it a long time, the\nchildren of Israel kept the watches of the Lord, and marched not,","For as many days soever as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle.\nAt the commandment of the Lord they pitched their tents, and at his\ncommandment they took them down.","If the cloud tarried from evening until morning, and immediately\nat break of day left the tabernacle, they marched forward:  and if it\ndeparted after a day and a night, they took down their tents.","But if it remained over the tabernacle for two days or a month or\na longer time, the children of Israel remained in the same place, and\nmarched not:  but immediately as soon as it departed, they removed the\ncamp.","By the word of the Lord they pitched their tents, and by his word\nthey marched:  and kept the watches of the Lord according to his\ncommandment by the hand of Moses."]}
