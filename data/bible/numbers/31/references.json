Moreover, as to the circumstance that some codices of Matthew's Gospel contain the reading, \"For the woman[fn-17-P1760_723498:292-nf] is not dead, but sleepeth,\" while Mark and Luke certify that she was a damsel of the age of twelve years, we may suppose that Matthew has followed the Hebrew mode of speech here. For in other passages of Scripture, as well as here, it is found that not only those who had already known a man, but all females in general, including untouched virgins, are called women.[fn-17-P1761_723881:293-nf] That is the case, for instance, where it is written of Eve, \"He made it[fn-17-P1762_723970:294-nf] into a woman;\"[fn-17-P1763_724002:295-nf] and again, in the book of Numbers, where the women[fn-17-P1764_724073:296-nf] who have not known a man by lying with him, that is to say, the virgins, are ordered to be saved from being put to death.[fn-17-P1765_724212:297-nf] Adopting the same phraseology, Paul, too, says of Christ Himself, that He was \"made of a woman.\"[fn-17-P1766_724331:298-nf] And it is better, therefore, to understand the matter according to these analogies, than to suppose that this damsel of twelve years of age was already married, or had known a man.[fn-17-P1767_724532:299-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":31,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_19_sermon_ii_lii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"10.
