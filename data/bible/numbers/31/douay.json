But the rest of the things\nfor use they carried to the camp on the plains of Moab, beside the\nJordan over against Jericho.","And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the\nsynagogue went forth to meet them without the camp.","And Moses being angry with the chief officers of the army, the\ntribunes, and the centurions that were come from the battle,","Said:  Why have you saved the women?","Are not these they, that deceived the children of Israel by the\ncounsel of Balaam, and made you transgress against the Lord by the sin\nof Phogor, for which also the people was punished?","Therefore kill all that are of the male sex, even of the\nchildren:  and put to death the women, that have carnally known men.","But the girls, and all the women that are virgins save for\nyourselves:","And stay without the camp seven days.  He that hath killed a man,\nor touched one that is killed, shall be purified the third day and the\nseventh day.","And of all the spoil, every garment, or vessel, or any thing\nmade for use, of the skins, or hair of goats, or of wood, shall be\npurified.","Eleazar also the priest spoke to the men of the army, that had\nfought, in this manner:  This is the ordinance of the law, which the\nLord hath commanded Moses:","Gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,","And all that may pass through the fire, shall be purified by\nfire, but whatsoever cannot abide the fire, shall be sanctified with\nthe water of expiation:","And you shall wash your garments the seventh day, and being\npurified, you shall afterwards enter into the camp.","And the Lord said to Moses:","Take the sum of the things that were taken both of man and\nbeast, thou and Eleazar the priest and the princes of the multitude:","And thou shalt divide the spoil equally, between them that\nfought and went out to the war, and between the rest of the multitude.","And thou shalt separate a portion to the Lord from them that\nfought and were in the battle, one soul of five hundred as well of\npersons as of oxen and asses and sheep.","And thou shalt give it to Eleazar the priest, because they are\nthe firstfruits of the Lord.","Out of the moiety also of the children of Israel thou shalt take\nthe fiftieth head of persons, and of oxen, and asses, and sheep, and of\nall beasts, and thou shalt give them to the Levites that watch in the\ncharge of the tabernacle of the Lord.","And Moses and Eleazar did as the Lord had commanded.","And the spoil which the army had taken, was six hundred\nseventy-five thousand sheep,","Seventy-two thousand oxen,","Sixty-one thousand asses:","And thirty-two thousand persons of the female sex, that had not\nknown men.","And one half was given to them that had been in the battle, to\nwit, three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep:","Out of which, for the portion of the Lord, were reckoned six\nhundred seventy five sheep.","And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen, seventy-two oxen:","Out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses, sixty-one asses:","Out of the sixteen thousand persons, there fell to the portion\nof the Lord, thirty-two souls.","And Moses delivered the number of the firstfruits of the Lord to\nEleazar the priest, as had been commanded him,","Out of the half of the children of Israel, which he had\nseparated for them that had been in the battle.","But out of the half that fell to the rest of the multitude, that\nis to say, out of the three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred\nsheep,","And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen,","And out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses,","And out of the sixteen thousand persons,","Moses took the fiftieth head, and gave it to the Levites that\nwatched in the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord had commanded.","And when the commanders of the army, and the tribunes and\ncenturions were come to Moses, they said:","We thy servants have reckoned up the number of the fighting men,\nwhom we had under our hand, and not so much as one was wanting.","Therefore we offer as gifts to the Lord what gold every one of\nus could find in the booty, in garters and tablets, rings and\nbracelets, and chains, that thou mayst pray to the Lord for us.","And Moses and Eleazar the priest received all the gold in divers\nkinds,","In weight sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty sicles, from\nthe tribunes and from the centurions.","For that which every one had taken in the booty was his own.","And that which was received they brought into the tabernacle of\nthe testimony, for a memorial of the children of Israel before the\nLord."]}
