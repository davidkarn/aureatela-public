For Agag his king shall be removed, and his kingdom shall be\ntaken away.","God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like to the\nrhinoceros.  They shall devour the nations that are his enemies, and\nbreak their bones, and pierce them with arrows.","Lying down he hath slept as a lion, and as a lioness, whom none\nshall dare to rouse.  He that blesseth thee, shall also himself be\nblessed:  he that curseth thee shall be reckoned accursed.","And Balac being angry against Balaam, clapped his hands together\nand said:  I called thee to curse my enemies, and thou on the contrary\nhast blessed them three times.","Return to thy place.  I had determined indeed greatly to honour\nthee, but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed for thee.","Balaam made answer to Balac:  Did I not say to thy messengers,\nwhom thou sentest to me:","If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I\ncannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to utter any thing of my\nown head either good or evil:  but whatsoever the Lord shall say, that I\nwill speak?","But yet going to my people, I will give thee counsel, what this\npeople shall do to thy people in the latter days.","Therefore taking up his parable, again he said:  Balaam the son\nof Beor hath said:  The man whose eye is stopped up, hath said:","The hearer of the words of God hath said, who knoweth the\ndoctrine of the Highest, and seeth the visions of the Almighty, who\nfalling hath his eyes opened:","I shall see him, but not now:  I shall behold him, but not near.\nA STAR SHALL RISE out of Jacob and a sceptre shall spring up from\nIsrael:  and shall strike the chiefs of Moab, and shall waste all the\nchildren of Seth","And he shall possess Idumea:  the inheritance of Seir shall come\nto their enemies, but Israel shall do manfully.","Out of Jacob shall he come that shall rule, and shall destroy\nthe remains of the city.","And when he saw Amalec, he took up his parable, and said:  Amalec\nthe beginning of nations, whose latter ends shall be destroyed.","He saw also the Cinite:  and took up his parable, and said:  Thy\nhabitation indeed is strong:  but though thou build thy nest in a rock,","And thou be chosen of the stock of Cin, how long shalt thou be\nable to continue?
