Circumcise yourselves to the Lord your God, and take away the foreskins of your heart, lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it.\" Also Moses himself says:[fn-14-P1443_600547:226-nf] \"In the last days the Lord shall circumcise thine heart to love the Lord thy God.\" Also Jesus[fn-14-P1444_600662:227-nf] the son of Nun, his successor, said: \"And the Lord said unto Jesus, Make thee knives of flint very sharp, and sit and circumcise the children of Israel the second time.\" He said that this second circumcision would be not of the flesh, as the first was, which the Jews practise even now, but of the heart and spirit, which was delivered by Christ, who was the true Jesus. For the prophet does not say, \"And the Lord said unto me,\" but \"unto Jesus,\" that he might show that God was not speaking of him, but of Christ, to whom God was then speaking. For that Jesus represented[fn-14-P1445_601273:228-nf] Christ: for when he was at first called Auses,[fn-14-P1446_601385:229-nf] Moses, foreseeing the future, ordered that he should be called Jesus; that since he had been chosen as the leader of the warfare against Amalek, who was the enemy of the children of Israel, he might both subdue the adversary by the emblem[fn-14-P1447_601953:230-nf] of the name, and lead the people into the land of promise. And for this reason he was also successor to Moses, to show that the new law given by Christ Jesus was about to succeed to the old law which was given by Moses. For that circumcision of the flesh is plainly irrational; since, if God had so willed it, He might so have formed man from the beginning, that he should be without a foreskin. But it was a figure of this second circumcision, signifying that the breast is to be laid bare; that is, that we ought to live with an open and simple heart, since that part of the body which is circumcised has a kind of resemblance to the heart, and is to be treated with reverence. On this account God ordered that it should be laid bare, that by this argument He might admonish us not to have our breast hidden[fn-14-P1448_602929:231-nf] in obscurity; that is, not to veil any shameful deed within the secrets of conscience. This is the circumcision of the heart of which the prophets speak, which God transferred from the mortal flesh to the soul, which alone is about to endure. For being desirous of promoting our life and salvation in accordance with His own goodness, in that circumcision He hath set before us repentance, that if we lay open our hearts,-that is if we confess our sins and make satisfaction to God,-we shall obtain pardon, which is denied to those who are obstinate and conceal their faults, by Him who regards not the outward appearance, as man does, but the innermost secrets of the heart.[fn-14-P1449_603727:232-nf] ","title":"Book IV.

In the course of the appointing of a successor to Moses, Oshea[fn-22-P2284_757007:161-nf] the son of Nun[fn-22-P2285_757051:162-nf] is certainly transferred from his pristine name, and begins to be called Jesus.[fn-22-P2286_757158:163-nf] Certainly, you say. This we first assert to have been a figure of the future. For, because Jesus Christ was to introduce the second people (which is composed of us nations, lingering deserted in the world[fn-22-P2287_757601:164-nf] aforetime) into the land of promise, \"flowing with milk and honey\"[fn-22-P2288_757983:165-nf] (that is, into the possession of eternal life, than which nought is sweeter); and this had to come about, not through Moses (that is, not through the Law's discipline), but through Joshua (that is, through the new law's grace), after our circumcision with \"a knife of rock\"[fn-22-P2289_758306:166-nf] (that is, with Christ's precepts, for Christ is in many ways and figures predicted as a rock[fn-22-P2290_758584:167-nf] ); therefore the man who was being prepared to act as images of this sacrament was inaugurated under the figure of the Lord's name, even so as to be named Jesus.[fn-22-P2291_758781:168-nf] For He who ever spake to Moses was the Son of God Himself; who, too, was always seen.[fn-22-P2292_758888:169-nf] For God the Father none ever saw, and lived.[fn-22-P2293_758961:170-nf] And accordingly it is agreed that the Son of God Himself spake to Moses, and said to the people, \"Behold, I send mine angel before thy\"-that is, the people's-\"face, to guard thee on the march, and to introduce thee into the land which I have prepared thee: attend to him, and be not disobedient to him; for he hath not escaped[fn-22-P2294_759360:171-nf] thy notice, since my name is upon him.\"[fn-22-P2295_759553:172-nf] For Joshua was to introduce the people into the land of promise, not Moses. Now He called him an \"angel,\" on account of the magnitude of the mighty deeds which he was to achieve (which mighty deeds Joshua the son of Nun did, and you yourselves read), and on account of his office of prophet announcing (to wit) the divine will; just as withal the Spirit, speaking in the person of the Father, calls the forerunner of Christ, John, a future \"angel,\" through the prophet: \"Behold, I send mine angel before Thy\"-that is, Christ's-\"face, who shall prepare Thy way before Thee.\"[fn-22-P2296_760153:173-nf] Nor is it a novel practice to the Holy Spirit to call those \"angels\" whom God has appointed as ministers of His power. For the same John is called not merely an \"angel\" of Christ, but withal a \"lamp\" shining before Christ: for David predicts, \"I have prepared the lamp for my Christ; \"[fn-22-P2297_760504:174-nf] and him Christ Himself, coming \"to fulfil the prophets,\"[fn-22-P2298_760606:175-nf] called so to the Jews. \"He was,\" He says, \"the burning and shining lamp; \"[fn-22-P2299_760754:176-nf] as being he who not merely \"prepared His ways in the desert,\"[fn-23-P2300_760874:177-nf] but withal, by pointing out \"the Lamb of God,\"[fn-23-P2301_760983:178-nf] illumined the minds of men by his heralding, so that they understood Him to be that Lamb whom Moses was wont to announce as destined to suffer. Thus, too, (was the son of Nun called) Joshua, on account of the future mystery[fn-23-P2302_761235:179-nf] of his name: for that name (He who spake with Moses) confirmed as His own which Himself had conferred on him, because He had bidden him thenceforth be called, not \"angel\" nor \"Oshea,\" but \"Joshua.\" Thus, therefore, each name is appropriate to the Christ of God-that He should be called Jesus as well (as Christ).","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":13,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_10_book_iii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"54.

Let the Jews say what prophet is meant in this promise of God to Moses: \"I will raise up unto them a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee.\" Many prophets appeared after Moses; but one in particular is here pointed out. The Jews will perhaps naturally think of the successor of Moses, who led into the promised land the people that Moses had brought out of Egypt. Having this successor of Moses in his mind, he may perhaps laugh at me for asking to what prophet the words of the promise refer, since it is recorded who followed Moses in ruling and leading the people. When he has laughed at my ignorance, as Faustus supposes him to do, I will still continue my inquiries, and will desire my laughing opponent to give me a serious answer to the question why Moses changed the name of this successor, who was preferred to himself as the leader of the people into the promised land, to show that the law given by Moses not to save, but to convince the sinner, cannot lead us into heaven, but only the grace and truth which are by Jesus Christ. This successor was called Osea, and Moses gave him the name of Jesus. Why . then did he give him this name when he sent him from the valley of Pharan into the land into which he was to lead the people?[fn-17-P1707_953869:33-nf] The true Jesus says, \"If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself.\"[fn-17-P1708_954004:34-nf] I will ask the Jew if the prophet does not show the prophetical meaning of these things when he says, \"God shall come from Africa, and the Holy One from Pharan.\" Does this not mean that the holy God would come with the name of him whocame from Africa by Pharan, that is, with the name of Jesus? Then, again, it is the Word of God Himself who speaks when He promises to provide this successor to Moses, speaking of him as an angel,-a name commonly given in Scripture to those carrying any message. The words are: \"Behold I send my angel before thy face, to preserve thee in the way, and to bring thee into the land which I have sworn to give thee. Take heed unto him, and obey, and beware of unbelief in him; for he will not take anything from thee wrongfully, for my name is in him.\"[fn-17-P1709_954806:35-nf] Consider these words. Let the Jew, not to speak of the Manichaean, say what other angel he can find in Scripture to whom these words apply, but this leader who was to bring the people into the land of promise. Then let him inquire who it was that succeeded Moses, and brought in the people. He will find that it was Jesus, and that this was not his name at first, but after his name was changed. It follows that He who said, \"My name is in him,\" is the true Jesus, the leader who brings His people into the inheritance of eternal life, according to the New Testament, of which the Old was a figure. No event or action could have a more distinctly prophetical character than this, where the very name is a prediction.
