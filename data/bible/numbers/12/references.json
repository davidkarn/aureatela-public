For for this cause the month Abib was appointed by the law to be the beginning of months, and was made known unto us as the first among the months of the year; both by the ancient writers who lived before, and by the later who lived after the destruction of Jerusalem, it was shown to possess a most clear and evidently definite period, especially because in some places the reaping is early, and sometimes it is late, so as to be sometimes before the time and sometimes after it, as it happened in the very beginning of the giving of the law, before the Passover, according as it is written, \"But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were not grown up.\"[fn-45-P4509_1360713:16-nf] Whence it is rightly prescribed by the law, that from the vernal equinox, in whatsoever week the fourteenth day of the first month shall fall, in it the Passover is to be celebrated, becoming and conformable songs of praise having been first taken up for its celebration.

But after the destruction of the city it was mocked at by some hardening of heart, which we observing, according to the law, with sincerity have received; and in this, according to the Word, when he speaks of the day of our holy festivity, which the election bath attained: but the rest have become hardened,[fn-45-P4513_1362772:20-nf] as said the Scripture; and after other things.","title":"Fragments from the Writings of Peter.","author":"Peter, Bishop of Alexandria"},{"chapter":12,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_16_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_ephesians","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"ANF-01","text":"And pray ye without ceasing in behalf of other men; for there is hope of the repentance, that they may attain to God.

In the course of the appointing of a successor to Moses, Oshea[fn-22-P2284_757007:161-nf] the son of Nun[fn-22-P2285_757051:162-nf] is certainly transferred from his pristine name, and begins to be called Jesus.[fn-22-P2286_757158:163-nf] Certainly, you say. This we first assert to have been a figure of the future. For, because Jesus Christ was to introduce the second people (which is composed of us nations, lingering deserted in the world[fn-22-P2287_757601:164-nf] aforetime) into the land of promise, \"flowing with milk and honey\"[fn-22-P2288_757983:165-nf] (that is, into the possession of eternal life, than which nought is sweeter); and this had to come about, not through Moses (that is, not through the Law's discipline), but through Joshua (that is, through the new law's grace), after our circumcision with \"a knife of rock\"[fn-22-P2289_758306:166-nf] (that is, with Christ's precepts, for Christ is in many ways and figures predicted as a rock[fn-22-P2290_758584:167-nf] ); therefore the man who was being prepared to act as images of this sacrament was inaugurated under the figure of the Lord's name, even so as to be named Jesus.[fn-22-P2291_758781:168-nf] For He who ever spake to Moses was the Son of God Himself; who, too, was always seen.[fn-22-P2292_758888:169-nf] For God the Father none ever saw, and lived.[fn-22-P2293_758961:170-nf] And accordingly it is agreed that the Son of God Himself spake to Moses, and said to the people, \"Behold, I send mine angel before thy\"-that is, the people's-\"face, to guard thee on the march, and to introduce thee into the land which I have prepared thee: attend to him, and be not disobedient to him; for he hath not escaped[fn-22-P2294_759360:171-nf] thy notice, since my name is upon him.\"[fn-22-P2295_759553:172-nf] For Joshua was to introduce the people into the land of promise, not Moses. Now He called him an \"angel,\" on account of the magnitude of the mighty deeds which he was to achieve (which mighty deeds Joshua the son of Nun did, and you yourselves read), and on account of his office of prophet announcing (to wit) the divine will; just as withal the Spirit, speaking in the person of the Father, calls the forerunner of Christ, John, a future \"angel,\" through the prophet: \"Behold, I send mine angel before Thy\"-that is, Christ's-\"face, who shall prepare Thy way before Thee.\"[fn-22-P2296_760153:173-nf] Nor is it a novel practice to the Holy Spirit to call those \"angels\" whom God has appointed as ministers of His power. For the same John is called not merely an \"angel\" of Christ, but withal a \"lamp\" shining before Christ: for David predicts, \"I have prepared the lamp for my Christ; \"[fn-22-P2297_760504:174-nf] and him Christ Himself, coming \"to fulfil the prophets,\"[fn-22-P2298_760606:175-nf] called so to the Jews. \"He was,\" He says, \"the burning and shining lamp; \"[fn-22-P2299_760754:176-nf] as being he who not merely \"prepared His ways in the desert,\"[fn-23-P2300_760874:177-nf] but withal, by pointing out \"the Lamb of God,\"[fn-23-P2301_760983:178-nf] illumined the minds of men by his heralding, so that they understood Him to be that Lamb whom Moses was wont to announce as destined to suffer. Thus, too, (was the son of Nun called) Joshua, on account of the future mystery[fn-23-P2302_761235:179-nf] of his name: for that name (He who spake with Moses) confirmed as His own which Himself had conferred on him, because He had bidden him thenceforth be called, not \"angel\" nor \"Oshea,\" but \"Joshua.\" Thus, therefore, each name is appropriate to the Christ of God-that He should be called Jesus as well (as Christ).","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":12,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_12_book_vii_","source_chapter":43,"source_paragraph":"188","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"For these reasons the emperor had the highest esteem for Proclus.

Carpocrates also makes equally good use of it, who was a magician and a fornicator like yourself, only he had not a Helen.[fn-29-P2912_1021636:239-nf] And why should he not? since he asserted that souls are reinvested with bodies, in order to ensure the overthrow by all means of divine and human truth. For, (according to his miserable doctrine, ) this life became consummated to no man until all those blemishes which are held to disfigure it have been fully displayed in its conduct; because there is nothing which is accounted evil by nature, but simply as men think of it. The transmigration of human souls, therefore, into any kind of heterogeneous bodies, he thought by all means indispensable, whenever any depravity whatever had not been fully perpetrated in the early stage of life's passage. Evil deeds (one may be sure) appertain to life. Moreover, as often as the soul has fallen short as a defaulter in sin, it has to be recalled to existence, until it \"pays the utmost farthing,\"[fn-29-P2913_1022565:240-nf] thrust out from time to time into the prison of the body. To this effect does he tamper with the whole of that allegory of the Lord which is extremely clear and simple in its meaning, and ought to be from the first understood in its plain and natural sense. Thus our \"adversary\" (therein mentioned[fn-29-P2914_1022883:241-nf] ) is the heathen man, who is walking with us along the same road of life which is common to him and ourselves. Now \"we must needs go out of the world,\"[fn-29-P2915_1023051:242-nf] if it be not allowed us to have conversation with them. He bids us, therefore, show a kindly disposition to such a man. \"Love your enemies,\" says He, \"pray for them that curse you,\"[fn-29-P2916_1023254:243-nf] lest such a man in any transaction of business be irritated by any unjust conduct of yours, and \"deliver thee to the judge\" of his own (nation[fn-29-P2917_1023417:244-nf] ), and you be thrown into prison, and be detained in its close and narrow cell until you have liquidated all your debt against him.[fn-29-P2918_1023569:245-nf] Then, again, should you be disposed to apply the term \"adversary\" to the devil, you are advised by the (Lord's) injunction, while you are in the way with him,\" to make even with him such a compact as may be deemed compatible with the requirements of your true faith. Now the compact you have made respecting him is to renounce him, and his pomp, and his angels. Such is your agreement in this matter. Now the friendly understanding you will have to carry out must arise from your observance of the compact: you must never think of getting back any of the things which you have abjured, and have restored to him, lest he should summon you as a fraudulent man, and a transgressor of your agreement, before God the Judge (for in this light do we read of him, in another passage, as \"the accuser of the brethren,\"[fn-29-P2919_1024395:246-nf] or saints, where reference is made to the actual practice of legal prosecution); and lest this Judge deliver you over to the angel who is to execute the sentence, and he commit you to the prison of hell, out of which there will be no dismissal until the smallest even of your delinquencies be paid off in the period before the resurrection.[fn-29-P2920_1024757:247-nf] What can be a more fitting sense than this? What a truer interpretation? If, however, according to Carpocrates, the soul is bound to the commission of all sorts of crime and evil conduct, what must we from his system understand to be its \"adversary\" and foe? I suppose it must be that better mind which shall compel it by force to the performance of some act of virtue, that it may be driven from body to body, until it be found in none a debtor to the claims of a virtuous life. This means, that a good tree is known by its bad fruit-in other words, that the doctrine of truth is understood from the worst possible precepts. I apprehend[fn-29-P2921_1025621:248-nf] that heretics of this school seize with especial avidity the example of Elias, whom they assume to have been so reproduced in John (the Baptist) as to make our Lord's statement sponsor for their theory of transmigration, when He said, \"Elias is come already, and they knew him not; \"[fn-29-P2922_1025919:249-nf] and again, in another passage, \"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.\"[fn-29-P2923_1026040:250-nf] Well, then, was it really in a Pythagorean sense that the Jews approached John with the inquiry, \"Art thou Elias? \"[fn-29-P2924_1026177:251-nf] and not rather in the sense of the divine prediction, \"Behold, I will send you Elijah\" the Tisbite?[fn-29-P2925_1026297:252-nf] The fact, however, is, that their metempsychosis, or transmigration theory, signifies the recall of the soul which had died long before, and its return to some other body. But Elias is to come again, not after quitting life (in the way of dying), but after his translation (or removal without dying); not for the purpose of being restored to the body, from which he had not departed, but for the purpose of revisiting the world from which he was translated; not by way of resuming a life which he had laid aside, but of fulfilling prophecy,-really and truly the same man, both in respect of his name and designation, as well as of his unchanged humanity. How, therefore could John be Elias? You have your answer in the angel's announcement: \"And he shall go before the people,\" says he, \"in the spirit and power of Elias\"-not (observe) in his soul and his body. These substances are, in fact, the natural property of each individual; whilst \"the spirit and power\" are bestowed as external gifts by the grace of God and so may be transferred to another person according to the purpose and will of the Almighty, as was anciently the case with respect to the spirit of Moses.[fn-29-P2926_1027489:253-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":12,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_17_homily_x_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Well, then, let us speak to you to-day from the Old Testament.

Why then, swearing is a sin. For such in truth is the soul; full of all these ulcers, all these scars. But you do not see them? Yes, this is the mischief of it; and yet you might see if you wished; for God has given you eyes.

This, to be sure,[fn-61-P6139_1837638:838-nf] was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him\"[fn-61-P6140_1837814:839-nf] -Him, that is, not Moses or Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of Moses and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must have forbidden all[fn-61-P6141_1838040:840-nf] others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he prohibited those whom he did display? Now, even if their presence was necessary, they surely should not be represented as conversing together, which is a sign of familiarity; nor as associated in glory with him, for this indicates respect and graciousness; but they should be shown in some slough[fn-61-P6142_1838493:841-nf] as a sure token of their ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was sent to disperse, far removed from the glory of Him who was about to sever their words and writings from His gospel. This, then, is the way[fn-61-P6143_1838751:842-nf] how he demonstrates them to be aliens,[fn-61-P6144_1838802:843-nf] even by keeping them in his own company! This is how he shows they ought to be relinquished: he associates them with himself instead! This is how he destroys them: he irradiates them with his glory! How would their own Christ act? I suppose He would have imitated the frowardness (of heresy),[fn-61-P6145_1839128:844-nf] and revealed them just as Marcion's Christ was bound to do, or at least as having with Him any others rather than His own prophets! But what could so well befit the Creator's Christ, as to manifest Him in the company of His own foreannouncers?[fn-61-P6146_1839403:845-nf] -to let Him be seen with those to whom He had appeared in revelations?-to let Him be speaking with those who had spoken of Him?-to share His glory with those by whom He used to be called the Lord of glory; even with those chief servants of His, one of whom was once the moulder[fn-61-P6147_1839703:846-nf] of His people, the other afterwards the reformer[fn-61-P6148_1839810:847-nf] thereof; one the initiator of the Old Testament, the other the consummator[fn-61-P6149_1839930:848-nf] of the New? Well therefore does Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble connection with Him, suggest an expedient: \"It is good for us to be here\" (good: that evidently means to be where Moses and Elias are); \"and let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. But he knew not what he said.\"[fn-61-P6150_1840483:849-nf] How knew not? Was his ignorance the result of simple error? Or was it on the principle which we maintain[fn-61-P6151_1840608:850-nf] in the cause of the new prophecy,[fn-61-P6152_1840959:851-nf] that to grace ecstasy or rapture[fn-61-P6153_1841018:852-nf] is incident. For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, especially when he beholds the glory of God, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily loses his sensation,[fn-61-P6154_1841199:853-nf] because he is overshadowed with the power of God,-a point concerning which there is a question between us and the carnally-minded.[fn-61-P6155_1841352:854-nf] Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture[fn-61-P6156_1842177:855-nf] of Peter. For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the law forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the Spirit? And therefore, because it was in the Spirit that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not know what he had said. But if, on the other hand,[fn-61-P6157_1842594:856-nf] he was thus ignorant, because he erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, \"Whom they thought Him to be,\" meant the Creator's Christ, when he answered, \"Thou art the Christ; \"because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival god, he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in error here because of his previous erroneous opinion,[fn-61-P6158_1843038:857-nf] then you may be sure that up to that very day no new divinity had been revealed by Christ, and that Peter had so far made no mistake, because hitherto Christ had revealed nothing of the kind; and that Christ accordingly was not to be regarded as belonging to any other than the Creator, whose entire dispensation[fn-61-P6159_1843388:858-nf] he, in fact, here described. He selects from His disciples three witnesses of the impending vision and voice. And this is just the way of the Creator. \"In the mouth of three witnesses,\" says He, \"shall every word be established.\"[fn-61-P6160_1843707:859-nf] He withdraws to a mountain. In the nature of the place I see much meaning. For the Creator had originally formed His ancient people on a mountain both with visible glory and His voice. It was only tight that the New Testament should be attested[fn-61-P6161_1843999:860-nf] on such an elevated spot[fn-61-P6162_1844043:861-nf] as that whereon the Old Testament had been composed;[fn-61-P6163_1844119:862-nf] under a like covering of cloud also, which nobody will doubt, was condensed out of the Creator's air. Unless, indeed, he[fn-61-P6164_1844267:863-nf] had brought down his own clouds thither, because he had himself forced his way through the Creator's heaven;[fn-61-P6165_1844398:864-nf] or else it was only a precarious cloud,[fn-61-P6166_1844500:865-nf] as it were, of the Creator which he used. On the present (as also on the former)[fn-61-P6167_1844705:866-nf] occasion, therefore, the cloud was not silent; but there was the accustomed voice from heaven, and the Father's testimony to the Son; precisely as in the first Psalm He had said, \"Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.\"[fn-61-P6168_1844948:867-nf] By the mouth of Isaiah also He had asked concerning Him, \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6169_1845101:868-nf] When therefore He here presents Him with the words, \"This is my (beloved) Son,\" this clause is of course understood, \"whom I have promised.\" For if He once promised, and then afterwards says, \"This is He,\" it is suitable conduct for one who accomplishes His purpose[fn-61-P6170_1845415:869-nf] that He should utter His voice in proof of the promise which He had formerly made; but unsuitable in one who is amenable to the retort, Can you, indeed, have a right to say, \"This is my son,\" concerning whom you have given us no previous information,[fn-61-P6171_1845694:870-nf] any more than you have favoured us with a revelation about your own prior existence? \"Hear ye Him,\" therefore, whom from the beginning (the Creator) had declared entitled to be heard in the name of a prophet, since it was as a prophet that He had to be regarded by the people. \"A prophet,\" says Moses, \"shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your sons\" (that is, of course, after a carnal descent[fn-61-P6172_1846178:871-nf] ); \"unto Him shall ye hearken, as unto me.\"[fn-61-P6173_1846264:872-nf] \"Every one who will not hearken unto Him, his soul[fn-61-P6174_1846339:873-nf] shall be cut off from amongst his people.\"[fn-61-P6175_1846402:874-nf] , So also Isaiah: \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6176_1846522:875-nf] This voice the Father was going Himself to recommend. For, says he,[fn-61-P6177_1846609:876-nf] He establishes the words of His Son, when He says, \"This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.\" Therefore, even if there be made a transfer of the obedient \"heating\" from Moses and Elias to[fn-61-P6178_1847561:877-nf] Christ, it is still not from[fn-61-P6179_1847684:878-nf] another God, or to another Christ; but from\" the Creator to His Christ, in consequence of the departure of the old covenant and the supervening of the new. \"Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but He Himself,\" says Isaiah, \"shall save them; \"[fn-61-P6180_1847960:879-nf] for it is He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law and the prophets. The Father gave to the Son new disciples,[fn-61-P6181_1848177:880-nf] after that Moses and Elias had been exhibited along with Him in the honour of His glory, and had then been dismissed as having fully discharged their duty and office, for the express purpose of affirming for Marcion's information the fact that Moses and Elias had a share in even the glory of Christ. But we have the entire structure[fn-61-P6182_1848541:881-nf] of this same vision in Habakkuk also, where the Spirit in the person of some[fn-61-P6183_1848634:882-nf] of the apostles says, \"O Lord, I have heard Thy speech, and was afraid.\" What speech was this, other than the words of the voice from heaven, This is my beloved Son, hear ye, Him? \"I considered thy works, and was astonished.\" When could this have better happened than when Peter, on seeing His glory, knew not what he was saying? \"In the midst of the two Thou shalt be known\"-even Moses and Elias.[fn-61-P6184_1849050:883-nf] These likewise did Zechariah see under the figure of the two olive trees and olive branches.[fn-61-P6185_1849261:884-nf] For these are they of whom he says, \"They are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.\" And again Habakkuk says, \"His glory covered the heavens\" (that is, with that cloud), \"and His splendour shall be like the light-even the light, wherewith His very raiment glistened.\" And if we would make mention of[fn-61-P6186_1849613:885-nf] the promise to Moses, we shall find it accomplished here. For when Moses desired to see the Lord, saying, \"If therefore I have found grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself to me, that I may see Thee distinctly,\"[fn-61-P6187_1849874:886-nf] the sight which he desired to have was of that condition which he was to assume as man, and which as a prophet he knew was to occur. Respecting the face of God, however, he had already heard, \"No man shall see me, and live.\" \"This thing,\" said He, \"which thou hast spoken, will I do unto thee.\" Then Moses said, \"Show me Thy glory.\" And the Lord, with like reference to the future, replied, \"I will pass before thee in my glory,\" etc. Then at the last He says, \"And then thou shall see my back.\"[fn-61-P6188_1850423:887-nf] Not loins, or calves of the legs, did he want to behold, but the glory which was to be revealed in the latter days.[fn-61-P6189_1850569:888-nf] He had promised that He would make Himself thus face to face visible to him, when He said to Aaron, \"If there shall be a prophet among you, I will make myself known to him by vision, and by vision will I speak with him; but not so is my manner to Moses; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently\" (that is to say, in the form of man which He was to assume), \"and not in dark speeches.\"[fn-61-P6190_1851193:889-nf] Now, although Marcion has denied[fn-61-P6191_1851248:890-nf] that he is here represented as speaking with the Lord, but only as standing, yet, inasmuch as he stood \"mouth to mouth,\" he must also have stood \"face to face\" with him, to use his words,[fn-61-P6192_1851451:891-nf] not far from him, in His very glory-not to say,[fn-61-P6193_1851553:892-nf] in His presence. And with this glory he went away enlightened from Christ, just as he used to do from the Creator; as then to dazzle the eyes of the children of Israel, so now to smite those of the blinded Marcion, who has failed to see how this argument also makes against him.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":12,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Moreover, there comes to our aid, when we insist upon the Father and the Son as being Two, that regulating principle which has determined God to be invisible. When Moses in Egypt desired to see the face of the Lord, saying, \"If therefore I have found grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself unto me, that I may see Thee and know Thee,\"[fn-105-P10573_2968798:154-nf] God said, \"Thou canst not see my face; for there shall no man see me, and live: \"[fn-105-P10574_2968903:155-nf] in other words, he who sees me shall die. Now we find that God has been seen by many persons, and yet that no one who saw Him died (at the sight). The truth is, they saw God according to the faculties of men, but not in accordance with the full glory of the Godhead. For the patriarchs are said to have seen God (as Abraham and Jacob), and the prophets (as, for instance Isaiah and Ezekiel), and yet they did not die. Either, then, they ought to have died, since they had seen Him-for (the sentence runs), \"No man shall see God, and live ; \"or else if they saw God, and yet did not die, the Scripture is false in stating that God said, \"If a man see my face, he shall not live.\" Either way, the Scripture misleads us, when it makes God invisible, and when it produces Him to our sight. Now, then, He must be a different Being who was seen, because of one who was seen it could not be predicated that He is invisible. It will therefore follow, that by Him who is invisible we must understand the Father in the fulness of His majesty, while we recognise the Son as visible by reason of the dispensation of His derived existence;[fn-105-P10575_2970046:156-nf] even as it is not permitted us to contemplate, the sun, in the full amount of his substance which is in the heavens, but we can only endure with our eyes a ray, by reason of the tempered condition of this portion which is projected from him to the earth. Here some one on the other side may be disposed to contend that the Son is also invisible as being the Word, and as being also the Spirit;[fn-105-P10576_2970472:157-nf] and, while claiming one nature for the Father and the Son, to affirm that the Father is rather One and the Same Person with the Son. But the Scripture, as we have said, maintains their difference by the distinction it makes between the Visible and the Invisible. They then go on to argue to this effect, that if it was the Son who then spake to Moses, He must mean it of Himself that His face was visible to no one, because He was Himself indeed the invisible Father in the name of the Son. And by this means they will have it that the Visible and the Invisible are one and the same, just as the Father and the Son are the same; (and this they maintain) because in a preceding passage, before He had refused (the sight of) His face to Moses, the Scripture informs us that \"the Lord spake face to face with Moses, even as a man speaketh unto his friend; \"[fn-105-P10577_2971380:158-nf] just as Jacob also says, \"I have seen God face to face.\"[fn-105-P10578_2971460:159-nf] Therefore the Visible and the Invisible are one and the same; and both being thus the same, it follows that He is invisible as the Father, and visible as the Son. As if the Scripture, according to our exposition of it, were inapplicable to the Son, when the Father is set aside in His own invisibility. We declare, however, that the Son also, considered in Himself (as the Son), is invisible, in that He is God, and the Word and Spirit of God; but that He was visible before the days of His flesh, in the way that He says to Aaron and Miriam, \"And if there shall be a prophet amongst you, I will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream; not as with Moses, with whom I shall speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, that is to say, in truth, and not enigmatically\" that is to say, in image;[fn-105-P10579_2972302:160-nf] as the apostle also expresses it, \"Now we see through a glass, darkly (or enigmatically), but then face to face.\"[fn-105-P10580_2972438:161-nf] Since, therefore, He reserves to some future time His presence and speech face to face with Moses-a promise which was afterwards fulfilled in the retirement of the mount (of transfiguration), when as we read in the Gospel,\" Moses appeared talking with Jesus\"[fn-105-P10581_2972721:162-nf] -it is evident that in early times it was always in a glass, (as it were, )and an enigma, in vision and dream, that God, I mean the Son of God, appeared-to the prophets and the patriarchs, as also to Moses indeed himself. And even if the Lord did possibly[fn-105-P10582_2973011:163-nf] speak with him face to face, yet it was not as man that he could behold His face, unless indeed it was in a glass, (as it were, ) and by enigma. Besides, if the Lord so spake with Moses, that Moses actually discerned His face, eye to eye,[fn-105-P10583_2973267:164-nf] how comes it to pass that immediately afterwards, on the same occasion, he desires to see His face,[fn-105-P10584_2973391:165-nf] which he ought not to have desired, because he had already seen it? And how, in like manner, does the Lord also Say that His face cannot be seen, because He had shown it, if indeed He really had, (as our opponents suppose.) Or what is that fade of God, the sight of which is refused, if there was one which was visible to man? \"I have seen God,\" says Jacob, \"face to face, and my life is preserved.\"[fn-105-P10585_2973840:166-nf] There ought to be some other face which kills if it be only seen. Well, then, was the Son visible? (Certainly not,[fn-105-P10586_2973973:167-nf] ) although He was the face of God, except only in vision and dream, and in a glass and enigma, because the Word and Spirit (of God) cannot be seen except in an imaginary form. But, (they say, ) He calls the invisible Father His face. For who is the Father? Must He not be the face of the Son, by reason of that authority which He obtains as the begotten of the Father? For is there not a natural propriety in saying of some personage greater (than yourself), That man is my face; he gives me his countenance? \"My Father,\"says Christ, \"is greater than I.\"[fn-105-P10587_2974560:168-nf] Therefore the Father must be the face of the Son. For what does the Scripture say? \"The Spirit of His person is Christ the Lord.\"[fn-105-P10588_2974711:169-nf] As therefore Christ is the Spirit of the Father's person, there is good reason why, in virtue indeed of the unity, the Spirit of Him to whose person He belonged-that is to say, the Father-pronounced Him to be His \"face.\" Now this, to be sure, is an astonishing thing, that the Father can be taken to be the face of the Son, when He is His head; for \"the head of Christ is God.\"[fn-105-P10589_2975553:170-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":12,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§3.
