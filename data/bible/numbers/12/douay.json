{"verses":["And Mary and Aaron spoke against Moses, because of his wife the\nEthiopian,","And they said:  Hath the Lord spoken by Moses only?  Hath he not\nalso spoken to us in like manner?  And when the Lord heard this,","(For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon\nearth)","Immediately he spoke to him, and to Aaron and Mary:  Come out you\nthree only to the tabernacle of the covenant.  And when they were come\nout,","The Lord came down in a pillar of the cloud, and stood in the\nentry of the tabernacle calling to Aaron and Mary.  And when they were\ncome,","He said to them:  Hear my words:  if there be among you a prophet\nof the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him\nin a dream.","But it is not so with my servant Moses who is most faithful in\nall my house:","For I speak to him mouth to mouth:  and plainly, and not by\nriddles and figures doth he see the Lord.  Why then were you not afraid\nto speak ill of my servant Moses?","And being angry with them he went away:","The cloud also that was over the tabernacle departed:  and behold\nMary appeared white as snow with a leprosy.  And when Aaron had looked\non her, and saw her all covered with leprosy,","He said to Moses:  I beseech thee, my lord, lay not upon us this\nsin, which we have foolishly committed:","Let her not be as one dead, and as an abortive that is cast\nforth from the mother's womb.  Lo, now one half of her flesh is consumed\nwith the leprosy.","And Moses cried to the Lord, saying O God, I beseech thee heal\nher.","And the Lord answered him:  If her father had spitten upon her\nface, ought she not to have been ashamed for seven days at least?  Let\nher be separated seven days without the camp, and afterwards she shall\nbe called again.","Mary therefore was put out of the camp seven days:  and the\npeople moved not from that place until Mary was called again."]}
