{"verses":["And the Lord said to Aaron:  Thou, and thy sons, and thy father's\nhouse with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary:  and thou and\nthy sons with thee shall bear the sins of your priesthood.","And take with thee thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, and\nthe sceptre of thy father, and let them be ready in hand, and minister\nto thee:  but thou and thy sons shall minister in the tabernacle of the\ntestimony.","And the Levites shall watch to do thy commands, and about all the\nworks of the tabernacle:  only they shall not come nigh the vessels of\nthe sanctuary nor the altar, lest both they die, and you also perish\nwith them.","But let them be with thee, and watch in the charge of the\ntabernacle, and in all the ceremonies thereof.  A stranger shall not\njoin himself with you.","Watch ye in the charge of the sanctuary, and in the ministry of\nthe altar:  lest indignation rise upon the children of Israel.","I have given you your brethren the Levites from among the\nchildren of Israel, and have delivered them for a gift to the Lord, to\nserve in the ministries of the tabernacle.","But thou and thy sons look ye to the priesthood:  and all things\nthat pertain to the service of the altar, and that are within the veil,\nshall be executed by the priests.  If any stranger shall approach, he\nshall be slain.","And the Lord said to Aaron:  Behold I have given thee the charge\nof my firstfruits.  All things that are sanctified by the children of\nIsrael, I have delivered to thee and to thy sons for the priestly\noffice, by everlasting ordinances.","These therefore shalt thou take of the things that are\nsanctified, and are offered to the Lord.  Every offering, and sacrifice,\nand whatsoever is rendered to me for sin and for trespass, and becometh\nholy of holies, shall be for thee and thy sons.","Thou shalt eat it in the sanctuary:  the males only shall eat\nthereof, because it is a consecrated thing to thee.","But the firstfruits, which the children of Israel shall vow and\noffer, I have given to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters, by\na perpetual law.  He that is clean in thy house, shall eat them.","All the best of the oil, and of the wine, and of the corn,\nwhatsoever firstfruits they offer to the Lord, I have given them to\nthee.","All the firstripe of the fruits, that the ground bringeth forth,\nand which are brought to the Lord, shall be for thy use:  he that is\nclean in thy house, shall eat them.","Every thing that the children of Israel shall give by vow, shall\nbe thine.","Whatsoever is firstborn of all flesh, which they offer to the\nLord, whether it be of men, or of beasts, shall belong to thee:  only\nfor the firstborn of man thou shalt take a price, and every beast that\nis unclean thou shalt cause to be redeemed,","And the redemption of it shall be after one month, for five\nsicles of silver, by the weight of the sanctuary.  A sicle hath twenty\nobols.","But the firstling of a cow, and of a sheep and of a goat thou\nshalt not cause to be redeemed, because they are sanctified to the\nLord.  Their blood only thou shalt pour upon the altar, and their fat\nthou shalt burn for a most sweet odour to the Lord.","But the flesh shall fall to thy use, as the consecrated breast,\nand the right shoulder shall be thine.","All the firstfruits of the sanctuary which the children of\nIsrael offer to the Lord, I have given to thee and to thy sons and\ndaughters, by a perpetual ordinance.  It is a covenant of salt for ever\nbefore the Lord, to thee and to thy sons.","And the Lord said to Aaron:  You shall possess nothing in their\nland, neither shall you have a portion among them:  I am thy portion and\ninheritance in the midst of the children of Israel.","And I have given to the sons of Levi all the tithes of Israel\nfor a possession, for the ministry wherewith they serve me in the\ntabernacle of the covenant:","That the children of Israel may not approach any more to the\ntabernacle, nor commit deadly sin,","But only the sons of Levi may serve me in the tabernacle, and\nbear the sins of the people.  It shall be an everlasting ordinance in\nyour generations.  They shall not possess any other thing,","But be content with the oblation or tithes, which I have\nseparated for their uses and necessities.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Command the Levites, and declare unto them:  When you shall\nreceive of the children of Israel the tithes, which I have given you,\noffer the firstfruits of them to the Lord, that is to say, the tenth\npart of the tenth:","That it may be reckoned to you as an oblation of firstfruits, as\nwell of the barnfloors as of the winepresses:","And of all the things of which you receive tithes, offer the\nfirstfruits to the Lord, and give them to Aaron the priest.","All the things that you shall offer of the tithes, and shall\nseparate for the gifts of the Lord, shall be the best and choicest\nthings.","And thou shalt say to them:  If you offer all the goodly and the\nbetter things of the tithes, it shall be reckoned to you as if you had\ngiven the firstfruits of the barnfloor and the winepress:","And you shall eat them in all your places, both you and your\nfamilies:  because it is your reward for the ministry, wherewith you\nserve in the tabernacle of the testimony.","And you shall not sin in this point, by reserving the choicest\nand fat things to yourselves, lest you profane the oblations of the\nchildren of Israel, and die."]}
