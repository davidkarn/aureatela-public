{"verses":["And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:  When\na man, or woman, shall make a vow to be sanctified, and will consecrate\nthemselves to the Lord:","They shall abstain from wine, and from every thing that may make a\nman drunk.  They shall not drink vinegar of wine, or of any other drink,\nnor any thing that is pressed out of the grape:  nor shall they eat\ngrapes either fresh or dried.","All the days that they are consecrated to the Lord by vow:  they\nshall eat nothing that cometh of the vineyard, from the raisin even to\nthe kernel.","All the time of his separation no razor shall pass over his head,\nuntil the day be fulfilled of his consecration to the Lord.  He shall be\nholy, and shall let the hair of his head grow.","All the time of his consecration he shall not go in to any dead,","Neither shall he make himself unclean, even for his father, or for\nhis mother, or for his brother, or for his sister, when they die,\nbecause the consecration of his God is upon his head.","All the days of his separation he shall be holy to the Lord.","But if any man die suddenly before him:  the head of his\nconsecration shall be defiled:  and he shall shave it forthwith on the\nsame day of his purification, and again on the seventh day.","And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young\npigeons to the priest in the entry of the covenant of the testimony.","And the priest shall offer one for sin, and the other for a\nholocaust, and shall pray for him, for that he hath sinned by the dead:\nand he shall sanctify his head that day:","And shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his separation,\noffering a lamb of one year for sin:  yet so that the former days be\nmade void, because his sanctification was profaned.","This is the law of consecration.  When the days which he had\ndetermined by vow shall be expired, he shall bring him to the door of\nthe tabernacle of the covenant,","And shall offer his oblation to the Lord:  one he lamb of a year\nold without blemish for a holocaust, and one ewe lamb of a year old\nwithout blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for a\nvictim of peace offering,","A basket also of unleavened bread, tempered with oil, and wafers\nwithout leaven anointed with oil, and the libations of each:","And the priest shall present them before the Lord, and shall\noffer both the sin offering and the holocaust.","But the ram he shall immolate for a sacrifice of peace offering\nto the Lord, offering at the same time the basket of unleavened bread,\nand the libations that are due by custom.","Then shall the hair of the consecration of the Nazarite, be\nshaved off before the door of the tabernacle of the covenant:  and he\nshall take his hair, and lay it upon the fire, which is under the\nsacrifice of the peace offerings.","And shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened\ncake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and he shall deliver\nthem into the hands of the Nazarite, after his head is shaven.","And receiving them again from him, he shall elevate them in the\nsight of the Lord:  and they being sanctified shall belong to the\npriest, as the breast, which was commanded to be separated, and the\nshoulder.  After this the Nazarite may drink wine.","This is the law of the Nazarite, when he hath vowed his oblation\nto the Lord in the time of his consecration, besides those things which\nhis hand shall find, according to that which he had vowed in his mind,\nso shall he do for the fulfilling of his sanctification.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Say to Aaron and his sons:  Thus shall you bless the children of\nIsrael, and you shall say to them:","The Lord bless thee, and keep thee.","The Lord shew his face to thee, and have mercy on thee.","The Lord turn his countenance to thee, and give thee peace.","And they shall invoke my name upon the children of Israel, and I\nwill bless them."]}
