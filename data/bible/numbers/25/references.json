Why is it that you disregard your own scars and try to defame others? Why is it that when I give you the best advice you attack me like a madman? It may be that I am as infamous as you publicly proclaim; in that case you can at least repent as heartily as I do. It may be that I am as great a sinner as you make me out; if so, you can at least imitate a sinner's tears. Are my sins your virtues? Or does it alleviate your misery that many are in the same plight as yourself? Let a few tears fall on the silk and fine linen which make you so resplendent. Realize that you: are naked, torn, unclean, a beggar.[fn-56-P5609_1570416:3986-nf] It is never too late to repent.[fn-56-P5610_1570471:3987-nf] You may have gone down from Jerusalem and may have been wounded on the way; yet the Samaritan will set you upon his beast, and will bring you to the inn and will take care of you.[fn-56-P5611_1570695:3988-nf] Even if you are lying in your grave, the Lord will raise you though your flesh may stink.[fn-56-P5612_1570809:3989-nf] At least imitate those blind men for whose sake the Saviour left His home and heritage and came to Jericho.

She whom Satan had bound for eighteen years came to the Saviour; and being cured by Him was made straight so that she could once more look up towards heaven.[fn-56-P5618_1572112:3995-nf] God says to you what He said to Cain: \"Thou hast sinned: hold thy peace.\"[fn-56-P5619_1572213:3996-nf] Why do you flee from the face of God and dwell in the land of Nod?

The blood of Naboth[fn-56-P5623_1572903:4000-nf] cries out against you. The vineyard also of Jezreel, that is, of God'sseed, demands due vengeance upon you, seeing that you have turned it into a garden of pleasures and made it a seed-bed of lust. God sends you an Elijah to tell you of torment and of death. Bow yourself down therefore and put on sackcloth for a little while; then perhaps the Lord will say of you what He said of Ahab: \"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me?

King Asa also conquered the Accursed-of-life, when he wished to come in against\nhim, through his mother.[fn-42-P4228_1399181:61-nf] For Asa knew his\ncraftiness and removed his mother from her high estate, and cut in pieces her idol and cast it down.\nJohn was greater than all the prophets, yet Herod slew him because of the dancing of a daughter of\nEve.[fn-42-P4229_1399425:62-nf] Haman was wealthy and third in honour\nfrom the King, yet his wife counselled him to destroy the Jews.[fn-42-P4230_1399558:63-nf] Zimri was head of the tribe of Simeon, yet Cozbi,\ndaughter of the chiefs of Midian, overthrew him, and because of one woman twenty-four thousand of\nIsrael fell in one day.[fn-42-P4231_1399749:64-nf] ","title":"Letter of an Inquirer.","author":"Aphrahat"},{"chapter":25,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_42_on_the_baptism_of_christ","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Therefore, also, it is that after the dignity of adoption the devil plots more vehemently against us, pining away with envious glance, when he beholds the beauty of the new-born man, earnestly tending towards that heavenly city, from which he fell: and he raises up against us fiery temptations, seeking earnestly to despoil us of that second adornment, as he did of our former array.
