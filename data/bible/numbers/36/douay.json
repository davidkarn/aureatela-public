{"verses":["And the princes of the families of Galaad, the son of Machir, the\nson of Manasses, of the stock of the children of Joseph, came and spoke\nto Moses before the princes of Israel, and said:","The Lord hath commanded thee, my lord, that thou shouldst divide\nthe land by lot to the children of Israel, and that thou shouldst give\nto the daughters of Salphaad our brother the possession due to their\nfather:","Now if men of another tribe take them to wives, their possession\nwill follow them, and being transferred to another tribe, will be a\ndiminishing of our inheritance.","And so it shall come to pass, that when the jubilee, the is, the\nfiftieth year of remission, is come, the distribution made by the lots\nshall be confounded, and the possession of the one shall pass to the\nothers.","Moses answered the children of Israel, and said by the command of\nthe Lord:  The tribe of the children of Joseph hath spoken rightly.","And this is the law promulgated by the Lord touching the\ndaughters of Salphaad:  Let them marry to whom they will, only so that\nit be to men of their own tribe.","Lest the possession of the children of Israel be mingled from\ntribe to tribe.  For all men shall marry wives of their own tribe and\nkindred:","And all women shall take husbands of the same tribe:  that the\ninheritance may remain in the families.","And that the tribes be not mingled one with another, but remain\nso","As they were separated by the Lord.  And the daughters of\nSalphaad did as was commanded:","And Maala, and Thersa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Noa were\nmarried to the sons of their uncle by their father","Of the family of Manasses, who was the son of Joseph:  and the\npossession that had been allotted to them, remained in the tribe and\nfamily of their father.","These are the commandments and judgment, which the Lord\ncommanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel, in the plains\nof Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho."]}
