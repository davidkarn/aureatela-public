{"verses":["And the children of Israel, and all the multitude came into the\ndesert of Sin, in the first month:  and the people abode in Cades.  And\nMary died there, and was buried in the same place.","And the people wanting water, came together against Moses and\nAaron:","And making a sedition, they said:  Would God we had perished among\nour brethren before the Lord.","Why have you brought out the church of the Lord into the\nwilderness, that both we and our cattle should die?","Why have you made us come up out of Egypt, and have brought us\ninto this wretched place which cannot be sowed, nor bringeth forth\nfigs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there any water to drink?","And Moses and Aaron leaving the multitude, went into the\ntabernacle of the covenant, and fell flat upon the ground, and cried to\nthe Lord, and said.  O Lord God, hear the cry of this people, and open\nto them thy treasure, a fountain of living water, that being satisfied,\nthey may cease to murmur.  And the glory of the Lord appeared over them.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Take the rod, and assemble the people together, thou and Aaron\nthy brother, and speak to the rock before them, and it shall yield\nwaters.  And when thou hast brought forth water out of the rock, all the\nmultitude and their cattle shall drink.","Moses therefore took the rod, which was before the Lord, as he\nhad commanded him,","And having gathered together the multitude before the rock, he\nsaid to them:  Hear, ye rebellious and incredulous:  Can we bring you\nforth water out of this rock?","And when Moses bad lifted up his hand, and struck the rock twice\nwith the rod, there came forth water in great abundance, so that the\npeople and their cattle drank,","And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron:  Because you have not\nbelieved me, to sanctify me before the children of Israel, you shall\nnot bring these people into the land, which I will give them.","This is the Water of contradiction, where the children of Israel\nstrove with words against the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.","In the mean time Moses sent messengers from Cades to the king of\nEdom, to say:  Thus saith thy brother Israel:  Thou knowest all the\nlabour that hath come upon us:","In what manner our fathers went down into Egypt, and there we\ndwelt a long time, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers.","And how we cried to the Lord, and he heard us, and sent an\nangel, who hath brought us out of Egypt.  Lo, we are now in the city of\nCades, which is in the uttermost of thy borders,","And we beseech thee that we may have leave to pass through thy\ncountry.  We will not go through the fields, nor through the vineyards,\nwe will not drink the waters of thy wells, but we will go by the common\nhighway, neither turning aside to the right hand, nor to the left, till\nwe are past thy borders.","And Edom answered them:  Thou shalt not pass by me:  if thou dost\nI will come out armed against thee.","And the children of Israel said:  We will go by the beaten way:\nand if we and our cattle drink of thy waters, we will give thee what is\njust:  there shall be no difficulty in the price, only let us pass\nspeedily.","But he answered:  Thou shalt not pass.  And immediately he came\nforth to meet them with an infinite multitude, and a strong hand,","Neither would he condescend to their desire to grant them\npassage through his borders.  Wherefore Israel turned another way from\nhim.","And when they had removed the camp from Cades, they came to\nmount Hor, which is in the borders of the land of Edom:","Where the Lord spoke to Moses:","Let Aaron, saith he, go to his people:  for he shall not go into\nthe land which I have given the children of Israel, because he was\nincredulous to my words, at the waters of contradiction.","Take Aaron and his son with him, and bring them up into mount\nHor:","And when thou hast stripped the father of his vesture, thou\nshalt vest therewith Eleazar his son:  Aaron shall be gathered to his\npeople, and die there.","Moses did as the Lord had commanded:  and they went up into mount\nHor before all the multitude.","And when he had stripped Aaron of his vestments, he vested\nEleazar his son with them.","And Aaron being dead in the top of the mountain, he came down\nwith Eleazar.","And all the multitude seeing that Aaron was dead, mourned for\nhim thirty days throughout all their families."]}
