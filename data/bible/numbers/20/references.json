In the sequel we go on to Speak thus:[fn-15-P1586_359893:1092-nf] \"The apostle, in concluding his discussion of marriage and of virginity, is careful to observe a mean course in discriminating between them, and, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left, he keeps to the King's highway,[fn-15-P1587_360147:1093-nf] and thus fulfils the injunction, `Be not righteous overmuch.'[fn-15-P1588_360230:1094-nf] Moreover, when he goes on to compare monogamy with digamy, he puts digamy after monogamy, just as before he subordinated marriage to virginity.\" Do we not clearly show by this language what is typified in the Holy Scriptures by the terms right and left, and also what we take to be the meaning of the words \"Be not righteous overmuch\"? We turn to the left if, following the lust of Jews and Gentiles, we burn for sexual intercourse; we turn to the right if, following the error of the Manichaeans, we under a pretence of chastity entangle ourselves in the meshes of unchastity. But we keep to the King's highway if we aspire to virginity yet refrain from condemning marriage. Can any one, moreover, be so unfair in his criticism of my poor treatise as to allege that I condemn first marriages, when he reads my opinion on second ones as follows:[fn-15-P1589_361102:1095-nf] \"The apostle, it is true, allows second marriages, but only to such women as are bent upon them, to such as cannot contain,[fn-15-P1590_361251:1096-nf] lest `when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ they marry, having condemnation because they have rejected their first faith,'[fn-15-P1591_361410:1097-nf] and he makes this concession because many `are turned aside after Satan.'[fn-15-P1592_361526:1098-nf] But they will be happier if they abide as widows. To this he immediately adds his apostolical authority, `after my judgment.' Moreover, lest any should consider that authority, being human, to be of small weight, he goes on to say, `and I think also that I have the spirit of God.'[fn-15-P1593_361831:1099-nf] Thus, where he urges men to continence he appeals not to human authority, but to the Spirit of God; but when he gives them permission to marry he does not mention the Spirit of God, but allows prudential considerations to turn the balance, relaxing the strictness of his code in favor of individuals according to their several needs.\" Having thus brought forward proofs that second marriages are allowed by the apostle, we at once added the remarks which follow:[fn-15-P1594_362319:1100-nf] \"As marriage is permitted to virgins by reason of the danger of fornication, and as what in itself is not desirable is thus made excusable, so by reason of the same danger widows are permitted to marry a second time. For it is better that a woman should know one man (though he should be a second husband or a third) than that she should know several. In other words, it is preferable that she should prostitute herself to one rather than to many.\" Calumny may do its worst. We have spoken here not of a first marriage, but of a second, of a third, or (if you like) of a fourth. But lest any one should apply my words (that it is better for a woman to prostitute herself to one man than to several) to a first marriage when my whole argument dealt with digamy and trigamy, I marked my own view of these practices with the words:[fn-15-P1595_363173:1101-nf] \"`All things are lawful, but all things are not expedient.'[fn-15-P1596_363258:1102-nf] I do not condemn digamists nor yet trigamists, nor even, to put an extreme, case, octogamists. I will make a still greater concession: I am ready to receive even a whore-monger, if penitent. In every case where fairness is possible, fair consideration must be shown.\"","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":20,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1352","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"20.

His face is pale with fasting, yet it is the cravings of others that torment him most. In fact he has bestowed his whole substance to meet the needs of Christ's poor. Yet none is richer than he, for his wicker basket contains the body of the Lord, and his plain glass-cup the precious blood. Like his Master he has banished greed out of the temple; and without either scourge of cords or words of chiding he has overthrown the chairs of them that sell doves, that is, the gifts of the Holy Spirit. He has upset the tables of Mammon and has scattered the money of the money-changers; zealous that the house of God may be called a house of prayer and not a den of robbers.[fn-49-P4910_1346421:3509-nf] In his steps follow closely and in those of others like him in virtue, whom the priesthood makes poor men and more than ever humble. Or if you will be perfect, go out with Abraham from your country and from your kindred, and go whither you know not.[fn-49-P4911_1346726:3510-nf] If you have substance, sell it and give to the poor.

For that which has been conceived by God's rival, of course is not friendly to God's things. The discord of things is the same as the discord of their authors. Further, since God is best, the devil on the contrary worst, of beings, by their own very diversity they testify that neither works for[fn-122-P12245_3425434:38-nf] the other; so that anything of good can no more seem to be effected for us by the Evil One, than anything of evil by the Good.

But, however, having been instructed, by his own experiment, what an aid unto sinning was that which he had been the first to feel, and by means of which he had entered on his course of delinquency, he called the same to his assistance for the thrusting of man into crime. The woman,[fn-122-P12248_3426916:41-nf] immediately on being met by him-I may say so without rashness-was, through his very speech with her, breathed on by a spirit infected with impatience: so certain is it that she would never have sinned at all, if she had honoured the divine edict by maintaining her patience to the end. What (of the fact) that she endured not to have been met alone; but in the presence of Adam, not yet her husband, not yet bound to lend her his ears,[fn-122-P12249_3427387:42-nf] she is impatient of keeping silence, and makes him the transmitter of that which she had imbibed from the Evil One? Therefore another human being, too, perishes through the impatience of the one; presently, too, perishes of himself, through his own impatience committed in each respect, both in regard of God's premonition and in regard of the devil's cheatery; not enduring to observe the former nor to refute the latter. Hence, whence (the origin) of delinquency, arose the first origin of judgment; hence, whence man was induced to offend, God began to be wroth. Whence (came)the first indignation in God, thence (came) His first patience; who, content at that time with malediction only, refrained in the devil's case from the instant infliction[fn-122-P12250_3428185:43-nf] of punishment. Else what crime, before this guilt of impatience, is imputed to man? Innocent he was, and in intimate friendship with God, and the husbandman[fn-122-P12251_3428355:44-nf] of paradise. But when once he succumbed to impatience, he quite ceased to be of sweet savour[fn-122-P12252_3428475:45-nf] to God; he quite ceased to be able to endure things celestial. Thenceforward, a creature[fn-122-P12253_3428605:46-nf] given to earth, and ejected from the sight of God, he begins to be easily turned by impatience unto every use offensive to God. For straightway that impatience conceived of the devil's seed, produced, in the fecundity of malice, anger as her son; and when brought forth, trained him in her own arts. For that very thing which had immersed Adam and Eve in death, taught their son, too, to begin with murder. It would be idle for me to ascribe this to impatience, if Cain, that first homicide and first fratricide, had borne with equanimity and not impatiently the refusal by the Lord of his own oblations-if he is not wroth with his own brother-if, finally, he took away no one's life. Since, then, he could neither have killed unless he had been wroth, nor have been wroth unless he had been impatient, he demonstrates that what he did through wrath must be referred to that by which wrath was suggested during this cradle-time of impatience, then (in a certain sense) in her infancy. But how great presently were her augmentations! And no wonder, If she has been the first delinquent, it is a consequence that, because she has been the first, therefore she is the only parent stem,[fn-122-P12254_3429799:47-nf] too, to every delinquency, pouring down from her own fount various veins of crimes.[fn-122-P12255_3430075:48-nf] Of murder we have spoken; but, being from the very beginning the outcome of anger,[fn-122-P12256_3430217:49-nf] whatever causes besides it shortly found for itself it lays collectively on the account of impatience, as to its own origin. For whether from private enmities, or for the sake of prey, any one perpetrates that wickedness,[fn-122-P12257_3430508:50-nf] the earlier step is his becoming impatient of[fn-122-P12258_3430572:51-nf] either the hatred or the avarice. Whatever compels a man, it is not possible that without impatience of itself it can be perfected in deed. Who ever committed adultery without impatience of lust? Moreover, if in females the sale of their modesty is forced by the price, of course it is by impatience of contemning gain[fn-122-P12259_3430921:52-nf] that this sale is regulated.[fn-122-P12260_3431003:53-nf] These (I mention) as the principal delinquencies in the sight of the Lord,[fn-122-P12261_3431147:54-nf] for, to speak compendiously, every sin is ascribable to impatience. \"Evil\" is \"impatience of good.\" None immodest is not impatient of modesty; dishonest of honesty; impious of piety;[fn-122-P12262_3431387:55-nf] unquiet of quietness. In order that each individual may become evil he will be unable to persevere[fn-122-P12263_3431523:56-nf] in being good. How, therefore, can such a hydra of delinquencies fail to offend the Lord, the Disapprover of evils? Is it not manifest that it was through impatience that Israel himself also always failed in his duty toward God, from that time when,[fn-122-P12264_3431794:57-nf] forgetful of the heavenly arm whereby he had been drawn out of his Egyptian affliction, he demands from Aaron \"gods[fn-122-P12265_3431972:58-nf] as his guides; \"when he pours down for an idol the contributions of his gold: for the so necessary delays of Moses, while he met with God, he had borne with impatience. After the edible rain of the manna, after the watery following[fn-122-P12266_3432242:59-nf] of the rock, they despair of the Lord in not enduring a three-days' thirst;[fn-122-P12267_3432421:60-nf] for this also is laid to their charge by the Lord as impatience. And-not to rove through individual cases-there was no instance in which it was not by failing in duty through impatience that they perished. How, moreover, did they lay hands on the prophets, except through impatience of hearing them? on the Lord moreover Himself, through impatience likewise of seeing Him? But had they entered the path of patience, they would have been set free.[fn-122-P12268_3433028:61-nf] ","title":"Of Patience.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":20,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_33_tractate_xxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"9.

Let us then consider ourselves, brethren: we have been led out of Egypt, where we were slaves to the devil as to Pharaoh; where we applied ourselves to works of clay, engaged in earthly desires, and where we toiled exceedingly. And to us, while laboring, as it were, at the bricks, Christ cried aloud, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden.\" Thence we were led out by baptism as through the Red Sea.-red because consecrated by the blood of Christ. All our enemies that pursued us being dead, that is, all our sins being blotted out, we have been brought over to the other side. At the present time, then, before we come to the land of promise, namely, the eternal kingdom, we are in the wilderness in tabernacles. They who acknowledge these things are in tabernacles; for it was to be that some would acknowledge this. For that man, who understands that he is a sojourner in this world, is in tabernacles. That man understands that he is travelling in a foreign country, when he sees himself sighing for his native land. But whilst the body of Christ is in tabernacles, Christ is in tabernacles; but at that time He was so, not evidently but secretly. For as yet the shadow obscured the light; when the light came, the shadow was removed. Christ was in secret: He was in the feast of tabernacles, but there hidden. At the present time, when these things are already made manifest, we acknowledge that we are journeying in the wilderness: for if we know it, we are in the wilderness. What is it to be in the wilderness? In the desert waste. Why in the desert waste? Because in this world, where we thirst in a way in which is no water. But yet, let us thirst that we may be filled.

Which very thing, too, we observe to come from divine authority, that the priest should be chosen in the presence of the people under the eyes of all, and should be approved worthy and suitable by public judgment and testimony; as in the book of Numbers the Lord commanded Moses, saying, \"Take Aaron thy brother, and Eleazar his son, and place them in the mount, in the presence of all the assembly, and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and let Aaron die there, and be added to his people.\"[fn-61-P6127_1934277:14-nf] God commands a priest to be appointed in the presence of all the assembly; that is, He instructs and shows that the ordination of priests ought not to be solemnized except with the knowledge of the people standing near, that in the presence of the people either the crimes of the wicked may be disclosed, or the merits of the good may be declared, and the ordination, which shall have been examined by the suffrage and judgment of all, may be just and legitimate.[fn-61-P6128_1934763:15-nf] And this is subsequently observed, according to divine instruction, in the Acts of the Apostles, when Peter speaks to the people of ordaining an apostle in the place of Judas. \"Peter,\" it says, \"stood up in the midst of the disciples, and the multitude were in one place.\"[fn-61-P6129_1935062:16-nf] Neither do we observe that this was regarded by the apostles only in the ordinations of bishops and priests, but also in those of deacons, of which matter itself also it is written in their Acts: \"And they twelve called together,\" it says, \"the whole congregation of the disciples, and said to them; \"[fn-61-P6130_1935541:17-nf] which was done so diligently and carefully, with the calling together of the whole of the people, surely for this reason, that no unworthy person might creep into the ministry of the altar, or to the office of a priest.
