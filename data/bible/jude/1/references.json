About two years ago the aforesaid Pope Epiphanius sent a letter[fn-23-P2322_584262:1651-nf] to Bishop John, first finding fault with him as regarded some of his opinions and then mildly calling him to penitence. Such was the repute of the writer or else the elegance of the letter that all Palestine fought for copies of it. Now there was in our monastery a man of no small estimation in his country, Eusebius of Cremona, who, when he found that this letter was in everybody's mouth and that the ignorant and the educated alike admired it for its teaching and for the purity of its style, set to work to beg me to translate it for him into Latin and at the same time to simplify tile argument so that he might more readily understand it; for he was himself altogether unacquainted with the Greek language. I consented to his request and calling to my aid a secretary speedily dictated my version, briefly marking on the side of the page the contents of the several chapters. The fact is that he asked me to do this merely for himself, and I requested of him in return to keep his copy private and not too readily to circulate it. A year and six months went by, and then the aforesaid translation found its way by a novel stratagem from his desk to Jerusalem. For a pretended monk-either bribed as there is much reason to believe or actuated by malice of his own as his tempter vainly tries to convince us-shewed himself a second Judas by robbing Eusebius of his literary property and gave to the adversary an occasion of railing[fn-23-P2323_585746:1652-nf] against me.

Then immediately quickening her pace she began to move along the old road which leads to Gaza, that is to the `power' or `wealth' of God, silently meditating on that type of the Gentiles, the Ethiopian eunuch, who in spite of the prophet changed his skin[fn-39-P3948_1065228:2813-nf] and whilst he read the old testament found the fountain of the gospel.[fn-39-P3949_1065373:2814-nf] Next turning to the right she passed from Bethzur[fn-39-P3950_1065460:2815-nf] to Eshcol which means \"a cluster of grapes.\" It was hence that the spies brought back that marvellous cluster which was the proof of the fertility of the land[fn-39-P3951_1065643:2816-nf] and a type of Him who says of Himself: \"I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people there was none with me.\"[fn-39-P3952_1065805:2817-nf] Shortly afterwards she entered the home[fn-39-P3953_1065898:2818-nf] of Sarah and beheld the birthplace of Isaac and the traces of Abraham's oak under which he saw Christ's day and was glad.[fn-39-P3954_1066113:2819-nf] And rising up from thence she went up to Hebron, that is Kirjath-Arba, or the City of the Four Men. These are Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the great Adam whom the Hebrews suppose (from the book of Joshua the son of Nun) to be buried there.[fn-39-P3955_1066373:2820-nf] But many are of opinion that Caleb is the fourth and a monument at one side is pointed out as his. After seeing these places she did not care to go on to Kirjath-sepher, that is \"the village of letters;\" because despising the letter that killeth she had found the spirit that giveth life.[fn-39-P3956_1066686:2821-nf] She admired more the upper springs and the nether springs which Othniel the son of Kenaz the son of Jephunneh received in place of a south land and a waterless possession,[fn-39-P3957_1066943:2822-nf] and by the conducting of which he watered the dry fields of the old covenant.

By Zoar I mean that \"heifer of three years old\"[fn-39-P3960_1067615:2825-nf] which was formerly called Bela[fn-39-P3961_1067667:2826-nf] and in Syriac is rendered Zoar that is `little.' She called to mind the cave in which Lot found refuge, and with tears in her eyes warned the virgins her companions to beware of \"wine wherein is excess;\"[fn-39-P3962_1067897:2827-nf] for it was to this that the Moabites and Ammonites owe their origin.[fn-39-P3963_1067987:2828-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Therefore, when in these days a certain woman removed her marriage from the pale of the Church, and united herself to a Gentile, and when I remembered that this had in days gone by been done by others: wondering at either their own waywardness or else the double-dealing[fn-8-P850_203187:8-nf] of their advisers, in that there is no scripture which holds forth a licence of this deed,-\"I wonder,\" said I, \"whether they flatter themselves on the ground of that passage of the first (Epistle) to the Corinthians, where it is written: If any of the brethren has an unbelieving wife, and she consents to the matrimony, let him not dismiss her; similarly, let not a believing woman, married to an unbeliever, if she finds her husband agreeable (to their continued union), dismiss him: for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife by the believing husband; else were your children unclean.\"[fn-8-P851_203935:9-nf] It may be that, by understanding generally this monition regarding married believers, they think that licence is granted (thereby) to marry even unbelievers. God forbid that he who thus interprets (the passage) be wittingly ensnaring himself! But it is manifest that this scripture points to those believers who may have been found by the grace of God in (the state of) Gentile matrimony; according to the words themselves: \"If,\" it says, \"any believer has an unbelieving wife; \"it does not say, \"takes an unbelieving wife.\" It shows that it is the duty of one who, already living in marriage with an unbelieving woman,[fn-8-P852_204603:10-nf] has presently been by the grace of God converted, to continue with his wife; for this reason, to be sure, in order that no one, after attaining to faith, should think that he must turn away from a woman[fn-8-P853_204821:11-nf] who is now in some sense an \"alien\" and \"stranger.\"[fn-8-P854_204886:12-nf] Accordingly he subjoins withal a reason, that \"we are called in peace unto the Lord God; \"and that \"the unbeliever may, through the use of matrimony, be gained by the believer.\"[fn-8-P855_205092:13-nf] The very closing sentence of the period confirms (the supposition) that this is thus to be understood. \"As each,\" it says, \"is called by the Lord, so let him persevere.\"[fn-8-P856_205348:14-nf] But it is Gentiles who \"are called,\" I take it, not believers. But if he had been pronouncing absolutely, (in the words under discussion,) touching the marriage of believers merely, (then) had he (virtually) given to saints a permission to marry promiscuously. If, however, he had given such a permission, he would never have subjoined a declaration so diverse from and contrary to his own permission, saying: \"The woman, when her husband is dead, is free: let her marry whom. she wishes, only in the Lord.\"[fn-8-P857_205928:15-nf] Here, at all events, there is no need for reconsidering; for what there might have been reconsideration about, the Spirit has oracularly declared. For fear we should make an ill use of what he says, \"Let her marry whom she wishes,\" he has added, \"only in the Lord,\" that is, in the name of the Lord, which is, undoubtedly, \"to a Christian.\" That \"Holy Spirit,\"[fn-8-P858_206324:16-nf] therefore, who prefers that widows and unmarried women should persevere in their integrity, who exhorts us to a copy[fn-8-P859_206564:17-nf] of himself, prescribes no other manner of repeating marriage except \"in the Lord: \"to this condition alone does he concede the foregoing[fn-8-P860_206796:18-nf] of continence. \"Only,\" he says, \"in the Lord: \"he has added to his law a weight-\"only.\" Utter that word with what tone and manner you may, it is weighty: it both bids and advises; both enjoins and exhorts; both asks and threatens. It is a concise,[fn-8-P861_207061:19-nf] brief sentence; and by its own very brevity, eloquent. Thus is the divine voice wont (to speak), that you may instantly understand, instantly observe. For who but could understand that the apostle foresaw many dangers and wounds to faith in marriages of this kind, which he prohibits? sad that he took precaution, in the first place, against the defilement of holy flesh in Gentile flesh? At this point some one says, \"What, then, is the difference between him who is chosen by the Lord to Himself in (the state of) Gentile marriage, and him who was of old (that is, before marriage) a believer, that they should not be equally cautious for their flesh?-whereas the one is kept from marriage with an unbeliever, the other bidden to continue in it. Why, if we are defiled by a Gentile, is not the one disjoined, just as the other is not bound? \"I will answer, if the Spirit give (me ability); alleging, before all (other arguments), that the Lord holds it more pleasing that matrimony should not be contracted, than that it should at all be dissolved: in short, divorce He prohibits, except for the cause of fornication; but continence He commends. Let the one, therefore, have the necessity of continuing; the other, further, even the power of not marrying. Secondly, if, according to the Scripture, they who shall be \"apprehended\"[fn-8-P862_208444:20-nf] by the faith in (the state of) Gentile marriage are not defiled (thereby) for this reason, that, together with themselves, others[fn-8-P863_208621:21-nf] also are sanctified: without doubt, they who have been sanctified before marriage, if they commingle themselves with \"strange flesh,\"[fn-8-P864_208780:22-nf] cannot sanctify that (flesh) in (union with) which they were not \"apprehended.\" The grace of God, moreover, sanctifies that which it finds. Thus, what has not been able to be sanctified is unclean; what is unclean has no part with the holy, unless to defile and slay it by its own (nature).","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"174","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"1 \"Of the family of the Lord there were still living the grandchildren of Jude, who is said to have been the Lord's brother according to the flesh.[fn-18-P1809_834417:158-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_10_homily_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"\"Then Returned They,\" it is said: namely, when they had heard.

As soon as this Joshua[fn-62-P6273_1918303:119-nf] reached the Jordan, the waters of marriage, which had ever flowed in the land, dried up and stood in one heap; and the whole people, barefooted and on dry ground, crossed over, and came to Gilgal, and there was a second time circumcised. If we take this literally, it cannot possibly stand. For if we had two foreskins, or if another could grow after the first was cut off, there would be room for speaking of a second circumcision. But the meaning is that Joshua circumcised the people who had crossed the desert, with the Gospel knife, and he circumcised them with a stone knife, that what in the case of Moses' son was prefigured in a few might under Joshua be fulfilled in all. Moreover, the very foreskins were heaped together and buried, and covered with earth, and the fact that the reproach of Egypt was taken away, and the name of the place, Gilgal, which is by interpretation[fn-62-P6274_1919208:120-nf] revelation, show that while the people wandered in the desert uncircumcised their eyes were blinded. Let us see what follows. After this Gospel circumcision and the consecration of twelve stones at the place of revelation, the Passover was immediately celebrated, a lamb was slain for them, and they ate the food of the Holy Land. Joshua went forth, and was met by the Prince of the host, sword in hand, that is either to shew that he was ready to fight for the circumcised people, or to sever the tie of marriage. And in the same way that Moses was commanded, so was he:[fn-62-P6275_1919866:121-nf] \"loose thy shoe, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\" For if the armed host of the Lord was represented by the trumpets of the priests, we may see in Jericho a type of the overthrow of the world by the preaching of the Gospel. And to pass over endless details (for it is not my purpose now to unfold all the mysteries of the Old Testament),[fn-62-P6276_1920254:122-nf] five kings who previously reigned in the land of promise, and opposed the Gospel army, were overcome in battle with Joshua. I think it is clearly to be understood that before the Lord led his people from Egypt and circumcised them, sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch had the dominion, and that to these, as to five princes, everything was subject. And when they[fn-62-P6277_1920640:123-nf] took refuge in the cave of the body and in a place of darkness, Jesus entered the body itself and slew them, that the source of their power might be the instrument of their death.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"ANF-04","text":"What if, even here, you should conceive to reply that communion is indeed denied to sinners, very especially such as had been \"polluted by the flesh,\"[fn-15-P1579_461142:227-nf] but (only) for the present; to be restored, to wit, as the result of penitential suing: in accordance with that clemency of God which prefers a sinner's repentance to his death?[fn-15-P1580_461349:228-nf] -for this fundamental ground of your opinion must be universally attacked. We say, accordingly, that if it had been competent to the Divine clemency to have guaranteed the demonstration of itself even to the post-baptismally lapsed, the apostle would have said thus: \"Communicate not with the works of darkness, unless they shall have repented; \"and, \"With such take not food even, unless after they shall have wiped, with rolling at their feet, the shoes of the brethren; \"and, \"Him who shall have marred the temple of God, shall God mar, unless he shall have shaken off from his head in the church the ashes of all hearths.\" For it had been his duty, in the case of those things which he had condemned, to have equally determined the extent to which he had (and that conditionally) condemned them-whether he had condemned them with a temporary and conditional, and not a perpetual, seventy. However, since in all Epistles he both prohibits such a character, (so sinning) after believing, from being admitted (to the society of believers); and, if admitted, detrudes him from communion, without hope of any condition or time; he sides more with our opinion, pointing out that the repentance which the Lord prefers is that which before believing, before baptism, is esteemed better than the death of the sinner,-(the sinner, I say,) once for all to be washed through the grace of Christ, who once for all has suffered death for our sins. For this (rule), even in his own person, the apostle has laid down. For, when affirming that Christ came for this end, that He might save sinners,[fn-15-P1581_462995:229-nf] of whom himself had been the \"first,\" what does he add? \"And I obtained mercy, because I did (so) ignorantly in unbelief.\"[fn-15-P1582_463143:230-nf] Thus that clemency of God, preferring the repentance of a sinner to his death, looks at such as are ignorant still, and still unbelieving, for the sake of whose liberation Christ came; not (at such) as already know God, and have learnt the sacrament of the faith. But if the clemency of God is applicable to such as are ignorant still, and unbelieving, of course it follows that repentance invites clemency to itself; without prejudice to that species of repentance after believing, which either, for lighter sins, will be able to obtain pardon from the bishop, or else, for greater and irremissible ones, from God only.[fn-15-P1583_463789:231-nf] ","title":"VII.

For some writings which are said be theirs are quoted by those who, according to their own humor, loosely believe what they please. But the purity of the canon has not admitted these writings, not because the authority of these men who pleased God is rejected, but because they are not believed to be theirs. Nor ought it to appear strange if writings for which so great antiquity is claimed are held in suspicion, seeing that in the very history of the kings of Judah and Israel containing their acts, which we believe to belong to the canonical Scripture, very many things are mentioned which are not explained there, but are said to be found in other books which the prophets wrote, the very names of these prophets being sometimes given, and yet they are not found in the canon which the people of God received. Now I confess the reason of this is hidden from me; only I think that even those men, to whom certainly the Holy Spirit revealed those things which ought to be held as of religious authority, might write some things as men by historical diligence, and others as prophets by divine inspiration; and these things were so distinct, that it was judged that the former should be ascribed to themselves, but the latter to God speaking through them: and so the one pertained to the abundance of knowledge, the other to the authority of religion. In that authority the canon is guarded. So that, if any writings outside of it are now brought forward under the name of the ancient prophets, they cannot serve even as an aid to knowledge, because it is uncertain whether they are genuine; and on this account they are not trusted, especially those of them in which some things are found that are even contrary to the truth of the canonical books, so that it is quite apparent they do not belong to them.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_41_treatise_on_rebuke_and_grace","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Is such an one as is unwilling to be rebuked still able to say, \"What have I done,-I who have not received?\" when it appears plainly that he has received, and by his own fault has lost that which he has received? \"I am able,\" says he, \"I am altogether able,-when you reprove me for having of my own will relapsed from a good life into a bad one,-still to say, What have I done,-I who have not received?

And when we pray that he who stands may stand, we do not pray for anything else than that he may persevere. Jude the apostle, again, when he says, \"Now unto Him that is able to keep you without offence, and to establish you before the presence of His glory, immaculate in joy,\"[fn-63-P6396_2448294:46-nf] does he not most manifestly show that perseverance in good unto the end is God's gift?

What is it, moreover, that we read in the Acts of the Apostles: \"And when the Gentiles heard, they rejoiced and received the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed\"?[fn-63-P6397_2448741:47-nf] Who could be ordained to eternal life save by the gift of perseverance?

And as this is already accomplished by means of the laver of regeneration, why is it daily asked by believers, except that we may persevere in that which is already done in us? For the blessed Cyprian also understands this in this manner, inasmuch as, in his exposition of the same prayer, he says: \"We say, 'Hallowed be Thy name,' not that we wish for God that He may be hallowed by our prayers, but that we ask of God that His name may be hallowed in us. But by whom is God hallowed; since He Himself hallows? Well, because He said, 'Be ye holy, since I also am holy;'[fn-64-P6400_2449684:50-nf] we ask and entreat that we who have been hallowed in baptism may persevere in that which we have begun to be.\"[fn-64-P6401_2449838:51-nf] Behold the most glorious martyr is of this opinion, that what in these words Christ's faithful people are daily asking is, that they may persevere in that which they have begun to be.

And if we must also look at ancient history, I perceive that Enoch,[fn-53-P5372_1790432:19-nf] the seventh among our ancestors, was honoured by translation. I perceive also that the twenty-first, Abraham,[fn-53-P5373_1790556:20-nf] was given the glory of the Patriarchate, by the addition of a greater mystery. For the Hebdomad thrice repeated brings out this number. And one who is very bold might venture even to come to the New Adam, my God and Lord Jesus Christ, Who is counted the Seventy-seventh from the old Adam who fell under sin, in the backward genealogy according to Luke.[fn-53-P5374_1790926:21-nf] And I think of the seven trumpets of Jesus, the son of Nave, and the same number of circuits and days and priests, by which the walls of Jericho were shaken down.[fn-53-P5375_1791108:22-nf] And so too the seven compassings of the City; in the same way as there is a mystery in the threefold breathings of Elias, the Prophet, by which he breathed life into the son of the Sareptan widow,[fn-53-P5376_1791327:23-nf] and the same number of his floodings of the wood,[fn-53-P5377_1791399:24-nf] when he consumed the sacrifice with fire sent from God, and condemned the prophets of shame who could not do the like at his challenge. And the sevenfold looking for the cloud imposed upon the young servant; and Elissaaeus stretching himself that number of times upon the child of the Shunammite, by which stretching the breath of life was restored.[fn-53-P5378_1791769:25-nf] To the same doctrine belongs, I think (if I may omit the seven-stemmed and seven-lamped candlestick of the Temple[fn-53-P5379_1792250:26-nf] ) that the ceremony of the Priests' consecration lasted seven days;[fn-53-P5380_1792340:27-nf] and seven that of the purifying of a leper,[fn-53-P5381_1792406:28-nf] and that of the Dedication of the Temple[fn-53-P5382_1792464:29-nf] the same number, and that in the seventieth year the people returned from the Captivity;[fn-53-P5383_1792575:30-nf] that whatever is in Units may appear also in Decads, and the mystery of the Hebdomad be reverenced in a more perfect number. But why do I speak of the distant past? Jesus Himself who is pure perfection, could in the desert and with five loaves feed five thousand, and again with seven loaves four thousand. And the leavings after they were satisfied were in the first case twelve baskets full, and in the other seven baskets;[fn-53-P5384_1793026:31-nf] neither, I imagine, without a reason or unworthy of the Spirit. And if you read for yourself you may take note of many numbers which contain a meaning deeper than appears on the surface. But to come to an instance which is most useful to us on the present occasion, not that for these reasons or others very similar or yet more divine, the Hebrews honour the Day of Pentecost, m@d we also honour it; just as there are other rites of the Hebrews which we observe ... they were typically observed by them, and by us they are sacramentally reinstated.
