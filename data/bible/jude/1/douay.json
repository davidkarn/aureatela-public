{"verses":["Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James:  to them\nthat are beloved in God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and\ncalled.","Mercy unto you and peace:  and charity be fulfilled.","Dearly beloved, taking all care to write unto you concerning your\ncommon salvation, I was under a necessity to write unto you:  to beseech\nyou to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.","For certain men are secretly entered in (who were written of long\nago unto this judgment), ungodly men, turning the grace of our Lord God\ninto riotousness and denying the only sovereign Ruler and our Lord\nJesus Christ.","I will therefore admonish you, though ye once knew all things,\nthat Jesus, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, did\nafterwards destroy them that believed not.","And the angels who kept not their principality but forsook their\nown habitation, he hath reserved under darkness in everlasting chains,\nunto the judgment of the great day.","As Sodom and Gomorrha and the neighbouring cities, in like manner,\nhaving given themselves to fornication and going after other flesh,\nwere made an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire.","In like manner, these men also defile the flesh and despise\ndominion and blaspheme majesty.","When Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil, contended\nabout the body of Moses, he durst not bring against him the judgment of\nrailing speech, but said:  The Lord command thee.","But these men blaspheme whatever things they know not:  and what\nthings soever they naturally know, like dumb beasts, in these they are\ncorrupted.","Woe unto them!  For they have gone in the way of Cain:  and after\nthe error of Balaam they have for reward poured out themselves and have\nperished in the contradiction of Core.","These are spots in their banquets, feasting together without\nfear, feeding themselves:  clouds without water, which are carried about\nby winds:  trees of the autumn, unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by\nthe roots:","Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own confusion:\nwandering stars, to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for ever.","Now of these Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied,\nsaying:  Behold, the Lord cometh with thousands of his saints:","To execute judgment upon all and to reprove all the ungodly for\nall the works of their ungodliness, whereby they have done ungodly:  and\nfor all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against God.","These are murmurers, full of complaints, walking according to\ntheir own desires:  and their mouth speaketh proud things, admiring\npersons, for gain's sake.","But you, my dearly beloved, be mindful of the words which have\nbeen spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:","Who told you that in the last time there should come mockers,\nwalking according to their own desires in ungodlinesses.","These are they who separate themselves, sensual men, having not\nthe Spirit.","But you, my beloved, building yourselves upon your most holy\nfaith, praying in the Holy Ghost,","Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our\nLord Jesus Christ, unto life everlasting.","And some indeed reprove, being judged:","But others save, pulling them out of the fire.  And on others have\nmercy, in fear, hating also the spotted garment which is carnal.","Now to him who is able to preserve you without sin and to present\nyou spotless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, in\nthe coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:","To the only God our Saviour through Jesus Christ our Lord, be\nglory and magnificence, empire and power, before all ages, and now, and\nfor all ages of ages.  Amen."]}
