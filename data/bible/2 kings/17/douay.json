{"verses":["And Achitophel said to Absalom:  I will choose me twelve thousand\nmen, and I will arise and pursue after David this night.","And coming upon him (for he is now weary, and weak handed) I will\ndefeat him:  and when all the people is put to flight that is with him,\nI will kill the king who will be left alone.","And I will bring back all the people, as if they were but one\nman:  for thou seekest but one man:  and all the people shall be in\npeace.","And his saying pleased Absalom, and all the ancients of Israel.","But Absalom said:  Call Chusai the Arachite, and let us hear what\nhe also saith.","And when Chusai was come to Absalom, Absalom said to him:\nAchitophel hath spoken after this manner:  shall we do it or not?  what\ncounsel dost thou give?","And Chusai said to Absalom:  The counsel that Achitophel hath\ngiven this time is not good.","And again Chusai said:  Thou knowest thy father, and the men that\nare with him, that they are very valiant, and bitter in their mind, as\na bear raging in the wood when her whelps are taken away:  and thy\nfather is a warrior, and will not lodge with the people.","Perhaps he now lieth hid in pits, or in some other place where he\nliest:  and when any one shall fall at the first, every one that heareth\nit shall say:  There is a slaughter among the people that followed\nAbsalom.","And the most valiant man whose heart is as the heart of a lion,\nshall melt for fear:  for all the people of Israel know thy father to be\na valiant man, and that all who are with him are valiant.","But this seemeth to me to be good counsel:  Let all Israel be\ngathered to thee, from Dan to Bersabee, as the sand of the sea which\ncannot be numbered:  and thou shalt be in the midst of them.","And we shall come upon him in what place soever he shall be\nfound:  and we shall cover him, as the dew falleth upon the ground, and\nwe shall not leave of the men that are with him, not so much as one.","And if he shall enter into any city, all Israel shall cast ropes\nround about that city, and we will draw it into the river, so that\nthere shall not be found so much as one small stone thereof.","And Absalom, and all the men of Israel said:  The counsel of\nChusai the Arachite is better than the counsel of Achitophel:  and by\nthe will of the Lord the profitable counsel of Achitophel was defeated,\nthat the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.","And Chusai said to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests:  Thus and thus\ndid Achitophel counsel Absalom, and the ancients of Israel:  and thus\nand thus did I counsel them.","Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying:  Tarry not\nthis night in the plains of the wilderness, but without delay pass\nover:  lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that is with\nhim.","And Jonathan and Achimaas stayed by the fountain Rogel:  and\nthere went a maid and told them:  and they went forward, to carry the\nmessage to king David, for they might not be seen, nor enter into the\ncity.","But a certain boy saw them, and told Absalom:  but they making\nhaste went into the house of a certain man in Bahurim, who had a well\nin his court, and they went down into it.","And a woman took, and spread a covering over the mouth of the\nwell, as it were to dry sodden barley and so the thing was not known.","And when Absalom's servants were come into the house, they said\nto the woman:  Where is Achimaas and Jonathan?  and the woman answered\nthem:  They passed on in haste, after they had tasted a little water.\nBut they that sought them, when they found them not, returned into\nJerusalem.","And when they were gone, they came up out of the well, and going\non told king David, and said:  Arise, and pass quickly over the river:\nfor this manner of counsel has Achitophel given against you.","So David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they\npassed over the Jordan, until it grew light, and not one of them was\nleft that was not gone ever the river.","But Achitophel seeing that his counsel was not followed, saddled\nhis ass, and arose and went home to his house and to his city, and\nputting his house in order, hanged himself, and was buried in the\nsepulchre of his father.","But David came to the camp, and Absalom passed over the Jordan,\nhe and all the men of Israel with him.","Now Absalom appointed Amasa in Joab's stead over the army:  and\nAmasa was the son of a man who was called Jethra, of Jezrael, who went\nin to Abigail the daughter of Naas, the sister of Sarvia who was the\nmother of Joab.","And Israel camped with Absalom in the land of Galaad.","And when David was come to the camp, Sobi the son of Naas of\nRabbath of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammihel of\nLodabar and Berzellai the Galaadite of Rogelim,","Brought him beds, and tapestry, and earthen vessels, and wheat,\nand barley, and meal, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and\nfried pulse,","And honey, and butter, and sheep, and fat calves, and they gave\nto David and the people that were with him, to eat:  for they suspected\nthat the people were faint with hunger and thirst in the wilderness."]}
