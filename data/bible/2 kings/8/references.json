Again, hear concerning the title Son of God, by which we have called Him. They say that\n\"though God has no son, ye make that crucified Jesus, the firstborn son of God.\" Yet He called Israel\n\"My first-born,\" when He sent to Pharaoh through Moses and said to him, Israel is My\nfirst-born; I have said unto thee, let My Son go to serve Me, and if thou art not willing to let(him)\ngo, lo! I will slay thy son, they firstborn.[fn-44-P4452_1486190:5-nf] And also through the Prophet[fn-44-P4453_1486237:6-nf] He testified concerning this, and reproved them\nand said to the people, Out of Egypt have I called My son. As I called them, so they went and\nworshipped Baal and offered incense to the graven images. And Isaiah said[fn-44-P4454_1486469:7-nf] concerning them, Children have I reared and\nbrought up, and they have rebelled against Me. And again it is written, Ye are the children of\nthe Lord your God.[fn-44-P4455_1486640:8-nf] And about Solomon He\nsaid, He shall be to Me a son, and I will be to him a Father.[fn-44-P4456_1486740:9-nf] So also we call the Christ, the Son of God, for\nthrough Him we have gained the knowledge of God; even as He called Israel My firstborn son,\nand as He said concerning Solomon, He shall be to Me a son. And we call Him God, even as He\nsurnamed Moses by His own Name. And also David said concerning them:-Ye are Gods and children of\nthe Highest, all of you.[fn-44-P4457_1487115:10-nf] And when they\namended not themselves, therefore He said concerning them:-As men shall ye die, and as one of the\nprinces shall ye fall.[fn-44-P4458_1487269:11-nf] ","title":"Letter of an Inquirer.","author":"Aphrahat"}]
