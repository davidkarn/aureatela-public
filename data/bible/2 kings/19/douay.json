(For the talk of all Israel was come to the\nking in his house.)","You are my brethren, you are my bone, and my flesh, why are you\nthe last to bring back the king?","And say ye to Amasa:  Art not thou my bone, and my flesh?  So do\nGod to me and add more, if thou be not the chief captain of the army\nbefore me always in the place of Joab.","And he inclined the heart of all the men of Juda, as it were of\none man:  and they sent to the king, saying:  Return thou, and all thy\nservants.","And the king returned and came as far as the Jordan, and all\nJuda came as far as Galgal to meet the king, and to bring him over the\nJordan.","And Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim, made\nhaste and went down with the men of Juda to meet king David,","With a thousand men of Benjamin, and Siba the servant of the\nhouse of Saul:  and his fifteen sons, and twenty servants were with him:\nand going over the Jordan,","Said to him:  Impute not to me, my lord, the iniquity, nor\nremember the injuries of thy servant on the day that thou, my lord, the\nking, wentest out of Jerusalem, nor lay it up in thy heart, O king.","For I thy servant acknowledge my sin:  and therefore I am come\nthis day the first of all the house of Joseph, and am come down to meet\nmy lord the king.","But Abisai the son of Sarvia answering, said:  Shall Semei for\nthese words not be put to death, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?","And David said:  What have I to do with you, ye sons of Sarvia?\nwhy are you a satan this day to me?  shall there any man be killed this\nday in Israel?  do not I know that this day I am made king over Israel?","And the king said to Semei:  Thou shalt not die.  And he swore\nunto him.","And Miphiboseth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and\nhe had neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard:  nor washed his\ngarments from the day that the king went out, until the day of his\nreturn in peace.","And when he met the king at Jerusalem, the king said to him:  Why\ncamest thou not with me, Miphiboseth?","And he answering, said:  My lord, O king, my servant despised me:\nfor I thy servant spoke to him to saddle me an ass, that I might get on\nand go with the king:  for I thy servant am lame.","Moreover he hath also accused me thy servant to thee, my lord\nthe king:  but thou my lord the king art as an angel of God, do what\npleaseth thee.","For all of my father's house were no better than worthy of death\nbefore my lord the king; and thou hast set me thy servant among the\nguests of thy table:  what just complaint therefore have I?  or what\nright to cry any more to the king?","Then the king said to him:  Why speakest thou any more?  what I\nhave said is determined:  thou and Siba divide the possessions.","And Miphiboseth answered the king:  Yea, let him take all,\nforasmuch as my lord the king is returned peaceably into his house.","Berzellai also the Galaadite coming down from Rogelim, brought\nthe king over the Jordan, being ready also to wait on him beyond the\nriver.","Now Berzellai the Galaadite was of a great age, that is to say,\nfourscore years old, and he provided the king with sustenance when he\nabode in the camp:  for he was a man exceeding rich.","And the king said to Berzellai:  Come with me that thou mayest\nrest secure with me in Jerusalem.","And Berzellai said to the king:  How many are the days of the\nyears of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?","I am this day fourscore years old, are my senses quick to\ndiscern sweet and bitter?  or can meat or drink delight thy servant?  or\ncan I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women?  why\nshould thy servant be a burden to my lord, the king?","I thy servant will go on a little way from the Jordan with thee:\nI need not this recompense.","But I beseech thee let thy servant return, and die in my own\ncity, and be buried by the sepulchre of my father, and of my mother.\nBut there is thy servant Chamaam, let him go with thee, my lord, the\nking, and do to him whatsoever seemeth good to thee.","Then the king said to him:  Let Chamaam go over with me, and I\nwill do for him whatsoever shall please thee, and all that thou shalt\nask of me, thou shalt obtain.","And when all the people and the king had passed over the Jordan,\nthe king kissed Berzellai, and blessed him:  and he returned to his own\nplace.","So the king went on to Galgal, and Chamaam with him.
