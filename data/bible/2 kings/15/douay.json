And while he was offering sacrifices,\nthere was a strong conspiracy, and the people running together\nincreased with Absalom.","And there came a messenger to David, saying:  All Israel with\ntheir whole heart followeth Absalom.","And David said to his servants, that were with him in Jerusalem:\nArise and let us flee:  for we shall not escape else from the face of\nAbsalom:  make haste to go out, lest he come and overtake us, and bring\nruin upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.","And the king's servants said to him:  Whatsoever our lord the\nking shall command, we thy servants will willingly execute.","And the king went forth, and all his household on foot:  and the\nking left ten women his concubines to keep the house:","And the king going forth and all Israel on foot, stood afar off\nfrom the house:","And all his servants walked by him, and the bands of the\nCerethi, and the Phelethi, and all the Gethites, valiant warriors, six\nhundred men who had followed him from Geth on foot, went before the\nking.","And the king said to Ethai the Gethite:  Why comest thou with us:\nreturn and dwell with the king, for thou art a stranger, and art come\nout of thy own place.","Yesterday thou camest, and to day shalt thou be forced to go\nforth with us?  but I shall go whither I am going:  return thou, and take\nback thy brethren with thee, and the Lord will shew thee mercy, and\ntruth, because thou hast shewn grace and fidelity.","And Ethai answered the king, saying:  As the Lord liveth, and as\nmy lord the king liveth:  in what place soever thou shalt be, my lord, O\nking, either in death, or in life, there will thy servant be.","And David said to Ethai:  Come, and pass over.
