There are some who do not excuse even my namesake[fn-40-P4075_1217048:43-nf] from blame; who, living at Alexandria at the time for the sake of culture, although he had been most kindly treated by him, as if the dearest of his children, and received his special confidence, yet joined in the revolutionary plot against his father and patron: for, though others took the active part in it, the hand of Absalom[fn-40-P4076_1217533:44-nf] was with them, as the saying goes. If any of you had heard of the hand which was produced by fraud against the Saint, and the corpse[fn-40-P4077_1217792:45-nf] of the living man, and the unjust banishment, he knows what I mean. But this I will gladly forget. For on doubtful points, I am disposed to think we ought to incline to the charitable side, and acquit rather than condemn the accused. For a bad man would speedily condemn even a good man, while a good man would not be ready to condemn even a bad one. For one who is not ready to do ill, is not inclined even to suspect it. I come now to what is matter of fact, not of report, what is vouched for as truth instead of unverified suspicion.","title":"Oration XXI.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":15,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"7.
