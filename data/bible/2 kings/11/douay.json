{"verses":["And it came to pass at the return of the year, at the time when\nkings go forth to war, that David sent Joab and his servants with him,\nand all Israel, and they spoiled the children of Ammon, and besieged\nRabba:  but David remained in Jerusalem.","In the mean time it happened that David arose from his bed after\nnoon, and walked upon the roof of the king's house:  And he saw from the\nroof of his house a woman washing herself, over against him:  and the\nwoman was very beautiful.","And the king sent, and inquired who the woman was.  And it was\ntold him, that she was Bethsabee the daughter of Eliam, the wife of\nUrias the Hethite.","And David sent messengers, and took her, and she came in to him,\nand he slept with her:  and presently she was purified from her\nuncleanness:","And she returned to her house having conceived.  And she sent and\ntold David, and said:  I have conceived.","And David sent to Joab, saying:  Send me Urias the Hethite.  And\nJoab sent Urias to David.","And Urias came to David.  And David asked how Joab did, and the\npeople, and how the war was carried on.","And David said to Urias:  Go into thy house, and wash thy feet.\nAnd Urias went out from the king's house, and there went out after him\na mess of meat from the king.","But Urias slept before the gate of the king's house, with the\nother servants of his lord, and went not down to his own house.","And it was told David by some that said:  Urias went not to his\nhouse.  And David said to Urias:  Didst thou not come from thy journey?\nwhy didst thou not go down to thy house?","And Urias said to David:  The ark of God and Israel and Juda\ndwell in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord abide upon\nthe face of the earth:  and shall I go into my house, to eat and to\ndrink, and to sleep with my wife?  By thy welfare and by the welfare of\nthy soul I will not do this thing.","Then David said to Urias:  Tarry here to day, and to morrow I\nwill send thee away.  Urias tarried in Jerusalem that day and the next.","And David called him to eat and to drink before him, and he made\nhim drunk:  and he went out in the evening, and slept on his couch with\nthe servants of his lord, and went not down into his house.","And when the morning was come, David wrote a letter to Joab:  and\nsent it by the hand of Urias,","Writing in the letter:  Set ye Urias in the front of the battle,\nwhere the fight is strongest:  and leave ye him, that he may be wounded\nand die.","Wherefore as Joab was besieging the city, he put Urias in the\nplace where he knew the bravest men were.","And the men coming out of the city, fought against Joab, and\nthere fell some of the people of the servants of David, and Urias the\nHethite was killed also.","Then Joab sent, and told David all things concerning the battle.","And he charged the messenger, saying:  When thou hast told all\nthe words of the battle to the king,","If thou see him to be angry, and he shall say:  Why did you\napproach so near to the wall to fight?  knew you not that many darts are\nthrown from above off the wall?","Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerobaal?  did not a woman cast a\npiece of a millstone upon him from the wall and slew him in Thebes?  Why\ndid you go near the wall?  Thou shalt say:  Thy servant Urias the Hethite\nis also slain.","So the messenger departed, and came and told David all that Joab\nhad commanded him.","And the messenger said to David:  The men prevailed against us,\nand they came out to us into the field:  and we vigorously charged and\npursued them even to the gate of the city.","And the archers shot their arrows at thy servants from off the\nwall above:  and some of the king's servants are slain, and thy servant\nUrias the Hethite is also dead.","And David said to the messenger:  Thus shalt thou say to Joab:\nLet not this thing discourage thee:  for various is the event of war:\nand sometimes one, sometimes another is consumed by the sword:\nencourage thy warriors against the city, and exhort them that thou\nmayest overthrow it.","And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and\nshe mourned for him.","And the mourning being over, David sent and brought her into his\nhouse, and she became his wife, and she bore him a son:  and this thing\nwhich David had done, was displeasing to the Lord."]}
