David the son of Isai said:  The\nman to whom it was appointed concerning the Christ of the God of Jacob,\nthe excellent psalmist of Israel said:","The spirit of the Lord hath spoken by me and his word by my\ntongue.","The God of Israel said to me, the strong one of Israel spoke, the\nruler of men, the just ruler in the fear of God.","As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, shineth in the\nmorning without clouds, and as the grass springeth out of the earth by\nrain.","Neither is my house so great with God, that he should make with\nme an eternal covenant, firm in all things and assured.  For he is all\nmy salvation, and all my will:  neither is there ought thereof that\nspringeth not up.","But transgressors shall all of them be plucked up as thorns:\nwhich are not taken away with hands.","And if a man will touch them, he must be armed with iron and with\nthe staff of a lance:  but they shall be set on fire and burnt to\nnothing.","These are the names of the valiant men of David:  Jesbaham sitting\nin the chair was the wisest chief among the three, he was like the most\ntender little worm of the wood, who killed eight hundred men at one\nonset.","After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the\nthree valiant men that were with David when they defied the\nPhilistines, and they were there gathered together to battle.","And when the men of Israel were gone away, he stood and smote\nthe Philistines till his hand was weary, and grew stiff with the sword:\nand the Lord wrought a great victory that day:  and the people that were\nfled away, returned to take spoils of them that were slain.","And after him was Semma the son of Age of Arari.  And the\nPhilistines were gathered together in a troop:  for there was a field\nfull of lentils.  And when the people were fled from the face of the\nPhilistines,","He stood in the midst of the field, and defended it, and\ndefeated the Philistines:  and the Lord gave a great victory.","Moreover also before this the three who were princes among the\nthirty, went down and came to David in the harvest time into the cave\nof Odollam:  and the camp of the Philistines was in the valley of the\ngiants.","And David was then in a hold:  and there was a garrison of the\nPhilistines then in Bethlehem.","And David longed, and said:  O that some man would get me a drink\nof the water out of the cistern, that is in Bethlehem, by the gate.","And the three valiant men broke through the camp of the\nPhilistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, that was\nby the gate, and brought it to David:  but he would not drink, but\noffered it to the Lord,","Saying:  The Lord be merciful to me, that I may not do this:\nshall I drink the blood of these men that went, and the peril of their\nlives?  therefore he would not drink.  These things did these three\nmighty men.","Abisai also the brother of Joab, the son of Sarvia, was chief\namong three:  and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he\nslew, and he was renowned among the three,","And the noblest of three, and was their chief, but to the three\nfirst he attained not.","And Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant man, of great\ndeeds, of Cabseel:  he slew the two lions of Moab, and he went down, and\nslew a lion in the midst of a pit, in the time of snow.","He also slew an Egyptian, a man worthy to be a sight, having a\nspear in his hand:  but he went down to him with a rod, and forced the\nspear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slew him with his own spear.","These things did Banaias the son of Joiada.","And he was renowned among the three valiant men, who were the\nmost honourable among the thirty:  but he attained not to the first\nthree:  and David made him of his privy council.","Asael the brother of Joab was one of the thirty, Elehanan the\nson of Dodo of Bethlehem.","Semma of Harodi, Elica of Harodi,","Heles of Phalti, Hira the son of Acces of Thecua,","Abiezer of Anathoth, Mobonnai of Husati,","Selmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,","Heled the son of Baana, also a Netophathite, Ithai the son of\nRibai of Gabaath of the children of Benjamin,","Banaia the Pharathonite, Heddai of the torrent Gaas,","Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth of Beromi,","Eliaba of Salaboni.
