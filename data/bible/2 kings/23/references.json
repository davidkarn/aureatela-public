And the next day it was told us that the cities[fn-4-P450_84604:7-nf] of the two kings with a great host were coming against us. I therefore and Dan reigned ourselves to be Amorites, and went as allies into their city. And in the depth of night our brethren came, and we opened to them the gates; and we destroyed all the men and their substance, and we took for a prey all that was theirs, and their three walls we cast down. And we drew near to Thamna,[fn-4-P451_85116:8-nf] where was all the refuge of the hostile kings. Then having received hurt I was wroth, and charged upon them to the brow of the hill; and they slang at me with stones and darts; and had not Dan my brother aided me, they would have been able to slay me. We came upon them therefore with wrath, and they all fled; and passing by another way, they besought my father, and he made peace with them, and we did to them no hurt, but made a truce with them, and restored to them all the captives. And I built Thamna, and my father built Rhambael.[fn-4-P452_86223:9-nf] I was twenty years old when this war befell, and the Canaanites feared me and my brethren.","title":"IV.-The Testament of Judah Concerning Fortitude, and Love of Money, and Fornication.","author":"The Twelve Patriarchs"},{"chapter":23,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_21_lecture_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"28.
