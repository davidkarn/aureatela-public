And he\nanswered:  I am Siba thy servant.","And the king said:  Is there any one left of the house of Saul,\nthat I may shew the mercy of God unto Him?  And Siba said to the king:\nThere is a son of Jonathan left, who is lame of his feet.","Where is he?  said he.  And Siba said to the king:  Behold he is in\nthe house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lodabar.","Then King David sent, and brought him out of the house of Machir\nthe son of Ammiel of Lodabar.","And when Miphiboseth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul was come\nto David, he fell on his face and worshipped.  And David said:\nMiphiboseth?
