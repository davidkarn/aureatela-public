{"verses":["And Isboseth the son of Saul heard that Abner was slain in Hebron:\nand his hands were weakened, and all Israel was troubled.","Now the son of Saul had two men captains of his bands, the name of\nthe one was Baana, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Remmon\na Berothite of the children of Benjamin:  for Beroth also was reckoned\nin Benjamin.","And the Berothites fled into Gethaim, and were sojourners there\nuntil that time.","And Jonathan the son of Saul had a son that was lame of his feet:\nfor he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan\nfrom Jezrahel.  And his nurse took him up and fled:  and as she made\nhaste to flee, he fell and became lame:  and his name was Miphiboseth.","And the sons of Remmon the Berothite, Rechab and Baana coming,\nwent into the house of Isboseth in the heat of the day:  and he was\nsleeping upon his bed at noon.  And the doorkeeper of the house, who was\ncleansing wheat, was fallen asleep.","And they entered into the house secretly taking ears of corn, and\nRechab and Baana his brother stabbed him in the groin, and fled away.","For when they came into the house, he was sleeping upon his bed in\na parlour, and they struck him and killed him and taking away his head\nthey went off by the way of the wilderness, walking all night.","And they brought the head of Isboseth to David to Hebron:  and they\nsaid to the king:  Behold the head of Isboseth the son of Saul thy enemy\nwho sought thy life:  and the Lord hath revenged my lord the king this\nday of Saul, and of his seed.","But David answered Rechab, and Baana his brother, the sons of\nRemmon the Berothite, and said to them:  As the Lord liveth, who hath\ndelivered my soul out of all distress,","The man that told me, and said:  Saul is dead, who thought he\nbrought good tidings, I apprehended, and slew him in Siceleg, who\nshould have been rewarded for his news.","How much more now when wicked men have slain an innocent man in\nhis own house, upon his bed, shall I not require his blood at your\nhand, and take you away from the earth?","And David commanded his servants and they slew them:  and cutting\noff their hands and feet, hanged them up over the pool in Hebron:  but\nthe head of Isboseth they took and buried in the sepulchre of Abner in\nHebron."]}
