In regard to that woful compassion which I have mentioned, are those praised, and by king\nDavid blessed, who to the dry bones of Saul and Jonathan afforded mercy of sepulture.[fn-48-P4885_2402066:29-nf] But yet what mercy is that, which is afforded to\nthem that have feeling of nothing? Or haply is this to be challenged back to that conceit of an\ninfernal river which men unburied were not able to pass over? Far be this from the faith of\nChristians: else hath it gone most ill with so great a multitude of Martyrs, for whom there could be\nno burying of their bodies, and Truth did cheat them when It said, \"Fear not them which kill the\nbody, and after that have no more that they can do,\"[fn-48-P4886_2402573:30-nf] if these have been able to do to them so great\nevils, by which they were hindered to pass over to the places which they longed for. But, because\nthis without all doubt is most false, and it neither any whit hurts the faithful to have their bodies\ndenied sepulture, nor any whir the giving of sepulture unto infidels advantageth them; why then are\nthose who buried Saul and his son said to have done mercy, and for this are blessed by that godly\nking, but because it is a good affection with which the hearts of the pitiful are touched, when they\ngrieve for that in the dead bodies of other men, which, by that affection through which no man ever\nhateth his own flesh, they would not have done after their own death to their own bodies; and what\nthey would have done by them when they shall have no more feeling, that they take care to do by\nothers now having no feeling while themselves have yet feeling?","title":"On Care to Be Had for the Dead.","author":"Augustine"}]
