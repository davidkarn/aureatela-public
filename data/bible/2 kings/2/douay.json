{"verses":["And after these things David consulted the Lord, saying:  Shall I\ngo up into one of the cities of Juda?  And the Lord said to him:  Go up.\nAnd David said:  Whither shall I go up?  And he answered him:  Into\nHebron.","So David went up, and his two wives Achinoam the Jezrahelitess,\nand Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel:","And the men also that were with him, David brought up every man\nwith his household:  and they abode in the towns of Hebron.","And the men of Juda came, and anointed David there, to be king\nover the house of Juda.  And it was told David that the men of Jabes\nGalaad had buried Saul.","David therefore sent messengers to the men of Jabes Galaad, and\nsaid to them:  Blessed be you to the Lord, who have shewn this mercy to\nyour master Saul, and have buried him.","And now the Lord surely will render you mercy and truth, and I\nalso will requite you for this good turn, because you have done this\nthing.","Let your hands be strengthened, and be ye men of valour:  for\nalthough your master Saul be dead, yet the house of Juda hath anointed\nme to be their king.","But Abner the son of Ner, general of Saul's army, took Isboseth\nthe son of Saul, and led him about through the camp,","And made him king over Galaad, and over Gessuri, and over\nJezrahel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.","Isboseth the son of Saul was forty years old when he began to\nreign over Israel, and he reigned two years; and only the house of Juda\nfollowed David.","And the number of the days that David abode, reigning in Hebron\nover the house of Juda, was seven years and six months.","And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Isboseth the son of\nSaul, went out from the camp to Gabaon.","And Joab the son of Sarvia, and the servants of David went out,\nand met them by the pool of Gabaon.  And when they were come together,\nthey sat down over against one another:  the one on the one side of the\npool, and the other on the other side.","And Abner said to Joab:  Let the young men rise, and play before\nus.  And Joab answered:  Let them rise.","Then there arose and went over twelve in number of Benjamin, of\nthe part of Isboseth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of\nDavid.","And every one catching his fellow by the head, thrust his sword\ninto the side of his adversary, and they fell down together:  and the\nname of the place was called:  The field of the valiant, in Gabaon.","And there was a very fierce battle that day:  and Abner was put to\nflight, with the men of Israel, by the servants of David.","And there were the three sons of Sarvia there, Joab, and Abisai,\nand Asael:  now Asael was a most swift runner, like one of the roes that\nabide in the woods.","And Asael pursued after Abner, and turned not to the right hand\nnor to the left from following Abner.","And Abner looked behind him, and said:  Art thou Asael?  And he\nanswered:  I am.","And Abner said to him:  Go to the right hand or to the left, and\nlay hold on one of the young men and take thee his spoils.  But Asael\nwould not leave off following him close.","And again Abner said to Asael:  Go off, and do not follow me, lest\nI be obliged to stab thee to the ground, and I shall not be able to\nhold up my face to Joab thy brother.","But he refused to hearken to him, and would not turn aside:\nwherefore Abner struck him with his spear with a back stroke in the\ngroin, and thrust him through, and he died upon the spot:  and all that\ncame to the place where Asael fell down and died stood still.","Now while Joab and Abisai pursued after Abner, the sun went down:\nand they came as far as the hill of the aqueduct, that lieth over\nagainst the valley by the way of the wilderness in Gabaon.","And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together to\nAbner:  and being joined in one body, they stood on the top of a hill.","And Abner cried out to Joab, and said:  Shall thy sword rage unto\nutter destruction?  knowest thou not that it is dangerous to drive\npeople to despair?  how long dost thou defer to bid the people cease\nfrom pursuing after their brethren?","And Joab said:  As the Lord liveth, if thou hadst spoke sooner,\neven in the morning the people should have retired from pursuing after\ntheir brethren.","Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the army stood still, and\ndid not pursue after Israel any farther, nor fight any more.","And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plains:\nand they passed the Jordan, and having gone through all Beth-horon,\ncame to the camp.","And Joab returning, after he had left Abner, assembled all the\npeople:  and there were wanting of David's servants nineteen men, beside\nAsael.","But the servants of David had killed of Benjamin, and of the men\nthat were with Abner, three hundred and sixty, who all died.","And they took Asael, and buried him in the sepulchre of his\nfather in Bethlehem and Joab, and the men that were with him, marched\nall the night, and they came to Hebron at break of day."]}
