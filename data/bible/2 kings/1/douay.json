{"verses":["Now it came to pass, after Saul was dead, that David returned from\nthe slaughter of the Amalecites, and abode two days in Siceleg.","And on the third day, there appeared a man who came out of Saul's\ncamp, with his garments rent, and dust strewed on his head:  and when he\ncame to David, he fell upon his face, and adored.","And David said to him:  From whence comest thou?  And he said to\nhim:  I am fled out of the camp of Israel.","And David said unto him:  What is the matter that is come to pass?\ntell me:  He said:  The people are fled from the battle, and many of the\npeople are fallen and dead:  moreover Saul and Jonathan his son are\nslain.","And David said to the young man that told him:  How knowest thou\nthat Saul and Jonathan his son, are dead?","And the young man that told him, said:  I came by chance upon mount\nGelboe, and Saul leaned upon his spear:  and the chariots and horsemen\ndrew nigh unto him,","And looking behind him, and seeing me, he called me.  And I\nanswered, Here am I.","And he said to me:  Who art thou?  And I said to him:  I am an\nAmalecite.","And he said to me:  Stand over me, and kill me:  for anguish is come\nupon me, and as yet my whole life is in me.","So standing over him, I killed him:  for I knew that he could not\nlive after the fall:  and I took the diadem that was on his head, and\nthe bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither to thee,\nmy lord.","Then David took hold of his garments and rent them, and likewise\nall the men that were with him.","And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening for Saul,\nand for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the\nhouse of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword.","And David said to the young man that told him:  Whence art thou?\nHe answered:  I am the son of a stranger of Amalec.","David said to him:  Why didst thou not fear to put out thy hand to\nkill the Lord's anointed?","And David calling one of his servants, said:  Go near and fall\nupon him.  And he struck him so that he died.","And David said to him:  Thy blood be upon thy own head:  for thy\nown mouth hath spoken against thee, saying:  I have slain the Lord's\nanointed.","And David made this kind of lamentation over Saul, and over\nJonathan his son.","(Also he commanded that they should teach the children of Juda\nthe use of the bow, as it is written in the book of the just.)  And he\nsaid:  Consider, O Israel, for them that are dead, wounded on thy high\nplaces.","The illustrious of Israel are slain upon thy mountains:  how are\nthe valiant fallen?","Tell it not in Geth, publish it not in the streets of Ascalon:\nlest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of\nthe uncircumcised triumph.","Ye mountains of Gelboe, let neither dew, nor rain come upon you,\nneither be they fields of firstfruits:  for there was cast away the\nshield of the valiant, the shield of Saul as though he had not been\nanointed with oil.","From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the valiant, the\narrow of Jonathan never turned back, and the sword of Saul did not\nreturn empty.","Saul and Jonathan, lovely, and comely in their life, even in\ndeath they were not divided:  they were swifter than eagles, stronger\nthan lions.","Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you with\nscarlet in delights, who gave ornaments of gold for your attire.","How are the valiant fallen in battle?  Jonathan slain in the high\nplaces?","I grieve for thee, my brother Jonathan:  exceeding beautiful, and\namiable to me above the love of women.  As the mother loveth her only\nson, so did I love thee.","How are the valiant fallen, and the weapons of war perished?"]}
