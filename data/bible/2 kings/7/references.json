He shall build me a house for my name, and I will set up His throne for ever; and I will be to Him for a father, and He shall be to me for a son; and His house shall be established,[fn-13-P1320_570070:142-nf] and His kingdom for ever.\" But the reason why the Jews did not understand these things was this, because Solomon the son of David built a temple for God, and the city which he called from his own name, Jerusalem.[fn-13-P1321_570349:143-nf] Therefore they referred the predictions of the prophets to him. Now Solomon received the government of the kingdom from his father himself. But the prophets spoke of Him who was then born after that David had slept with his fathers. Besides, the reign of Solomon was not everlasting; for he reigned forty years. In the next place, Solomon was never called the son of God, but the son of David; and the house which he built was not firmly established,[fn-13-P1322_571099:144-nf] as the Church, which is the true temple of God, which does not consist of walls, but of the heart[fn-13-P1323_571239:145-nf] and faith of the men who believe on Him, and are called faithful. But that temple of Solomon, inasmuch as it was built by the hand, fell by the hand. Lastly, his father, in the cxxvith Psalm, prophesied in this manner respecting the works of his son:[fn-13-P1324_571566:146-nf] \"Except the Lord build the house, they have laboured in vain that built it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman hath waked but in vain.\"","title":"Book IV.

But now, indeed, philosophers have made for themselves, according to the pleasure of each, their own ideals of a blessed life; that they might be able, as it were by their own power, to do that, which by the common conditions of mortals they were not able to do,-namely, to live as they would. For they felt that no one could be blessed otherwise than by having what he would, and by suffering nothing which he would not. And who would not will, that the life whatsoever it be, with which he is delighted, and which he therefore calls blessed, were so in his own power, that he could have it continually? And yet who is in this condition? Who wills to suffer troubles in order that he may endure them manfully, although he both wills and is able to endure them if he does suffer them? Who would will to live in torments, even although he is able to live laudably by holding fast to righteousness in the midst of them through patience? They who have endured these evils, either in wishing to have or in fearing to lose what they loved, whether wickedly or laudably, have thought of them as transitory. For many have stretched boldly through transitory evils to good things which will last. And these, doubtless, are blessed through hope, even while actually suffering such transitory evils, through which they arrive at good things which will not be transitory. But he who is blessed through hope is not yet blessed: for he expects, through patience, a blessedness which he does not yet grasp. Whereas he, on the other hand, who is tormented without any such hope, without any such reward, let him use as much endurance as he pleases, is not truly blessed, but bravely miserable. For he is not on that account not miserable, because he would be more so if he also bore misery impatiently. Further, even if he does not suffer those things which he would not will to suffer in his own body, not even then is he to be esteemed blessed, inasmuch as he does not live as he wills. For to omit other things, which, while the body remains unhurt, belong to those annoyances of the mind, without which we should will to live, and which are innumerable; he would will, at any rate, if he were able, so to have his body safe and sound, and so to suffer no inconveniences from it, as to have it within his own control, or even to have it with an imperishableness of the body itself; and because he does not possess this, and hangs in doubt about it, he certainly does not live as he wills.

When many things had gone prosperously with king David, he thought to make a house for God, even that temple of most excellent renown which was afterwards built by king Solomon his son. While he was thinking of this, the word of the Lord came to Nathan the prophet, which he brought to the king, in which, after God had said that a house should not be built unto Him by David himself, and that in all that long time He had never commanded any of His people to build Him a house of cedar, he says, \"And now thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith God Almighty, I took thee from the sheepcote that thou mightest be for a ruler over my people in Israel: and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thy face, and have made thee a name, according to the name of the great ones who are over the earth.

And if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men: but my mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it away from those whom I put away from before my face.

I have found David my servant, and with my holy oil I have anointed him. For mine hand shall help him, and mine arm shall strengthen him. The enemy shall not prevail against him, and the son of iniquity shall harm him no more. And I will beat down his foes from before his face, and those that hate him will I put to flight. And my truth and my mercy shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted. I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the undertaker of my salvation. Also I will make him my first-born, high among the kings of the earth.

His seed also will I set for ever and ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.\"[fn-31-P3124_1730099:68-nf] Which words, when rightly understood, are all understood to be about the Lord Jesus Christ, under the name of David, on account of the form of a servant, which the same Mediator assumed[fn-31-P3125_1730310:69-nf] from the virgin of the seed of David.[fn-31-P3126_1730366:70-nf] For immediately something is said about the sins of his children, such as is set down in the Book of Samuel, and is more readily taken as if of Solomon. For there, that is, in the Book of Samuel, he says, \"And if he commit iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men; but my mercy will I not take away from him,\"[fn-31-P3127_1730758:71-nf] meaning by stripes the strokes of correction. Hence that saying, \"Touch ye not my christs.\"[fn-31-P3128_1730875:72-nf] For what else is that than, Do not harm them? But in the psalm, when speaking as if of David, He says something of the same kind there too. \"If his children,\" saith He, \"forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they profane my righteousnesses, and keep not my commandments; I will visit their iniquities with the rod, and their faults with stripes: but my mercy I will not make void from him.\"[fn-31-P3129_1731295:73-nf] a He did not say \"from them,\" although He spoke of his children, not of himself; but he said \"from him,\" which means the same thing if rightly understood. For of Christ Himself, who is the head of the Church, there could not be found any sins which required to be divinely restrained by human correction, mercy being still continued; but they are found in His body and members, which is His people. Therefore in the Book of Samuel it is said, \"iniquity of Him,\" but in the psalm, \"of His children,\" that we may understand that what is said of His body is in some way said of Himself. Wherefore also, when Saul persecuted His body, that is, His believing people, He Himself saith from heaven, \"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\"[fn-31-P3130_1732050:74-nf] Then in the following words of the psalm He says, \"Neither will I hurt in my truth, nor profane my covenant, and the things that proceed from my lips I will not disallow. Once have I sworn by my holiness, if I lie unto David,\"[fn-31-P3131_1732295:75-nf] -that is, I will in no wise lie unto David; for Scripture is wont to speak thus. But what that is in which He will not lie, He adds, saying, \"His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me, and as the moon perfected for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.\"[fn-31-P3132_1732603:76-nf] ","title":"Book XVII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_23_book_xvii","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But the rest of this psalm runs thus: \"Where are Thine ancient compassions, Lord, which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth? Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, which I have borne in my bosom of many nations; wherewith Thine enemies have reproached, O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the change of Thy Christ.\"[fn-31-P3153_1738556:88-nf] Now it may with very good reason be asked whether this is spoken in the person of those Israelites who desired that the promise made to David might be fulfilled to them; or rather of the Christians, who are Israelites not after the flesh but after the Spirit.[fn-31-P3154_1738840:89-nf] This certainly was spoken or written in the time of Ethan, from whose name this psalm gets its title, and that was the same as the time of David's reign; and therefore it would not have been said, \"Where are Thine ancient compassions, Lord, which Thou hast sworn unto David in Thy truth?\" unless the prophet had assumed the person of those who should come long afterwards, to whom that time when these things were promised to David was ancient. But it may be understood thus, that many nations, when they persecuted the Christians, reproached them with the passion of Christ, which Scripture calls His change, because by dying He is made immortal. The change of Christ, according to this passage, may also be understood to be reproached by the Israelites, because, when they hoped He would be theirs, He was made the Saviour of the nations; and many nations who have believed in Him by the New Testament now reproach them who remain in the old with this: so that it is said, \"Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants;\" because through the Lord's not forgetting, but rather pitying them, even they after this reproach are to believe. But what I have put first seems to me the most suitable meaning. For to the enemies of Christ who are reproached with this, that Christ hath left them, turning to the Gentiles,[fn-31-P3155_1740177:90-nf] this speech is incongruously assigned, \"Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants,\" for such Jews are not to be styled the servants of God; but these words fit those who, if they suffered great humiliations through persecution for the name of Christ, could call to mind that an exalted kingdom had been promised to the seed of David, and in desire of it, could say not despairingly, but as asking, seeking, knocking,[fn-31-P3156_1740618:91-nf] \"Where are Thine ancient compassions, Lord, which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth? Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, that I have borne in my bosom of many nations;\" that is, have patiently endured in my inward parts. \"That Thine enemies have reproached, O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the change of Thy Christ,\" not thinking it a change, but a consumption.[fn-31-P3157_1741023:92-nf] But what does \"Remember, Lord,\" mean, but that Thou wouldst have compassion, and wouldst for my patiently borne humiliation reward me with the excellency which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth? But if we assign these words to the Jews, those servants of God who, on the conquest of the earthly Jerusalem, before Jesus Christ was born after the manner of men, were led into captivity, could say such things, understanding the change of Christ, because indeed through Him was to be surely expected, not an earthly and carnal felicity, such as appeared during the few years of king Solomon, but a heavenly and spiritual felicity; and when the nations, then ignorant of this through unbelief, exulted over and insulted the people of God for being captives, what else was this than ignorantly to reproach with the change of Christ those who understand the change of Christ? And therefore what follows when this psalm is concluded, \"Let the blessing of the Lord be for evermore, amen, amen,\" is suitable enough for the whole people of God belonging to the heavenly Jerusalem, whether for those things that lay hid in the Old Testament before the New was revealed, or for those that, being now revealed in the New Testament, are manifestly discerned to belong to Christ. For the blessing of the Lord in the seed of David does not belong to any particular time, such as appeared in the days of Solomon, but is for evermore to be hoped for, in which most certain hope it is said, \"Amen, amen;\" for this repetition of the word is the confirmation of that hope. Therefore David understanding this, says in the second Book of Kings, in the passage from which we digressed to this psalm,[fn-31-P3158_1742741:93-nf] \"Thou hast spoken also for Thy servant's house for a great while to come.\"[fn-31-P3159_1742845:94-nf] Therefore also a little after he says, \"Now begin, and bless the house of Thy servant for evermore,\" etc., because the son was then about to be born from whom his posterity should be continued to Christ, through whom his house should be eternal, and should also be the house of God. For it is called the house of David on account of David's race; but the selfsame is called the house of God on account of the temple of God, made of men, not of stones, where shall dwell for evermore the people with and in their God, and God with and in His people, so that God may fill His people, and the people be filled with their God, while God shall be all in all, Himself their reward in peace who is their strength in war. Therefore, when it is said in the words of Nathan, \"And the Lord will tell thee what an house thou shalt build for Him,\"[fn-31-P3160_1743701:95-nf] it is afterwards said in the words of David, \"For Thou, Lord Almighty, God of Israel, hast opened the ear of Thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house.\"[fn-31-P3161_1743881:96-nf] For this house is built both by us through living well, and by God through helping us to live well; for \"except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it.\"[fn-31-P3162_1744074:97-nf] And when the final dedication of this house shall take place, then what God here says by Nathan shall be fulfilled, \"And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant him, and he shall dwell apart, and shall be troubled no more; and the son of iniquity shall not humble him any more, as from the beginning, from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel.\"[fn-31-P3163_1744478:98-nf] ","title":"Book XVII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_23_book_xvii","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But the rest of this psalm runs thus: \"Where are Thine ancient compassions, Lord, which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth?

Can any one think it was fulfilled in the peace of Solomon's reign? Scripture certainly commends that peace with excellent praise as a shadow of that which is to come. But this opinion is to be vigilantly opposed, since after it is said, \"And the son of iniquity shall not humble him any more,\" it is immediately added, \"as from the beginning, from the days in which I appointed judges over my people Israel.\"[fn-31-P3167_1745119:99-nf] For the judges were appointed over that people from the time when they received the land of promise, before kings had begun to be there. And certainly the son of iniquity, that is, the foreign enemy, humbled him through periods of time in which we read that peace alternated with wars; and in that period longer times of peace are found than Solomon had, who reigned forty years. For under that judge who is called Ehud there were eighty years of peace.[fn-31-P3168_1745599:100-nf] Be it far from us, therefore, that we should believe the times of Solomon are predicted in this promise, much less indeed those of any other king whatever. For none other of them reigned in such great peace as he; nor did that nation ever at all hold that kingdom so as to have no anxiety lest it should be subdued by enemies: for in the very great mutability of human affairs such great security is never given to any people, that it should not dread invasions hostile to this life.

This has proved Him to be such a one as prophecy announced He should be, so that He ought not to be regarded in any other character than that which prediction assigned to Him; and the result of this agreement between the facts of His course and the Scriptures of the Creator should be the restoration of belief in them from that prejudice which has, by contributing to diversity of opinion, either thrown doubt upon, or led to a denial of, a considerable part of them And now we go further and build up the superstructure of those kindred events[fn-51-P5107_1605260:281-nf] out of the Scriptures of the Creator which were predicted and destined to happen after Christ. For the dispensation would not be found complete, if He had not come after whom it had to run on its course.[fn-51-P5108_1605481:282-nf] Look at all nations from the vortex of human error emerging out of it up to the Divine Creator, the Divine Christ, and deny Him to be the object of prophecy, if you dare. At once there will occur to you the Father's promise in the Psalms: \"Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.\"[fn-51-P5109_1605911:283-nf] You will not be able to put in a claim for some son of David being here meant, rather than Christ; or for the ends of the earth being promised to David, whose kingdom was confined to the Jewish nation simply, rather than to Christ, who now embraces the whole world in the faith of His gospel. So again He says by Isaiah: \"I have given Thee for a dispensation of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind,\" that is, those that be in error, \"to bring out the prisoners from the prison,\" that is, to free them from sin, \"and from the prison-house,\" that is, of death, \"those that sit in darkness\"-even that of ignorance.[fn-51-P5110_1606576:284-nf] If these things are accomplished through Christ, they would not have been designed in prophecy for any other than Him through whom they have their accomplishment. In another passage He also says: \"Behold, I have set Him as a testimony to the nations, a prince and commander to the nations; nations which know Thee not shall invoke Thee, and peoples shall run together unto Thee.\"[fn-51-P5111_1606979:285-nf] You will not interpret these words of David, because He previously said, \"I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.\"[fn-51-P5112_1607153:286-nf] Indeed, you will be obliged from these words all the more to understand that Christ is reckoned to spring from David by carnal descent, by reason of His birth[fn-51-P5113_1607331:287-nf] of the Virgin Mary. Touching this promise of Him, there is the oath to David in the psalm, \"Of the fruit of thy body[fn-51-P5114_1607479:288-nf] will I set upon thy throne.\"[fn-51-P5115_1607532:289-nf] What body is meant? David's own? Certainly not. For David was not to give birth to a son.[fn-51-P5116_1607645:290-nf] Nor his wife's either. For instead of saying, \"Of the fruit of thy body,\" he would then have rather said, \"Of the fruit of thy wife's body.\" But by mentioning his[fn-51-P5117_1607854:291-nf] body, it follows that He pointed to some one of his race of whose body the flesh of Christ was to be the fruit, which bloomed forth from[fn-51-P5118_1608006:292-nf] Mary's womb. He named the fruit of the body (womb) alone, because it was peculiarly fruit of the womb, of the womb only in fact, and not of the husband also; and he refers the womb (body) to David, as to the chief of the race and father of the family. Because it could not consist with a virgin's condition to consort her with a husband,[fn-51-P5119_1608363:293-nf] He therefore attributed the body (womb) to the father. That new dispensation, then, which is found in Christ now, will prove to be what the Creator then promised under the appellation of \"the sure mercies of David,\" which were Christ's, inasmuch as Christ sprang from David, or rather His very flesh itself was David's \"sure mercies,\" consecrated by religion, and \"sure\" after its resurrection. Accordingly the prophet Nathan, in the first of Kings,[fn-51-P5120_1608836:294-nf] makes a promise to David for his seed, \"which shall proceed,\" says he, \"out of thy bowels.\"[fn-51-P5121_1609122:295-nf] Now, if you explain this simply of Solomon, you will send me into a fit of laughter. For David will evidently have brought forth Solomon! But is not Christ here designated the seed of David, as of that womb which was derived from David, that is, Mary's? Now, because Christ rather than any other[fn-51-P5122_1609474:296-nf] was to build the temple of God, that is to say, a holy manhood, wherein God's Spirit might dwell as in a better temple, Christ rather than David's son Solomon was to be looked for as[fn-51-P5123_1609671:297-nf] the Son of God. Then, again, the throne for ever with the kingdom for ever is more suited to Christ than to Solomon, a mere temporal king. From Christ, too, God's mercy did not depart, whereas on Solomon even God's anger alighted, after his luxury and idolatry. For Satan[fn-51-P5124_1609963:298-nf] stirred up an Edomite as an enemy against him. Since, therefore, nothing of these things is compatible with Solomon, but only with Christ, the method of our interpretations will certainly be true; and the very issue of the facts shows that they were clearly predicted of Christ. And so in Him we shall have \"the sure mercies of David.\" Him, not David, has God appointed for a testimony to the nations; Him, for a prince and commander to the nations, not David, who ruled over Israel alone. It is Christ whom all nations now invoke, which knew Him not; Christ to whom all races now betake themselves, whom they were ignorant of before. It is impossible that that should be said to be future, which you see (daily) coming to pass.","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_23_book_i_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"67.

The fourth rule of Tichonius is about species and genus. For so he calls it, intending that by species should be understood a part, by genus the whole of which that which he calls species is a part: as, for example, every single city is a part of the great society of nations: the city he calls a species, all nations constitute the genus. There is no necessity for here applying that subtilty of distinction which is in use among logicians, who discuss with great acuteness the difference between a part and a species. The rule is of course the same, if anything of the kind referred to is found in Scripture, not in regard to a single city, but in regard to a single province, or tribe, or kingdom. Not only, for example, about Jerusalem, or some of the cities of the Gentiles, such as Tyre or Babylon, are things said in Scripture whose significance oversteps the limits of the city, and which are more suitable when applied to all nations; but in regard to Judea also, and Egypt, and Assyria, or any other nation you choose to take which contains numerous cities, but still is not the whole world, but only a part of it, things are said which pass over the limits of that particular country, and apply more fitly to the whole of which this is a part; or, as our author terms it, to the genus of which this is a species. And hence these words have come to be commonly known, so that even uneducated people understand what is laid down specially, and what generally, in any given Imperial command. The same thing occurs in the case of men: things are said of Solomon, for example, the scope of which reaches far beyond him, and which are only properly understood when applied to Christ and His Church, of which Solomon is a part.[fn-52-P5241_2782922:77-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"}]
