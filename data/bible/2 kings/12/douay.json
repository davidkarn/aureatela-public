{"verses":["And the Lord sent Nathan to David:  and when he was come to him,\nhe said to him:  There were two men in one city, the one rich, and the\nother poor.","The rich man had exceeding many sheep and oxen.","But the poor man had nothing at all but one little ewe lamb,\nwhich he had bought and nourished up, and which had grown up in his\nhouse together with his children, eating of his bread, and drinking of\nhis cup, and sleeping in his bosom:  and it was unto him as a daughter.","And when a certain stranger was come to the rich man, he spared\nto take of his own sheep and oxen, to make a feast for that stranger,\nwho was come to him, but took the poor man's ewe, and dressed it for\nthe man that was come to him.","And David's anger being exceedingly kindled against that man, he\nsaid to Nathan:  As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this is a\nchild of death.","He shall restore the ewe fourfold, because he did this thing, and\nhad no pity.","And Nathan said to David:  Thou art the man.  Thus saith the Lord\nthe God of Israel:  I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered\nthee from the hand of Saul,","And gave thee thy master's house and thy master's wives into thy\nbosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and Juda:  and if these things\nbe little, I shall add far greater things unto thee.","Why therefore hast thou despised the word of the Lord, to do evil\nin my sight?  Thou hast killed Urias the Hethite with the sword, and\nhast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword\nof the children of Ammon.","Therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house, because\nthou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Urias the Hethite to\nbe thy wife.","Thus saith the Lord:  Behold, I will raise up evil against thee\nout of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy eyes and\ngive them to thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the\nsight of this sun.","For thou didst it secretly:  but I will do this thing in the\nsight of all Israel, and in the sight of the sun.","And David said to Nathan:  I have sinned against the Lord.  And\nNathan said to David:  The Lord also hath taken away thy sin:  thou shalt\nnot die.","Nevertheless, because thou hast given occasion to the enemies of\nthe Lord to blaspheme, for this thing, the child that is born to thee,\nshall surely die.","And Nathan returned to his house.  The Lord also struck the child\nwhich the wife of Urias had borne to David, and his life was despaired\nof.","And David besought the Lord for the child:  and David kept a\nfast, and going in by himself lay upon the ground.","And the ancients of his house came, to make him rise from the\nground:  but he would not, neither did he eat meat with them.","And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died:  and\nthe servants of David feared to tell him, that the child was dead.  For\nthey said:  Behold when the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he\nwould not hearken to our voice:  how much more will he afflict himself\nif we tell him that the child is dead?","But when David saw his servants whispering, he understood that\nthe child was dead:  and he said to his servants:  Is the child dead?\nThey answered him He is dead.","Then David arose from the ground, and washed and anointed\nhimself:  and when he had changed his apparel, he went into the house of\nthe Lord:  and worshipped, and then he came into his own house, and he\ncalled for bread, and ate.","And his servants said to him:  What thing is this that thou hast\ndone?  thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive, but\nwhen the child was dead, thou didst rise up, and eat bread.","And he said:  While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept\nfor him:  for I said:  Who knoweth whether the Lord may not give him to\nme, and the child may live?","But now that he is dead, why should I fast?  Shall I be able to\nbring him back any more?  I shall go to him rather:  but he shall not\nreturn to me.","And David comforted Bethsabee his wife, and went in unto her,\nand slept with her:  and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon,\nand the Lord loved him.","And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his\nname, Amiable to the Lord, because the Lord loved him.","And Joab fought against Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and\nlaid close siege to the royal city.","And Joab sent messengers to David, saying:  I have fought against\nRabbath, and the city of waters is about to be taken.","Now therefore gather thou the rest of the people together, and\nbesiege the city and take it:  lest when the city shall be wasted by me,\nthe victory be ascribed to my name.","Then David gathered all the people together, and went out\nagainst Rabbath:  and after fighting, he took it.","And he took the crown of their king from his head, the weight of\nwhich was a talent of gold, set with most precious stones, and it was\nput upon David's head, and the spoils of the city which were very great\nhe carried away.","And bringing forth the people thereof he sawed them, and drove\nover them chariots armed with iron:  and divided them with knives, and\nmade them pass through brickkilns:  so did he to all the cities of the\nchildren of Ammon:  and David returned, with all the army to Jerusalem."]}
