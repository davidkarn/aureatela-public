{"verses":["If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of\ncharity, if any society of the spirit, if any bowels of commiseration:","Fulfil ye my joy, that you be of one mind, having the same\ncharity, being of one accord, agreeing in sentiment.","Let nothing be done through contention:  neither by vain glory.  But\nin humility, let each esteem others better than themselves:","Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those\nthat are other men's.","For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:","Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal\nwith God:","But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in\nthe likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.","He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the\ndeath of the cross.","For which cause, God also hath exalted him and hath given him a\nname which is above all names:","That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that\nare in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:","And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ\nis in the glory of God the Father.","Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as\nin my presence only but much more now in my absence) with fear and\ntrembling work out your salvation.","For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish,\naccording to his good will.","And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations:","That you may be blameless and sincere children of God, without\nreproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation:  among whom\nyou shine as lights in the world.","Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ:\nbecause I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.","Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of\nyour faith, I rejoice and congratulate with you all.","And for the selfsame thing, do you also rejoice and congratulate\nwith me.","And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly,\nthat I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning\nyou.","For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection\nis solicitous for you.","For all seek the things that are their own not the things that\nare Jesus Christ's.","Now know ye the proof of him:  that as a son with the father, so\nhath he served with me in the gospel.","Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately:  so soon as I\nshall see how it will go with me.","And I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come to you\nshortly.","But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my\nbrother and fellow labourer and fellow soldier, but your apostle:  and\nhe that hath ministered to my wants.","For indeed he longed after you all:  and was sad, for that you had\nheard that he was sick.","For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death:  but God had mercy on\nhim.  And not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow\nupon sorrow.","Therefore, I sent him the more speedily:  that seeing him again,\nyou may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.","Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord:  and treat with\nhonour such as he is.","Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death:\ndelivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was\nwanting towards my service."]}
