{"verses":["As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord.  To write the\nsame things to you, to me indeed is not wearisome, but to you is\nnecessary.","Beware of dogs:  beware of evil workers:  beware of the concision.","For we are the circumcision, who in spirit serve God and glory in\nChrist Jesus, not having confidence in the flesh.","Though I might also have confidence in the flesh.  If any other\nthinketh he may have confidence in the flesh, I more:","Being circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the\ntribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews.  According to the law, a\nPharisee:","According to zeal, persecuting the church of God:  According to the\njustice that is in the law, conversing without blame.","But the things that were gain to me, the same I have counted loss\nfor Christ.","Furthermore, I count all things to be but loss for the excellent\nknowledge of Jesus Christ, my Lord:  for whom I have suffered the loss\nof all things and count them but as dung, that I may gain Christ.","And may be found in him, not having my justice, which is of the\nlaw, but that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus, which is of God:\njustice in faith.","That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the\nfellowship of his sufferings:  being made conformable to his death,","If by any means I may attain to the resurrection which is from\nthe dead.","Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect:\nbut I follow after, if I may by any means apprehend, wherein I am also\napprehended by Christ Jesus.","Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended.  But one\nthing I do:  Forgetting the things that are behind and stretching forth\nmyself to those that are before,","I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation\nof God in Christ Jesus.","Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded:  and if\nin any thing you be otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you,","Nevertheless, whereunto we are come, that we be of the same mind,\nlet us also continue in the same rule.","Be ye followers of me, brethren:  and observe them who walk so as\nyou have our model.","For many walk, of whom I have told you often (and now tell you\nweeping) that they are enemies of the cross of Christ:","Whose end is destruction:  whose God is their belly:  and whose\nglory is in their shame:  who mind earthly things.","But our conversation is in heaven:  from whence also we look for\nthe Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ,","Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of\nhis glory, according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue\nall things unto himself."]}
