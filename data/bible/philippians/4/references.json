But why do I linger over old and forgotten matters, seeking to excuse a fault for which Fabiola has herself confessed her penitence? Who would believe that, after the death of her second husband at a time when most widows, having shaken off the yoke of servitude, grow careless and allow themselves more liberty than ever, frequenting the baths, flitting through the streets, shewing their harlot faces everywhere; that at this time Fabiola came to herself? Yet it was then that she put on sackcloth to make public confession of her error. It was then that in the presence of all Rome (in the basilica which formerly belonged to that Lateranus who perished by the sword of Caesar[fn-32-P3218_843271:2332-nf] ) she stood in the ranks of the penitents and exposed before bishop, presbyters, and people-all of whom wept when they saw her weep-her dishevelled hair, pale features, soiled hands and unwashed neck. What sins would such a penance fail to purge away? What ingrained stains would such tears be unable to wash out? By a threefold confession Peter blotted out his threefold denial.[fn-32-P3219_843887:2333-nf] If Aaron committed sacrilege by fashioning molten gold into the head of a calf, his brother's prayers made amends for his transgressions.[fn-32-P3220_844070:2334-nf] If holy David, meekest of men, committed the double sin of murder and adultery, he atoned for it by a fast of seven days. He lay upon the earth, he rolled in the ashes, he forgot his royal power, he sought for light in the darkness.[fn-32-P3221_844330:2335-nf] And then, turning his eyes to that God whom he had so deeply offended, he cried with a lamentable voice: \"Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight,\" and \"Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit.\"[fn-32-P3222_844618:2336-nf] He who by his virtues teaches me how to stand and not to fall, by his penitence teaches me how, if I fall, I may rise again.

Yet when Ahab heard these words \"he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted ...in sackcloth, and went softly.\"[fn-32-P3225_845376:2339-nf] Then came the word of God to Elijah the Tishbite saying: \"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? Because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days.\"[fn-32-P3226_845584:2340-nf] O happy penitence which has drawn down upon itself the eyes of God, and which has by confessing its error changed the sentence of God's anger! The same conduct is in the Chronicles[fn-32-P3227_845802:2341-nf] attributed to Manasseh, and in the book of the prophet Jonah[fn-32-P3228_845910:2342-nf] to Nineveh, and in the gospel to the publican.[fn-32-P3229_845982:2343-nf] The first of these not only was allowed to obtain forgiveness but also recovered his kingdom, the second broke the force of God's impending wrath, while the third, smiting his breast with his hands, \"would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven.\" Yet for all that the publican with his humble confession of his faults went back justified far more than the Pharisee with his arrogant boasting of his virtues. This is not however the place to preach penitence, neither am I writing against Montanus and Novatus.[fn-32-P3230_846520:2344-nf] Else would I say of it that it is \"a sacrifice ...well pleasing to God,\"[fn-32-P3231_846690:2345-nf] I would cite the words of the psalmist: \"the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,\"[fn-32-P3232_846796:2346-nf] and those of Ezekiel \"I prefer the repentance of a sinner rather than his death,\"[fn-32-P3233_846899:2347-nf] and those of Baruch, \"Arise, arise, O Jerusalem,\"[fn-32-P3234_846979:2348-nf] and many other proclamations madeby the trumpets of the prophets.

Nay more, we must do good if we are to depart from evil. We must seek peace if we are to avoid war.

For the apostle also says, \"If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ;\"[fn-5-P597_213482:6-nf] while he says in another place, \"Please all men in all things, even as I also please all men in all things.\"[fn-5-P598_213606:7-nf] And they who do not understand this think it a contradiction; while the explanation is, that he has said he does not please men, because he was accustomed to act rightly, not with the express design of pleasing men, but of pleasing God, to the love of whom he wished to turn men's hearts by that very thing in which he was pleasing men. Therefore he was both right in saying that he did not please men, because in that very thing he aimed at pleasing God: and right in authoritatively teaching that we ought to please men, not in order that this should be sought for as the reward of our good deeds; but because the man who would not offer himself for imitation to those whom he wished to be saved, could not please God; but no man possibly can imitate one who has not pleased him. As, therefore, that man would not speak absurdly who should say, In this work of seeking a ship, it is not a ship, but my native country, that I seek: so the apostle also might fitly say, In this work of pleasing men, it is not men, but God, that I please; because I do not aim at pleasing men, but have it as my object, that those whom I wish to be saved may imitate me. Just as he says of an offering that is made for the saints, \"Not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit;\"[fn-5-P599_214892:8-nf] i.e., In seeking your gift, I seek not it, but your fruit.

But if we that are evil pass this judgment, consider what sentence she obtained from that God who is a lover of mankind; and how much, even before God's gifts, her repentance caused her to reap in the way of blessing.","title":"Homily VI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"38.

For in heaven there is unbroken peace, both between all the intelligent creatures that exist there, and between these and their Creator.

Remember Adam and Eve fell when they were virgins, and that the perfect purity of their bodies did not profit them when they sinned. The virgin who sins is to be compared to Eve, and not to Mary. We do not deny that, in the present life, there is the remedy of repentance, but we remind you rather to hope for reward, than to look for pardon. For it is disgraceful that those should ask for indulgence who are expecting the crown of virginity,and that those should commit anything unlawful who have even cut themselves off from things lawful; for it must be remembered that it is lawful to contract an alliance by marriage. And as those are to be praised who, from love to Christ, and for the glory of the kingdom of heaven, have despised the tie of wedlock, so those are to be condemned who, through the pleasure of incontinence, after they have vowed themselves to God, have recourse to the Apostolic remedy. Therefore, as we have said, those who decline marriage despise not things unlawful, but things lawful. And if that class of people swear, if they speak evil of others, if they are detractors, or if they patiently listen to detractors, if they return evil for evil, if they incur the charge of covetousness with respect to other people's property, or of avarice in regard to their own, if they cherish the poison of revenge or envy, if they either say or think anything unbefitting against the institutions of the law orthe Apostles, if with a desire of pleasing in the flesh, they exhibit themselves dressed up and adorned, if they do any other unlawful things, as is only too common, what will it profit them to have spurned what is lawful, while they practice what is not lawful?If you wish it to be of advantage to you, that you have despised things lawful, take care that you do not any of those things which are not lawful. For, it is foolish to have dreaded that which is in its nature less, and not to dread that which is intrinsically more [or not to avoid those things[fn-7-P774_313004:19-nf] which are inter- dicted, while such things as are permitted meet with contempt]. For the Apostle says, \"She that is unmarried careth for the things of the Lord, how she may please God, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she who is married careth for the things of this world, how she may please[fn-7-P775_313335:20-nf] her husband.\" He thus affirms that the married woman pleases her husband by thinking of worldly things, while the unmarried woman pleases God, inasmuch as she has no anxiety about the things of the world. Let him tell me, then, whom she desires to please, who has no husband, and yet cares for the things of the world? Shall not the married woman, in such a case, be preferred to her? Yes, since she by caring for the things of the world pleases at least her husband, but the other neither pleases her husband, since she does not have one, nor can she please God.[fn-7-P776_313989:21-nf] But it is not fitting that we should pass over in silence that which he said: \"The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, how she may please God, that she may be holy both in body and spirit\" [she careth, he says, for the things of the Lord; she does not care for the things of the world, or of men, but for the things of God]. What, then, are the things of the Lord? Let the Apostle tell: \"Whatsoever[fn-7-P777_314455:22-nf] things are holy, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise of doctrine\": these are the things of the Lord, which holy and truly apostolic virgins meditate upon, and think of, day and night, without any interval of time. Of the Lord is the resurrection of the dead, of the Lord is immortality, of the Lord is incorruption, of the Lord is that splendor of the sun which is promised to the saints, as it is written in the Gospel, \"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father\":[fn-7-P778_315090:23-nf] of the Lord are the many mansions of the righteous in the heavens of the Lord is the fruit which is produced, whether thirty fold, or sixty fold, or an hundred fold. Those virgins who think on these things, and by what works they may be able to merit them, think of the things of the Lord. Of the Lord, too, is the law of the new and old testament, in which shine forth the holy utterances of his lips; and if any virgins meditate without intermission on these things, they think of the things of the Lord. In that case, there is fulfilled in them the saying of the prophet: \"The eternal[fn-7-P779_315699:24-nf] foundations are upon a solid rock, and the commands of God are in the heart of the holy woman.\"","title":"Letter II.

And when thou didst bury the dead in simplicity, and because thou didst not delay to rise up and to leave thy dinner, but didst go out and cover the dead, I was sent to prove thee; and again God has sent me to heal thee, and Sarah thy daughter-in-law. For I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels which stand and go in and out before the glory of God.\"[fn-72-P7257_2382154:92-nf] By Isaiah also the Lord reminds us, and teaches similar things, saying, \"Loosen every knot of iniquity, release the oppressions of contracts which have no power, let the troubled go into peace, and break every unjust engagement. Break thy bread to the hungry, and bring the poor that are without shelter into thy house. When thou seest the naked, clothe him; and despise not those of the same family and race as thyself. Then shall thy light break forth in season, and thy raiment shall spring forth speedily; and righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of God shall surround thee. Then shalt thou call, and God shall hear thee; and while thou shalt yet speak, He shall say, Here I am.\"[fn-72-P7258_2382873:93-nf] He promises that He will be at hand, and says that He will hear and protect those who, loosening the knots of unrighteousness from their heart, and giving alms among the members of God's household according to His commands, even in hearing what God commands to be done, do themselves also deserve to be heard by God. The blessed Apostle Paul, when aided in the necessity of affliction by his brethren, said that good works which are performed are sacrifices to God. \"I am full,\" saith he. \"having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.\"[fn-72-P7259_2383528:94-nf] For when one has pity on the poor, he lends to God; and he who gives to the least gives to God-sacrifices spiritually to God an odour of a sweet smell.","title":"Treatise IV.

Doubtless this passeth all understanding but His own.

Thus, then, the angels of God are our angels, as Christ is God's and also ours. They are God's, because they have not abandoned Him; they are ours, because we are their fellow-citizens.

For there was already in Job patience, which God knew, and to which He bore witness: but it became known unto men by test of trial:[fn-38-P3833_1818462:68-nf] and what lay hid within was not produced, but shown, by the things that were brought on him from without. Timothy also certainly had the virtue of abstaining from wine,[fn-38-P3834_1818646:69-nf] which Paul took not from him, by advising him to use a moderate portion of wine, \"for the sake of his stomach and his often infirmities,\" otherwise he taught him a deadly lesson, that for the sake of the health of the body there should be a loss of virtue in the soul: but because what he advised could take place with safety to that virtue, the profit of drinking was so left free to the body, as that the habit of continence continued in the soul.

As I have noted, the first Christian hospital was founded (a.d. 350) by Ephraem Syrus. His example was followed by St. Basil, who also rounded another for lepers. The founding of hostels as refuges for travellers was an institution of the Nicene period. \"In the time of Chrysostom,\" says one not too well disposed towards the Gospel,[fn-93-P9387_2930050:859-nf] \"the church of Antioch supported three thousand widows and virgins, besides strangers and sick.

A Christian, it was maintained, should devote at least one-tenth of his profits to the poor. A priest named Thalasius collected blind beggars in an asylum on the banks of the Euphrates. A merchant named Apollinus founded on Mount Nitria a gratuitous dispensary.\"So here our author's canons enforce (1) works of mercy; (2) almsdeeds; (3) brotherly love; (4) mutual support; (5) forgiveness of injuries; (6) the example of Christ's holy living; (7) forbearance; (8) suppression of idle talk; (9) love of enemies; (10) abhorrence of usury, (11) and avarice, (12) and carnal impurity: also, (13) obedience to parents; (14) parental love; (15) consideration of servants; (16) respect for the aged; (17) moderation, even in use of things lawful; (18) control of the tongue; (19) abstinence from detraction; (20) to visit the sick; (21) care of widows and orphans; (22) not to flatter; (23) to practise the Golden Rule; and (24) to abstain from bloodshed.

Indeed in all spiritual delights, which unmarried women enjoy, their holy conversation ought also to be with caution; lest haply, though their life be not evil through haughtiness, their report be evil through negligence. Nor are they to be listened to, whether they be holy men or women, when (upon occasion of their neglect in some matter being blamed, through which it comes to pass that they fall into evil suspicion, from which they know that their life is far removed) they say that it is enough for them their conscience before God, despising what men think of them, not only imprudently[fn-42-P4232_2006650:73-nf] but also cruelly; when they slay the souls of others; whether of such as blaspheme the way of God, who following their suspicion are displeased at what is the chaste life of the Saints, as though, it were shameful, or of such also as make excuse, and imitate, not what they see, but what they think. Wherefore whosoever guards his life from charges of shameful and evil deeds, does good to himself; but whosoever guards his character too, is merciful also towards others. For unto ourselves our ownlife is necessary, unto others our character;and certainly even what we mercifully minister unto others, for their health, abounds also to our own profit. Whence not in vain the Apostle, \"We provide good things,\" saith he, \"not only before God, but also before men;\"[fn-42-P4233_2007462:74-nf] also he saith, \"Please ye all men through all things; even as I also please all men through all things, not seeking what is of profit unto myself, but what unto many, that they may be saved.\"[fn-42-P4234_2007688:75-nf] Also in a certain exhortation he says, \"For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are holy, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are most dear whatsoever things are of good report; if any virtue, if any praise, these things think on, which ye have both learned, and received, arid heard, and seen in me.\"[fn-42-P4235_2008077:76-nf] You see howl among many things, unto which by exhortation he admonished them, he neglected not to set, \"whatsoever things are of good report;\" and in two words included all things, where he saith, \"if any virtue, if any praise.\" For unto virtue pertain the good things of which He made mention above; but good report unto praise. I think that the Apostle took not the praise of men for any great thing, saying in another place, \"But to me it is the least thing, that I be judged of you, or of day of man;\"[fn-42-P4236_2008604:77-nf] and in another place, \"If I were pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ;\"[fn-42-P4237_2008708:78-nf] and again, \"For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience.\"[fn-42-P4238_2008794:79-nf] But of these two, that is, of a good life, and a good report, or as is said more shortly, of virtue and praise, the one for his own sake he most wisely kept, the other for the sake of others he most mercifully provided. But, forasmuch as human caution, how great soever, cannot on every side avoid most malevolent suspicions, when for our good report we shall have done whatever we rightly can, if any, either by falsely pretending evil things of us, or from believing evil of us, endeavor to stain our fair fame, let there be present the solace of conscience, and clearly also the joy, in that our reward is great in Heaven, even when men say many evil things of us,[fn-42-P4239_2009481:80-nf] and we yet live godly and righteously.

In this habit of retirement, where the fire of meditation burns bright, there is a want of sympathy with human weakness, and with the need men have of our help in their calamities. This life also burns with the desire for children (for it wishes to teach what it knows, and not to go with the corruption of envy[fn-21-P2165_1294835:93-nf] ), and sees its sister-life fully occupied with work and with bringing forth; and it grieves that men run after that virtue which cares for their wants and weaknesses, instead of that which has a divine imperishable lesson to impart.

For does he deny that in baptism all sins are forgiven, because he confesses that there remain frailty and infirmity, whence he says that we sin after baptism and even to the end of this life, having unceasing conflict with the vices of the flesh? Or did he not remember what the apostle said about the Church without spot, that he prescribed that no one ought so to flatter himself in respect of a pure and spotless heart as to trust in his own innocence, and think that no medicine needed to be applied to his wounds? I think that these new heretics may concede to this catholic man that he knew \"that the Holy Spirit even in the old times aided good dispositions;\" nay, even, what they themselves will not allow, that they could not have possessed good dispositions except through the Holy Spirit. I think that Cyprian knew that all the prophets and apostles or saints of any kind soever who pleased the Lord at any time were righteous-\"not in comparison with the wicked,\" as they falsely assert that we say, \"but by the rule of virtue,\" as they boast that they say; although Cyprian says, nevertheless, no one can be without sin, and whoever should assert that he is blameless is either proud or a fool. Nor is it with reference to anything else that he understands the Scripture, \"Who shall boast that he has a pure heart? or who shall boast that he is pure from sins?\"[fn-57-P5753_2261815:103-nf] I think that Cyprian would not have needed to be taught by such as these, what he very well knew, \"that, in the time to come, there would be a reward of good works and a punishment of evil works, but that no one could then perform the commands which here he might have despised;\" and yet he does not understand and assert the Apostle Paul, who was assuredly not a contemner of the divine commands, to have said, \"To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain,\"[fn-57-P5754_2262294:104-nf] on any other account, except that he reckoned it the greatest gain after this life no longer to be held in worldly entanglements, no longer to be obnoxious to the sins and vices of the flesh. Therefore the most blessed Cyprian felt, and in the truth of the divine Scriptures saw, that even the life of the apostles themselves, however good, holy, and righteous, suffered some involvements of worldly entanglements, was obnoxious to some sins and vices of the flesh; and that they desired death thatthey might be free from those evils, and that they might attain to that perfect righteousness which would not suffer such things, and which would no more have to be achieved in the way of command merely, but to be received in the way of reward. For not even when that shall have come for which we pray when we say, \"Thy kingdom come,\" will there be in that kingdom of God no righteousness; since the apostle says, \"The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-57-P5755_2263328:105-nf] Certainly these three things are commanded among other divine precepts. Here righteousness is prescribed to us when it is said, \"Do righteousness;\"[fn-57-P5756_2263497:106-nf] peace is prescribed when it is said, \"Have peace among yourselves;\"[fn-57-P5757_2263585:107-nf] joy is prescribed when it is said, \"Rejoice in the Lord always.\"[fn-57-P5758_2263670:108-nf] Let, then, the Pelagians deny that these things shall be in the kingdom of God, where we shall live without end; or let them be so mad, if it appears good, as to contend that righteousness, peace, and joy, will be such there as they are here to the righteous. But if they both shall be, and yet shall not be the same, assuredly here, in respect of the commandment of them, the doing is to be cared for,-there the perfection is to be hoped for in the way of reward; when, not being withheld by any earthly entanglements, and being liable to no sins and vices of the flesh (on account of which the apostle, as Cyprian received this testimony, said that to die would be to him gain), we may perfectly love God, the contemplation of whom will be face to face; we may also perfectly love our neighbour, since, when the thoughts of the heart are made manifest, no suspicion of any evil can disturb any one concerning any one.

Of those, then, who seek to enter in, those who are not able to enter will not be able to do so, because the gates of Hades prevail against them; but in the case of those against whom the gates of Hades will not prevail, those seeking to enter in will be strong, being able to do all things, in Christ Jesus, who strengtheneth them.[fn-79-P7932_1686237:89-nf] And in like manner each one of those who are the authors of any evil opinion has become the architect of a certain gate of Hades; but those who co-operate with the teaching of the architect of such things are servants and stewards, who are the bond-servants of the evil doctrine which goes to build up impiety. And though the gates of Hades are many and almost innumerable, no gate of Hades will prevail against the rock or against the church which Christ builds upon it.

And this also we must know that as the gates of cities have each their own names, in the same way the gates of Hades might be named after the species of sins; so that one gate of Hades is called \"fornication,\" through which fornicators go, and another \"denial,\" through which the deniers of God go down into Hades.

And now, what we have drawn from the authority of Scripture ought to be sufficient to refute the arguments of the heretics. It will not, however, appear improper if we discuss the matter with them shortly, on the grounds of reason itself. We ask them, then, if they know what is regarded among men as the ground of virtue and wickedness, and if it appears to follow that we can speak of virtues in God, or, as they think, in these two Gods. Let them give an answer also to the question, whether they consider goodness to be a virtue; and as they will undoubtedly admit it to be so, what will they say of injustice? They will never certainly, in my opinion, be so foolish as to deny that justice is a virtue. Accordingly, if virtue is a blessing, and justice is a virtue, then without doubt justice is goodness. But if they say that justice is not a blessing, it must either be an evil or an indifferent thing. Now I think it folly to return any answer to those who say that justice is an evil, for I shall have the appearance of replying either to senseless words, or to men out of their minds. How can that appear an evil which is able to reward the good with blessings, as they themselves also admit? But if they say that it is a thing of indifference, it follows that since justice is so, sobriety also, and prudence, and all the other virtues, are things of indifference. And what answer shall we make to Paul, when he says, \"If there be any virtue, and, if there be any praise, think on these things, which ye have learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me? \"[fn-65-P6558_1303501:60-nf] Let them learn, therefore, by searching the holy Scriptures, what are the individual virtues, and not deceive themselves by saying that that God who rewards every one according to his merits, does, through hatred of evil, recompense the wicked with evil, and not because those who have sinned need to be treated with severer remedies, and because He applies to them those measures which, with the prospect of improvement, seem nevertheless, for the present, to produce a feeling of pain. They do not read what is written respecting the hope of those who were destroyed in the deluge; of which hope Peter himself thus speaks in his first Epistle: \"That Christ, indeed, was put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit, by which He went and preached to the spirits who were kept in prison, who once were unbelievers, when they awaited the long-suffering of God in the days of Noah, when the ark was preparing, in which a few, i.e., eight souls, were saved by water. Whereunto also baptism by a like figure now saves you.\"[fn-65-P6559_1304552:61-nf] And with regard to Sodom and Gomorrah, let them tell us whether they believe the prophetic words to be those of the Creator God-of Him, viz., who is related to have rained upon them a shower of fire and brimstone. What does Ezekiel the prophet say of them? \"Sodom,\" he says, \"shall be restored to her former condition.\"[fn-65-P6560_1304897:62-nf] But why, in afflicting those who are deserving of punishment, does He not afflict them for their good?-who also says to Chaldea, \"Thou hast coals of fire, sit upon them; they will be a help to thee.\"[fn-65-P6561_1305125:63-nf] And of those also who fell in the desert, let them hear what is related in the Psalms 78, which bears the superscription of Asaph; for he says, \"When He slew them, then they sought Him.\"[fn-65-P6562_1305448:64-nf] He does not say that some sought Him after others had been slain, but he says that the destruction of those who were killed was of such a nature that, when put to death, they sought God. By all which it is established, that the God of the law and the Gospels is one and the same, a just and good God, and that He confers benefits justly, and punishes with kindness; since neither goodness without justice, nor justice without goodness, can display the (real) dignity of the divine nature.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-04","text":"5. We are not, however, to suppose that each individual has to contend against all these (adversaries). For it is impossible for any man, although he were a saint, to carry on a contest against all of them at the same time. If that indeed were by any means to be the case, as it is certainly impossible it should be so, human nature could not possibly bear it without undergoing entire destruction.[fn-71-P7154_1578414:302-nf] But as, for example, if fifty soldiers were to say that they were about to engage with fifty others, they would not be understood to mean that one of them had to contend against the whole fifty, but each one would rightly say that \"our battle was against fifty,\" all against all; so also this is to be understood as the apostle's meaning, that all the athletes and soldiers of Christ have to wrestle and struggle against all the adversaries enumerated,-the struggle having, indeed, to be maintained against all, but by single individuals either with individual powers, or at least in such manner as shall be determined by God, who is the just president of the struggle. For I am of opinion that there is a certain limit to the powers of human nature, although there may be a Paul, of whom it is said, \"He is a chosen vessel unto Me; \"[fn-71-P7155_1579286:303-nf] or a Peter, against whom the gates of hell do not prevail; or a Moses, the friend of God: yet not one of them could sustain, without destruction to himself,[fn-71-P7156_1579463:304-nf] the whole simultaneous assault of these opposing powers, unless indeed the might of Him alone were to work in him, who said, \"Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\"[fn-71-P7157_1579668:305-nf] And therefore Paul exclaims with confidence, \"I can do all things through Christ, who strengtheneth me; \"[fn-71-P7158_1579795:306-nf] and again, \"I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\"[fn-71-P7159_1579922:307-nf] On account, then, of this power, which certainly is not of human origin operating and speaking in him, Paul could say, \"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor power, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"[fn-71-P7160_1580342:308-nf] For I do not think that human nature can alone of itself maintain a contest with angels, and with the powers of the height and of the abyss,[fn-71-P7161_1580666:309-nf] and with any other creature; but when it feels the presence of the Lord dwelling within it, confidence in the divine help will lead it to say, \"The Lord is my light, and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the enemies draw near to me, to eat my flesh, my enemies who trouble me, they stumbled and fell. Though an host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in Him shall I be confident.\"[fn-71-P7162_1581188:310-nf] From which I infer that a man perhaps would never be able of himself to vanquish an opposing power, unless he had the benefit of divine assistance. Hence, also, the angel is said to have wrestled with Jacob. Here, however, I understand the writer to mean, that it was not the same thing for the angel to have wrestled with Jacob, and to have wrestled against him; but the angel that wrestles with him is he who was present with him in order to secure his safety, who, after knowing also his moral progress, gave him in addition the name of Israel, i.e., he is with him in the struggle, and assists him in the contest; seeing there was undoubtedly another angel against whom he contended, and against whom he had to carry on a contest. Finally, Paul has not said that we wrestle with princes, or with powers, but against principalities and powers. And hence, although Jacob wrestled, it was unquestionably against some one of those powers which, Paul declares, resist and contend with the human race, and especially with the saints. And therefore at last the Scripture says of him that \"he wrestled with the angel, and had power with God,\" so that the struggle is supported by help of the angel, but the prize of success conducts the conqueror to God.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_50_exhortation_to_the_heathen","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"363","folder":"ANF-02","text":"But the rest, round whom the world's growths have fastened, as the rocks on the sea-shore are covered over with sea-weed, make light of immortality, like the old man of Ithaca, eagerly longing to see, not the truth, not the fatherland in heaven, not the true light, but smoke. But godliness, that makes man as far as can be like God, designates God as our suitable teacher, who alone can worthily assimilate man to God.

And the Church alone offers this pure oblation to the Creator, offering to Him, with giving of thanks, [the things taken] from His creation.

For some, by maintaining that the Father is different from the Creator, do, when they offer to Him what belongs to this creation of ours, set Him forth as being covetous of another's property, and desirous of what is not His own. Those, again, who maintain that the things around us originated from apostasy, ignorance, and passion, do, while offering unto Him the fruits of ignorance, passion, and apostasy, sin against their Father, rather subjecting Him to insult than giving Him thanks.

Wherefore also to those capable of perceiving he showed resurrection, that of the life still in the flesh, creeping on its belly. Whence also he applied the name \"brood of vipers\" to the voluptuous, who serve the belly and the pudenda, and cut off one another's heads for the sake of worldly pleasures. \"Little children, let us not love in word, or in tongue,\" says John, teaching them to be perfect, \"but in deed and in truth; hereby shall we know that we are of the truth.\"[fn-68-P6884_2109502:143-nf] And if \"God be love,\" piety also is love: \"there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.\"[fn-68-P6885_2109634:144-nf] \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.\"[fn-68-P6886_2109718:145-nf] And again, to him who desires to become a Gnostic, it is written, \"But be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in love, in faith, in purity.\"[fn-68-P6887_2109903:146-nf] For perfection in faith differs, I think, from ordinary faith. And the divine apostle furnishes the rule for the Gnostic in these words, writing as follows: \"For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to lack. I can do all things through Him who strengtheneth me.\"[fn-68-P6888_2110362:147-nf] And also when discussing with others in order to put them, to shame, he does not shrink from saying, \"But call to mind the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly, whilst ye were made a gazing-stock, both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took with joy the spoiling of your goods, knowing that you have a better and enduring substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after doing the will of God, ye may obtain the promise. For yet a little while, and He that cometh will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: and if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.\"[fn-68-P6889_2111342:148-nf] He then brings forward a swarm of divine examples. For was it not \"by faith,\" he says, this endurance, that they acted nobly who \"had trial of mockeries and scourgings, and, moreover, of bonds and imprisonments? They were stoned, they were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts, in mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth. And all having received a good report, through faith, received not the promise of God\" (what is expressed by a parasiopesis is left to be understood, viz., \"alone \"). He adds accordingly, \"God having provided some better thing for us (for He was good), that they should not without us be made perfect. Wherefore also, having encompassing us such a cloud,\" holy and transparent, \"of witnesses, laying aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, let us run with patience the race set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.\"[fn-68-P6890_2112408:149-nf] Since, then, he specifies one salvation in Christ of the righteous,[fn-68-P6891_2112510:150-nf] and of us he has expressed the former unambiguously, and saying nothing less respecting Moses, adds, \"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.\"[fn-68-P6892_2112908:151-nf] The divine Wisdom says of the martyrs, \"They seemed in the eyes of the foolish to die, and their departure was reckoned a calamity, and their migration from us an affliction. But they are in peace. For though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope was full of immortality.\"[fn-68-P6893_2113261:152-nf] He then adds, teaching martyrdom to be a glorious purification, \"And being chastened a little, they shall be benefited much; because God proved them,\" that is, suffered them to be tried, to put them to the proof, and to put to shame the author of their trial, \"and found them worthy of Himself,\" plainly to be called sons. \"As gold in the furnace He proved them, and as a whole burned-offering of sacrifice He accepted them.

And now, to speak about each kind offault separately: of gluttony there are three sorts: (I) that which drives a monk to eatbefore the proper and stated times; (2) that which cares about filling the belly and gorging it with all kinds of food, and (3) that which is on the lookout for dainties anddelicacies. And these three sorts give a monk no little trouble, unless he tries to free himself from all of them with the same care and scrupulousness. For just as one should never venture to break one's fast before the right time so we must utterly avoid all greediness in eating, and the choice and dainty preparation of our food: for from these three causes different but extremely dangerous conditions of the soul arise. For from the first there springs up dislike of the monastery, and thence there grows up disgust and intoleranceof the life there, and this is sure to be soonfollowed by withdrawal and speedy departure from it. By the second there are kindled the fiery darts of luxury and lasciviousness. The third also weaves the entangling meshes of covetousness for the nets of its prisoners, and ever hinders monks from following the perfect self-abnegation of Christ. And when there are traces of this passion in us we can recognize them by this; viz., if we are kept to dine by one of the brethren we are not content to eat our food with the relish which he has prepared and offers to us, but take the unpar- donable liberty of asking to have something else poured. over it or added to it, a thing which we should never do for three reasons: (I) because the monastic mind ought always to be accustomed to practise endurance and abstinence, and like the Apostle, to learn to be content in whatever state he is.[fn-41-P4146_1532088:18-nf] For one who is upset by taking an unsavoury morsel once and in a way, and who cannot even for a short time overcome the delicacy of his appetite will never succeed in curbing the secret and more important desires of the body; (2) because it sometimes happens that at the time our host is out of that particular thing which we ask for, and we make him feel ashamed of the wants and bareness of his table, by exposing his poverty which he would rather was only known to God; (3) because sometimes other people do not care about the relish which we ask for, and so it turns out that we are annoying most of them while intent on satisfying the desires of our own palate. And on this account we must by all means avoid such a liberty. Of fornication there are three sorts: (I) that which is accomplished by sexual intercourse; (2) that which takes place without touching a woman, for which we read that Onan the son of the patriarch Judah was smitten by the Lord; and which is termed by Scripture uncleanness: of which the Apostle says: \"But I say to the unmarried and to widows, that it is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they do not contain let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn;\"[fn-41-P4147_1533320:19-nf] (3) that which is conceived in heart and mind, of which the Lord says in the gospel: \"Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.\"[fn-41-P4148_1533532:20-nf] And these three kinds the blessed Apostle tells us must be stamped out in one and the same way. \"Mortify,\" says he, \"your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, lust, etc.\"[fn-41-P4149_1533747:21-nf] And again of two of them he says to the Ephesians: \"Let fornication and uncleanness be not so much as named among you:\" and once more: \"But know this that no fornicator or unclean person, or covetous person who is an idolater hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.\"[fn-41-P4150_1534046:22-nf] And just as these three must be avoided by us with equal care, go they one and all shut us out and exclude us equally from the kingdom of Christ. Of covetousness there are three kinds: (I) That which hinders renunciants from allowing themselves of be stripped of their goods and property; (2) that which draws us to resume with excessive eagerness the possession of those things which we have given away and distributed to the poor; (3) that which leads a man to covet and procure what he never previously possessed. Of anger there are three kinds: one which rages within, which is called in Greek qumo/j; another which breaks out in word and deed and action, which they term o0rgh/: of which the Apostle speaks, saying \"But now do ye lay aside all anger and indignation;\"[fn-41-P4151_1534837:23-nf] the third, which is not like those in boiling over and being done with in an hour, but which lasts for days and long periods, which is called mh=nij. And all these three must be condemned by us with equal horror. Of deflection there are two kinds: one, that which springs up when anger has died down, or is the result of some loss we have incurred or of some purpose which has been hindered and interfered with; the other, that which comes from unreasonable anxiety of mind or from despair. Of accidie there are two kinds: one of which sends those affected by it to sleep; while the other makes them forsake their cell and flee away. Of vainglory, although it takes various forms and shapes, and is divided into different classes, yet there are two main kinds: (I) when we are puffed up about carnal things and things visible, and (2) when we are inflamed with the desire of vain praise for things spiritual and unseen.","title":"V.

And in order to make our meaning clearer, the saint has for his right hand his spiritual achievements, in which he is found when with fervent spirit he gets the better of his desires and passions, when he is free from all attacks of the devil, and without any effort or difficulty rejects and cuts off all carnal sins, when he is exalted above the earth and regards all things present and earthly as light smoke or vain shadows, and scorns them as what is about to vanish away, when with an overflowing heart he not only longs most intensely for the future but actually sees it the more clearly, when he is more effectually fed on spiritual contemplations, when he sees heavenly mysteries more brightly laid open to him, when he pours forth his prayers to God with greater purity and readiness, when he is so inflamed with fervent of spirit as to pass with the utmost readiness of soul to things invisible and eternal, so as scarcely to believe that he any longer remains in the flesh. He has also a left hand, when he is entangled in the toils of temptation, when he is inflamed with the heat of desire for carnal lusts, when he is set on fire by emotion towards rage and anger, when he is overcome by being puffed up with pride or vainglory, when he is oppressed by a sorrow that worketh death, when l he is shaken to pieces by the contrivances andattacks of accidie, and when he has lost allspiritual warmth, and grows indifferent with a sort of lukewarmness and unreasonable griefso that not only is he forsaken by good and kindling thoughts, but actually Psalms, prayer, reading, and retirement in his cell all pall upon him, and all virtuous exercises seem byan intolerable and horrible loathing to have lost their saviour. And when a monk is troubled in this way, then he knows that he is attacked \"on the left hand.\" Anyone therefore who is not at all puffed up through the aid of vainglory by any of those things on the right hand which we have mentioned, and who struggles manfully against those on the left hand, and does not yield to despair and give in, but rather on the other hand seizes the armour of patience to practise himself in virtue-this man can use both hands as fight hands, and in each action he proves triumphant and carries off the prize of victory from that condition on the left hand as well as that on the fight. Such, we read, was the reward which the blessed Job obtained who was certainly crawned (for a victory) on the right hand, when he was the father of seven sons and walked as a rich and wealthy man, and yet offered daily sacrifices to the Lord for their purification, in his anxiety that they might prove acceptable and dear to God rather than to himself, when his gates stood open to every stranger, when he was \"feet to lame and eyes to blind,\"[fn-43-P4319_1592763:33-nf] when the shoulders of the suffering were kept warm by the wool of his sheep, when he was a father to orphans and a husband to widows, when he did not even in his heart rejoice at the fall of his enemy. And again it was the same man who with still greater virtue triumphed over adversity on the left hand, when deprived in one moment of his seven sons he was not as a father overcome with bitter grief but as a true servant of God rejoiced in the will of his Creator. When instead of being a wealthy man he became poor, naked instead of rich, pining away instead of strong, despised and contemptible instead of famous and honourable, and yet preserved his fortitude of mind unshaken, when, lastly, bereft of all his wealth and substance he took up his abode on the dunghill, and like some stern executioner of his own body scraped with a potsherd the matter that broke out, and plunging his fingers deep into his wounds dragged out on every side masses of worms from his limbs. And in all this he never fell into despair and blasphemy, nor murmured at all against his Creator. Moreover also so little was he overcome by such a weight of bitter temptations that the cloak which out of all his former property remained to cover his body, and which alone could be saved from destruction by the devil because he was clothed with it, he rent and cast off, and covered with it his nakedness which he voluntarily endured, which the terrible robber had brought upon him. The hair of his head too, which was the only thing left untouched out of all the remains of his former glory, he shaved and cast to his tormentor, and cutting off even that which his savage foe had left to him he exulted over him and mocked him with that celestial cry of his: \"If we have received good at the hand of the Lord, should we not also receive evil? Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither. The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done; blessed be the name of the Lord.\"[fn-43-P4320_1594800:34-nf] I should also with good reason call Joseph ambidextrous, as in prosperity he was very dear to his father, affectionate to his brethren, acceptable to God; and in adversity was chaste, and faithful to the Lord, in prison most kind to the prisoners, forgetful of wrongs, generous to his enemies; and to his brethren who were envious of him and as far as lay in their powers, his murderers, he proved not only affectionate but actually munificent. These men then and those who are like them are rightly termed a0mfoterode/cion, i.e., ambidextrous. For they can use either hand as the right hand, and passing through those things which the Apostle enumerates can fairly say: \"Through the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, through honour and dishonour, through evil report and good report etc.\" And of this right and left hand Solomon speaks as follows in the Song of songs, in the person of the bride: \"His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.\"[fn-43-P4321_1595818:35-nf] And while this passage shows that both are useful, yet it puts one under the head, because misfortunes ought to be subject to the control of the heart, since they are only useful for this; viz., to train us for a time and discipline us for our salvation and make us perfect in the matter of patience. But the right hand she hopes will ever cling to her to cherish her and hold her fast in the blessed embrace of the Bridegroom, and unite her to him indissolubly. We shall then be ambidextrous, when neither abundance nor want affects us, and when the former does not entice us to the luxury of a dangerous carelessness, while the latter does not draw us to despair, and complaining; but when, giving thanks to God in either case alike, we gain one and the same advantage out of good and bad fortune. And such that truly ambidextrous man, the teacher of the Gentiles, testifies that he himself was, when he says: \"For I have learnt in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith. I know both how to be brought low and I know how to abound: everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to De hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things in Him which strengtheneth me.\"[fn-43-P4322_1597044:36-nf] ","title":"VI.

John's gospel we read that He offered up with such fulness. From the words of which (as it is too long to repeat it all) the careful inquirer can discover by the order of the passage that this is so. And the Apostle also in his Epistle to the Philippians has expressed the same meaning, by putting these four kinds of prayers in a slightly different order, and has shown that they ought sometimes to be offered together in the fervour of a single prayer, saying as follows: \"But in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.\"[fn-48-P4877_1766859:23-nf] And by this he wanted us especially to understand that in prayer and supplication thanksgiving ought to be mingled with our requests.","title":"IX.

Thus of old time, Job, who possessed fortitude above all men, thought of these things when in prosperity; and when in adversity, he patiently endured, and when he suffered, gave thanks. As also the humble David, in the very time of affliction sang praises and said, `I will bless the Lord at all times[fn-89-P8955_3278586:34-nf] .' And the blessed Paul, in all his Epistles, so to say, ceased not to thank God. In times of ease, he failed not, and in afflictions he gloried, knowing that `tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and that hope maketh not ashamed[fn-89-P8956_3278874:35-nf] .' Let us, being followers of such men, pass no season without thanksgiving, but especially now, when the time is one of tribulation, which the heretics excite against us, will we praise the Lord, uttering the words of the saints; `All these things have come upon us, yet have we not forgotten Thee[fn-89-P8957_3279190:36-nf] .' For as the Jews at that time, although suffering an assault from the tabernacles[fn-89-P8958_3279293:37-nf] of the Edomites, and oppressed by the enemies of Jerusalem, did not give themselves up, but all the more sang praises to God; so we, my beloved brethren, though hindered from speaking the word of the Lord, will the more proclaim it, and being afflicted, we will sing Psalms[fn-89-P8959_3279596:38-nf] , in that we are accounted worthy to be despised, and to labour anxiously for the truth. Yea, moreover, being grievously vexed, we will give thanks. For the blessed Apostle, who gave thanks at all times, urges us in the same manner to draw near to God saying, `Let your requests, with thanksgiving, be made known unto God[fn-89-P8960_3279940:39-nf] .' And being desirous that we should always continue in this resolution, he says, `At all times give thanks; pray without ceasing[fn-89-P8961_3280088:40-nf] .' For he knew that believers are strong while employed in thanksgiving, and that rejoicing they pass over the walls of the enemy, like those saints who said, `Through Thee will we pierce through our enemies, and by my God I will leap over a walls[fn-89-P8962_3280357:41-nf] .' At all times let us stand firm, but especially now, although many afflictions overtake us, and many heretics are furious against us. Let us then, my beloved brethren, celebrate with thanksgiving the holy feast which now draws near to us, `girding up the loins of our minds[fn-89-P8963_3280652:42-nf] ,' like our Saviour Jesus Christ, of Whom it is written, `Righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and faithfulness the girdle of His reins[fn-89-P8964_3280818:43-nf] .' Each one of us having in his hand the staff which came out of the root of Jesse, and our feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel[fn-89-P8965_3280971:44-nf] , let us keep the feast as Paul saith, `Not with the old leaven, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth[fn-89-P8966_3281118:45-nf] ;' reverently trusting that we are reconciled through Christ, and not departing from faith in Him, nor do we defile ourselves together with heretics, and strangers to the truth, whose conversation and whose will degrade them. But rejoicing in afflictions, we break through the furnace of iron and darkness, and pass, unharmed, over that terrible Red Sea. Thus also, when we look upon the confusion of heretics, we shall, with Moses, sing that great song of praise, and say, `We will sing unto the Lord, for He is to be gloriously praised[fn-89-P8967_3281674:46-nf] .' Thus, singing praises, and seeing that the sin which is in us has been cast into the sea, we pass over to the wilderness. And being first purified by the fast of forty days, by prayers, and fastings, and discipline, and good works, we shall be able to eat the holy Passover in Jerusalem.","title":"Letter III.

But of course this is not the real cause of our separation. It was when they found that they would recommend themselves to Euzoius[fn-53-P5372_1692909:7-nf] if they were alienated from me, that they devised these pretences. The object was to find some ground of recommendation with the authorities for their attack upon me. Now they are beginning to run down even the Nicene Creed, and nickname me Homoousiast, because in that creed the Only begotten Son is said to be homoousios with God the Father. Not that one essence is divided into two kindred parts; God forbid! This was not the meaning of that holy and God-beloved synod; their meaning was that what the Father is in essence, such is the Son. And thus they themselves have explained it to us, in the phrase Light of Light. Now it is the Nicene Creed, brought by themselves from the west, which they presented to the Synod at Tyana, by which they were received.[fn-53-P5373_1693694:8-nf] But they have an ingenious theory as to changes of this kind; they use the words of the creed as physicians use a remedy for the particular moment, and substitute now one and now another to suit particular diseases. The unsoundness of such a sophism it is rather for you to consider than for me to prove. For \"the Lord will give you understanding\"[fn-53-P5374_1694117:9-nf] to know what is the right doctrine, and what the crooked and perverse. If indeed we are to subscribe one creed to-day and another tomorrow, and shift with the seasons, then is the declaration false of him who said, \"One Lord, one faith, one baptism.\"[fn-53-P5375_1694386:10-nf] But if it is true, then \"Let no man deceive you with [these] vain words.\" They falsely accuse me of introducing novelties about the Holy Spirit. Ask what the novelty is. I confess what I have received, that the Paraclete is ranked with Father and Son, and not numbered with created beings. We have made profession of our faith in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and we are baptized in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Wherefore we never separate the Spirit from conjunction[fn-53-P5376_1694882:11-nf] with the Father and the Son. For our mind, enlightened by the Spirit, looks at the Son, and in Him, as in an image, beholds the Father. And I do not invent names of myself, but call the Holy Ghost Paraclete; nor do I consent to destroy His due glory. These are truly my doctrines. If any one wishes to accuse me for them, let him accuse me; let my persecutor persecute me.
