Either some brother who is sick is visited, or else the sacrifice is offered, or else the word of God is dispensed.

For you will never need a pretext for going out if you always go out when there is need. Take food in moderation, and never overload your stomach. For many women, while temperate as regards wine, are intemperate in the use of food. When you rise at night to pray, let your breath be that of an empty and not that of an overfull stomach. Read often, learn all that you can. Let sleep overcome you, the roll still in your hands; when your head falls, let it be on the sacred page. Let your fasts be of daily occurrence and your refreshment such as avoids satiety. It is idle to carry an empty stomach if, in two or three days' time, the fast is to be made up for by repletion. When cloyed the mind immediately grows sluggish, and when the ground is watered it puts forth the thorns of lust. If ever you feel the outward man sighing for the flower of youth, and if, as you lie on your couch after a meal, you are excited by the alluring train of sensual desires; then seize the shield of faith, for it alone can quench the fiery darts of the devil.[fn-7-P713_142837:440-nf] \"They are all adulterers,\" says the prophet; \"they have made ready their heart like an oven.\"[fn-7-P714_142951:441-nf] But do you keep close to the footsteps of Christ, and, intent upon His words, say: \"Did not our heart burn within us by the way while Jesus opened to us the Scriptures?\"[fn-7-P715_143159:442-nf] and again: \"Thy word is tried to the uttermost, and thy servant loveth it.\"[fn-7-P716_143257:443-nf] It is hard for the human soul to avoid loving something, and our mind must of necessity give way to affection of one kind or another.

Therefore, as you lie on your couch, say again and again: \"By night have I sought Him whom my soul loveth.\"[fn-7-P717_143667:444-nf] \"Mortify, therefore,\" says the apostle, \"your members which are upon the earth.\"[fn-7-P718_143769:445-nf] Because he himself did so, he could afterwards say with confidence: \"I live, yet not I, but Christ, liveth in me.\"[fn-7-P719_143904:446-nf] He who mortifies his members, and feels that he is walking in a vain show,[fn-7-P720_143999:447-nf] is not afraid to say: \"I am become like a bottle in the frost.[fn-7-P721_144134:448-nf] Whatever there was in me of the moisture of lust has been dried out of me.\" And again: \"My knees are weak through fasting; I forget to eat my bread.

Let me now run through the list of our own writers. Did not Quadratus[fn-29-P2989_790878:2150-nf] a disciple of the apostles and bishop of the Athenian church deliver to the Emperor Hadrian (on the occasion of his visit to the Eleusinian mysteries) a treatise in defence of our religion. And so great was the admiration caused in everyone by his eminent ability that it stilled a most severe persecution. The philosopher Aristides,[fn-29-P2990_791444:2151-nf] a man of great eloquence, presented to the same Emperor an apology for the Christians composed of extracts from philosophic writers. His example was afterwards followed by Justin[fn-29-P2991_791750:2152-nf] another philosopher who delivered to Antoninus Plus and his sons[fn-29-P2992_791955:2153-nf] and to the senate a treatise Against the Gentiles, in which he defended the ignominy of the cross and preached the resurrection of Christ with all freedom. Need I speak of Melito[fn-29-P2993_792177:2154-nf] bishop of Sardis, of Apollinaris[fn-29-P2994_792298:2155-nf] chief-priest of the Church of Hierapolis, of Dionysius[fn-29-P2995_792534:2156-nf] bishop of the Corinthians, of Tatian,[fn-29-P2996_792694:2157-nf] of Bardesanes,[fn-29-P2997_792746:2158-nf] of Irenaeus[fn-29-P2998_792929:2159-nf] successor to the martyr Pothinus;[fn-29-P2999_793101:2160-nf] all of whom have in many volumes explained the uprisings of the several heresies and tracked them back, each to the philosophic source from which it flows. Pantaenus,[fn-30-P3000_793336:2161-nf] a philosopher of the Stoic school, was on account of his great reputation for learning sent by Demetrius bishop of Alexandria to India, to preach Christ to the Brahmans and philosophers there. Clement,[fn-30-P3001_793716:2162-nf] a presbyter of Alexandria, in my judgment the most learned of men, wrote eight books of Miscellanies[fn-30-P3002_793886:2163-nf] and as many of Outline Sketches,[fn-30-P3003_793940:2164-nf] a treatise against the Gentiles, and three volumes called the Pedagogue. Is there any want of learning in these, or are they not rather drawn from the very heart of philosophy? Imitating his example Origen[fn-30-P3004_794168:2165-nf] wrote ten books of Miscellanies, in which he compares together the opinions held respectively by Christians and by philosophers, and confirms all the dogmas of our religion by quotations from Plato and Aristotle, from Numenius[fn-30-P3005_794586:2166-nf] and Cornutus.[fn-30-P3006_794698:2167-nf] Miltiades[fn-30-P3007_794866:2168-nf] also wrote an excellent treatise against the Gentiles. Moreover Hippolytus[fn-30-P3008_795003:2169-nf] and a Roman senator named Apollonius[fn-30-P3009_795150:2170-nf] have each compiled apologetic works. The books of Julius Africanus[fn-30-P3010_795323:2171-nf] who wrote a history of his own times are still extant, as also are those of Theodore who was afterwards called Gregory,[fn-30-P3011_795592:2172-nf] a man endowed with apostolic miracles as well as with apostolic virtues. We still have the works of Dionysius[fn-30-P3012_795833:2173-nf] bishop of Alexandria, of Anatolius[fn-30-P3013_795966:2174-nf] chief priest of the church of Laodicea, of the presbyters Pamphilus,[fn-30-P3014_796128:2175-nf] Pierius,[fn-30-P3015_796238:2176-nf] Lucian,[fn-30-P3016_796283:2177-nf] Malchion;[fn-30-P3017_796406:2178-nf] of Eusebius[fn-30-P3018_796534:2179-nf] bishop of Csarea, Eustathius[fn-30-P3019_796591:2180-nf] of Antioch and Athanasius[fn-30-P3020_796740:2181-nf] of Alexandria; of Eusebius[fn-30-P3021_796901:2182-nf] of Emisa, of Triphyllius[fn-30-P3022_797058:2183-nf] of Cyprus, of Asterius[fn-30-P3023_797175:2184-nf] of Scythopolis, of the confessor Serapion,[fn-30-P3024_797317:2185-nf] of Titus[fn-30-P3025_797430:2186-nf] bishop of Bostra; and of the Cappadocians Basil,[fn-30-P3026_797583:2187-nf] Gregory,[fn-30-P3027_797715:2188-nf] and Amphilochius.[fn-30-P3028_797836:2189-nf] All these writers so frequently interweave in their books the doctrines and maxims of the philosophers that you might easily be at a loss which to admire most, their secular erudition or their knowledge of the scriptures.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":366,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"854","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"A too careful management of one's income, a too near calculation of one's expenses-these are habits not easily laid aside.

We have lost her, it is true, but the heavenly mansions have gained her; for as long as she was in the body she was absent from the Lord[fn-38-P3846_1040904:2731-nf] and would constantly complain with tears:-\"Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar; my soul hath been this long time a pilgrim.\"[fn-38-P3847_1041086:2732-nf] It was no wonder that she sobbed out that even she was in darkness (for this is the meaning of the word Kedar) seeing that, according to the apostle, \"the world lieth in the evil one;\"[fn-38-P3848_1041337:2733-nf] and that, \"as its darkness is, so is its light;\"[fn-38-P3849_1041409:2734-nf] and that \"the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.\"[fn-38-P3850_1041524:2735-nf] She would frequently exclaim: \"I am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers were,\"[fn-38-P3851_1041642:2736-nf] and again, I desire \"to depart and to be with Christ.\"[fn-38-P3852_1041721:2737-nf] As often too as she was troubled with bodily weakness (brought on by incredible abstinence and by redoubled fastings), she would be heard to say: \"I keep under my body and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway;\"[fn-38-P3853_1042029:2738-nf] and \"It is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine;\"[fn-38-P3854_1042110:2739-nf] and \"I humbled my soul with fasting;\"[fn-38-P3855_1042171:2740-nf] and \"thou wilt make all\" my \"bed in\" my \"sickness;\"[fn-38-P3856_1042246:2741-nf] and \"Thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer.\"[fn-38-P3857_1042351:2742-nf] And when the pain which she bore with such wonderful patience darted through her, as if she saw the heavens opened[fn-38-P3858_1042489:2743-nf] she would say \"Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away and be at rest.\"[fn-38-P3859_1042607:2744-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":232,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1429","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"14. I think it unnecessary to warn you against covetousness since it is the way of your family both to have riches and to despise them. The apostle too tells us that covetousness is idolatry,[fn-52-P5217_1434349:3734-nf] and to one who asked the Lord the question: \"Good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?\" He thus replied: \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.\"[fn-52-P5218_1434641:3735-nf] Such is the climax of complete and apostolic virtue-to sell all that one has and to distribute to the poor,[fn-52-P5219_1434788:3736-nf] and thus freed from all earthly encumbrance to fly up to the heavenly realms with Christ. To us, or I should rather say to you, a careful stewardship is entrusted, although in such matters full freedom of choice is left to every individual, whether old or young. Christ's words are \"if thou wilt be perfect.\" I do not compel you, He seems to say, I do not command you, but I set the palm before you, I shew you the prize; it is for you to choose whether you will enter the arena and win the crown. Let us consider how wisely Wisdom has spoken. \"Sell that thou hast.\" To whom is the command given? Why, to him to whom it was said, \"if thou wilt be perfect.\" Sell not a part of thy goods but \"all that thou hast.\" And when you have sold them, what then? \"Give to the poor.\" Not to the rich, not to your kinsfolk, not to minister to self indulgence; but to relieve need. It does not matter whether a man is a priest or a relation or a connexion, you must think of nothing but his poverty. Let your praises come from the stomachs of the hungry and not from the rich banquets of the overfed. We read in the Acts of the Apostles how, while the blood of the Lord was still warm and believers were in the fervour of their first faith, they all sold their possessions and laid the price of them at the apostles' feet (to shew that money ought to be trampled underfoot) and \"distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.\"[fn-52-P5220_1436260:3737-nf] But Ananias and Sapphira proved timid stewards, and what is more, deceitful ones; therefore they brought on themselves condemnation. For having made a vow they offered their money to God as if it were their own and not His to whom they had vowed it; and keeping back for their own use a part of that which belonged to another, through fear of famine which true faith never fears, they drew down on themselves suddenly the avenging stroke, which was meant not in cruelty towards them but as a warning to others.[fn-52-P5221_1436806:3738-nf] In fact the apostle Peter by no means called down death upon them as Porphyry[fn-52-P5222_1436907:3739-nf] foolishly says. He merely announced God's judgment by the spirit of prophecy, that the doom of two persons might be a lesson to many. From the time of your dedication to perpetual virginity your property is yours no longer; or rather is now first truly yours because it has come to be Christ's. Yet while your grandmother and mother are living you must deal with it according to their wishes. If, however, they die and rest in the sleep of the saints (and I know that they desire that you should survive them); when your years are riper, and your will steadier, and your resolution stronger, you will do with your money what seems best to you, or rather what the Lord shall command, knowing as you will that hereafter you will have nothing save that which you have here spent on good works. Others may build churches, may adorn their walls when built with marbles, may procure massive columns, may deck the unconscious capitals with gold and precious ornaments, may cover church doors with silver and adorn the altars with gold and gems. I do not blame those who do these things; I do not repudiate them.[fn-52-P5223_1438144:3740-nf] Everyone must follow his own judgment. And it is better to spend one's money thus than to hoard it up and brood over it. However your duty is of a different kind. It is yours to clothe Christ in the poor, to visit Him in the sick, to feed Him in the hungry, to shelter Him in the homeless, particularly such as are of the household of faith,[fn-52-P5224_1438517:3741-nf] to support communities of virgins, to take care of God's servants, of those who are poor in spirit, who serve the same Lord as you day and night, who while they are on earth live the angelic life and speak only of the praises of God. Having food and raiment they rejoice and count themselves rich. They seek for nothing more, contented if only they can persevere in their design. For as soon as they begin to seek more they are shewn to be undeserving even of those things that are needful.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1538","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1. We read in Isaiah the words, \"the fool will speak folly,\"[fn-55-P5533_1542598:3925-nf] and I am told that some one has been mad enough to put deacons before presbyters, that is, before bishops. For when the apostle clearly teaches that presbyters are the same as bishops, must not a mere server of tables and of widows[fn-55-P5534_1542858:3926-nf] be insane to set himself up arrogantly over men through whose prayers the body and blood of Christ are produced?[fn-55-P5535_1543004:3927-nf] Do you ask for proof of what I say? Listen to this passage: \"Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the bishops and deacons.\"[fn-55-P5536_1543283:3928-nf] Do you wish for another instance? In the Acts of the Apostles Paul thus speaks to the priests[fn-55-P5537_1543396:3929-nf] of a single church: \"Take heed unto yourselves and to all the flock, in the which the Holy Ghost hath made you bishops, to feed the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.\"[fn-55-P5538_1543603:3930-nf] And lest any should in a spirit of contention argue that there must then have been more bishops than one in a single church, there is the following passage which clearly proves a bishop and a presbyter to be the same. Writing to Titus the apostle says: \"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain presbyters[fn-55-P5539_1544004:3931-nf] in every city, as I had appointed thee: if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God.\"[fn-55-P5540_1544227:3932-nf] And to Timothy he says: \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.\"[fn-55-P5541_1544398:3933-nf] Peter also says in his first epistle: \"The presbyters which are among you I exhort, who am your fellow-presbyter and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: feed the flock of Christ[fn-55-P5542_1544657:3934-nf] ...taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly, according unto God.\"[fn-55-P5543_1544766:3935-nf] In the Greek the meaning is still plainer, for the word used is episkopountej, that is to say, overseeing, and this is the origin of the name overseer or bishop.[fn-55-P5544_1544988:3936-nf] But perhaps the testimony of these great men seems to you insufficient. If so, then listen to the blast of the gospel trumpet, that son of thunder,[fn-55-P5545_1545156:3937-nf] the disciple whom Jesus loved[fn-55-P5546_1545209:3938-nf] and who reclining on the Saviour's breast drank in the waters of sound doctrine. One of his letters begins thus: \"The presbyter unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth;\"[fn-55-P5547_1545425:3939-nf] and another thus: \"The presbyter unto the well-beloved Gains whom I love in the truth.\"[fn-55-P5548_1545532:3940-nf] When subsequently one presbyter was chosen to preside over the rest, this was done to remedy schism and to prevent each individual from rending the church of Christ by drawing it to himself. For even at Alexandria from the time of Mark the Evangelist until the episcopates of Heraclas and Dionysius the presbyters always named as bishop one of their own number chosen by themselves and set in a more exalted position, just as an army elects a general, or as deacons appoint one of themselves whom they know to be diligent and call him archdeacon. For what function, excepting ordination, belongs to a bishop that does not also belong to a presbyter? It is not the case that there is one church at Rome and another in all the world beside. Gaul and Britain, Africa and Persia, India and the East worship one Christ and observe one rule of truth. If you ask for authority, the world outweighs its capital.[fn-55-P5549_1546456:3941-nf] Wherever there is a bishop, whether it be at Rome or at Engubium, whether it be at Constantinople or at Rhegium, whether it be at Alexandria or at Zoan, his dignity is one and his priesthood is one. Neither the command of wealth nor the lowliness of poverty makes him more a bishop or less a bishop.

And shall he thus have, as the first benefit (resulting therefrom), this, that he should desire longer life, when the apostle himself is in haste to be \"with the Lord? \"[fn-10-P1050_265161:66-nf] Assuredly, most free will he be from encumbrance in persecutions, most constant in martyrdoms, most prompt in distributions of his goods, most temperate in acquisitions; lastly, undistracted by cares will he die, when he has left children behind him-perhaps to perform the last rites over his grave! Is it then, perchance, in forecast for the commonwealth that such (marriages)are contracted? for fear the States fail, if no rising generations be trained up? for fear the rights of law, for fear the branches of commerce, sink quite into decay? for fear the temples be quite forsaken? for fear there be none to raise the acclaim, \"The lion for the Christians? \"-for these are the acclaims which they desire to hear who go in quest of offspring! Let the well-known burdensomeness of children-especially in our case-suffice to counsel widowhood: (children) whom men are compelled by laws to undertake (the charge of); because no wise man would ever willingly have desired sons! What, then, will you do if you succeed in filling your new wife with your own conscientious scruples? Are you to dissolve the conception by aid of drags? I think to us it is no more lawful to hurt (a child) in process of birth, than one (already) horn. But perhaps at that time of your wife's pregnancy you will have the hardihood to beg from God a remedy for so grave a solicitude, which, when it lay in your own power, you refused? Some (naturally) barren woman, I suppose, or (some woman) of an age already feeling the chill of years, will be the object of your forecasting search. A course prudent enough, and, above all, worthy of a believer! For there is no woman whom we have believed to have borne (a child) when barren or old, when God so willed! which he is all the more likely to do if any one, by the presumption of this foresight of his own, provoke emulation on the part of God. In fine, we know a case among our brethren, in which one of them took a barren woman in second marriage for his daughter's sake, and became' as well for the second time a father as for the second time a husband.","title":"V.

At last they planned an attack upon him, and having punished him severely, and put him to flight, vexed him for a long time. On one occasion when he opposed Xantippe; who from above was heaping abuse upon him, the termagant soused him with dirty water, but he only wiped his head and said, \"I knew that a shower must follow such thunder as that.\"[fn-65-P6545_2046141:365-nf] Metella, consort of L.

It was the common talk of Athens, as I learnt in my youthful years when we soon pick up what is bad, and yet Sulla was in the dark, and first got to know the secrets of his household through the abuse of his enemies. Cn. Pompey had an impure wife[fn-65-P6548_2047348:368-nf] Mucia, who was surrounded by eunuchs from Pontus and troops of the countrymen of Mithridates.

Finding himself excluded he held his tongue, and consoled himself for the insult by reading a tragic poem.[fn-65-P6552_2048497:372-nf] Gorgias the Rhetorician recited his excellent treatise on Concord to the Greeks, then at variance among themselves, at Olympia. Whereupon[fn-65-P6553_2048830:373-nf] Melanthius his enemy observed: \"Here is a man who teaches us concord, and yet could not make concord between himself his wife, and maid-servant, three persons in one house.\" The truth was that his wife envied the beauty of the girl, and drove the purest of men wild with daily quarrels.

In all the bombast of tragedy and the overthrow of houses, cities, and kingdoms, it is the wives and concubines who stir up strife. Parents take up arms against their children: unspeakable banquets are served: and on account of the rape of one wretched woman Europe and Asia are involved in a ten years' war. We read of some who were divorced the day after they were married, and immediately married again. Both husbands are to blame, both he who was so soon dissatisfied, and he who was so soon pleased. Epicurus the patron of pleasure (though[fn-65-P6561_2051646:381-nf] Metrodorus his disciple married Leontia) says that a wise man can seldom marry, because marriage has many drawbacks. And as riches, honours, bodily health, and other things which we call indifferent, are neither good nor bad, but stand as it were midway, and become good and bad according to the use and issue, so wives stand on the border line of good and ill. It is, moreover, a serious matter for a wise man to be in doubt whether he is going to marry a good or a bad woman.[fn-65-P6562_2052427:382-nf] Chrysippus ridiculously maintains that a wise man should marry, that he may not outrage Jupiter[fn-65-P6563_2052912:383-nf] Gamelius and Genethlius.

I will follow in detail the views now expounded, and before I come to Scripture and show by it that fasting is pleasing to God, and chastity accepted by him, I will meet philosophic argument with argument, and will prove that we are not followers of Empedocles and Pythagoras, who on account of their doctrine of the transmigration of souls think nothing which lives and moves should be eaten, and look upon him who fells a fir-tree or an oak as equally guilty with the parricide or the poisoner: but that we worship our Creator Who made all things for the use of man. And as the ox was created for ploughing, the horse for riding, dogs for watching, goats for milk, sheep for their wool: so it was with swine and stags, and roes and hares, and other animals: but the immediate purpose of their creation was not that they might serve for food, but for other uses of men. For if everything that moves and lives was made for food, and prepared for the stomach, let my opponents tellme why elephants, lions, leopards, and wolves were created; why vipers, scorpions, bugs, lice, and fleas; why the vulture, the eagle, the crow, the hawk; why whales, dolphins, seals, and small snails were created. Which of us ever eats the flesh of a lion, a viper, a vulture, a stork, a kite, or the worms that crawl upon our shores? As then these have their proper uses, so may we say that other beasts, fishes, birds, were created not for eating, but for medicine. In short, to how many uses the flesh of vipers, from which we make our antidotes against poison, may be applied, physicians know well. Ivory dust is an ingredient in many remedies. Hyena's gall restores brightness to the eyes, and its dung and that of dogs cures gangrenous wounds. And (it may seem strange to the reader) Galen asserts in his treatise on Simples, that human dung is of service in a multitude of cases. Naturalists say that snake-skin, boiled in oil, gives wonderful relief in ear-ache. What to the uninitiated seems so useless as a bug? Yet, suppose a leech to have fastened on the throat, as soon as the odour of a bug is inhaled the leech is vomited out, and difficulty in urinating is relieved by the same application. As for the fat of pigs, geese, fowls, and pheasants, how useful they are is told in all medical works, and if you read these books you will see there that the vulture has as many curative properties as it has limbs. Peacock's dung allays the inflammation of gout. Cranes, storks, eagle's gall, hawk's blood, the ostrich, frogs, chameleons, swallow's dung and flesh-in what diseases these are suitable remedies, I could tell if it were my purpose to discuss bodily ailments and their cure. If you think proper you may read Aristotle and[fn-66-P6666_2093457:73-nf] Theophrastus in prose, or[fn-66-P6667_2093508:74-nf] Marcellus of Side, and our[fn-66-P6668_2093703:75-nf] Flavius, who discourse on these subjects in hexameter verse; the[fn-66-P6669_2094046:76-nf] second Pliny also, and[fn-66-P6670_2094294:77-nf] Dioscorides, and others, both naturalists and physicians, who assign to every herb, every stone, every animal whether reptile, bird, or fish, its own use in the art of which they treat. So then when you ask me why the pig was created, I immediately reply, as if two boys were disputing, by asking you why were vipers and scorpions? You must not judge that anything from the hand of God is superfluous, because there are many beasts and birds which your palate rejects. But this may perhaps look more like contentiousness and pugnacity than truth. Let me tell you therefore that pigs and wild-boars, and stags, and the rest of living creatures were created, that soldiers, athletes, sailors, rhetoricians, miners, and other slaves of hard toil, who need physical strength, might have food: and also those who carry arms and provisions, who wear themselves out with the work of hand or foot, who ply the oar, who need good lungs to shout and speak, who level mountains and sleep out rain or fair. But our religion does not train boxers, athletes, sailors, soldiers, or ditchers, but followers of wisdom, who devote themselves to the worship of God, and know why they were created and are in the world from which they are impatient to depart. Hence also the Apostle says:[fn-66-P6671_2095753:78-nf] \"When I am weak, then am I strong.\" And.[fn-66-P6672_2095815:79-nf] \"Though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.\" And[fn-66-P6673_2095919:80-nf] \"I have the desire to depart and be with Christ.\" And,[fn-66-P6674_2095992:81-nf] \"Make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof.\" Are all commanded[fn-66-P6675_2096094:82-nf] not to have two coats, nor food in their scrip, money in their purse, a staff in the hand, shoes on the feet? or to sell all they possess and give to the poor, and follow Jesus? Of course not: but the command is for those who wish to be perfect. On the contrary John the Baptist lays down one rule for the soldiers, another for the publicans. But the Lord says in the Gospel to him who had boasted of having kept the whole law:[fn-66-P6676_2096566:83-nf] \"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow me.\" That He might not seem to lay a heavy burden on unwilling shoulders, He sent His hearer away with full power to please himself, saying \"If thou wilt be perfect.\" And so I too say to you: If you wish to be perfect, it is good not to drink wine, and eat flesh. If you wish to be perfect, it is better to enrich the mind than to stuff the body. But if you are an infant and fond of the cooks and their preparations, no one will snatch the dainties out of your mouth. Eat and drink, and, if you like, with Israel rise up and play, and sing[fn-66-P6677_2097224:84-nf] \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.\" Let him eat and drink, who looks for death when he has feasted, and who says with Epicurus, \"There is nothing after death, and death itself is nothing.\" We believe Paul when he says in tones of thunder:[fn-66-P6678_2097497:85-nf] \"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats.

For none of these is what it has: the cup is not liquor, nor the body color, nor the air light and heat, nor the mind wisdom. And hence they can be deprived of what they have, and can be turned or changed into other qualities and states, so that the cup may be emptied of the liquid of which it is full, the body be discolored, the air darken, the mind grow silly. The incorruptible body which is promised to the saints in the resurrection cannot, indeed, lose its quality of incorruption, but the bodily substance and the quality of incorruption are not the same thing. For the quality of incorruption resides entire in each several part, not greater in one and less in another; for no part is more incorruptible than another. The body, indeed, is itself greater in whole than in part; and one part of it is larger, another smaller, yet is not the larger more incorruptible than the smaller. The body, then, which is not in each of its parts a whole body, is one thing; incorruptibility, which is throughout complete, is another thing;-for every part of the incorruptible body, however unequal to the rest otherwise, is equally incorrupt. For the hand, e.g., is not more incorrupt than the finger because it is larger than the finger; so, though finger and hand are unequal, their incorruptibility is equal. Thus, although incorruptibility is inseparable from an incorruptible body, yet the substance of the body is one thing, the quality of incorruption another. And therefore the body is not what it has. The soul itself, too, though it be always wise (as it will be eternally when it is redeemed), will be so by participating in the unchangeable wisdom, which it is not; for though the air be never robbed of the light that is shed abroad in it, it is not on that account the same thing as the light.

In a former section I expressed a fear[fn-29-P2979_1155489:82-nf] that, when Pelagius said that \"a man was able by the help of God's grace to live without sin,\" he perhaps meant by the term \"grace\" the capability possessed by nature as created by God with a free will, as it is understood in that book which I received as his and to which I replied;[fn-29-P2980_1155795:83-nf] and that by these means he was deceiving the judges, who were ignorant of the circumstances. Now, however, since he anathematizes those persons who hold that \"God's grace and assistance is not given for single actions, but is imparted in the freedom of the will, or in the law and in doctrine,\" it is quite evident that he really means the grace which is preached in the Church of Christ, and is conferred by the ministration of the Holy Ghost for the purpose of helping us in our single actions, whence it is that we pray for needful and suitable grace that we enter not into any temptation. Nor, again, have I any longer a fear that, when he said, \"No man can be without sin unless he has acquired a knowledge of the law,\" and added this explanation of his words, that \"he posited in the knowledge of the law, help towards the avoidance of sin,\"[fn-29-P2981_1156789:84-nf] he at all meant the said knowledge to be considered as tantamount to the grace of God; for, observe, he anathematizes such as hold this opinion. See, too, how he refuses to hold our natural free will, or the law and doctrine, as equivalent to that grace of God which helps us through our single actions What else then is left to him but to understand that grace which the apostle tells us is given by \"the supply of the Spirit?\"[fn-29-P2982_1157239:85-nf] and concerning which the Lord said: \"Take no thought how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.\"[fn-29-P2983_1157486:86-nf] Nor, again, need I be under any apprehension that, when he asserted, \"All men are ruled by their own will,\" and afterwards explained that he had made that statement \"in the interest of the freedom of our will, of which God is the helper whenever it makes choice of good,\"[fn-29-P2984_1157780:87-nf] that he perhaps here also held God's helping grace as synonymous with our natural free will and the teaching of the law. For inasmuch ashe rightly anathematized the persons who holdthat God's grace or assistance is not given for single actions, but lies in the gift of free will, or in the law and doctrine, it follows, of course, that God's grace or assistance is given us for single actions,-free will, or the law and the doctrine, being left out of consideration; and thus through all the single actions of our life, when we act rightly, we are ruled and directed by God; nor is our prayer a useless one, wherein we say: \"Order my steps according to Thy word, and let not any iniquity have dominion. over me.\"[fn-29-P2985_1158514:88-nf] ","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_14_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"79.

We shall therefor repeat word for word the statement laiddown by him, which supports our argument as follows:-\"The blessed John,\" he says,\"teaches us that God the Word, by Whom allthings were made, has become incarnate, saying`And the Word was made flesh.'\" Does he understand what he is writing when he adds this to his own argument? I can hardly myselfthink that the same man can at once be aware of the meaning of these words and contendagainst our statement. For if any one examinesthe words carefully, he will find that there is nomutual conflict between what is said by us and what is said by him. For we both consider the dispensation in the flesh apart, and regard the Divine power in itself: and he, in like manner with ourselves, says that the Word that was in the beginning has been manifested in the flesh: yet no one ever charged him, nor does he charge himself, with preaching \"two Words\", Him Who was in the beginning, and Him Who was made flesh; for he knows, surely, that the Word is identical with the Word, He who appeared in the flesh with Him Who was with God. But the flesh was not identical with the Godhead, till this too was transformed to the Godhead, so that of necessity one set of attributes befits God the Word, and a different set of attributes befits the \"form of the servant[fn-16-P1641_949842:46-nf] .\" If, then, in view of such a confession, he does not reproach himself with the duality of Words, why are we falsely charged with dividing the object of oar faith into \"two Christs\"?-we, who say that He Who was highly exalted after His Passion, was made Lord and Christ by His union[fn-16-P1642_951120:47-nf] with Him Who is verily Lord and Christ, knowing by what we have learnt that the Divine Nature is always one and the same, and with the same mode of existence, while the flesh in itself is that which reason and sense apprehend concerning it, but when mixed[fn-16-P1643_951390:48-nf] with the Divine no longer remains in its own limitations and properties, but is taken up to that which is overwhelming and transcendent. Our contemplation, however, of the respective properties of the flesh and of the Godhead remains free from confusion, so long as each of these is contemplated by itself[fn-16-P1644_951728:49-nf] , as, for example, \"the Word was before the ages, but the flesh came into being in the last times\": but one could not reverse this statement, and say that the latter is pretemporal, or that the Word has come into being in the last times. The flesh is of a passible, the Word of an operative nature: and neither is the flesh capable of making the things that are, nor is the power possessed by the Godhead capable of suffering. The Word was in the beginning with God, the man was subject to the trial of death; and neither was the Human Nature from everlasting, nor the Divine Nature mortal: and all the rest of the attributes are contemplated in the same way. It is not the Human Nature that raises up Lazarus, nor is it the power that cannot suffer that weeps for him when he lies in the grave: the tear proceeds from the Man, the life from the true Life. It is not the Human Nature that feeds the thousands, nor is it omnipotent might that hastens to the fig-tree. Who is it that is weary with the journey, and Who is it that by His word made all the world subsist? What is the brightness of the glory, and what is that that was pierced with the nails? What form is it that is buffeted in the Passion, and what form is it that is glorified from everlasting? So much as this is clear, (even if one does not follow the argument into detail,) that the blows belong to the servant in whom the Lord was, the honours to the Lord Whom the servant compassed about, so that by reason of contact and the union of Natures the proper attributes of each belong to both[fn-16-P1645_953622:50-nf] , as the Lord receives the stripes of the servant, while the servant is glorified with the honour of the Lord; for this is why the Cross is said to be the Cross of the Lord of glory[fn-16-P1646_954208:51-nf] , and why every tongue confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father[fn-16-P1647_954317:52-nf] .","title":"Book V","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_25_the_second_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_ephesians","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"ANF-01","text":"For, so long as there is not implanted in you any one lust which is able to torment you, behold, ye live in God.

Let not the number which added itself affright you. (ch. ii. 41; iv. 4.) He might also have mentioned another instance, that of the Egyptian, but what he has spoken is fully sufficient. And he closes his speech with an alarming topic: \"Lest haply,\" etc. And he does not pronounce upon it, lest he should seem to be pleading their cause; but he reasons by way of syllogism froth the issue of the matter. And he does not venture to pronounce that it is not of men, nor yet that it is of God; for bad he said that it was of God. they would have gainsaid him: but had he said that it was of men, they would again have taken prompt measures. Therefore he bids them wait for the end, saying, \"Refrain,\" But they once more threaten knowing indeed that they avail nothing, but doing after their manner. Such is the nature of wickedness: it attempts even impossibilities.-\"And after this man rose up Judas,\" etc. These things Josephus relates in detail. (Ant. xx. 8; ib. v. 2; xviii. 1. B. J. ii. 8. 1.) But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm: that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of persons![fn-6-P678_538091:9-nf] And he does not say, \"But if ye do not overthrow it, it is of God;\" but, \"If it be of God, it will not be overthrown.\" \"And to him they agreed.\" (v. 40.) They reverenced the high character of the man. \"And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.\" (v. 41.) What miracles so wonderful as this? Nowhere is the like of this recorded of the old saints: for Jeremiah indeed was scourged for the word of God, and they threatened Elijah, and the rest: but in this case, even by this very thing, and not only by their miracles, these showed forth the power of God. He does not say, that they were not pained, but that though pained they rejoiced. How does this appear? From their boldness afterwards: they were so instant still, even after their beatings, in preaching the word. \"But in the temple,\" it says, \"and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\" (v. 42.) \"And in those days \"-when these things were done, when there were scourgings, when there were threatenings, when the disciples were multiplying-also, it says, \"there arose a murmuring.\" (ch. vi. 1.) And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict order in a multitude. \"There arose a murmuring,\"etc. to,-\"And[fn-6-P679_539639:10-nf] a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.-There arose murmuring against the Hebrews \"-for that description of people seemed to be more honorable-\" because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.\"[fn-6-P680_540664:11-nf] (v. 1-7.) So then there was a daily ministration for the widows. And observe how he calls it a \"ministration\" (diakonia), and not directly alms: extolling by this at once the doers, and those to whom it was done. \"Were neglected.\" This did not arise from malice, but perhaps from the carelessness of the multitude. And therefore he brought it forward openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it was a great evil that it existed.[fn-6-P681_541655:12-nf] \"Then the twelve,\" etc. (v. 2.) Do you observe[fn-6-P682_542527:13-nf] how outward concerns succeed to inward? They do not act at their own discretion, but plead for themselves to the congregation. So ought it to be done now. \"It is not reason,\" says he, \"that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\" First he puts to them the unreasonableness of the thing; that it is not possible for both things to be done with the same attention: just as when they were about to ordain Matthias, they first show the necessity of the thing, that one was deficient, and there must needs be twelve. And so here they showed the necessity; and they did it not sooner, but waited till the murmuring arose; nor, on the other hand, did they suffer this to spread far. And, lo! they leave the decision to them: those who pleased all, those who of all were honestly reputed, them they present:[fn-6-P683_543553:14-nf] not now twelve, but \"seven, full of the Spirit and of wisdom: well reported of\" for their conversation. (v. 3.) Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, \"Therefore must one of these men which have companied with us all the time\" (ch. i. 21): but not so here: for the case was not alike. And they do not now put it to the lot; they might indeed themselves have made the election, as moved by the Spirit: but nevertheless, they desire the testimony of the people. The fixing the number, and the ordaining them, and for this kind of business, rested with them: but the choice of the men they make over to the people, that they might not seem to act from favor: just as God also leaves it to Moses to choose as elders those whom he knew. (Num. xi. 16.) \"And of wisdom.\" For indeed there needs much wisdom in such ministrations. For think not, because he hath not the word committed unto him, that such an one has no need of wisdom: he does need it, and much too. \"But we,\" saith he, \"will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.\" (v. 4.) Again they plead for themselves, beginning and ending with this. \"Will give ourselves continually,\" he saith. For so it behooved, not just to do the mere acts, or in any chance way, but to be continually doing them. \"And the saying,\" we are told, \"pleased the whole multitude.\" (v. 5, 6.) This too was worthy of their wisdom. All approved of what was said so sensible was it. \"And they chose,\" it says (again it is the people (autoi) that choose,) \"Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.\" They separated them from the multitude, and it is the people (autoi) that draw them, not the Apostles that lead them. Observe how he avoids all that is superfluous: he does not tell in what way it was done, but that they were ordained (exeirotonhqhsan) with prayer: for this is the meaning of xeirotonia, (i.e. \"putting forth the hand,\") or ordination: the hand of the man is laid upon (the person,) but the whole work is of God, and it is His hand which toucheth the head of the one ordained, if he be duly ordained. \"And the word of God,\" it says, \"increased: and the number of the disciples multiplied.\" (v. 7.) It is not for nothing that he says this: it shows how great is the virtue of alms and good order. And as he is about in the sequel to enlarge (aucein) upon the affair of Stephen, he puts first the causes which led to it. \"And many,\" he says, \"of the priests were obedient to the faith.\" For[fn-6-P684_546413:15-nf] since they perceived such to be the mind of their ruler and teacher, they put the matter to the test of facts.-It is also a subject for wonder, how it was that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and how it was that the Apostles were not rejected by them. But what sort of rank these bore, and what sort of office they received, this is what we need to learn. Was it that of Deacons? And yet this is not the case in the Churches. But[fn-6-P685_547436:16-nf] is it to the Presbyters that the management belongs? And yet at present there was no Bishop, but the Apostles only. Whence I think it clearly and manifestily follows, that neither Deacons nor Presbyters is their designation: but it was for this particular purpose that they were ordained.[fn-6-P686_551764:17-nf] And this business was not simply handed over to them without further ceremony, but the Apostles prayed over them, that power might be given to them. But observe, I pray you, if there were need of seven men for this, great in proportion must have been the sums of money that flowed in, great in proportion also the number of widows. So then the prayers were not made in an off-hand way, but with much deliberate attention: and this office,[fn-6-P687_552972:18-nf] as well as preaching, was thus brought to good effect; for what they did, they effected mostly by the means of these (their prayers.) Thus they were enabled to give their attention to things spiritual; thus were these also free to undertake long journeys; thus were these put in trust with the word. But the writer does not say this, nor extol them, but that it was \"not reason\" that they should leave the work given to them. Thus they had been taught by Moses's example not to undertake the management of everything by themselves. (Num. xi. 14.) \"Only,\" it is said, \"that we should remember the poor.\" (Gal. ii. 10.) And[fn-6-P688_554824:19-nf] how did they bring these forward? They fasted. \"Look you out seven men,\" etc. (v. 3.) It is not simply, spiritual men, but, \"full of the Spirit and of wisdom, \"for it needed very great superiority of mind (filosofiaj) to bear the complainings of widows. For what profits it, that the dispenser of alms steal not, if nevertheless he waste all, or be harsh and easily provoked? \"And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost.\" (v. 5.) And in this regard Philip also was admirable: for it is of him that the writer says: \"And we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.\"-(ch. xxi. 8.) Dost thou mark how matters are ordered quite otherwise than after the matter of men? \"And the number of disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem.\" (v. 7.) In Jerusalem the multitude increased. Wonderful, where Christ was slain, there the preaching increased! And not only was it not the case that some were offended then in the manner of Ananias, but the awe became even greater: while these are scourged, those threatening, those tempting the Spirit, those murmuring. But I would have thee remark under what circumstances the multitude increased: after these trials, then it was that the multitude increased, and not before. Mark also how great the mercy of God. Of those chief-priests, of the very men who had indignation and sore displeasure and so cried out and said, \"He saved others, Himself He cannot save;\" of these same,\" Many,\" it says, \"were obedient unto the faith.\" (Matt. xxvii. 42.)

And therefore he brought it forward openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it was a great evil that it existed.[fn-6-P681_541655:12-nf] \"Then the twelve,\" etc. (v. 2.) Do you observe[fn-6-P682_542527:13-nf] how outward concerns succeed to inward? They do not act at their own discretion, but plead for themselves to the congregation. So ought it to be done now. \"It is not reason,\" says he, \"that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.\" First he puts to them the unreasonableness of the thing; that it is not possible for both things to be done with the same attention: just as when they were about to ordain Matthias, they first show the necessity of the thing, that one was deficient, and there must needs be twelve. And so here they showed the necessity; and they did it not sooner, but waited till the murmuring arose; nor, on the other hand, did they suffer this to spread far. And, lo! they leave the decision to them: those who pleased all, those who of all were honestly reputed, them they present:[fn-6-P683_543553:14-nf] not now twelve, but \"seven, full of the Spirit and of wisdom: well reported of\" for their conversation. (v. 3.) Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, \"Therefore must one of these men which have companied with us all the time\" (ch. i. 21): but not so here: for the case was not alike. And they do not now put it to the lot; they might indeed themselves have made the election, as moved by the Spirit: but nevertheless, they desire the testimony of the people. The fixing the number, and the ordaining them, and for this kind of business, rested with them: but the choice of the men they make over to the people, that they might not seem to act from favor: just as God also leaves it to Moses to choose as elders those whom he knew. (Num. xi. 16.) \"And of wisdom.\" For indeed there needs much wisdom in such ministrations. For think not, because he hath not the word committed unto him, that such an one has no need of wisdom: he does need it, and much too. \"But we,\" saith he, \"will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.\" (v. 4.) Again they plead for themselves, beginning and ending with this. \"Will give ourselves continually,\" he saith. For so it behooved, not just to do the mere acts, or in any chance way, but to be continually doing them. \"And the saying,\" we are told, \"pleased the whole multitude.\" (v. 5, 6.) This too was worthy of their wisdom. All approved of what was said so sensible was it. \"And they chose,\" it says (again it is the people (autoi) that choose,) \"Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.\" They separated them from the multitude, and it is the people (autoi) that draw them, not the Apostles that lead them. Observe how he avoids all that is superfluous: he does not tell in what way it was done, but that they were ordained (exeirotonhqhsan) with prayer: for this is the meaning of xeirotonia, (i.e. \"putting forth the hand,\") or ordination: the hand of the man is laid upon (the person,) but the whole work is of God, and it is His hand which toucheth the head of the one ordained, if he be duly ordained. \"And the word of God,\" it says, \"increased: and the number of the disciples multiplied.\" (v. 7.) It is not for nothing that he says this: it shows how great is the virtue of alms and good order. And as he is about in the sequel to enlarge (aucein) upon the affair of Stephen, he puts first the causes which led to it. \"And many,\" he says, \"of the priests were obedient to the faith.\" For[fn-6-P684_546413:15-nf] since they perceived such to be the mind of their ruler and teacher, they put the matter to the test of facts.-It is also a subject for wonder, how it was that the multitude was not divided in its choice of the men, and how it was that the Apostles were not rejected by them. But what sort of rank these bore, and what sort of office they received, this is what we need to learn. Was it that of Deacons? And yet this is not the case in the Churches. But[fn-6-P685_547436:16-nf] is it to the Presbyters that the management belongs? And yet at present there was no Bishop, but the Apostles only. Whence I think it clearly and manifestily follows, that neither Deacons nor Presbyters is their designation: but it was for this particular purpose that they were ordained.[fn-6-P686_551764:17-nf] And this business was not simply handed over to them without further ceremony, but the Apostles prayed over them, that power might be given to them. But observe, I pray you, if there were need of seven men for this, great in proportion must have been the sums of money that flowed in, great in proportion also the number of widows. So then the prayers were not made in an off-hand way, but with much deliberate attention: and this office,[fn-6-P687_552972:18-nf] as well as preaching, was thus brought to good effect; for what they did, they effected mostly by the means of these (their prayers.) Thus they were enabled to give their attention to things spiritual; thus were these also free to undertake long journeys; thus were these put in trust with the word. But the writer does not say this, nor extol them, but that it was \"not reason\" that they should leave the work given to them. Thus they had been taught by Moses's example not to undertake the management of everything by themselves. (Num. xi. 14.) \"Only,\" it is said, \"that we should remember the poor.\" (Gal. ii. 10.) And[fn-6-P688_554824:19-nf] how did they bring these forward? They fasted. \"Look you out seven men,\" etc. (v. 3.) It is not simply, spiritual men, but, \"full of the Spirit and of wisdom, \"for it needed very great superiority of mind (filosofiaj) to bear the complainings of widows. For what profits it, that the dispenser of alms steal not, if nevertheless he waste all, or be harsh and easily provoked? \"And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost.\" (v. 5.) And in this regard Philip also was admirable: for it is of him that the writer says: \"And we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.\"-(ch. xxi. 8.) Dost thou mark how matters are ordered quite otherwise than after the matter of men? \"And the number of disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem.\" (v. 7.) In Jerusalem the multitude increased. Wonderful, where Christ was slain, there the preaching increased! And not only was it not the case that some were offended then in the manner of Ananias, but the awe became even greater: while these are scourged, those threatening, those tempting the Spirit, those murmuring. But I would have thee remark under what circumstances the multitude increased: after these trials, then it was that the multitude increased, and not before. Mark also how great the mercy of God. Of those chief-priests, of the very men who had indignation and sore displeasure and so cried out and said, \"He saved others, Himself He cannot save;\" of these same,\" Many,\" it says, \"were obedient unto the faith.\" (Matt. xxvii. 42.)

That marriage can take place of persons first ill joined, an honest decree following after, is manifest. But a marriage once for all entered upon in the City of our God, where, even from the first union of the two,theman and the woman, marriage bears a certain sacramental character, can no way be dissolved but by the death of one of them. For the bond of marriage remains, although a family, for the sake of which it was entered upon, do not follow through manifest barrenness; so that, when now married persons know that they shall not have children, yet it is not lawful for them to separate even for the very sake of children, and to join themselves unto others. And if they shall so do, they commit adultery with those unto whom they join themselves, but themselves remain husbands and wives. Clearly with the good will of the wife to take another woman, that from her may be born sons common to both, by the sexual intercourse and seed of the one, but by the right and power of the other, was lawful among the ancient fathers: whether it be lawful now also, I would not hastily pronounce. For there is not now necessity of begetting children, as there then was, when, even when wives bare children, it was allowed, in order to a more numerous posterity, to marry other wives in addition, which now is certainly not lawful.

But now a new statute, breathing the very spirit of modesty, proceeded from the emperor, which peremptorily forbade the con- tinuance of former practices. And besides this he sent them also written exhortations, as though he had been especially ordained by God for this end, that he might instruct all men in the principles of chastity. Hence, he disdained not to communicate by letter even with these persons, urging them to seek diligently the knowledge of God. At the same time he followed up his words by corresponding deeds, and erected even in this city a church of great size and magnificence: so that an event unheard of before in any age, now for the first time came to pass, namely, that a city which had hitherto been wholly given up to superstition now obtained the privilege of a church of God, with presbyters and deacons, and its people were placed under the presiding care of a bishop consecrated to the service of the supreme God. And further, the emperor, being anxious that here also as many as possible might be won to the truth, bestowed abundant provision for the necessities of the poor, desiring even thus to invite them to seek the doctrines of salvation, as though he were almost adopting the words of him who said, \"Whether in pretense, or in truth, let Christ be preached.\"[fn-77-P7781_3211941:71-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_34_book_iii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"4.

Now this ambiguity is resolved by one word that follows, which is translated enim [for]; and the translators who have omitted this particle have preferred the interpretation which makes the apostle seem not only in a strait betwixt two, but also to have a desire for two.[fn-50-P5060_2719296:8-nf] We must therefore punctuate the sentence thus: \"et quid eligam ignoro: compellor autem ex duobus\" [what I shall choose I wot not: for I am in a strait betwixt two]; and after this point follows: \"concupiscentiam habens dissolvi, et esse cum Christo\" [having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ]. And, as if he were asked why he has a desire for this in preference to the other, he adds: \"multo enim magis optimum\" [for it is far better]. Why, then, is he in a strait betwixt the two?

It was the want of clear views on this question that originated, or at least greatly aggravated, the Pelagian heresy. And the efforts of Tichonius to clear up this point were good, but not complete. For, in discussing the question about faith and works, he said that works were given us by God as the reward of faith, but that faith itself was so far our own that it did not come to us from God; not keeping in mind the saying of the apostle: \"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,\"[fn-52-P5234_2779975:73-nf] But he had not come into contact with this heresy, which has arisen in our time, and has given us much labor and trouble in defending against it the grace of God which is through our Lord Jesus Christ, and which (according to the saying of the apostle, \"There must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you\"[fn-52-P5235_2780347:74-nf] ) has made us much more watchful and diligent to discover in Scripture what escaped Tichonius, who, having no enemy to guard against, was less attentive and anxious on this point, namely, that even faith itself is the gift of Him who \"hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.\"[fn-52-P5236_2780649:75-nf] Whence it is said to certain believers: \"Unto you it is given, in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.\"[fn-52-P5237_2780817:76-nf] Who, then, can doubt that each of these is the gift of God, when he learns from this passage, and believes, that each of them is given?

Wherefore our Lord Himself, before saying what I have just quoted about men of this stamp, made this observation: \"The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.\"[fn-54-P5478_2907666:78-nf] The seat they occupied, then, which was not theirs but Moses', compelled them to say what was good, though they did what was evil.

But the second passage suggests a better view, namely, that as many beings were framed with a body, the first made of these was the creature called dragon, but called in another passage[fn-62-P6216_969359:72-nf] the great whale (leviathan) which the Lord tamed. We must ask about this; whether, when the saints were living a blessed life apart from matter and from any body, the dragon, falling from the pure life, became fit to be bound in matter and in a body, so that the Lord could say, speaking through storm and clouds, \"This is the beginning of the creation of God, made for His angels to mock at.\" It is possible, however, that the dragon is not positively the beginning of the creation of the Lord, but that there were many creatures made with a body for the angels to mock at, and that the dragon was the first of these, while others could subsist in a body without such reproach. But it is not so. For the soul of the sun is placed in a body, and the whole creation, of which the Apostle says:[fn-62-P6217_970169:73-nf] \"The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now,\" and perhaps the following is about the same: \"The creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it for hope; \"so that bodies might be in vanity, and doing the things of the body, as he who is in the body must.[fn-62-P6218_970517:74-nf] ... One who is in the body does the things of the body, though unwillingly. Wherefore the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but he who does unwillingly the things of the body does what he does for the sake of hope, as if we should say that Paul desired to remain in the flesh, not willingly, but on account of hope. For though he thought it better[fn-62-P6219_970914:75-nf] to be dissolved and to be with Christ, it was not unreasonable that he should wish to remain in the flesh for the sake of the benefit to others and of advancement in the things hoped for, not only by him, but also by those benefited by him. This meaning of the term\" beginning,\" as of origin, will serve us also in the passage in which Wisdom speaks in the Proverbs.[fn-62-P6220_971299:76-nf] \"God,\" we read, \"created me the beginning of His ways, for His works.\" Here the term could be interpreted as in the first application we spoke of, that of a way: \"The Lord,\" it says, \"created me the beginning of His ways.\" One might assert, and with reason, that God Himself is the beginning of all things, and might go on to say, as is plain, that the Father is the beginning of the Son; and the demiurge the beginning of the works of the demiurge, and that God in a word is the beginning of all that exists.

And in order, therefore, that they may know that this also pertains to grace, let them read what the apostle says: \"And that ye be in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which indeed is to them a cause of perdition, but of your salvation, and that of God; for unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.\"[fn-50-P5051_1993807:8-nf] Certainly he said that both were given.

Truly, even in this way, too, they are saying that God's grace is given according to our merits, which Pelagius, in the ecclesiastical meeting in the East, condemned, in the fear of being condemned. For if without God's grace the desire of good begins with ourselves, merit itself will have begun-to which, as if of debt, comes the assistance of grace; and thus God's grace will not be bestowed freely, but will be given according to our merit. But that he might furnish a reply to the future Pelagius, the Lord does not say, \"Without me it is with difficulty that you can do anything,\" but He says, \"Without me ye can do nothing.[fn-53-P5339_2101324:34-nf] And, that He might also furnish an answer to these future heretics, in that very same evangelical saying He does not say, \"Without me you can perfect nothing,\" but \"do\" nothing. For if He had said \"perfect,\" they might say that God's aid is necessary not for beginning good, which is of ourselves, but for perfecting it. But let them hear also the apostle. For when the Lord says, \"Without me ye can do nothing,\" in this one word He comprehends both the beginning and the ending. The apostle, indeed, as if he were an expounder of the Lord's saying, distinguished both very clearly when he says, \"Because He who hath begun a good work in you will perfect it even to the day of Christ Jesus.\"[fn-53-P5340_2102034:35-nf] But in the Holy Scriptures, in the writings of the same apostle, we find more about that of which we are speaking. For we are now speaking of the desire of good, and if they will have this to begin of ourselves and to be perfected by God, let them see what they can answer to the apostle when he says, \"Not that we are sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.\"[fn-53-P5341_2102448:36-nf] \"To think anything,\" he says,-he certainly means, \"to think anything good;\" but is it less to think than to desire. Because we think all that we desire, but we do not desire all that we think; because sometimes also we think what we do not desire. Since, then, it is a smaller thing to think than to desire,-for a man may think good which he does not yet desire, and by advancing may afterwards desire what before without desire he thought of,-how are we not sufficient as of ourselves to that which is less, that is, to the thinking of something good, but our sufficiency is of God; while to that which is greater,-that is, to the desire of some good thing-without the divine help, we are sufficient of free will? For what the apostle says here is not, \"Not that we are sufficient as of ourselves to think that which is perfect;\" but he says, \"to think anything,\" to which \"nothing\" is the contrary.

In the epistle on \"Works and Alms,\" he says: \"Let us then acknowledge, beloved brethren, the wholesome gift of the divine mercy, and let us who cannot be without some wound of conscience heal our wounds by the spiritual remedies for the cleansing and purging of our sins. Nor let any one so flatter himself with the notion of a pure and immaculate heart, as, in dependence on his own innocence, to think that the medicine needs not to be applied to his wounds; since it is written, `Who shall boast that he hath a clean heart, or who shall boast that he is pure from sins?'[fn-57-P5737_2255687:90-nf] And again, in his epistle, John lays it down and says, 'If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.'[fn-57-P5738_2255843:91-nf] But if no one can be without sin, and whoever should say that he is without fault is either proud or foolish, how needful, how kind is the divine mercy, which, knowing that there are still found some wounds in those that have been healed, I has given even after their healing wholesome remedies for the curing and healing of their wounds anew!\"[fn-57-P5739_2256206:92-nf] Again, in the same treatise he says: \"And since there cannot fail daily to be sins committed in the sight of God, there failed not daily sacrifices wherewith the sins might be cleansed away.\"[fn-57-P5740_2256472:93-nf] Also, in the treatise on the Mortality, he says: \"Our warfare is with avarice, with immodesty, with anger, with ambition; our trying and toilsome wrestling with carnal vices, with the enticements of the world. The mind of man besieged, and on every hand invested with the onsets of the devil, scarcely meets the repeated attacks, scarcely resists them.If avarice is prostrated, lust springs up. If lust is overcome, ambition takes its place. If ambition is despised, anger exasperates, pride puffs up, wine-bibbing entices; envy breaks concord: jealousy cuts friendship; you are constrained to curse, which the divine law forbids; you are compelled to swear, which is not lawful. So many persecutions the soul suffers daily, with so many risks is the heart wearied; and yet it delights to abide here long among the devil's weapons, although it should rather be our craving and wish to hasten to Christ by the aid of a quicker death.\"[fn-57-P5741_2257426:94-nf] Again, in the same treatise he says: \"The blessed Apostle Paul in his epistle lays it down, saying, `To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain;'[fn-57-P5742_2257615:95-nf] counting it the greatest gain no longer to be held by the snares of this world, no longer to be liable to the sins and vices of the flesh.\"[fn-57-P5743_2257773:96-nf] Moreover, on the Lord's Prayer, explaining what it is we ask when we say, \"Hallowed be thy name,\" he says, among other matters: \"For we have need of daily sanctification, that we, who daily fall away, may wash out our sins by continual sanctification.\"[fn-57-P5744_2258046:97-nf] Again, in the same treatise, when he would explain our saying, \"Forgive us our debts,\" he says: \"And how necessarily, how providently and salutarily, are we admonished that we are sinners, since we are compelled to entreat for our sins; and while pardon is asked for from God, the soul recalls its own consciousness of guilt. Lest any one should flatter himself as being innocent, and by exalting himself should more deeply perish, he is instructed and taught that he sins daily, in that he is bidden to entreat daily for his sins. Thus, moreover, John also in his epistle warns us, and says: `If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.'\"[fn-57-P5745_2258840:98-nf] Rightly, also, he proposed in his letter to Quirinus his own most absolute judgment on this subject, to which he subjoined the divine testimonies, \"That no one is without filth and without sin.\"[fn-57-P5746_2259080:99-nf] There also he set down those testimonies by which original sin is confirmed, which these men endeavour to twist into I know not what new and evil meanings, whether what the holy Job says, \"No one is pure from filth not one even if his life be of one day upon the earth,\"[fn-57-P5747_2259424:100-nf] or what is read in the Psalm, \"Behold, I was conceived in iniquity; and in sins hath my mother nourished me in the womb.\"[fn-57-P5748_2259568:101-nf] To which testimonies, on account of those also who are already holy in mature age, since even they are not without filth and sin, he added also that word of the most blessed John, which he often mentions in many other places besides, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves;\"[fn-57-P5749_2259875:102-nf] and other passages of the same sentiment, which are asserted by all catholics, by way of opposing those \"who deceive themselves, and the truth is not in them.\"","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_38_homily_xxxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"Mark the vehemence with which all this is done by the Apostles: \"rent their clothes, ran in, cried out,\" all from strong affection of the soul, revolted[fn-12-P1228_1178653:1-nf] by the things that were done. For it was a grief, indeed a grief inconsolable, that they should needs be thought gods, and introduce idolatry, the very thing which they came to destroy! This also was a contrivance of the devil-but he did not prevail.[fn-12-P1229_1179016:2-nf] But what say they? \"We also are men of like passions with you.\" At the very outset they overthrew the evil. They said not simply, \"Men,\" but \"As ye.\" Then, that they may not seem to honor the gods, hear what they add: \"Preaching unto you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, Who made heaven, the sea, and all things that are therein.\" Observe how they nowhere mention things invisible[fn-12-P1230_1179544:3-nf] (b) For[fn-12-P1231_1180787:4-nf] they had learnt that one should study not so much to say somewhat worthy of God, as to say what is profitable for the hearers. (a) What then? if He be Maker of all things, why does He not also attend to these things by His Providence?-\"Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways\" (v. 16)-but wherefore He suffered them, this he does not say, for at present he keeps to the matter of immediate importance, nowhere bringing in the name of Christ. Observe, he does not wish to swell the accusation against them, but[fn-12-P1232_1181945:5-nf] rather that they themselves should refer all to God. \"Nevertheless, He left not Himself without witness, in that He did good, giving you rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.\" (v. 17.) (c) See how covertly he puts the accusation \"in that He did good,\" etc. And yet if God did this, He could not have \"let them alone;\" on the contrary, they ought to be punished, for that, enjoying so great benefits, they had not acknowledged Him, not even as their feeder.[fn-12-P1233_1183224:6-nf] \"From heaven,\" he says, \"giving you rain.\" Thus also David said, \"From the fruit of their corn and wine and oil were they made to abound\" (Ps. iv. 7), and in many places speaking of Creation, he brings forward these benefits: and Jeremiah mentions first Creation, then Providence (shown) by the rains, so that the Apostle here discourses as taught from those Scriptures. \"Filling,\" he says, \"with food and gladness.\" (Jer. v. 24.) With large liberality (filotimiaj) the food is given, not merely for a frugal sufficiency, nor stinted by the need. \"And saying these things, they scarcely stopped the multitudes\" (v. 18)-indeed by this very thing they gained most admiration-\"from sacrificing to them.\" Do you observe that this was the point with them to put an end to that madness? \"But there came,\" it says, \"certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium\" (v. 19).-Indeed children of the devil, that not in their own cities only, but also beyond them, they did these things, and as much made it their study to make an end of the preaching, as the Apostles were in earnest to establish it!-\"and having persuaded the multitude and stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city.\" (e) So then, the Gentiles regarded them as gods, but these \"dragged\" him, \"out of the city, supposing he had been dead. Having persuaded the multitude\"-for it is not likely that all thus reverenced them. In the very city in which they received this reverence, in the same were they thus terribly ill treated. And this also profited the beholders. \"Lest any man,\" he says, \"should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth aught from me.\" (v. 20.)-\"Howbeit as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and came into the city.\" (d) Here is fulfilled that saying, \"My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.\" (2 Cor. xii. 9.) Greater this than the raising of the lame man! (f) \"Came into the city.\" Do you mark the zeal, do you mark how fervent he[fn-12-P1234_1186476:7-nf] is, how set on fire! He came into the city itself again: for proof that if on any occasion he did retire, it was because he had sown the word, and because it was not right to inflame their wrath. (h) Then they went over all the cities in which they had been in danger. \"And on the morrow,\" it says, \"he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe. And when they had preached the Gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.\" (v. 21, 22.) This they said, this they showed. But it is purposely so done, not only by[fn-12-P1235_1187401:8-nf] the Apostles, but by the disciples also, that they may learn from the very outset both the might of the preaching, and that they must themselves also suffer such things, that they may stand nobly, not idly gaping for the miracles, but much more (ready) for the trials. Therefore also the Apostle himself said, \"Having the same conflict which ye saw in me and heard.\" (Phil. i. 30.) Persecutions succeeded to persecutions: wars, fightings, stonings. (g) These things, not less than the miracles, both made them more illustrious, and prepared for them a greater rejoicing. The Scripture nowhere says that they returned rejoicing because they had done miracles, but (it does say that they rejoiced), that \"they were counted worthy for that Name to suffer shame.\" (ch. v. 41.) And this they were taught of Christ, saying, \"Rejoice not that the devils obey you.\" (Luke x. 20.) For the joy indeed and without alloy is this, to suffer aught for Christ's sake. (i) \"And that through much tribulation:\" what sort of cheering (protroph) is this? how did they persuade them, by telling them at the outset of tribulations? Then also another consolation.[fn-12-P1236_1188685:9-nf] \"And when they had appointed for them elders in every Church,[fn-12-P1237_1189261:10-nf] and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed. (v. 23.) Do you mark Paul's ardor?-Then other consolation: \"Commended them,\" it says, \"to the Lord. And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia (v. 24, 25): (l) and thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.\" (v. 26.) Why do they come back to Antioch? To report what had taken place yonder. And besides, there is a great purpose of Providence concerned: for it was needful that they should thenceforth preach with boldness to the Gentiles. They come therefore, reporting these things, that they may be able to know them: and it is providentially ordered, that just then came those who forbade to keep company with the Gentiles in order that from Jerusalem they might obtain great encouragement, and so go their ways with boldness. And besides, it shows that in their temper there was nothing of self-will: for they come, at the same time showing their boldness, in that without the authority of those (at Jerusalem) they had preached to the Gentiles, and their obedience, in that they refer the matter to them: for they were not made arrogant, as (apenohqhsan) having achieved so great successes. \"Whence,\" it says, \"they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.\" And yet moreover the Spirit had said, \"Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.\" (ch. xiii. 2.) \"And when they were come, and had gathered the Church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how He had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles. And there they abode long time with the disciples.\" (v. 27, 28.)

For \"how,\" says he, \"shall they call upon Him in whom they have not believed?\"[fn-61-P6119_2371330:153-nf] The spirit of grace, therefore, causes us to have faith, in order that through faith we may, on praying for it, obtain the ability to do what we are commanded.

For I have received faith, which worketh by love, but I have not received perseverance therein to the end. Will any one dare to say that this perseverance is not the gift of God, and that so great a possession as this is ours in such wise that if any one have it the apostle could not say to him, `For what hast thou which thou hast not received?'[fn-63-P6385_2445187:35-nf] since he has this in such a manner as that he has not received it?\" To this, indeed, we are not able to deny, that perseverance in good, progressing even to the end, is also a great gift of God; and that it exists not save it comefrom Him of whom it is written, \"Every best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.\"[fn-63-P6386_2445563:36-nf] But the rebuke of him who has not persevered must not on that account be neglected, \"lest God perchance give unto him repentance, and he recover from the snares of the devil;\"[fn-63-P6387_2445756:37-nf] since to the usefulness of rebuke the apostle has subjoined this decision, saying, as I have above mentioned, \"Rebuking with moderation those that think differently, lest at any time God give them repentance.\"[fn-63-P6388_2445986:38-nf] For if we should say that such a perseverance, so laudable and so blessed, is man's in such wise as that he has it not from God, we first of all make void that which the Lord says to Peter: \"I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.\"[fn-63-P6389_2446246:39-nf] For what did He ask for him, but perseverance to the end? And assuredly, if a man could have this from man, it should not have been asked from God. Then when the apostle says, \"Now we pray to God that ye do no evil,\"[fn-63-P6390_2446483:40-nf] beyond a doubt he prays to God on their behalf for perseverance. For certainly he does not \"do no evil\" who forsakes good, and, not persevering in good, turns to the evil, from which he ought to turn aside.[fn-63-P6391_2446711:41-nf] In that place, moreover, where he says, \"I thank my God in every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making quest with joy for your fellowship[fn-63-P6392_2447232:42-nf] in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-63-P6393_2447438:43-nf] -what else does he promise to them from the mercy of God than perseverance in good to the end? And again where he says, \"Epaphras saluteth you, who is one of you, a servant ofChrist Jesus, always striving for you in prayer, that you may stand perfect and fulfilled in all the will of God,\"[fn-63-P6394_2447753:44-nf] -what is \"that you may stand\" but \"that you may persevere\"?

And when we pray that he who stands may stand, we do not pray for anything else than that he may persevere. Jude the apostle, again, when he says, \"Now unto Him that is able to keep you without offence, and to establish you before the presence of His glory, immaculate in joy,\"[fn-63-P6396_2448294:46-nf] does he not most manifestly show that perseverance in good unto the end is God's gift? For what but a good perseverance does He give who preserves without offence that He may place before the presence of His glory immaculate in joy? What is it, moreover, that we read in the Acts of the Apostles: \"And when the Gentiles heard, they rejoiced and received the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed\"?[fn-63-P6397_2448741:47-nf] Who could be ordained to eternal life save by the gift of perseverance? And when we read, \"He that shall persevere unto the end shall be saved;\"[fn-63-P6398_2448906:48-nf] with what salvation but eternal? And when, in the Lord's Prayer, we say to God the Father, \"Hallowed be Thy name,\"[fn-63-P6399_2449039:49-nf] what do we ask but that His name may be hallowed in us? And as this is already accomplished by means of the laver of regeneration, why is it daily asked by believers, except that we may persevere in that which is already done in us? For the blessed Cyprian also understands this in this manner, inasmuch as, in his exposition of the same prayer, he says: \"We say, 'Hallowed be Thy name,' not that we wish for God that He may be hallowed by our prayers, but that we ask of God that His name may be hallowed in us. But by whom is God hallowed; since He Himself hallows? Well, because He said, 'Be ye holy, since I also am holy;'[fn-64-P6400_2449684:50-nf] we ask and entreat that we who have been hallowed in baptism may persevere in that which we have begun to be.\"[fn-64-P6401_2449838:51-nf] Behold the most glorious martyr is of this opinion, that what in these words Christ's faithful people are daily asking is, that they may persevere in that which they have begun to be.

For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\"[fn-110-P11093_3149485:95-nf] And therefore he afterward says: \"Who shall separate us from the love of God? Shall tribulation, or distress, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is written: For Thy sake we are killed all the day long; we have been counted as sheep for the slaughter, ) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through Him who loved us. For we are persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor power, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"[fn-110-P11094_3150053:96-nf] But further, in recounting his own sufferings to the Corinthians, he certainly decided that suffering must be borne: \"In labours, (he says, ) more abundant, in prisons very frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes, save one; thrice was I beaten with rods; once was I stoned,\"[fn-110-P11095_3150381:97-nf] and the rest. And if these severities will seem to be more grievous than martyrdoms, yet once more he says: \"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake.\"[fn-110-P11096_3150634:98-nf] He also says, in verses occurring in a previous part of the epistle: \"Our condition is such, that we are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; and are in need, but not in utter want; since we are harassed by persecutions, but not forsaken; it is such that we are east down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in our body the dying of Christ.\"[fn-110-P11097_3151009:99-nf] \"But though,\" says he, \"our outward man perisheth\"-the flesh doubtless, by the violence of persecutions-\"yet the inward man is renewed day by day\"-the soul, doubtless, by hope in the promises. \"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal\"-he is speaking of troubles; \"but the things which are not seen are eternal\"-he is promising rewards. But writing in bonds to the Thessalonians,[fn-110-P11098_3151615:100-nf] he certainly affirmed that they were blessed, since to them it had been given not only to believe on Christ, but also to suffer for His sake. \"Having,\" says he, \"the same conflier which ye both saw in me, and now hear to be in me.\"[fn-110-P11099_3151899:101-nf] \"For though I are offered upon the sacrifice, I joy and rejoice with you all; in like manner do ye also joy and rejoice with me.\" You see what he decides the bliss of martyrdom to be, in honour of which he is providing a festival of mutual joy. When at length he had come to be very near the attainment of his desire, greatly rejoicing in what he saw before him, he writes in these terms to Timothy: \"For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; there is laid up for me the crown which the Lord will give me on that day\"[fn-111-P11100_3152549:102-nf] -doubtless of his suffering. Admonition enough did he for his part also give in preceding passages: \"It is a faithful saying: For if we are dead with Christ, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us; if we believe not, yet He is faithful: He cannot deny Himself.\"[fn-111-P11101_3152903:103-nf] \"Be not thou, therefore, ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; \"[fn-111-P11102_3153013:104-nf] for he had said before: \"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.\"[fn-111-P11103_3153153:105-nf] For we suffer with power from love toward God, and with a sound mind, when we suffer for our blamelessness. But further, if He anywhere enjoins endurance, for what more than for sufferings is He providing it? If anywhere He tears men away from idolatry, what more than martyrdoms takes the lead, in tearing them away to its injury?","title":"Scorpiace.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_128_tractate_cxxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5. But first the Lord asks what He knew, and that not once, but a second and a third time, whether Peter loved Him; and just as often He has the same answer, that He is loved, while just as often He gives Peter the same charge to feed His sheep. To the threefold denial there is now appended a threefold confession, that his tongue may not yield a feebler service to love than to fear, and imminent death may not appear to have elicited more from the lips than present life. Let it be the office of love to feed the Lord's flock, if it was the signal of fear to deny the Shepherd. Those who have this purpose in feeding the flock of Christ, that they may have them as their own, and not as Christ's, are convicted of loving themselves, and not Christ, from the desire either of boasting, or wielding power, or acquiring gain, and not from the love of obeying, serving, and pleasing God. Against such, therefore, there stands as a wakeful sentinel this thrice inculcated utterance of Christ, of whom the apostle complains that they seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ's.[fn-38-P3881_2138354:4-nf] For what else mean the words, \"Lovest thou me? Feed my sheep,\" than if it were said, If thou lovest me, think not of feeding thyself, but feed my sheep as mine, and not as thine own; seek my glory in them, and not thine own; my dominion, and not thine; my gain, and not thine; lest thou be found in the fellowship of those who belong to the perilous times, lovers of their own selves, and all else that is joined on to this beginning of evils? For the apostle, after saying, \"For men shall be lovers of their own selves,\" proceeded to add, \"Lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, wicked, irreligious, without affection, false accusers, incontinent, implacable, without kindness, traitors, heady, blinded;[fn-38-P3882_2139121:5-nf] lovers of pleasures more than of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.\"[fn-38-P3883_2139231:6-nf] All these evils flow from that as their fountain which he stated first, \"lovers of their own selves.\" With great propriety, therefore, is Peter addressed, \"Lovest thou me?\" and found replying, \"I love Thee:\" and the command applied to him, \"Feed my lambs,\" and this a second and a third time We have it also demonstrated here that love and liking are one and the same thing; for the Lord also in the last question said not Diligis me? but, Amas me? Let us, then, love not ourselves, but Him; and in feeding His sheep, let us be seeking the things which are His, not the things which are our own. For in some inexplicable way, I know not what, every one that loveth himself, and not God, loveth not himself; and whoever loveth God, and not himself, he it is that loveth himself. For he that cannot live by himself will certainly die by loving himself; he therefore loveth not himself who loves himself to his own loss of life. But when He is loved by whom life is preserved, a man by not loving himself only loveth the more, when it is for this reason that he loveth not himself [namely] that he may love Him by whom he lives. Let not those, then, who feed Christ's sheep be \"lovers of their own selves,\" test they feed them as if they were their own, and not His, and wish to make their own gain of them, as \"lovers of money;\" or to domineer over them, as \"boastful;\" or to glory in the honors which they receive at their hands, as \"proud;\" or to go the length even of originating heresies, as \"blasphemers;\" and not to give place to the holy fathers, as those who are \"disobedient to parents;\" and to render evil for good to those who wish to correct them, because unwilling to let them perish, as \"unthankful;\" to slay their own souls and those of others, as \"wicked;\" to outrage the motherly bowels of the Church, as \"irreligious;\" to have no sympathy with the weak, as those who are \"without affection;\" to attempt to traduce the character of the saints, as \"false accusers;\" to give loose reins to the basest lusts, as \"incontinent;\" to make lawsuits their practice, as \"implacable;\" to know nothing of loving service, as those who are \"without kindness;\" to make known to the enemies of the godly what they are well aware ought to be kept secret, as \"traitors;\" to disturb human modesty by shameless discussions, as \"heady;\" to understand neither what they say nor whereof they affirm,[fn-38-P3884_2141643:7-nf] as \"blinded;\" and to prefer carnal delights to spiritual joys, as those who are \"lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.\" For these and such like vices, whether all of them meet in a single individual, or whether some dominate in one and others in another, spring up in some form or another from this one root, when men are \"lovers of their own selves.\" A vice which is specially to be guarded against by those who feed Christ's sheep, lest they be seeking their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ's, and be turning those to the use of their own lusts for whom the blood of Christ was shed. Whose love ought, in one who feedeth His sheep, to grow up unto so great a spiritual fervor as to overcome even the natural fear of death, that makes us unwilling to die even when we wish to live with Christ. For the Apostle Paul also says that he had a desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ,[fn-38-P3885_2142563:8-nf] and yet he groans, being burdened, and wishes not to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality may be swallowed up of life.[fn-38-P3886_2142708:9-nf] And so to His present lover the Lord said, \"When thou shall be old, thou shall stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. For this He said to him, signifying by what death he should glorify God.\" \"Thou shall stretch forth thy hands,\" He said; in other words, thou shall be crucified. But that thou mayest come to this, \"another shall gird thee, and carry thee,\" not whither thou wouldest, but \"whither thou wouldest not.\" He told him first what would happen, and then how it should come to pass. For it was not after being crucified, but when actually about to be crucified, that he was carried whither he would not; for after being crucified he went his way, not whither he would not, but rather whither he would. And though when set free from the body he wished to be with Christ, yet, were it only possible, he had a desire for eternal life apart from the grievousness of death, to which grievous experience he was unwillingly carried, but from it [when all was over] he was willingly carried away; unwillingly he came to it, but willingly he conquered it, and left this feeling of infirmity behind that makes every one unwilling to die,-a feeling so permanently natural, that even old age itself was unable to set the blessed Peter free from its influence, even as it was said unto him, \"When thou shalt be old,\" thou shall be led \"whither thou wouldest not.\" For our consolation the Saviour Himself transfigured also the same feeling in His own person when He said, \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;\"[fn-38-P3887_2144306:10-nf] and He certainly had come to die without having any necessity, but only the willingness to die, with power to lay down His life, and with power to take it again. But however great be the grievousness of death, it ought to be overcome by the power of that love which is felt to Him who, being our life, was willing to endure even death in our behalf. For if there were no grievousness, even of the smallest kind, in death, the glory of the martyrs would not be so great. But if the good Shepherd, who laid down His own life for His sheep,[fn-38-P3888_2144865:11-nf] has raised up so many martyrs for Himself out of the very sheep, how much more ought those to contend to death for the truth, and even to blood against sin, who are entrusted by Him with the feeding, that is, with the teaching and governing of these very sheep? And on this account, along with the preceding example of His own passion, who can fail to see that the shepherds ought all the more to set themselves closely to imitate the Shepherd, if He was so imitated even by many of the sheep under whom, as the one Shepherd and in the one flock, the shepherds themselves are likewise sheep? For He made all those His sheep for [all of] whom He died, because He Himself also became a sheep that He might suffer for all.","title":"Tractate CXXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_45_book_i_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"ANF-04","text":"5. But let us see whether we can find in holy Scripture any indications properly applicable to these heavenly existences. The following is the statement of the Apostle Paul: \"The creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of Him who subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.\"[fn-64-P6434_1222094:124-nf] To what vanity, pray, was the creature made subject, or what creature is referred to, or how is it said \"not willingly,\" or \"in hope of what? \"And in what way is the creature itself to be delivered from the bondage of corruption? Elsewhere, also, the same apostle says: \"For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.\"[fn-64-P6435_1222482:125-nf] And again in another passage, \"And not only we, but the creation itself groaneth together, and is in pain until now.\"[fn-64-P6436_1222622:126-nf] And hence we have to inquire what are the groanings, and what are the pains. Let us see then, in the first place, what is the vanity to which the creature is subject. I apprehend that it is nothing else than the body; for although the body of the stars is ethereal, it is nevertheless material. Whence also Solomon appears to characterize the whole of corporeal nature as a kind of burden which enfeebles the vigour of the soul in the following language: \"Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity. I have looked, and seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity.\"[fn-64-P6437_1223259:127-nf] To this vanity, then, is the creature subject, that creature especially which, being assuredly the greatest in this world, holds also a distinguished principality of labour, i.e., the sun, and moon, and stars, are said to be subject to vanity, because they are clothed with bodies, and set apart to the office of giving light to the human race. \"And this creature,\" he remarks, \"was subjected to vanity not willingly.\" For it did not undertake a voluntary service to vanity, but because it was the will of Him who made it subject, and because of the promise of the Subjector to those who were reduced to this unwilling obedience, that when the ministry of their great work was performed, they were to be freed from this bondage of corruption and vanity when the time of the glorious redemption of God's children should have arrived. And the whole of creation, receiving this hope, and looking for the fulfilment of this promise now, in the meantime, as having an affection for those whom it serves, groans along with them, and patiently suffers with them, hoping for the fulfilment of the promises. See also whether the following words of Paul can apply to those who, although not willingly, yet in accordance with the will of Him who subjected them, and in hope of the promises, were made subject to vanity, when he says, \"For I could wish to be dissolved,\" or \"to return and be with Christ, which is far better.\"[fn-64-P6438_1224699:128-nf] For I think that the sun might say in like manner, \"I would desire to be dissolved,\" or \"to return and be with Christ, which is far better.\" Paul indeed adds, \"Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more needful for you; \"while the sun may say, \"To abide in this bright and heavenly body is more necessary, on account of the manifestation of the sons of God.\" The same views are to be believed and expressed regarding the moon and stars.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_129_tractate_cxxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3.

Nay, rather, does there not arise a wider and more difficult one, why Jesus bestowed on the disciple, whom He loved beyond the others to such an extent that he was counted worthy to recline on His breast, the gift of a protracted sleep in the body, when He delivered the blessed Peter, by the eminent glory of martyrdom, from the burden of the body itself, and vouchsafed to him what the Apostle Paul said that he desired, and committed to writing, namely, \"to be let loose, and to be with Christ\"?[fn-39-P3903_2152030:7-nf] But if, what is rather to be believed, Saint John declared that the Lord said not, \"He dieth not,\" for the very purpose that no such meaning might be attached to the words which He used; and his body lieth in its sepulchre lifeless like those of others deceased; it remains, if that really takes place which report has spread abroad regarding the soil, which grows up anew, though continually carried away, that it is either so done for the purpose of commending the preciousness of his death, seeing it wants the commendation of martyrdom (for he suffered not death at a persecutor's hand for the faith of Christ), or on some other account that is concealed from our knowledge.

He will perceive also the reason of the purgation from leprosy, and what the different kinds of leprosy are, and the reason of the purgation of those who lose their seed. He will come to know, moreover, what are the good influences,[fn-67-P6750_1410809:198-nf] and their greatness, and their qualities; and those too which are of a contrary kind, and what the affection of the former, and what the strife-causing emulation of the latter is towards men. He will behold also the nature of the soul, and the diversity of animals (whether of those which live in the water, or of birds, or of wild beasts), and why each of the genera is subdivided into so many species; and what intention of the Creator, or what purpose of His wisdom, is concealed in each individual thing. He will become acquainted, too, with the reason why certain properties are found associated with certain roots or herbs, and why, on the other hand, evil effects are averted by other herbs and roots. He will know, moreover, the nature of the apostate angels, and the reason why they have power to flatter in some things those who do not despise them with the whole power of faith, and why they exist for the purpose of deceiving and leading men astray. He will learn, too, the judgment of Divine Providence on each individual thing; and that, of those events which happen to men, none occur by accident or chance, but in accordance with a plan so carefully considered, and so stupendous, that it does not overlook even the number of the hairs of the heads, not merely of the saints, but perhaps of all human beings, and the plan of which providential government extends even to caring for the sale of two sparrows for a denarius, whether sparrows there be understood figuratively or literally. Now indeed this providential government is still a subject of investigation, but then it will be fully manifested. From all which we are to suppose, that meanwhile not a little time may pass by until the reason of those things only which are upon the earth be pointed out to the worthy and deserving after their departure from life, that by the knowledge of all these things, and by the grace of full knowledge, they may enjoy an unspeakable joy. Then, if that atmosphere which is between heaven and earth is not devoid of inhabitants, and those of a rational kind, as the apostle says, \"Wherein in times past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-67-P6751_1413098:199-nf] And again he says, \"We shall be caught up in the clouds to meet Christ in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.\"[fn-67-P6752_1413337:200-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_43_the_first_book_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But why do we not in opposition to this, rather hear the words, \"Who hath first given to Him and it shall be recompensed to him again? since of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things \"[fn-66-P6678_2542607:12-nf] And from whom, then, is that very beginning of our faith if not from Him?

This then is the third cause of affliction; and the fourth is, that the saints might not be supposed to serve God from a hope of present prosperity. For many of those who live in debauchery, when blamed as they often are by many, and invited to the labours of virtue; and when they hear the saints commended for their cheerfulness under great hardships,[fn-16-P1602_1279060:36-nf] attack their character on this ground; and not men only, but the devil himself hath taken up this suspicion. For when Job was surrounded with great wealth, and enjoyed much opulence, that wicked demon,[fn-16-P1603_1279349:37-nf] being reproached by God on his account, and having nothing to say; when he could neither answer the accusations against himself, nor impugn the virtue of this just man; took refuge at once in this defence, speaking thus, \"Doth Job fear thee for nought? Hast thou not made an hedge about him on all sides.\"[fn-16-P1604_1279875:38-nf] \"For reward then,\" saith he, \"that man is virtuous, enjoying thereby so much opulence.\" What then did God? Being desirous to show, that it was not for reward that his saints serve Him, He stripped him of all his opulence; gave him over to poverty; and permitted him to fall into grievous disease. Afterwards reproving him,[fn-16-P1605_1280235:39-nf] that he had suspected thus without cause, He saith, \"He let holdeth fast his integrity; to no purpose didst thou move me to destroy his substance.\" For it is a sufficient reward, and compensation to the saints, that they are serving God; since this indeed to the lover is reward enough, to love the object of his love;[fn-16-P1606_1280623:40-nf] and he seeks nothing besides, nor accounts anything greater than this. And if such be the case with regard to a man, much more in relation to God; which therefore that God might demonstrate, He gave more than the devil asked; for the latter said, \"Put forth thine hand, and touch him;\"[fn-16-P1607_1281102:41-nf] but God said not thus, but, \"I deliver him unto thee.\" For just as in the contests[fn-16-P1608_1281206:42-nf] of the outer world, the combatants that are vigorous, and in high condition of body,[fn-16-P1609_1281508:43-nf] are not so well discerned, when they are enwrapt all around with the garment soaked in oil; but when casting this aside, they are brought forward unclothed into the arena; then above all they strike the spectators on every side with astonishment at the proportion of their limbs, there being no longer anything to conceal them; so also was it with Job. When he was enveloped in all that wealth, it was not visible to the many, what a man he was. But when, like the wrestler, that strips off his garment, he threw it aside, and came naked to the conflicts of piety, thus unclothed, he astonished all who saw him;[fn-16-P1610_1282141:44-nf] so that the very theatre of angels shouted at beholding his fortitude of soul, and applauded him as he won his crown! For, as I have already observed, he was not so well seen of men, when clad in all that wealth, as when, casting it away like a garment, he exhibited himself naked as it were in a theatre, in the midst of the world, and all admired his vigor of soul, evidenced as this was not only by his being stripped of all things, but by the conflict, and by his patience in respect of his infirmity. And as I said before, God Himself did not smite him; in order that the devil might not again say, \"Thou hast spared him, and hast not inflicted so great a trial as was necessary:\" but he gave to the adversary the destruction of his cattle, and power over his flesh. \"I am sure,\" saith He, \"of this wrestler; therefore I do not forbid thee to impose on him whatever struggles thou desirest.\" But as those who are well skilled in the sports of the palaestra, and have reason to rely on their art and bodily strength, often do not seize their antagonists upright, nor take an equal advantage, but suffer them to take them by the middle,[fn-16-P1611_1283421:45-nf] that they may make a more splendid conquest; so also God gave to the devil to take this saint by the waist, that when he had overcome, after an attack so greatly to his disadvantage, and stretched his adversary on the ground, his crown might be so much the more glorious!","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_56_of_patience_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Not even that species of impatience under the loss of our dear ones is excused, where some assertion of a right to grief acts the patron to it.

They announced Christ, indeed, according to the truth whereby we believe in Christ, but not in the spirit in which He was announced by the good evangelists to the sons of the dove. \"For Paul,\" he says, \"in his epistle was not speaking of heretics, or of their baptism, so that it could be shown that he had laid down anything concerning this matter. He was speaking of brethren, whether as walking disorderly and contrary to the discipline of the Church, or as keeping the discipline of the Church in the fear of God. And he declared that some of them spoke the word of God steadfastly and fearlessly, but that some were acting in envy and strife; that some had kept themselves encompassed with kindly Christian love, but that others entertained malice and strife: but yet that he patiently endured all things, with the view that, whether in truth or in pretence, the name of Christ, which Paul preached, might come to the knowledge of the greatest number, and that the sowing of the word, which was as yet a new and unaccustomed work, might spread more widely by the preaching of those that spoke. Furthermore, it is one thing for those who are within the Church to speak in the name of Christ, another thing for those who are without, acting against the Church, to baptize in the name of Christ.\"[fn-34-P3473_1972209:38-nf] These words of Cyprian seem to warn us that we must distinguish between those who are bad outside, and those who are bad within the Church. And those whom he says that the apostle represents as preaching the gospel impurely and of envy, he says truly were within. This much, however, I think I may say without rashness, if no one outside can have anything which is of Christ, neither can any one within have anything which is of the devil. For if that closed garden can contain the thorns of the devil, why cannot the fountain of Christ equally flow beyond the garden's bounds? But if it cannot contain them, whence, even in the time of the Apostle Paul himself, did there arise amongst those who were within so great an evil of envy and malicious strife? For these are the words of Cyprian. Can it be that envy and malicious strife are a small evil? How then were those in unity who were not at peace? For it is not my voice, nor that of any man, but of the Lord Himself; nor did the sound go forth from men, but from angels, at the birth of Christ, \"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will.\"[fn-34-P3474_1973358:39-nf] And this certainly would not have been proclaimed by the voice of angels when Christ was born upon the earth, unless God wished this to be understood, that those are in the unity of the body of Christ who are united in the peace of Christ, and those are in the peace of Christ who are of good will. Furthermore, as good will is shown in kindliness, so is bad will shown in malice.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_55_book_iv_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"13.

For if charity is God, God is capable neither of proficiency nor of deficiency: that charity is said to be making proficiency in thee, means only that thou makest proficiency in it. Ask therefore what proficiency thou hast made in charity, and what thine heart will answer thee, that thou mayest know the measure of thy profiting. For he has promised to show us in what we may know Him, and hath said, \"In this is love made perfectin us.\" Ask, in what? \"That we have boldness in the day of judgment.\" Whoso hath boldness in the day of judgment, in that man is charity made perfect. What is it to have boldness in the day of judgment? Not to fear lest the day of judgment should come. There are men who do not believe in a day of judgment; these cannot have boldness in a day which they do not believe will come. Let us pass these: may God awaken them, that they may live; why speak we of the dead? They do not believe that there will be a day of judgment; they neither fear nordesire what they do not believe. Some man has begun to believe in a day of judgment: if he has begun to believe, he has also begun to fear. But because he fears as yet, because he hath not yet boldness in the day of judgment, not yet is charity in that man made perfect. But for all that, is one to despair? In whom thou seest the beginning, why despairest thou of the end? What beginning do I see? (sayest thou.) That very fear. Hear the Scripture: \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\"[fn-45-P4563_2462586:5-nf] Well then, he has begun to fear the day of judgment: by fearing let him correct himself, let him watch against his enemies, i.e. his sins; let him begin to come to life again inwardly, and to mortify his members which are upon the earth, as the apostle saith, \"Mortify your members which are upon the earth.\"[fn-45-P4564_2462918:6-nf] By the members upon earth he means spiritual wickedness:[fn-45-P4565_2462991:7-nf] for he goes on to expound it, \"Covetousness, uncleanness,\"[fn-45-P4566_2463076:8-nf] and the rest which he there follows out. Now in proportion as this man who has begun to fear the day of judgment, mortifies his members which are upon the earth, in that proportion the heavenly members rise up and are strengthened. But the heavenly members are all good works. As the heavenly members rise up, he begins to desire that which once he feared. Once he feared lest Christ should come and find in him the impious whom He must condemn; now he longs for Him to come, because He shall find the pious man whom He may crown. Having now begun to desire Christ's coming, the chaste soul which desires the embrace of the Bridegroom renounces the adulterer, becomes a virgin within by faith, hope, and charity. Now hath the man boldness in the day of judgment: he fights not against himself when he prays, \"Thy kingdom come.\"[fn-45-P4567_2463920:9-nf] For he that fears test the kingdom of God should come, fears lest his prayer be heard. How can he be said to pray, who fears lest his prayer be heard? But he that prays with boldness of charity, wishes now that He may come. Of this same desire said one in the Psalm, \"And thou, Lord, how long? Turn, Lord, and deliver my soul.\"[fn-45-P4568_2464266:10-nf] He groaned at being so put off. For there are men who with patience submit to die; but there are some perfect who with patience endure to live. What do I mean? When a person still desires this life, that person, when the day of death comes, patiently endures death: he struggles against himself that he may follow the will of God, and in his mind desires that which God chooseth, not what man's will chooseth: from desire of the present life there comes a reluctance against death, but yet he takes to him patience and fortitude, that he may with an even mind meet death; he dies patiently. But when a man desires, as the apostle saith, \"to be dissolved and to be with Christ,\"[fn-45-P4569_2464963:11-nf] that person, not patiently dies, but patiently lives, delightedly dies. See the apostle patiently living, i.e. how with patience he here, not loves life, but endures it. \"To be dissolved,\" saith be, \"and to be with Christ, is far better: but to continue in the flesh is necessary for your sakes.\" Therefore, brethren, do your endeavor, settle it inwardly with yourselves to make this your concern, that ye may desire the day of judgment.

What need is there of further disputation here, seeing that we have already handled with the utmost care that very epistle to Jubaianus of which he has made mention? And as to what he has said here, let us not forget that it might be said of all unrighteous men who, as he himself bears witness, are in the Catholic Church, and whose power of possessing and of conferring baptism is not questioned by any of us. For they come to the Church, who pass to Christ from the party of the devil, and build upon the rock, and are incorporated with the Dove, and are placed in security in the garden enclosed and fountain sealed; where none of those are found who live contrary to the precepts of Christ, wherever they may seem to be. For in the epistle which he wrote to Magnus, while discussing this very question, he himself warned us at sufficient length, and in no ambiguous terms, of what kind of society we should understand that the Church consists. For he says, in speaking of a certain man, \"Let him become an alien and profane, an enemy to the peace and unity of the Lord, not dwelling in the house of God, that is to say, in the Church of Christ, in which none dwell save those who are of one heart and of one mind.\"[fn-45-P4528_2272304:136-nf] Let those, therefore, who would lay injunctions on us on the authority of Cyprian, pay attention for a time to what we here say.

It is indeed worth while to consider the whole of the passage in the aforesaid letter to Magnus, which he has put together as follows: \"Not dwelling,\" he says, \"in the house of God-that is to say, in the Church of Christ-in which none dwell save those that are of one heart and of one mind, as the Holy Spirit says in the Psalms, speaking of. `God that, maketh men to be of one mind an house.'[fn-45-P4533_2273858:138-nf] Finally, the very sacrifices of the Lord declare that Christians are united among themselves by a firm and inseparable love for one another. For when the Lord calls bread, which is compacted together by the union of many grains, His body,[fn-45-P4534_2274140:139-nf] He is signifying one people, whom He bore, compacted into one body; and when He calls wine, which is pressed out from a multitude of branches and clusters and brought together into one, His blood,[fn-45-P4535_2274357:140-nf] He also signifies one flock joined together by the mingling of a multitude united into one.\" These words of the blessed Cyprian show that he both understood and loved the glory of the house of God, which house he asserted to consist of those who are of one heart and of one mind, proving it by the testimony of the prophets and the meaning of the sacraments, and in which house certainly were not found those envious persons, those malevolent without charity, who nevertheless used to baptize. From whence it is clear that the sacrament of Christ can both be in and be administered by those who are not in the Church of Christ, in which Cyprian himself bears witness that there are none dwelling save those who are of one heart and of one mind. Nor can it indeed be said that they are allowed to baptize so long as they are undetected, seeing that the Apostle Paul did not fail to detect those of whose ministry he bears unquestionable testimony in his epistle, saying that he rejoices that they also were proclaiming Christ.

Let us, if you please, trace this a little further back. \"Some,\" he says, \"preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will, some of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel. But some indeed preach Christ even of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds.

Certainty a short time ago you appeared to be urging the praises of charity as against us, according to the witness of the apostle, that where there is no charity, whatever there is is of no avail; and yet you see that in those there is no charity, and there was with them the preaching of Christ, of which the apostle says here that he rejoices. For it is not that he rejoices in what is evil in them, but in what is good in the name of Jesus Christ. In him assuredly there was the charity which \"rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.\"[fn-52-P5282_2550643:226-nf] The envy, moreover, which was in them is an evil proceeding from the devil, for by this he has both killed and cast down. Where then were these wicked men whom the apostle thus condemns, and in whom there was so much that was good to cause him to rejoice? Were they within, or without? Choose which you will. If they were within, then Paul knew them, and yet they did not pollute him. And so you would not be polluted in the unity of the whole world by those of whom you make certain charges, whether these be true, or falsehoods invented by yourselves. Wherefore do you separate yourself? Why do you destroy yourself by the criminal sacrilege of schism? But if they were without, then you see that even in those who were without, and who certainly cannot belong to everlasting life, since they have not charity, and do not abide in unity, there is yet found the holiness of the name of Christ, so that the apostle joyfully confirms their teaching, on account of the intrinsic holiness of the name, although he repudiates them. We are right, therefore, in not doing wrong to the actual name, when those come to us who were without; but we correct the individuals, while we do honor to the name.

Who when ministering support to the poor, or when receiving with benevolent kindness the crowds that come to him, can at the very moment when he is with anxious mind perplexed for the wants of his brethren, contemplate the vastness of the bliss on high, and while he is shaken by the troubles and cares of the present life look forward to the state of the world to come with an heart raised above the stains of earth? Whence the blessed David when laying down that this alone is good for man, longs to cling constantly to God, and says: \"It is good for me to cling to God, and to put my hope in the Lord.\"[fn-65-P6559_2341472:21-nf] And Ecclesiastes also declares that this cannot be done without fault by any of the saints, and says: \"For there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.\"[fn-65-P6560_2341684:22-nf] For who, even if he be the chief of all righteous and holy men, can we ever think could, while bound in the chains of this life, so acquire this chief good, as never to cease from divine contemplation, or be thought to be drawn away by earthly thoughts even for a short time from Him Who alone is good? Who ever takes no care for food, none for clothing or other carnal things, or when anxious about receiving the brethren, or change of place, or building his cell, has never desired the aid of man's assistance, nor when harassed by scarcity and want has incurred this sentence of reproof from the Lord: \"Be not anxious for your life what ye shall eat, nor for your body what ye shall put on\"?[fn-65-P6561_2342399:23-nf] Further we confidently assert that even the Apostle Paul himself who surpassed in the number of his sufferings the toils of all the saints, could not possibly fulfil this, as he himself testifies to the disciples in the Acts of the Apostles: \"Ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs, and to the needs of those who were with me,\" or when in writing in the Thessalonians he testifies that he \"worked in labour and weariness night and day.\"[fn-65-P6562_2342883:24-nf] And although for this there were great rewards for his merits prepared, yet his mind, however holy and sublime it might be, could not help being sometimes drawn away from that heavenly contemplation by its attention to earthly labours. Further, when he saw himsetf enriched with such practical fruits, and on theother hand considered in his heart the good of meditation, and weighed as it were in one scale the profit of all these labours and in the other the delights of divine contemplation, when for a long time he had corrected the balance in his breast, while the vast rewards for his labours delighted him on one side, and on the other the desire for unity with and the inseparable companionship of Christ inclined him to depart this life, at last in his perplexity he cries out and says: \"What I shall choose I know not. For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, for it were much better: but to abide in the flesh is more necessary for your sakes.\"[fn-65-P6563_2343915:25-nf] Though then in many ways he preferred this excellent good to all the fruits of his preaching, yet he submits himself in consideration of love, without which none can gain the Lord; and for their sakes, whom hitherto he had soothed with milk as nourishment from the breasts of the gospel, does not refuse to be parted from Christ, which is bad for himself though useful for others. For he is driven to choose this the rather by that excessive goodness of his whereby for the salvation of his brethren he is ready, were it possible, to incur even the last evil of an Anathema. \"For I could wish,\" he says, \"that I myself were Anathema from Christ for my brethren's sake, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites,\"[fn-65-P6564_2344669:26-nf] i.e., I could wish to be subject not only to temporal, but even to perpetual punishment, if only all men, were it possible, might enjoy the fellowship of Christ: for I am sure that the salvation of all would be better for Christ and for me than my own. That then the Apostle might perfectly gain this chief good, i.e., to enjoy the vision of God and to be joined continually to Christ, he was ready to be parted from this body, which as it is feeble and hindered by the many requirements of its frailties cannot help separating from union with Christ: for it is impossible for the mind, that is harassed by such frequent cares, and hampered by such various and tiresome troubles, always to enjoy the Divine vision. For what aim of the saints can be so persistent, what purpose can be so high that that crafty plotter does not sometimes destroy it? Who has frequented the recesses of the desert and shunned intercourse with all men in such a way that he never trips by unnecessary thoughts, and by looking on things or being occupied in earthly actions falls away from that contemplation of God, which truly alone is good? Who ever could preserve such fervour of spirit as not sometimes to pass by roving thoughts from his attention to prayer, and fall away suddenly from heavenly to earthly things? Which of us (to pass over other times of wandering) even at the very moment when heraises his soul in prayer to God on high, does not fall into a sort of stupor, and even against his will offend by that very thing from which he hoped for pardon of his sins? Who, I ask, is so alert and vigilant as never, while he is singing a Psalm to God, to allow his mind to wander from the meaning of Scripture? Who is so intimate with and closely joined to God, as to congratulate himself on having carried out for a single day that rule of the Apostle's, whereby he bids us pray without ceasing?[fn-65-P6565_2346575:27-nf] And though all these things may seem to some, who are involved in grosser sins, to be trivial and altogether foreign to sin, yet to those who know the value of perfection a quantity even of very small matters becomes most serious.","title":"XXIII.

But give heed to the fact that even the hirelings are needful. For many indeed in the Church are following after earthly profit, and yet preach Christ, and through them is heard the voice of Christ; and the sheep follow, not the hireling, but the Shepherd's voice speaking through the hireling. Hearken to the hirelings as pointed out by the Lord Himself: \"The scribes,\" He saith, \"and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: do what they say; but do not what they do.\"[fn-19-P1992_1234795:15-nf] What else said He but, Listen to the Shepherd's voice speaking through the hirelings? For sitting in Moses' seat, they teach the law of God; therefore God teacheth by them. But if they wish to teach their own things, hear them not, do them not. For certainly such seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's; but no hireling has dared to say to Christ's people, Seek your own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. For his own evil conduct he does not preach from the seat of Christ: he does injury by the evil that he does, not by the good that he says. Pluck the grapes, beware of the thorn. It is well I see that you have understood; but for the sake of those that are slower, I shall repeat these words with greater plainness. How said I, Pluck the bunch of grapes, beware of the thorn; when the Lord saith, \"Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles\"? That is quite true: and yet what I said is also true, Pluck the bunch of grapes, beware of the thorn. For sometimes the grape-cluster, springing from the root of the vine, finds its support in a common hedge; its branch, grows, becomes embedded among thorns, and the thorn bears other fruit than its own. For the thorn has not been produced from the vine, but has become the resting-place of its runner. Make thine inquiries only at the roots. Seek for the thorn-root, thou wilt find it apart from the vine: seek the origin of the grape, and from the root of the vine it will be found to have sprung. And so, Moses' seatwas the vine; the morals of the Pharisees werethe thorns. Sound doctrine cometh through the wicked, as the vine-branch in a hedge, a bunch of grapes among thorns. Gather care. fully, so as in seeking the fruit not to tear thine hand; and while thou art to hear one speaking what is good, imitate him not when doing what is evil. \"What they tell you, do,\"-gather the grapes; \"but what they do, do not,\"-beware of the thorns. Even through hirelings listen to the voice of the Shepherd, but be not hirelings yourselves, seeing ye are members of the Shepherd. Yea, Paul himself, the holy apostle who said, \"I have noone who hath a brother's concern about you; for all seek their own, not the things which l are Jesus Christ's,\" draws a distinction in another place between hirelings and sons; and see what he saith: \"Some preach Christ even of envy and strife, and some also of good will: some of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel; but some also preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds.\" These were hirelings who disliked the Apostle Paul. And why such dislike, but just because they were seeking after temporal things? But mark what he adds: \"What then, notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is preached: and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.\"[fn-19-P1993_1237671:16-nf] Christ is the truth: let the truth be preached in pretense by hirelings, let it be preached in truth by the children: the children are waiting patiently for the eternal inheritance of the Father, the hirelings are longing for, and in a hurry to get, the temporal pay of their employer.

Lord, Thou saidst to those whom Thou didst certainly wish to be faithful shepherds, and whom Thou didst form into Thine own members, \"If they persecute you flee.\" Doest Thou, then, injustice to them, when Thou blamest the hirelings who flee when they see the wolf coming!

He was speaking of brethren, whether as walking disorderly anti against the discipline of the Church, or as keeping the truth of the Gospel with the fear of God. And he said that certain of them spoke the word of God with constancy and courage, but some acted in envy and dissension; that some maintained towards him a benevolent love, but that some indulged a malevolent spirit of dissension; but yet that he bore all patiently, so long only as, whether in truth or in pretence, the name of Christ which Paul preached might come to the knowledge of many; and the sowing of the word, which as yet had been new and irregular, might increase through the preaching of the speakers. Besides, it is one thing for those who are within the Church to speak concerning the name of Christ; it is another for those who are without, and act in opposition to the Church, to baptize in the name of Christ.
