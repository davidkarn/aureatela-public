In these and like testimonies of the divine Scriptures, by free use of which, as I have said, our predecessors exploded such sophistries or errors of the heretics, the unity and equality of the Trinity are intimated to our faith. But because, on account of the incarnation of the Word of God for the working out of our salvation, that the man Christ Jesus might be the Mediator between God and men,[fn-2-P247_86430:50-nf] many things are so said in the sacred books as to signify, or even most expressly declare, the Father to be greater than the Son; men have erred through a want of careful examination or consideration of the whole tenor of the Scriptures, and have endeavored to transfer those things which are said of Jesus Christ according to the flesh, to that substance of His which was eternal before the incarnation, and is eternal. They say, for instance, that the Son is less than the Father, because it is written that the Lord Himself said, \"My Father is greater than I.\"[fn-2-P248_87013:51-nf] But the truth shows that after the same sense the Son is less also than Himself; for how was He not made less also than Himself, who \"emptied[fn-2-P249_87175:52-nf] Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant?\" For He did not so take the form of a servant as that He should lose the form of God, in which He was equal to the Father. If, then, the form of a servant was so taken that the form of God was not lost, since both in the form of a servant and in the form of God He Himself is the same only-begotten Son of God the Father, in the form of God equal to the Father, in the form of a servant the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; is there any one who cannot perceive that He Himself in the form of God is also greater than Himself, but yet likewise in the form of a servant less than Himself? And not, therefore, without cause the Scripture says both the one and the other, both that the Son is equal to the Father, and that the Father is greater than the Son. For there is no confusion when the former is understood as on account of the form of God, and the latter as on account of the form of a servant. And, in truth, this rule for clearing the question through all the sacred Scripturesis set forth in one chapter of an epistle of the Apostle Paul, where this distinction is commended to us plainly enough. For he says, \"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and was found in fashion[fn-2-P250_88580:53-nf] as a man.\"[fn-2-P251_88604:54-nf] The Son of God, then, is equal to God the Father in nature, but less in \"fashion.\"[fn-2-P252_88708:55-nf] For in the form of a servant which He took He is less than the Father; but in the form of God, in which also He was before He took the form of a servant, He is equal to the Father. In the form of God He is the Word, \"by whom all things are made;\"[fn-2-P253_88968:56-nf] but in the form of a servant He was \"made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.\"[fn-2-P254_89099:57-nf] In like manner, in the form of God He made man; in the form of a servant He was made man. For if the Father alone had made man without the Son, it would not have been written, \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.\"[fn-2-P255_89347:58-nf] Therefore, because the form of God took the form of a servant, both is God and both is man; but both God, on account of God who takes; and both man, on account of man whois taken. For neither by that taking is the one of them turned and changed into the other: the Divinity is not changed into the creature, so as to cease to be Divinity; nor the creature into Divinity, so as to cease to be creature.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"28. Yet unless the very same were the Son of man on account of the form of a servant which He took, who is the Son of God on account of the form of God in which He is; Paul the apostle would not say of the princes of this world, \"For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.\"[fn-3-P388_134737:164-nf] For He was crucified after the form of a servant, and yet \"the Lord of glory\" was crucified. For that \"taking\" was such as to make God man, and man God. Yet what is said on account of what, and what according to what, the thoughtful, diligent, and pious reader discerns for himself, the Lord being his helper. For instance, we have said that He glorifies His own, as being God, and certainly then as being the Lord of glory; and yet the Lord of glory was crucified, because even God is rightly said to have been crucified, not after the power of the divinity, but after the weakness of the flesh:[fn-3-P389_135355:165-nf] just as we say, that He judges as God, that is, by divine power, not by human; and yet the man Himself will judge, just as the Lord of glory was crucified: for soHe expressly says, \"When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, and before Him shall be gathered all nations;\"[fn-3-P390_135686:166-nf] and the rest that is foretold of the future judgment in that place even to the last sentence. And the Jews, inasmuch as they will be punished in that judgment for persisting in their wickedness, as it is elsewhere written, \"shall look upon Him whom they have pierced.\"[fn-3-P391_135981:167-nf] For whereas both good and bad shall see the Judge of the quick and dead, without doubt the bad will not be able to see Him, except after the form in which He is the Son of man; but yet in the glory wherein He will judge, not in the lowliness wherein He was judged. But the ungodly without doubt will not see that form of God in which He is equal to the Father. For they are not pure in heart; and \"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\"[fn-3-P392_136457:168-nf] And that sight is face to face,[fn-3-P393_136508:169-nf] the very sight that is promised as the highest reward to the just, and which will then take place when He \"shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father;\" and in this \"kingdom\" He means the sight of His own form also to be understood, the whole creature being made subject to God, including that wherein the Son of God was made the Son of man. Because, according to this creature, \"The Son also Himself shall be subject unto Him, that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.\"[fn-3-P394_137036:170-nf] Otherwise if the Son of God, judging in the form in which He is equal to the Father, shall appear when He judges to the ungodly also; what becomes of that which He promises, as some great thing, to him who loves Him, saying, \"And I will love him, and will manifest myself to him?\"[fn-3-P395_137342:171-nf] Wherefore He will judge as the Son of man, yet not by human power, but by that whereby He is the Son of God; and on the other hand, He will judge as the Son of God, yet not appearing in that [unincarnate] form in which He is God equal to the Father, but in that [incarnate form] in which He is the Son of man.[fn-3-P396_137673:172-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_10_the_chaplet_or_de_corona_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Much less may the Christian put the service of idolatry on his own head-nay, I might have said, upon Christ, since Christ is the Head of the Christian man-(for his head) is as free as even Christ is, under no obligation to wear a covering, not to say a band.

Do not be disturbed because the apostle allows none to be chosen as a widow under threescore years old, neither suppose that he intends to reject those who are still young.

If this be not his meaning, all who become widows under threescore years will have to take husbands.

When the needs of the Church at length brought me to Rome[fn-49-P4973_1366302:3548-nf] in company with the reverend pontiffs, Paulinus and Epiphanius-the first of whom ruled the church of the Syrian Antioch while the second presided over that of Salamis in Cyprus,-I in my modesty was for avoiding the eyes of highborn ladies, yet she pleaded so earnestly, \"both in season and out of season\"[fn-49-P4974_1366628:3549-nf] as the apostle says, that at last her perseverance overcame my reluctance.

But why do we delay any longer to stop their mouths by another most clear and most weighty proof, where not an angel in the singular nor men in the plural are spoken of, but simply angels; by whom not any particular word was wrought, but the Law itself is most distinctly declared to be given; which certainly none of the faithful doubts that God gave to Moses for the control of the children of Israel, or yet, that it was given by angels. So Stephen speaks: \"Ye stiff-necked,\" he says, \"and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: who have received the Law by the disposition of angels,[fn-7-P787_304747:79-nf] and have not kept it.\"[fn-7-P788_304797:80-nf] What is more evident than this? What more strong than such an authority? The Law, indeed, was given to that people by the disposition of angels; but the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ was by it prepared and pre-announced; and He Himself, as the Word of God, was in some wonderful and unspeakable manner in the angels, by whose disposition the Law itself was given. And hence He said in the Gospel, \"For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.\"[fn-7-P789_305294:81-nf] Therefore then the Lord was speaking by the angels; and the son of God, who was to be the Mediator of God and men, from the seed of Abraham, was preparing His own advent by the angels, that He might find some by whom He would be received, confessing themselves guilty, whom the Law unfulfilled had made transgressors. And hence the apostle also says to the Galatians, \"Wherefore then serveth the Law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made, which [seed] was ordered[fn-7-P790_305833:82-nf] through angels in the hand of a mediator;\"[fn-7-P791_305893:83-nf] that is, ordered through angels in His own hand. For He was not born in limitation, but in power. But you learn in another place that he does not mean any one of the angels as a mediator, but the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, in so far as He deigned to be made man: \"For there is one God,\" he says, \"and one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.\"[fn-7-P792_306270:84-nf] Hence that passover in the killing of the lamb:[fn-7-P793_306337:85-nf] hence all those things which are figuratively spoken in the Law, of Christ to come in the flesh, and to suffer, but also to rise again, which Law was given by the disposition of angels; in which angels, were certainly the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and in which, sometimes the Father, sometimes the Son, sometimes the Holy Spirit, and sometimes God, without any distinction of person, was figuratively signified by them, although appearing in visible and sensible forms, yet by His own creature, not by His substance, in order to the seeing of which, hearts are cleansed through all those things which are seen by the eyes and heard by the ears.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_12_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"ANF-04","text":"To us continence has been pointed out by the Lord of salvation as an instrument for attaining eternity,[fn-8-P802_193657:72-nf] and as a testimony of (our) faith; as a commendation of this flesh of ours, which is to be sustained for the \"garment of immortality,\"[fn-8-P803_193868:73-nf] which is one day to supervene; for enduring, in fine, the will of God.

And since we are showing how we can say the Father alone, because there is no Father in the Godhead except Himself, we must consider also the opinion which holds that the only true God is not the Father alone, but the leather and the Son and the Holy Spirit. For if any one should ask whether the Father alone is God, how can it be replied that He is not, unless perhaps we were to say that the Father indeed is God, but that He is not God alone, but that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are God alone?

Are we therefore, from the testimony of the Lord, both to call the Father the one true God, and the Son the one true God, and the Holy Spirit the one true God, and the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit together, that is, the Trinity itself together, not three true Gods but one true God?

Is it because it follow's, that whenever we name One who cleaves to One by a harmony so great that through this harmony both are one, this harmony itself must be understood, although it is not mentioned? For in that place, too, the apostle seems as it were to pass over the Holy Spirit; and yet there, too, He is understood, where he says, \"All are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.\"[fn-11-P1153_476695:19-nf] And again, \"The head of the woman is the man, the head of the man is Christ, and the head of Christ is God.\"[fn-11-P1154_476829:20-nf] But again, if God is only all three together, how can God be the head of Christ, that is, the Trinity the head of Christ, since Christ is in the Trinity in order that it may be the Trinity? Is that which is the Father with the Son, the head of that which is the Son alone? For the Father with the Son is God, but the Son alone is Christ: especially since it is the Word already made flesh that speaks; and according to this His humiliation also, the Father is greater than He, as He says, \"for my Father is greater than I;\"[fn-11-P1155_477372:21-nf] so that the very being of God, which is one to Him with the Father, is itself the head of the man who is mediator, which He is alone.[fn-11-P1156_477525:22-nf] For if we rightly call the mind the chief thing of man, that is, as it were the head of the human substance, although the man himself together with the mind is man; why is not the Word with the Father, which together is God, much more suitably and much more the head of Christ, although Christ as man cannot be understood except with the Word which was made flesh? But this, as we have already said, we shall consider somewhat more carefully hereafter. At present the equality and one and the same substance of the Trinity has been demonstrated as briefly as possible, that in whatever way that other question be determined, the more rigorous discussion of which we have deferred, nothing may hinder us from confessing the absolute equality of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"33.

Again, after the deluge, when the human race started as it were anew, men and women were paired together and a fresh blessing was pronounced on procreation, [fn-61-P6161_1848172:23-nf] \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\" Moreover, free permission was given to eat flesh,[fn-61-P6162_1848293:24-nf] \"Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.\" He then flies off to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom the first had three wives, the second one, the third four, Leah, Rachel, Billah, and Zilpah, and he declares that Abraham by his faith merited the blessing which he received in begetting his son. Sarah, typifying the Church, when it had ceased to be with her after the manner of women, exchanged the curse of barrenness for the blessing of child-bearing. We are informed that Rebekah went like a prophet to inquire of the Lord, and was told,[fn-61-P6163_1848904:25-nf] \"Two nations and two peoples are in thy womb.\" that Jacob served for his wife, and that when Rachel, thinking it was in the power of her husband to give her children, said,[fn-61-P6164_1849096:26-nf] \"Give me children, or else I die,\" he replied,[fn-61-P6165_1849161:27-nf] \"Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?\" so well aware was he that the fruit of marriage cometh from the Lord and not from the husband. We next learn that Joseph, a holy man of spotless chastity, and all the patriarchs, had wives, and that God blessed them all alike through the lips of Moses. Judah also and Thamar are brought upon the scene, and he censures Onan, slain by the Lord, because he, grudging to raise up seed to his brother, marred the marriage rite. He refers to Moses and the leprosy of Miriam, who, because she chided her brother on account of his wife, was stricken by the avenging hand of God. He praises Samson, I may even say extravagantly panegyrizes the uxorious Nazarite. Deborah also and Barak are mentioned, because, although they had not the benefit of virginity, they were victorious over the iron chariots of Sisera and Jabin. He brings forward Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, and extols her for arming herself with the[fn-61-P6166_1850165:28-nf] stake. He says there was no difference between Jephthah and his virgin daughter, who was sacrificed to the Lord: nay, of the two, he prefers the faith of the father to that of the daughter who met death with grief and tears. He then comes to Samuel, another Nazarite of the Lord, who from infancy was brought up in the tabernacle and was clad in a linen ephod, or, as the words are rendered, in linen vestments: he, too, we are told, begot sons without a stain upon his priestly purity. He places Boaz and his wife Ruth side by side in his repository, and traces the descent of Jesse and David from them. He then points out how David himself, for the price of two hundred foreskins and at the peril of his life, was bedded with the king's daughter. What shall I say of Solomon, whom he includes in the list of husbands, and represents as a type of the Saviour, maintaining that of him it was written,[fn-61-P6167_1851098:29-nf] \"Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son\"? And[fn-61-P6168_1851202:30-nf] \"To him shall be given of the gold of Sheba, and men shall pray for him continually.\" Then all at once he makes a jump to Elijah and Elisha, and tells us as a great secret that the spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha. Why he mentioned this he does not say. It can hardly be that he thinks Elijah and Elisha, like the rest, were married men. The next step is to Hezekiah, upon whose praises he dwells, and yet (I wonder why) forgets to mention that he said,[fn-61-P6169_1851677:31-nf] \"Henceforth I will beget children.\" He relates that Josiah, a righteous man, in whose time the book of Deuteronomy was found in the temple, was instructed by Huldah, wife of Shallum. Daniel also and the three youths are classed by him with the married. Suddenly he betakes himself to the Gospel, and adduces Zachariah and Elizabeth, Peter and his father-in-law, and the rest of the Apostles. His inference is thus expressed: \"If they idly urge in defence of themselves the plea that the world in its early stage needed to be replenished, let them listen to the words of Paul,[fn-61-P6170_1852281:32-nf] `I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children.' And[fn-61-P6171_1852371:33-nf] `Marriage is honourable and the bed undefiled.' And[fn-61-P6172_1852463:34-nf] `A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.' And[fn-61-P6173_1852636:35-nf] `Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: but she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.' Surely we shall hear no more of the famous Apostolic utterance,[fn-61-P6174_1852925:36-nf] `And they who have wives as though they had them not.' It can hardly be that you will say the reason why he wished them to be married was that some widows had already turned back after Satan: as though virgins never fell and their fall was not more ruinous. All this makes it clear that in forbidding to marry, and to eat food which God created for use, you have consciences seared as with a hot iron, and are followers of the Manichaeans.\" Then comes much more which it would be unprofitable to discuss. At last he dashes into rhetoric and apostrophizes virginity thus: \"I do you no wrong, Virgin: you have chosen a life of chastity on account of the present distress: you determined on the course in order to be holy in body and spirit: be not proud: you and your married sisters are members of the same Church.\"","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"27.

We have concerning it this notion, that all things that exist in the creation are defined by means of their several names. Thus whenever a man speaks of \"heaven\" he directs the notion of the hearer to the created object indicated by this name, and he who mentions \"man\" or some animal, at once by the mention of the name impresses upon the hearer the form of the creature, and in the same way all other things, by means of the names imposed upon them, are depicted in the heart of him who by hearing receives the appellation imposed upon the thing. The uncreated Nature alone, which we acknowledge in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy Spirit, surpasses all significance of names. For this cause the Word, when He spoke of \"the name\" in delivering the Faith, did not add what it is,-for how could a name be found for that which is above every name? -but gave authority that whatever name our intelligence by pious effort be enabled to discover to indicate the transcendent Nature, that name should be applied alike to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, whether it be \"the Good\" or \"the Incorruptible,\" whatever name each may think proper to be employed to indicate the undefiled Nature of Godhead. And by this deliverance the Word seems to me to lay down for us this law, that we are to be persuaded that the Divine Essence is ineffable and incomprehensible: for it is plain that the title of Father does not present to us the Essence, but only indicates the relation to the Son. It follows, then, that if it were possible for human nature to be taught the essence of God, He \"Who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth[fn-9-P972_531585:19-nf] \" would not have suppressed the knowledge upon this matter But as it is, by saying nothing concerning the Divine Essence, He showed that the knowledge thereof is beyond our power, while when we have learnt that of which we are capable, we stand in no need of the knowledge beyond our capacity, as we have in the profession of faith in the doctrine delivered to us what suffices for our salvation. For to learn that He is the absolutely existent, together with Whom, by the relative force of the term, there is also declared the majesty of the Son, is the fullest teaching of godliness; the Son, as has been said, implying in close union with Himself the Spirit of Life and Truth, inasmuch as He is Himself Life and Truth.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"The mighty Paul, knowing that the Only-begotten God, Who has the pre-eminence in all things[fn-10-P1067_578878:86-nf] , is the author and cause of all good, bears witness to Him that not only was the creation of all existent things wrought by Him, but that when the original creation of man had decayed and vanished away[fn-10-P1068_579102:87-nf] , to use his own language, and another new creation was wrought in Christ, in this too no other than He took the lead, but He is Himself the first-born of all that new creation of men which is effected by the Gospel. And that our view about this may be made clearer let us thus divide our argument. The inspired apostle on four occasions employs this term, once as here, calling Him, \"first-born of all creation[fn-10-P1069_579579:88-nf] ,\" another time, \"the first-born among many brethren[fn-10-P1070_579649:89-nf] ,\" again, \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1071_579705:90-nf] ,\" and on another occasion he employs the term absolutely, without combining it with other words, saying, \"But when again He bringeth the first-born into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him[fn-10-P1072_579955:91-nf] .\" Accordingly whatever view we entertain concerning this title in the other combinations, the same we shall in consistency apply to the phrase \"first-born of all creation.\" For since the title is one and the same it must needs be that the meaning conveyed is also one. In what sense then does He become \"the first-born among many brethren?\" in what sense does He become \"the first-born from the dead?\" Assuredly this is plain, that because we are by birth flesh and blood, as the Scripture saith, \"He Who for our sakes was born among us and was partaker of flesh and blood[fn-10-P1073_580545:92-nf] ,\" purposing to change us from corruption to incorruption by the birth from above, the birth by water and the Spirit, Himself led the way in this birth, drawing down upon the water, by His own baptism, the Holy Spirit; so that in all things He became the first-born of those who are spiritually born again, and gave the name of brethren to those who partook in a birth like to His own by water and the Spirit. But since it was also meet that He should implant in our nature the power of rising again from the dead, He becomes the \"first-fruits of them that slept[fn-10-P1074_581130:93-nf] \" and the \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1075_581186:94-nf] ,\" in that He first by His own act loosed the pains of death[fn-10-P1076_581264:95-nf] , so that His new birth from the dead was made a way for us also, since the pains of death, wherein we were held, were loosed by the resurrection of the Lord. Thus, just as by having shared in the washing of regeneration[fn-10-P1077_581533:96-nf] He became \"the first-born among many brethren,\" and again by having made Himself the first-fruits of the resurrection, He obtains the name of the \"first-born from the dead,\" so having in all things the pre-eminence, after that \"all old things,\" as the apostle says, \"have passed away[fn-10-P1078_581877:97-nf] ,\" He becomes the first-born of the new creation of men in Christ by the two-fold regeneration, alike that by Holy Baptism and that which is the consequence of the resurrection from the dead, becoming for us in both alike the Prince of Life[fn-10-P1079_582141:98-nf] , the first-fruits, the first-born. This first-born, then, hath also brethren, concerning whom He speaks to Mary, saying, \"Go and tell My brethren, I go to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God[fn-10-P1080_582374:99-nf] .\" In these words He sums up the whole aim of His dispensation as Man.

For neither was it a paradise only physical for the advantage of the body, and not also spiritual for the advantage of the mind; nor was it only spiritual to afford enjoyment to man by his internal sensations, and not also physical to afford him enjoyment through his external senses. But obviously it was both for both ends. But after that proud and therefore envious angel (of whose fall I have said as much as I was able in the eleventh and twelfth books of this work, as well as that of his fellows, who, from being God's angels, became his angels), preferring to rule with a kind of pomp of empire rather than to be another's subject, fell from the spiritual Paradise, and essaying to insinuate his persuasive guile into the mind of man, whose unfallen condition provoked him to envy now that himself was fallen, he chose the serpent as his mouthpiece in that bodily Paradise in which it and all the other earthly animals were living with those two human beings, the man and his wife, subject to them, and harmless; and he chose the serpent because, being slippery, and moving in tortuous windings, it was suitable for his purpose. And this animal being subdued to his wicked ends by the presence and superior force of his angelic nature, he abused as his instrument, and first tried his deceit upon the woman, making his assault upon the weaker part of that human alliance, that he might gradually gain the whole, and not supposing ,that the man would readily give ear to him, or be deceived, but that he might yield to the error of the woman. For as Aaron was not induced to agree with the people when they blindly wished him to make an idol, and yet yielded to constraint; and as it is not credible that Solomon was so blind as to suppose that idols should be worshipped, but was drawn over to such sacrilege by the blandishments of women; so we cannot believe that Adam was deceived, and supposed the devil's word to be truth, and therefore transgressed God's law, but that he by the drawings of kindred yielded to the woman, the husband to the wife, the one human being to the only other human being. For not without significance did the apostle say, \"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression;\"[fn-24-P2427_1353149:89-nf] but he speaks thus, because the woman accepted as true what the serpent told her, but the man could not bear to be severed from his only companion, even though this involved a partnership in sin. He was not on this account less culpable, but sinned with his eyes open. And so the apostle does not say, \"He did not sin,\" but \"He was not deceived.\" For he shows that he sinned when he says, \"By one man sin entered into the world,\"[fn-24-P2428_1353599:90-nf] and immediately after more distinctly, \"In the likeness of Adam's transgression.\" But he meant that those are deceived who do not judge that which they do to be sin; but he knew. Otherwise how were it true \"Adam was not deceived?\"But having as yet no experience of the divine severity, he was possibly deceived in so far as he thought his sin venial.

On its being objected to him, from the fifth chapter of Coelestius' book, that\" they say that every individual has the ability to possess all powers and graces, thus taking away that `diversity of graces,' which the apostle teaches,\" Pelagius replied: \"We have certainly said so much; but yet they have laid against us a malignant and blundering charge. We do not take away the diversity of graces; but we declare that God gives to the person, who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all graces, even as He conferred them on the Apostle Paul.\" Hereupon the Synod said: \"You accordingly do yourself hold the doctrine of the Church touching the gift of the graces, which are collectively possessed by the apostle.\" Here some one may say, \"Why then is he anxious? Do you on your side deny that all the powers and graces were combined in the apostle?\" For my own part, indeed, if all those are to be understood which the apostle has himself mentioned together in one passage,-as, I suppose, the bishops understood Pelagius to mean when they approved of his answer, and pronounced it to be in keeping with the sense of the Church,-then I do not doubt that the apostle had them all; for he says: \"And God hath set some in the Church, first, apostles; secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers; after that miracles; then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.\"[fn-29-P2989_1160021:89-nf] What then? shall we say that the Apostle Paul did not possess all these gifts himself? Who would be bold enough to assert this? The very fact that he was an apostle showed, of course, that he possessed the grace of the apostolate. He possessed also that of prophecy; for was not that a prophecy of his in which lie says: \"In the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils?\"[fn-29-P2990_1160475:90-nf] He was, moreover, \"the teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity?[fn-29-P2991_1160562:91-nf] He performed miracles also and cures; for he shook off from his hand, unhurt, the biting viper;[fn-29-P2992_1160677:92-nf] and the cripple stood upright on his feet at the apostle's word, and his strength was at once restored.[fn-29-P2993_1160802:93-nf] It is not clear what he means by helps, for the term is of very wide application; but who can say that he was wanting even in this grace, when through his labours such helps were manifestly afforded towards the salvation of mankind? Then as to his possessing the grace of \"government,\" what could be more excellent than his administration, when the Lord at that time governed so many churches by his personal agency, and governs them still in our day through his epistles? And in respect of the \"diversities of tongues,\" what tongues could have been wanting to him, when he says himself: \"I thank my God that I speak with tongues more than you all?\"[fn-29-P2994_1161473:94-nf] It being thus inevitable to suppose that not one of these was wanting to the Apostle Paul, the judges approved of Pelagius' answer, wherein he said \"that all graces were conferred upon him.\" But there are other graces in addition to these which are not mentioned here. For it is not to be supposed, however greatly the Apostle Paul excelled others as a member of Christ's body, that the very Head itself of the entire body did not receive more and ampler graces still, whether in His flesh or His soul as man; for such a created nature did the Word of God assume as His own into the unity of His Person, that He might be our Head, and we His body. And in very deed, if all gifts could be in each member, it would be evident that the similitude, which is used to illustrate this subject, of the several members of our body is inapplicable; for some things are common to the members in general, such as life and health, whilst other things arepeculiar to the separate members, since the ear has no perception of colours, nor the eye of voices. Hence it is written: \"If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? if the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?\"[fn-29-P2995_1162667:95-nf] Now this of course is not said as if it were impossible for God to impart to the ear the sense of seeing, or to the eye the function of hearing. However, what He does in Christ's body, which is the Church, and what the apostle meant by diversity of graces[fn-29-P2996_1162944:96-nf] as if through the different members, there might be gifts proper even to every one separately, is clearly known. Why, too, and on what ground they who raised the objection were so unwilling to have taken away all difference in graces, why, moreover, the bishops of the synod were able to approve of the answer given by Pelagius in deference to the Apostle Paul, in whom we admit the combination of all those graces which he mentioned in the one particular passage, is by this time clear also.","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_20_on_the_proceedings_of_pelagius_","source_chapter":51,"source_paragraph":"176","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"To his lordship, the truly blessed and deservedly venerable father, Bishop Augustin, Timasius and Jacobus send greeting in the Lord.

If, however, he should teach that the immortal being of the soul also is sown along with the mortal body, he will not be believed; for the Almighty alone breathes into man the undying and undecaying part, as also it is He alone who is Creator of the invisible and indestructible.

For when one thoroughly examines and understands those things which happen to man according to his nature, he will know not to despise the procreation of children, although he applauds chastity, and prefers it in honour. For although honey be sweeter and more pleasant than other things, we are not for that reason to consider other things bitter which are mixed up in the natural sweetness of fruits. And, in support of these statements, I will bring forward a trustworthy witness, namely, Paul, who says, \"So then he that giveth her[fn-49-P4945_1492552:17-nf] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth bet ter.\"[fn-49-P4946_1492760:18-nf] Now the word, in setting forth that which is better and sweeter, did not intend to take away the inferior, but arranges so as to assign to each its own proper use and advantage.

For it is the custom of the prophetic Word to compare the Church to a flower covered and variegated meadow, adorned and crowned not only with the flowers of virginity, but also with those of child-bearing and of continence; for it is written, \"Upon thy[fn-49-P4949_1493854:21-nf] right hand did stand the queen in a vesture of gold, wrought about with divers colours.\"[fn-49-P4950_1493966:22-nf] ","title":"Discourse II.-Theophila.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_112_treatise_ii_on_the_dress_of_virgins_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-05","text":"8.

And thus the experience of death is not[fn-16-P1693_970800:27-nf] referred to Him Who had communion in our passible nature by reason of the union with Him of the Man, while at the same time the exalted and Divine names descend to the Man, so that He Who was manifested upon the Cross is called even \"the Lord of glory[fn-16-P1694_971491:28-nf] ,\" since the majesty implied in these names is transmitted from the Divine to the Human by the commixture of Its Nature with that Nature which is lowly. For this cause he describes Him in varied and different language, at one time as Him Who came down from heaven, at another time as Him Who was born of woman, as God from eternity, and Man in the last days; thus too theOnly-begotten God is held to be impassible, and Christ to be capable of suffering; nor does his discourse speak falsely in these opposing statements, as it adapts in its conceptions to each Nature the terms that belong to it. If then these are the doctrines which we have learnt from inspired teaching, how do we refer the cause of our salvation to an ordinary man? and if we declare the word \"made\" employed by the blessed Peter to have regard not to the pre-temporal existence, but to the new dispensation of the Incarnation, what has this to do with the charge against us? For this great Apostle says that that which was seen in the form of the servant has been made, by being assumed, to be that which He Who assumed it was in His own Nature. Moreover, in the Epistle to the Hebrews we may learn the same truth from Paul, when he says that Jesus was made an Apostle and High Priest by God, \"being faithful to him that made Him so[fn-16-P1695_972815:29-nf] .\" For in that passage too, in giving the name of High Priest to Him Who made with His own Blood the priestly propitiation for our sins, he does not by the word \"made\" declare the first existence of the Only-begotten, but says \"made\" with the intention of representing that grace which is commonly spoken of in connection with the appointment of priests. For Jesus, the great High Priest (as Zechariah says[fn-16-P1696_973257:30-nf] ), Who offered up his own lamb, that is, His own Body, for the sin of the world; Who, by reason of the children that arc partakers of flesh and blood, Himself also in like manner took part with them in blood[fn-16-P1697_973488:31-nf] (not in that He was in the beginning, being the Word and God, and being in the form of God, and equal with God, but in that He emptied Himself in the form of the servant, and offered an oblation and sacrifice for us), He, I say, became a High Priest many generations later, after the order of Melchisedech[fn-16-P1698_973816:32-nf] . Surely a reader who has more than a casual acquaintance with the discourse to the Hebrews knows the mystery of this matter. As, then, in that passage He is said to have been made Priest and Apostle, so here He is said to have been made Lord and Christ,-the latter for the dispensation on our behalf, the former by the change and transformation of the Human to the Divine (for by \"making\" the Apostle means \"making anew\"). Thus is manifest the knavery of our adversaries, who insolently wrest the words referring to the dispensation to apply them to the pretemporal existence. For we learn from the Apostle not to know Christ in the same manner now as before, as Paul thus speaks, \"Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now know we Him no more[fn-16-P1699_974600:33-nf] ,\" in the sense that the one knowledge manifests to us His temporary dispensation, the other His eternal existence. Thus our discourse has made no inconsiderable answer to his charges:-that we neither hold two Christs nor two Lords, that we are not ashamed of the Cross, that we do not glorify a mere man as having suffered for the world, that we assuredly do not think that the word \"made\" refers to the formation of the essence.

For Jesus, the great High Priest (as Zechariah says[fn-16-P1696_973257:30-nf] ), Who offered up his own lamb, that is, His own Body, for the sin of the world; Who, by reason of the children that arc partakers of flesh and blood, Himself also in like manner took part with them in blood[fn-16-P1697_973488:31-nf] (not in that He was in the beginning, being the Word and God, and being in the form of God, and equal with God, but in that He emptied Himself in the form of the servant, and offered an oblation and sacrifice for us), He, I say, became a High Priest many generations later, after the order of Melchisedech[fn-16-P1698_973816:32-nf] . Surely a reader who has more than a casual acquaintance with the discourse to the Hebrews knows the mystery of this matter. As, then, in that passage He is said to have been made Priest and Apostle, so here He is said to have been made Lord and Christ,-the latter for the dispensation on our behalf, the former by the change and transformation of the Human to the Divine (for by \"making\" the Apostle means \"making anew\"). Thus is manifest the knavery of our adversaries, who insolently wrest the words referring to the dispensation to apply them to the pretemporal existence. For we learn from the Apostle not to know Christ in the same manner now as before, as Paul thus speaks, \"Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now know we Him no more[fn-16-P1699_974600:33-nf] ,\" in the sense that the one knowledge manifests to us His temporary dispensation, the other His eternal existence. Thus our discourse has made no inconsiderable answer to his charges:-that we neither hold two Christs nor two Lords, that we are not ashamed of the Cross, that we do not glorify a mere man as having suffered for the world, that we assuredly do not think that the word \"made\" refers to the formation of the essence. But, such being our view, our argument has no small support from our accuser himself, where in the midst of his discourse he employs his tongue in a flourishing onslaught upon us, and produces this sentence among others: \"This, then, is the conflict that Basil wages against himself, and he clearly appears neither to have `applied his own mind to the intention of the Apostles,' nor to be able to preserve the sequence of his own arguments; for according to them he must, if he is conscious of their irreconcilable character, admit that the Word Who was in the beginning and was God became Lord,\" or he fits together \"statements that are mutually conflicting.\" Why, this is actually our statement which Eunomius repeats, who says that \"the Word that was in the beginning and was God became Lord.\" For, being what He was, God, and Word, and Life, and Light, and Grace, and Truth, and Lord, and Christ, and every name exalted and Divine, He did become, in the Man assumed by Him, Who was none of these, all else which the Word was and among the rest did become Lord and Christ, according to the teaching of Peter, and according to the confession of Eunomius;-not in the sense that the Godhead acquired anything by way of advancement, but (all exalted majesty being contemplated in the Divine Nature) He thus becomes Lord and Christ, not by arriving at any addition of grace in respect of His Godhead (for the Nature of the Godhead is acknowledged to be lacking in no good), but by bringing the Human Nature to theft participation in the Godhead which is signified by the terms \"Christ\" and \"Lord.\"","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_23_book_xvii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Again Saul sinned through disobedience, and again Samuel says to him in the word of the Lord, \"Because thou hast despised the word of the Lord, the Lord hath despised thee, that thou mayest not be king over Israel.\"[fn-30-P3099_1716054:54-nf] And again for the same sin, when Saul confessed it, and prayed for pardon, and besought Samuel to return with him to appease the Lord, he said, \"I will not return with thee: for thou hast despised the word of the Lord, and the Lord will despise thee that thou mayest not be king over Israel.

For (to use an illustration) Jacob, at the time when he was being born, first put forth from the womb a hand, with which also he held the foot of the brother who was taking priority of him in the act of birth; and next indeed the head followed, and thereafter, at last, and as matter of course, the rest of the members:[fn-28-P2842_1307354:17-nf] while, nevertheless the head in point of dignity and power has precedence, not only of those members which followed it then, but also of the very hand which anticipated it in the process of the birth, and is really the first, although not in the matter of the time of appearing, at least in the order of nature. And in an analogous manner, the Lord Jesus Christ, previous to His appearing in the fiesta, and coming forth in a certain manner out of the womb of His secrecy, before the eyes of men as Man, the Mediator between God and men,[fn-28-P2843_1307912:18-nf] \"who is over all, God blessed for ever,\"[fn-28-P2844_1307972:19-nf] sent before Him, in the person of the holy patriarchs and prophets, a certain portion of His body, wherewith, as by a hand, He gave token beforetime of His own approaching birth, and also supplanted[fn-28-P2845_1308188:20-nf] the people who were prior to Him in their pride, using for that purpose the bonds of the law, as if they were His five fingers. For through five epochs of times[fn-28-P2846_1308445:21-nf] there was no cessation in the foretelling and prophesying of His own destined coming; and in a manner consonant with this, he through whom the law was given wrote five books; and proud men, who were carnally minded, and sought to \"establish their own righteousness,\"[fn-28-P2847_1308737:22-nf] were not filled with blessing by the open hand of Christ, but were debarred from such good by the hand compressed and closed; and therefore their feet were tied, and \"they fell, while we are risen, and stand upright.\"[fn-28-P2848_1308971:23-nf] But although, as I have said, the Lord Christ did thus send before Him a certain portion of His body, in the person of those holy men who came before Him as regards the time of birth, nevertheless He is Himself the Head of the body, the Church,[fn-28-P2849_1309232:24-nf] and all these have been attached to that same body of which He is the head, in virtue of their believing in Him whom they announced prophetically. For they were: not sundered (from that body) in consequence of fulfilling their course before Him, but rather were they made one with the same by reason of their obedience. For although the hand may be put forward away before the head, still it has its connection beneath the head. Wherefore all things which were written aforetime were written in order that we might be taught thereby,[fn-28-P2850_1309783:25-nf] and were our figures, and happened in a figure in the ease of these men. Moreover they were written for our sakes, upon whom the end of the ages has come.[fn-28-P2851_1309955:26-nf] ","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_25_introductory_notice_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"37. \"Howbeit, after the lapse of some generations, another type was presented, which bears very emphatically on the matter in hand. For that city[fn-30-P3012_1409674:120-nf] was brought into captivity, and a large section of the people were carried off into Babylonia. Now, as Jerusalem signifies the city and fellowship of the saints, so Babylonia signifies the city and fellowship of the wicked, seeing that by interpretation it denotes confusion. On the subject of these two cities, which have been running their courses, mingling the one with the other, through all the changes of time from the beginning of the human race, and which shall so move on together until the end of the world, when they are destined to be separated at the last judgment, we have spoken already a little ago.[fn-30-P3013_1410323:121-nf] That captivity, then, of the city of Jerusalem, and the people thus carried into Babylonia in bondage, were ordained so to proceed by the Lord, by the voice of Jeremiah, a prophet of that time.[fn-30-P3014_1410542:122-nf] And there appeared kings[fn-30-P3015_1410598:123-nf] of Babylon, under whom they were in slavery, who on occasion of the captivity of this people were so wrought upon by certain miracles that they came to know the one true God who rounded universal creation, and worshipped Him, and commanded that He should be worshipped. Moreover the people were ordered both to pray for those by whom they were detained in captivity, and in their peace to hope for peace, to the effect that they should beget children, and build houses, and plant gardens and vineyards.[fn-30-P3016_1411162:124-nf] But at the end of seventy years, release from their captivity was promised to them.[fn-30-P3017_1411268:125-nf] All this, furthermore, signified in a figure that the Church of Christ in all His saints, who are citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem, would have to do service under the kings of this world. For the doctrine of the apostles speaks also in this wise, that 'every soul should be subject to the higher powers,' and that there 'should be rendered all things to all men, tribute to whom tribute (is due), custom to whom custom,'[fn-30-P3018_1411712:126-nf] and all other things in like manner which, without detriment to the worship of our God, we render to the rulers in the constitution of human society: for the Lord Himself also, in order to set before us an example of this sound doctrine, did not deem it unworthy of Him to pay tribute[fn-30-P3019_1412021:127-nf] on account of that human individuality[fn-30-P3020_1412083:128-nf] wherewith He was invested. Again, Christian servants and good believers are also commanded to serve their temporal masters in equanimity and faithfulness;[fn-30-P3021_1412315:129-nf] whom they will hereafter judge, if even on to the end they find them wicked, or with whom they will hereafter reign in equality, if they too shall have been converted to the true God. Still all are enjoined to be subject to the powers that are of man and of earth, even until, at the end of the predetermined time which the seventy years signify, the Church shall be delivered from the confusion of this world, like as Jerusalem was to be set free from the captivity in Babylonia. By occasion of that captivity, however, the kings of earth too have themselves been led to forsake the idols on account of which they were wont to persecute the Christians, and have come to know, and now worship, the one true God and Christ the Lord; and it is on their behalf that the Apostle Paul enjoins prayer to be made, even although they should persecute the Church. For he speaks in these terms: 'I entreat, therefore, that first of all supplications, adorations,[fn-30-P3022_1413287:130-nf] intercessions, and givings of thanks be made for kings, for all men, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, with all godliness and charity.\"[fn-30-P3023_1413543:131-nf] Accordingly peace has been given to the Church by these same persons, although it be but of a temporal sort,-a temporal quiet for the work of building houses after a spiritual fashion, and planting gardens and vineyards. For witness your own case, too,-at this very time we are engaged, by means of this discourse, in building you up and planting you. And the like process is going on throughout the whole circle of lands, in virtue of the peace allowed by Christian kings, even as the same apostle thus expresses himself: 'Ye are God's husbandry; ye are God's building.'[fn-30-P3024_1414139:132-nf] ","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_23_homily_xvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But if thou desirest to hear also His rebuke for them in particular, listen to Isaiah,[fn-17-P1754_588562:10-nf] in many words inveighing against them, and deriding their habit, their aspect, their gait, their trailing garments, their tripping feet, their drooping necks.

As regards the departure to Babylon, where the Spirit of God by the prophet Jeremiah enjoins them to go, telling them to pray for the people in whose land they dwell as strangers, because in their peace they would find peace, and to build houses, and plant vineyards and gardens,-the figurative meaning is plain, when we consider that the true Israelites, in whom is no guile, passed over in the ministry of the apostles with the ordinances of the gospel into the kingdom of the Gentiles. So the apostle, like an echo of Jeremiah, says to us, \"I will first of all that prayer, supplications, intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men, and for those in authority, that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and charity; for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.\"[fn-14-P1471_791867:58-nf] Accordingly the basilicas of Christian congregations have been built by believers as abodes of peace, and vineyards of the faithful have been renewed, and gardens planted, where chief among the plants is the mustard tree, in whose wide-spreading branches the pride of the Gentiles, like the birds of heaven, in its soaring ambition, takes shelter. Again, in the return from captivity after seventy years, according to Jeremiah's prophecy, and in the restoration of the temple, every believer in Christ must see a figure of our return as the Church of God from the exile of this world to the heavenly Jerusalem, after the seven days of time have fulfilled their course. Joshua the high priest, after the captivity, who rebuilt the temple, was a figure of Jesus Christ, the true High Priest of our restoration. The prophet Zechariah saw this Joshua in a filthy garment; and after the devil who stood by to accuse him was defeated, the filthy garment was taken from him, and a dress of honor and glory given him. So the body of Jesus Christ, which is the Church, when the adversary is conquered in the judgment at the end of the world, will pass from the pains of exile to the glory of everlasting safety. This is the song of the Psalmist at the dedication of his house: \"Thou hast turned for me my mourning into gladness; Thou hast removed my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness, that my glory may sing praise unto Thee, and not be silent.\"[fn-14-P1472_793331:59-nf] ","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_29_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_antiochians","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"ANF-01","text":"The Evangelists, too, when they declared that the one Father was \"the only true God,\"[fn-27-P2713_443723:15-nf] did not omit what concerned our Lord, but wrote: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

Whereas, then, Matthew had in view the kingly character, and Luke the priestly, they have at the same time both set forth pre-eminently the humanity of Christ: for it was according to His humanity that Christ was made both King and Priest.

But inasmuch as it was the priest's want to enter all alone into the holy of holies, in accordance with that principle, Luke, whose object contemplated the priestly office of Christ, did not have any one to come after him as a confederate, who was meant in some way to serve as an epitomizer of his narrative.[fn-10-P1063_417404:20-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_12_book_i_","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"143","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"53. Wherefore, seeing that Christ Himself is that Wisdom of God by whom all things were created, and considering that no rational intelligences, whether of angels or of men, receive wisdom except by participation in this Wisdom wherewith we are united by that Holy Spirit through whom charity is shed abroad in our hearts[fn-13-P1329_532042:157-nf] (which Trinity at the same time constitutes one God), Divine Providence, having respect to the interests of mortal men whose time-bound life was held engaged in things which rise into being and die,[fn-13-P1330_532259:158-nf] decreed that this same Wisdom of God, assuming into the unity of His person the (nature of) man, in which He might be born according to the conditions of time, and live and die and rise again, should utter and perform and bear and sustain things congruous to our salvation; and thus, in exemplary fashion, show at once to men on earth the way for a return to heaven, and to those angels who are above us, the way to retain their position in heaven.[fn-13-P1331_532770:159-nf] For unless, also, in the nature of the reasonable soul, and under the conditions of an existence in time, something came newly into being,-that is to say, unless that began to be which previously was not,-there could never be any passing from a life of utter corruption and folly into one of wisdom and true goodness. And thus, as truth in the contemplative lives in the enjoyment of things eternal, while faith in the believing is what is due to things which are made, man is purified through that faith which is conversant with temporal things, in order to his being made capable of receiving the truth of things eternal. For one of their noblest intellects, the philosopher Plato, in the treatise which is named the Timaeus, speaks also to this effect: \"As eternity is to that which is made, so truth to faith.\" Those two belong to the things above,-namely, eternity and truth; these two belong to the things below,-namely, that which is made and faith. In order, therefore, that we may be called off from the lowest objects, and led up again to the highest, and in order also that what is made may attain to the eternal, we must come through faith to truth. And because all contraries are reduced to unity by some middle factor, and because also the iniquity of time alienated us from the righteousness of eternity, there was need of some mediatorial righteousness of a temporal nature; which mediatizing factor might be temporal on the side of those lowest objects, but also righteous on the side of these highest,[fn-13-P1332_534392:160-nf] and thus, by adapting itself to the former without cutting itself off from the latter, might bring back those lowest objects to the highest. Accordingly, Christ was named the Mediator between God and men, who stood between the immortal God and mortal man, as being Himself both God and man,[fn-13-P1333_534998:161-nf] who reconciled man to God, who continued to be what He (formerly) was, but was made also what He (formerly) was not.

Now that the words addressed to Mary are not applicable to the Godhead of the Only-begotten, one may learn from the intention with which they were uttered. For He Who humbled Himself to a level with human littleness, He it is Who spake the words. And what is the meaning of what He then uttered, they may know in all its fulness who by the Spirit search out the depths of the sacred mystery. But as much as comes within our compass we will set down in few words, following the guidance of the Fathers. He Who is by nature Father of existent things, from Whom all things have their birth, has been proclaimed as one, by the sublime utterance of the Apostle. \"For there is one God,\" he says, \"and Father, of Whom are all things[fn-20-P2094_1268713:8-nf] .\" Accordingly human nature did not enter into the creation from any other source, nor grow spontaneously in the parents of the race, but it too had for the author of its own constitution none other than the Father of all. And the name of Godhead itself, whether it indicates the authority of oversight or of foresight[fn-20-P2095_1269055:9-nf] , imports a certain relation to humanity. For He Who bestowed on all things that are, the power of being, is the God and overseer of what He has Himself produced. But since, by the wiles of him that sowed in us the tares of disobedience, our nature no longer preserved in itself the impress of the Father's image, but was transformed into the foul likeness of sin, for this cause it was engrafted by virtue of similarity of will into the evil family of the father of sin: so that the good and true God and Father was no longer the God and Father of him who had been thus outlawed by his own depravity, but instead of Him Who was by Nature God, those were honoured who, as the Apostle says, \"by nature were no Gods[fn-20-P2096_1269960:10-nf] ,\" and in the place of the Father, he was deemed father who is falsely so called, as the prophet Jeremiah says in his dark saying, \"The partridge called, she gathered together what she hatched not[fn-20-P2097_1270174:11-nf] .\" Since, then, this was the sum of our calamity, that humanity was exiled from the good Father, and was banished from the Divine oversight and care, for this cause He Who is the Shepherd of the whole rational creation, left in the heights of heaven His unsinning and supramundane flock, and, moved by love, went after the sheep which had gone astray, even our human nature[fn-20-P2098_1270575:12-nf] . For human nature, which alone, according to the similitude in the parable, through vice roamed away from the hundred of rational beings, is, if it be compared with the whole, but an insignificant and infinitesimal part. Since then it was impossible that our life, which had been estranged from God, should of itself return to the high and heavenly place, for this cause, as saith the Apostle, He Who knew no sin is made sin for us[fn-20-P2099_1271124:13-nf] , and frees us from the curse by taking on Him our curse as His own[fn-21-P2100_1271215:14-nf] , and having taken up, and, in the language of the Apostle, \"slain\" in Himself \"the enmity[fn-21-P2101_1271328:15-nf] \" which by means of sin had come between us and God,-(in fact sin was \"the enmity\")-and having become what we were, He through Himself again united humanity to God. For having by purity brought into closest relationship with the Father of our nature that new man which is created after God[fn-21-P2102_1271640:16-nf] , in Whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily[fn-21-P2103_1271716:17-nf] , He drew with Him into the same grace all the nature that partakes of His body and is akin to Him. And these glad tidings He proclaims through the woman, not to those disciples only, but also to all who up to the present day become disciples of the Word,-the tidings, namely, that man is no longer outlawed, nor cast out of the kingdom of God, but is once more a son, once more in the station assigned to him by his God, inasmuch as along with the first-fruits of humanity the lump also is hallowed[fn-21-P2104_1272237:18-nf] . \"For behold,\" He says, \"I and the children whom God hath given Me[fn-21-P2105_1272327:19-nf] .\" He Who for our sakes was partaker of flesh and blood has recovered you, and brought you back to the place whence ye strayed away, becoming mere flesh and blood by sin[fn-21-P2106_1272542:20-nf] . And so He from Whom we were formerly alienated by our revolt has become our Father and our God. Accordingly in the passage cited above the Lord brings the glad tidings of this benefit. And the words are not a proof of the degradation of the Son, but the glad tidings of our reconciliation to God. For that which has taken place in Christ's Humanity is a common boon bestowed on mankind generally. For as when we see in Him the weight of the body, which naturally gravitates to earth, ascending through the air into the heavens, we believe according to the words of the Apostle, that we also \"shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air[fn-21-P2107_1273219:21-nf] ,\" even so, when we hear that the true God and Father has become the God and Father of our First-fruits, we no longer doubt that the same God has become our God and Father too, inasmuch as we have learnt hat we shall come to the same place whither Christ has entered for us as our forerunner[fn-21-P2108_1273533:22-nf] . And the fact too that this grace was revealed by means of a woman, itself agrees with the interpretation which we have given For since, as the Apostle tells us, \"the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression[fn-21-P2109_1273771:23-nf] ,\" and was by her disobedience foremost in the revolt from God, for this cause she is the first witness of the resurrection, that she might retrieve by her faith in the resurrection the overthrow caused by her disobedience, and that as, by making herself at the beginning a minister and advocate to her husband of the counsels of the serpent, she brought into human life the beginning of evil, and its train of consequences, so, by ministering[fn-21-P2110_1274235:24-nf] to His disciples the words of Him Who slew the rebel dragon, she might become to men the guide to faith, whereby with good reason the first proclamation of death is annulled. It is likely, indeed, that by more diligent students a more profitable explanation of the text may be discovered. But even though none such should be found, I think that every devout reader will agree that the one advanced by our opponents is futile, after comparing it with that which we have brought forward. For the one has been fabricated to destroy the glory of the Only-begotten, and nothing more: but the other includes in its scope the aim of the dispensation concerning man. For it has been shown that it was not the intangible, immutable, and invisible God, but the moving, visible, and tangible nature which is proper to humanity, that gave command to Mary to minister the word to His disciples.","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_23_book_xii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But he has reached the irrefutable argument which we long ago detected lurking in the sequel of his statements[fn-21-P2124_1286290:31-nf] , but which is here proclaimed aloud without disguise. For he wishes to show that the essence of the Son is subject to passion, and to decay, and in no wise differs from material nature, which is in a state of flux, that by this means he may demonstrate His difference from the Father. For he says, \"If he can show that the God Who is over all, Who is the Light unapproachable, was incarnate or could be incarnate, came under authority, obeyed commands, came under the laws of men, bore the Cross, let him say that the Light is equal to the Light.\" If these words had been brought forward by us as following by necessary consequence from premises laid down by Eunomius, who would not have charged us with unfairness, in employing an over-subtle dialectic to reduce our adversaries' statement to such an absurdity? But as things stand, the fact that they themselves make no attempt to suppress the absurdity that naturally follows from their assumption, helps to support our contention that it was not without due reflection that, with the help of truth, we censured life argument of heresy. For behold, how undisguised and outspoken is their striving against the Only-begotten God! Nay, by His enemies His work of mercy is reckoned a means of disparaging and maligning the Nature of the Son of God, as though not of deliberate purpose, but by a compulsion of His Nature he had slipped down to life in the flesh, and to the suffering of the Cross! And as it is the nature of a stone to fall downward, and of fire to rise upward, and as these material objects do not exchange their natures one with another, so that the stone should have an upward tendency, and fire be depressed by its weight and sink downwards, even so they make out that passion was part of the very Nature of the Son, and that for this cause He came to that which was akin and familiar to Him, but that the Nature of the Father, being free from such passions, remained unapproachable by the contact of evil. For he says, that the God Who is over all, Who is Light unapproachable, neither was incarnate nor could be incarnate. The first of the two statements was quite enough, that the Father did not become incarnate. But now by his addition a double absurdity arises; for he either charges the Son with evil, or the Father with powerlessness. For if to partake of our flesh is evil, then he predicates evil of the Only-begotten God; but if the lovingkindness to man was good, then he makes out the Father to be powerless for good, by saying that it would not have been in His power to have effectually bestowed such grace by taking flesh. And yet who in the world does not know that life-giving power proceeds to actual operation both in the Father and in the Son? \"For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them,\" He says, \"even so the Son quickeneth whom He will[fn-21-P2125_1289217:32-nf] ,\"-meaning obviously by \"dead\" us who had fallen from the true life. If then it is even so as the Father quickeneth, and not otherwise, that the Son brings to operation the same grace, how comes it that the adversary of God moves his profane tongue against both, insulting the Father by attributing to Him powerlessness for good, and the Son by attributing to Him association with evil. But \"Light,\" he says, \"is not equal to Light,\" because the one he calls \"true,\" and the other \"unapproachable.\" Is then the true considered to be a diminution of the unapproachable? Why so? and yet their argument is that the Godhead of the Father must be conceived to be greater and more exalted than that of the Son, because the one is called in the Gospel \"true God[fn-21-P2126_1289992:33-nf] ,\" the other \"God[fn-21-P2127_1290032:34-nf] \" without the addition of \"true.\" How then does the same term, as applied to the Godhead, indicate an enhancement of the conception, and, as applied to Light, a diminution? For if they say that the Father is greater than the Son because He is true God, by the same showing the Son would be acknowledged to be greater than the Father, because the former is called \"true Light[fn-21-P2128_1290426:35-nf] ,\" and the latter not so. \"But this Light,\" says Eunomius, \"carried into effect the plan of mercy, while the other remained inoperative with respect to that gracious action.\" A new and strange mode of determining priority in dignity! They judge that which is ineffective for a benevolent purpose to be superior to that which is operative. But such a notion as this neither exists nor ever will be found amongst Christians,-a notion by which it is made out that every good that is in existent things has not its origin from the Father. But of goods that pertain to us men, the crowning blessing is held by all right-minded men to be the return to life; and it is secured by the dispensation carried out by the Lord in His human nature; not that the Father remained aloof, as heresy will have it, ineffective and inoperative during the time of this dispensation. For it is not this that He indicates Who said, \"He that sent Me is with Me[fn-21-P2129_1291381:36-nf] ,\" and \"The Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works[fn-21-P2130_1291482:37-nf] .\" With what right then does heresy attribute to the Son alone the gracious intervention on our behalf, and thereby exclude the Father from having any part or lot in our gratitude for its successful issue? For naturally the requital of thanks is due to our benefactors alone, and He Who is incapable of benefiting us is outside the pale of our gratitude. See you how the course of their profane attack upon the Only-begotten Son has missed its mark, and is working round in natural consequence so as to be directed against the majesty of the Father? And this seems to me to be a necessary result of their method of proceeding. For if he that honoureth the Son honoureth the Father[fn-21-P2131_1292185:38-nf] , according to the Divine declaration, it is plain on the other side that an assault upon the Son strikes at the Father. But I say that to those who with simplicity of heart receive the preaching of the Cross and the resurrection, the same grace should be a cause of equal thankfulness to the Son and to the Father, and now that the Son has accomplished the Father's will (and this, in the language of the Apostle, is \"that all men should be saved[fn-21-P2132_1292657:39-nf] \"), they ought for this boon to honour the Father and the Son alike, inasmuch as our salvation would not have been wrought, had not the good will of the Father proceeded to actual operation for us through His own power. And we have learnt from the Scripture that the Son is the learnt of the Father[fn-21-P2133_1292975:40-nf] .","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"15. I still hold that there is a reference to Christ in the passage which you select for refutation, where God says to Moses, \"I will raise up unto them from among their brethren a prophet like unto thee.\"[fn-16-P1687_944664:17-nf] The string of showy antitheses with which you try to ornament your dull discourse does not at all affect my belief of this truth. You attempt to prove, by a comparison of Christ and Moses, that they are unlike, and that therefore the words. \"I will raise up a prophet like unto thee,\" cannot be understood of Christ. You specify a number of particulars in which you find a diversity: that the one is man, and the other God; that one is a sinner, the other sinless; that one is born of ordinary generation, the other, as we hold, of a virgin, and, as you hold, not even of a virgin; the one incurs God's anger, and is put to death on a mountain, the other suffers voluntarily, having throughout the approval of His Father. But surely things may be said to be like, although they are not like in every respect. Besides the resemblance between things of the same nature, as between two men, or between parents and children, or between men in general, or any species of animals, or in trees, between one olive and another, or one laurel and another, there is often a resemblance in things of a different nature, as between a wild and a tame olive, or between wheat and barley. These things are to some extent allied. But there is the greatest possible distance between the Son of God, by whom all things were made, and a beast or a stone. And yet in the Gospel we read, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\"[fn-16-P1688_946079:18-nf] and in the apostle, \"That rock was Christ.\"[fn-16-P1689_946140:19-nf] This could not be said except on the supposition of some resemblance. What wonder, then, if Christ condescended to become like Moses, when He was made like the lamb which God by Moses commanded His people to eat as a type of Christ, enjoining that its blood should be used as a means of protection, and that it should be called the Passover, which every one must admit to be fulfilled in Christ? The Scripture, I acknowledge, shows points of difference; and the Scripture also, as I call on you to acknowledge, shows points of resemblance. There are points of both kinds, and one can be proved as well as the other. Christ is unlike man, for He is God; and it is written of Him that He is \"over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-16-P1690_946881:20-nf] Christ is also like man, for He is man; and it is likewise written of Him, that He is the \"Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.\"[fn-16-P1691_947042:21-nf] Christ is unlike a sinner, for He is ever holy; and He is like a sinner, for \"God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh.\"[fn-16-P1692_947237:22-nf] Christ is unlike a man born in ordinary generation, for He was born of a virgin; and yet He is like, for He too was born of a woman, to whom it was said, \"That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-16-P1693_947488:23-nf] Christ is unlike a man, who dies on account of his own sin, for He died without sin, and of His own free-will; and again, He is like, for He too died a real death of the body.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_25_answer_to_eunomius_second_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But if any one would give a more sensuous interpretation to the words \"God said,\" as proving that articulate speech was His creation, by a parity of reason he must understand by the words \"God saw,\" that He did so by faculties of perception like our own, through the organs of vision; and so again by the words \"The Lord heard me and had mercy upon me,\" and again, \"He smelled a sweet savour[fn-22-P2253_1448586:46-nf] ,\" and whatever other sensuous expressions are employed by Scripture in reference to head, or foot, or hand, or eyes, or fingers, or sandals, as appertaining to God, taking them, I say, in their plain literal acceptation, he will present to us an anthropomorphous deity, after the similitude of what is seen among ourselves. But if any one hearing that the heavens are the work of His fingers, that He has a strong hand, and a mighty arm, and eyes, and feet, and sandals, deduces from such words ideas worthy of God, and does not degrade the idea of His pure nature by carnal and sensuous imaginations, it will follow that on the one hand he will regard the verbal utterances as indications of the Divine will, but on the other He will not conceive of them as articulate sounds, but will reason thus; that the Creator of human reason has gifted us with speech proportionally to the capacity of our nature, so that we might be able thereby to signify the thoughts of our minds; but that, so far as the Divine nature differs from ours, so great will be the degree of difference between our notions respecting it and its own inherent majesty and godhead. And as our power compared with God's, and our life with His life, is as nothing, and all else that is ours, compared with what is in Him, is \"as nothing in comparison[fn-22-P2254_1449945:47-nf] \" with Him, as saith the inspired Teaching, so also our word as compared with Him, Who is the Word indeed, is as nothing[fn-22-P2255_1450085:48-nf] . For this word of yours was not in the beginning, but was created along with our nature, nor is it to be regarded as having any reality of its own, but, as our master (Basil) somewhere has said, it vanishes along with the sound of the voice, nor is any operation of the word discernible, but it has its subsistence in voice only, or in written characters. But the word of God is God Himself, the Word that was in the beginning and that abideth for ever, through Whom all things were and are, Who ruleth over all, and hath all power over the things in heaven and the things on earth, being Life, and Truth, and Righteousness, and Light, and all that is good, and upholding all things in being. Such, then, and so great being the word, as we understand it, of God, our opponent allows God, as some great thing, the power of language, made up of nouns, verbs, and conjunctions, not perceiving that, as He Who conferred practical powers on our nature is not spoken of as fabricating each of their several results, but, while He gave our nature its ability, it is by us that a house is constructed, or a bench, or a sword, or a plough, and whatsoever thing our life happens to be in need of, each of which things is our own work, although it may be ascribed to Him Who is the author of our being, and Who created our nature capable of every science,-so also our power of speech is the work of Him Who made our nature what it is, but the invention of each several term required to denote objects in hand is of our own devising. And this is proved by the fact that many terms in use are of a base and unseemly character, of which no man of sense would conceive God the inventor: so that, if certain of our familiar expressions are ascribed by Holy Scripture to God as the speaker, we should remember that the Holy Spirit is addressing us in language of our own, as e.g. in the history of the Acts we are told that each man received the teaching of the disciples in his own language wherein he was born, understanding the sense of the words by the language which he knew. And, that this is true, may be seen yet more clearly by a careful examination of the enactments of the Levitical law. For they make mention of pans, and cakes, and fine flours, and the like, in the mystic sacrifices, instilling wholesome doctrine under the veil of symbol and enigma. Mention, too, is made of certain measures then in use, such as ephah, and nebel[fn-22-P2256_1452691:49-nf] , and hin, and the like. Are we, then, to suppose that God made these names and appellations, or that in the beginning He commanded them to be such, and to be so named, calling one kind of grain wheat, and its pith flour, and flat sweetmeats, whether heavy or light, cakes; and that He commanded a vessel of the kind in which a moist lump is boiled or baked to be called a pan, or that He spoke of a certain liquid measure by the name of hin or nebel, and measured dry produce by the homer? surely it is trifling and mere Jewish folly, far removed from the grandeur of Christian simplicity, to think that God, Who is the Most High and above every name and thought, Who by sole virtue of His will governs the world, which He brought into existence, and upholds it in being, should set Himself like some schoolmaster to settle the niceties of terminology. Rather let us say, that as we indicate to the deaf what we want them to do, by gestures and signs, not because we have no voice of our own, but because a verbal communication would be utterly useless to those who cannot hear, so, in as much as human nature is in a sense deaf and insensible to higher truths, we maintain that the grace of God at sundry times and in divers manners spake by the Prophets, ordering their voices conformably to our capacity and the modes of expression with which we are familiar, and that by such means it leads us, as with a guiding hand, to the knowledge of higher truths, not teaching us in terms proportioned to their inherent sublimity, (for how can the great be contained by the little?) but descending to the lower level of our limited comprehension. And as God, after giving animals their power of motion, no longer prescribes each step they take, for their nature, having once for all taken its beginning from the Creator, moves of itself, and makes its way, adapting its power of motion to its object from time to time (except in so far as it is said that a man's steps are directed by the Lord), so our nature, having received from God the power of speech and utterance and of expressing the will by the voice, proceeds on its way through things, giving them distinctive names by varying inflections of sound; and these signs are the verbs and nouns which we use, and through which we signify the meaning of the things. And though the word \"fruit\" is made use of by Moses before the creation of fruit, and \"seed\" before that of seed, this does not disprove our assertion, nor is the sense of the lawgiver opposed to what we have said in respect to thought and conception. For that end of past husbandry which we speak of as fruit, and that beginning of future husbandry which we speak of as seed, this thing, I mean, underlying these names,-whether wheat or some other produce which is increased and multiplied by sowing-does not, he teaches us, grow spontaneously, but by the will of Him Who created them to grow with their peculiar power, so as to be the same fruit and to reproduce themselves as seed, and to support mankind with their increase. And by the Divine will the thing is produced, not the name, so that the substantial thing[fn-22-P2257_1456099:50-nf] is the work of the Creator, but the distinguishing names of things, by which speech furnishes us with a clear and accurate description of them, are the work and the invention of man's reasoning faculty, though the reasoning faculty itself and its nature are a work of God. And since all men are endowed with reason, differences of language will of necessity be found according to differences of country. But if any one maintain that light, or heaven, or earth, or seed were named after human fashion by God, he will certainly conclude that they were named in some special language. What that was, let him show. For he who knows the one thing will not, in all probability, be ignorant of the other. For at the river Jordan, after the descent of the Holy Ghost, and again in the hearing of the Jews, and at the Transfiguration, there came a voice from heaven, teaching men not only to regard the phenomenon as something more than a figure, but also to believe the beloved Son of God to be truly God. Now that voice was fashioned by God, suitably to the understanding of the hearers, in airy substance, and adapted to the language of the day, God, \"who willeth that all men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth[fn-22-P2258_1457801:51-nf] ,\" having so articulated His words in the air with a view to the salvation of the hearers, as our Lord also saith to the Jews, when they thought it thundered because the sound took place in the air. \"This voice came not because of Me, but for your sakes[fn-22-P2259_1458074:52-nf] .\" But before the creation of the world, inasmuch as there was no one to hear the word, and no bodily element capable of accentuating the articulate voice, how can he who says that God used words give any air of probability to his assertion? God Himself is without body, creation did not yet exist. Reason does not suffer us to conceive of anything material in respect to Him. They who might have been benefited by the hearing were not yet created. And if men were not yet in being, neither had any form of language been struck out in accordance with national peculiarities, by what arguments, then, can he who looks to the bare letter make good his assertion, that God spoke thus using human parts of speech?","title":"Answer to Eunomius' Second Book","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_31_book_i_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Let us now look at the quotation from Genesis, where the woman was created out of the side of the man, and was brought to him, and he said: \"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.\" Our opponent thinks that \"Adam ought to have said, 'Soul of my soul, or spirit of my spirit,' if this, too, had been derived from him.\" But, in fact, they who maintain the opinion of the propagation of souls feel that they possess a more impregnable defence of their position in the fact that in the Scripture narrative which informs us that God took a rib out of the man's side and formed it into a woman, it is not added that He breathed into her face the breath of life; for this reason, as they say, because she had already been ensouled[fn-45-P4580_1755084:45-nf] from the man.

Remember then, that Jechonias, rejected without any fault of his, ceased to reign, and passed over unto the Gentiles, when the carrying away unto Babylon took place. Now observe the figure hereby manifested beforehand, of things to come in the Lord Jesus Christ. For the Jews would not that our Lord Jesus Christ should reign over them, yet found they no fault in Him. He was rejected in His own person, and in that of His servants also, and so they passed over unto the Gentiles as into Babylon in a figure. For this also did Jeremiah prophesy, that the Lord commanded them to go into Babylon: and whatever other prophets told the people not to go into Babylon, them he reproved as false prophets.[fn-29-P2944_1302934:37-nf] Let those who read the Scriptures, remember this as we do; and let those who do not, give us credit. Jeremiah then on the part of God threatened those who would not go into Babylon, whereas to them who should go he promised rest there, and a sort of happiness in the cultivation of their vines, and planting of their gardens, and the abundance of their fruits. How then does the people of Israel, not now in figure but in verity, pass over unto Babylon? Whence came the Apostles? Were they not of the nation of the Jews? Whence came Paul himself?for he saith, \"I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.\"[fn-29-P2945_1303587:38-nf] Many of the Jews then believed in the Lord; from them were the Apostles chosen; of them were the more than five hundred brethren, to whom it was vouchsafed[fn-29-P2946_1303760:39-nf] to see the Lord after His resurrection;[fn-29-P2947_1303816:40-nf] of them were the hundred and twenty in the house,[fn-29-P2948_1303885:41-nf] when the Holy Ghost came down. But what saith the Apostle in the Acts of the Apostles, when the Jews refused the word of truth? \"We were sent unto you, but seeing ye have rejected the word of God, lo! we turn unto the Gentiles.\"[fn-29-P2949_1304131:42-nf] The true passing over then into Babylon, which was then prefigured in the time of Jeremiah, took place in the spiritual dispensation of the time of the Lord's Incarnation. But what saith Jeremiah of these Babylonians, to those who were passing over to them? \"For in their peace shall be your peace.\"[fn-29-P2950_1304451:43-nf] When Israel then passed over also into Babylon by Christ and the Apostles, that is, when the Gospel came unto the Gentiles, what saith the Apostle, as though by the mouth of Jeremiah of old? \"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men. For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.\"[fn-29-P2951_1304904:44-nf] For they were not yet Christian kings, yet he prayed for them. Israel then praying in Babylon hath been heard; the prayers of the Church have been heard, and the kings have become Christian, and you see now fulfilled what was then spoken in figure; \"In their peace shall be your peace,\" for they have received the peace of Christ, and have left off to persecute Christians, that now in the secure quiet of peace, the Churches might be built up, and peoples planted in the garden[fn-29-P2952_1305405:45-nf] of God, and that all nations might bring forth fruit in faith, and hope, and love, which is in Christ.","title":"Sermon I.

For, as I have read in some writer of Valentinus' wretched faction,[fn-95-P9505_2608542:220-nf] they refuse at the outset to believe that a human and earthly substance was created[fn-95-P9506_2608646:221-nf] for Christ, lest the Lord should be regarded as inferior to the angels, who are not formed of earthly flesh; whence, too, it would be necessary that, if His flesh were like ours, it should be similarly born, not of the Spirit, nor of God, but of the will of man. Why, moreover, should it be born, not of corruptible [seed], but of incorruptible? Why, again, since His flesh has both risen and returned to heaven, is not ours, being like His, also taken up at once? Or else, why does not His flesh, since it is like ours, return in like manner to the ground, and suffer dissolution? Such objections even the heathen used constantly to bandy about.[fn-95-P9507_2609313:222-nf] Was the Son of God reduced to such a depth of degradation Again, if He rose again as a precedent for our hope, how is it that nothing like it has been thought desirable (to happen) to ourselves?[fn-95-P9508_2609551:223-nf] Such views are not improper for heathens and they are fit and natural for the heretics too. For, indeed, what difference is there between them, except it be that the heathen, in not believing, do believe; while the heretics, in believing, do not believe? Then, again, they read: \"Thou madest Him a little less than angels; \"[fn-95-P9509_2609971:224-nf] and they deny the lower nature of that Christ who declares Himself to be, \"not a man, but a worm; \"[fn-95-P9510_2610097:225-nf] who also had \"no form nor comeliness, but His form was ignoble, despised more than all men, a man in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of weakness.\"[fn-95-P9511_2610275:226-nf] Here they discover a human being mingled with a divine one and so they deny the manhood.

What method of release from this jurisdiction can be devised? Here too the Gospel teaching is abundantly sufficient. We hear our Lord saying to Nicodemus, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit[fn-27-P2774_1887343:88-nf] .\" We know too that the flesh is subject to death because of sin, but the Spirit of God is both incorruptible, and life-giving, and deathless. As at our physical birth there comes into the world with us a potentiality of being again turned to dust, plainly the Spirit also imparts a life-giving potentiality to the children begotten by Himself. What lesson, then, results from these remarks? This: that we should wean ourselves from this life in the flesh, which has an inevitable follower, death; and that we should search for a manner of life which does not bring death in its train. Now the life of Virginity is such a life. We will add a few other things to show how true this is. Every one knows that the propagation of mortal frames is the work which the intercourse of the sexes has to do; whereas for those who are joined to the Spirit, life and immortality instead of children are produced by this latter intercourse; and the words of the Apostle beautifully suit their case, for the joyful mother of such children as these \"shall be saved in child-bearing[fn-27-P2775_1888430:89-nf] ;\" as the Psalmist in his divine songs thankfully cries, \"He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children[fn-27-P2776_1888588:90-nf] .\" Truly a joyful mother is the virgin mother who by the operation of the Spirit conceives the deathless children, and who is called by the Prophet barren because of her modesty only. This life, then, which is stronger than the power of death, is, to those who think, the preferable one. The physical bringing of children into the world-I speak without wishing to offend-is as much a starting-point of death as of life; because from the moment of birth the process of dying commences. But those who by virginity have desisted from this process have drawn within themselves the boundary line of death, and by their own deed have checked his advance; they have made themselves, in fact, a frontier between life and death, and a barrier too, which thwarts him. If, then, death cannot pass beyond virginity, but finds his power checked and shattered there, it is demonstrated that virginity is a stronger thing than death; and that body is rightly named undying which does not lend its service to a dying world, nor brook to become the instrument of a succession of dying creatures. In such a body the long unbroken career of decay and death, which has intervened between[fn-27-P2777_1889775:91-nf] the first man and the lives of virginity which have been led, is interrupted. It could not be indeed that death should cease working as long as the human race by marriage was working too; he walked the path of life with all preceding generations; he started with every new-born child and accompanied it to the end: but he found in virginity a barrier, to pass which was an impossible feat. Just as, in the age of Mary the mother of God, he who had reigned from Adam to her time found, when he came to her and dashed his forces against the fruit of her virginity as against a rock, that he was shattered to pieces upon her, so in every soul which passes through this life in the flesh under the protection of virginity, the strength of death is in a manner broken and annulled, for he does not find the places upon which he may fix his sting. If you do not throw into the fire wood, or straw, or grass, or something that it can consume, it has not the force to last by itself; so the power of death cannot go on working, if marriage does not supply it with material and prepare victims for this executioner. If you have any doubts left, consider the actual names of those afflictions which death brings upon mankind, and which were detailed in the first part of this discourse. Whence do they get their meaning? \"Widowhood,\" \"orphanhood,\" \"loss of children,\" could they be a subject for grief, if marriage did not precede? Nay, all the dearly-prized blisses, and transports, and comforts of marriage end in these agonies of grief, The hilt of a sword is smooth and handy, and polished and glittering outside; it seems to grow to the outline of the hand[fn-27-P2778_1891533:92-nf] ; but the other part is steel and the instrument of death, formidable to look at, more formidable still to come across. Such a thing is marriage. It offers for the grasp of the senses a smooth surface of delights, like a hilt of rare polish and beautiful workmanship; but when a man has taken it up and has got it into his hands, he finds the pain that has been wedded to it is in his hands as well; and it becomes to him the worker of mourning and of loss. It is marriage that has the heartrending spectacles to show of children left desolate in the tenderness of their years, a mere prey to the powerful, yet smiling often at their misfortune from ignorance of coming woes. What is the cause of widowhood but marriage? And retirement from this would bring with it an immunity from the whole burden of these sad taxes on our hearts. Can we expect it otherwise? When the verdict that was pronounced on the delinquents in the beginning is annulled, then too the mothers' \"sorrows[fn-27-P2779_1892575:93-nf] \" are no longer \"multiplied,\" nor does \"sorrow\" herald the births of men; then all calamity has been removed from life and \"tears wiped from off all faces[fn-27-P2780_1892748:94-nf] ;\" conception is no more an iniquity, nor child-bearing a sin; and births shall be no more \"of bloods,\" or \"of the will of man,\" or \"of the will of the flesh[fn-27-P2781_1892922:95-nf] \", but of God alone. This is always happening whenever any one in a lively heart conceives all the integrity of the Spirit, and brings forth wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption too. It is possible for any one to be the mother of such a son; as our Lord says, \"He that doeth my will is my brother, my sister, and my mother[fn-27-P2782_1893288:96-nf] .\" What room is there for death in such parturitions? Indeed in them death is swallowed up by life. In fact, the Life of Virginity seems to be an actual representation of the blessedness in the world to come, showing as it does in itself so many signs of the presence of those expected blessings which are reserved for us there. That the truth of this statement may be perceived, we will verify it thus. It is so, first, because a man who has thus died once for all to sin lives for the future to God; he brings forth no more fruit unto death; and having so far as in him lies made an end[fn-27-P2783_1893900:97-nf] of this life within him according to the flesh, he awaits thenceforth the expected blessing of the manifestation[fn-27-P2784_1894069:98-nf] of the great God, refraining from putting any distance between himself and this coming of God by an intervening posterity: secondly, because he enjoys even in this present life a certain exquisite glory of all the blessed results of our resurrection. For our Lord has announced that the life after our resurrection shall be as that of the angels. Now the peculiarity of the angelic nature is that they are strangers to marriage; therefore the blessing of this promise has been already received by him who has not only mingled his own glory with the halo of the Saints, but also by the stainlessness of his life has so imitated the purity of these incorporeal beings. If virginity then can win us favours such as these, what words are fit to express the admiration of so great a grace? What other gift of the soul can be found so great and precious as not to suffer by comparison with this perfection?","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_36_book_i_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"They say,\" says he, \"that the saints in the Old Testament were not without sins,-that is that they were not free from crimes even by amendment, but they were seized by death in their guilt.\" Nay, I say that either before the law, or in the time of the Old Testament, they were freed from sins,-not by their own power, because \"cursed is every one that hath put his hope in man,\"[fn-50-P5086_2003611:25-nf] and without any doubt those are under this curse whom also the sacred Psalm notifies, \"who trust in their own strength;\"[fn-50-P5087_2003751:26-nf] nor by the old covenant which gendereth to bondage,[fn-50-P5088_2003821:27-nf] although it was divinely given by the grace of a sure dispensation; nor by that law itself, holy and just and good as it was, where it is written, \"Thou shalt not covet,\"[fn-50-P5089_2004010:28-nf] since it wasnot given as being able to give life, but it was added for the sake of transgression until the seed should come to whom the promise was made; but I say that they were freed by the blood of the Redeemer Himself, who is the one Mediator of God and man, the man Christ Jesus.[fn-50-P5090_2004311:29-nf] But those enemies of the grace of God, which is given to small and great through Jesus Christ our Lord, say that the men of God of old were of a perfect righteousness, lest they should be supposed to have needed the incarnation, the passion, and resurrection of Christ, by belief in whom they were saved.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_36_book_i_","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"We say,\" says he, \"that the saints of the Old Testament, their righteousness being perfected here, passed to eternal life,-that is, that by the love of virtue they departed from all sins; because those whom we read of as having committed any sin, we nevertheless know to have amended themselves.\" Of whatever virtue you may declare that the ancient righteous men were possessed, nothing saved them but the belief in the Mediator who shed His blood for the remission of their sins.

Be not disquieted, O flesh and blood, with any care; in Christ you have acquired both heaven and the kingdom of God. Otherwise, if they say that you are not in Christ, let them also say that Christ is not in heaven, since they have denied you heaven.

For a little afterwards, he has described what is, as it were, the death of death itself: \"Death,\" says he, \"is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin \"-here is the corruption; \"and the strength of sin is the law\"[fn-102-P10217_2851872:385-nf] -that other law, no doubt, which he has described \"in his members as warring against the law of his mind,\"[fn-102-P10218_2852004:386-nf] -meaning, of course, the actual power of sinning against his will. Now he says in a previous passage (of our Epistle to the Corinthians), that \"the last enemy to be destroyed is death.\"[fn-102-P10219_2852211:387-nf] In this way, then, it is that corruption shall not inherit incorruption; in other words, death shall not continue.

But in what condition, if not in that wherein we shall be found? \"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-102-P10221_2852796:389-nf] What mortal is this but the flesh? what corruptible but the blood. Moreover, that you may not suppose the apostle to have any other meaning, in his care to teach you, and that you may understand him seriously to apply his statement to the flesh, when he says \"this corruptible\" and \"this mortal,\" he utters the words while touching the surface of his own body.[fn-102-P10222_2853174:390-nf] He certainly could not have pronounced these phrases except in reference to an object which was palpable and apparent. The expression indicates a bodily exhibition. Moreover, a corruptible body is one thing, and corruption is another; so a mortal body is one thing, and mortality is another. For that which suffers is one thing, and that which causes it to suffer is another.

And should the vessels themselves afterwards fail to hold her, escaping from even these, and returning to her mother earth, she is absorbed once more, as it were, by its secret embraces, ultimately to stand forth to view, like Adam when summoned to hear from his Lord and Creator the words, \"Behold, the man is become as one of us!\"[fn-103-P10342_2899959:473-nf] -thoroughly \"knowing\" by that time \"the evil\" which she had escaped, \"and the good\" which she has acquired. Why, then, O soul, should you envy the flesh? There is none, after the Lord, whom you should love so dearly; none more like a brother to you, which is even born along with yourself in God. You ought rather to have been by your prayers obtaining resurrection for her: her sins, whatever they were, were owing to you. However, it is no wonder if you hate her; for you have repudiated her Creator.[fn-103-P10343_2900483:474-nf] You have accustomed yourself either to deny or change her existence even in Christ[fn-103-P10344_2900635:475-nf] -corrupting the very Word of God Himself, who became flesh, either by mutilating or misinterpreting the Scripture,[fn-103-P10345_2900787:476-nf] and introducing, above all, apocryphal mysteries and blasphemous fables.[fn-103-P10346_2901156:477-nf] But yet Almighty God, in His most gracious providence, by \"pouring out of His Spirit in these last days, upon all flesh, upon His servants and on His handmaidens,\"[fn-103-P10347_2901362:478-nf] has checked these impostures of unbelief and perverseness, reanimated men's faltering faith in the resurrection of the flesh, and cleared from all obscurity and equivocation the ancient Scriptures (of both God's Testaments[fn-103-P10348_2901834:479-nf] ) by the clear light of their (sacred) words and meanings. Now, since it was \"needful that there should be heresies, in order that they which are approved might be made manifest; \"[fn-103-P10349_2902066:480-nf] since, however, these heresies would be unable to put on a bold front without some countenance from the Scriptures, it therefore is plain enough that the ancient Holy Writ has furnished them with sundry materials for their evil doctrine, which very materials indeed (so distorted) are refutable from the same Scriptures. It was fit and proper, therefore, that the Holy Ghost should no longer withhold the effusions of His gracious light upon these inspired writings, in order that they might be able to disseminate the seeds of truth with no admixture of heretical subtleties, and pluck out from it their tares. He has accordingly now dispersed all the perplexities of the past, and their self-chosen allegories and parables, by the open and perspicuous explanation of the entire mystery, through the new prophecy, which descends in copious streams from the Paraclete. If you will only draw water from His fountains, you will never thirst for other doctrine: no feverish craving after subtle questions will again consume you; but by drinking in evermore the resurrection of the flesh, you will be satisfied with the refreshing draughts.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_31_the_pearl_seven_hymns_on_the_faith","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"Let our Lord be set between God and men![fn-36-P3669_1165082:29-nf] Let the Prophets be as it were His heralds!

For, confuted on all sides on the distinction between the Father and the Son, which we maintain without destroying their inseparable union-as (by the examples) of the sun and the ray, and the fountain and the river-yet, by help of (their conceit)an indivisible number, (with issues)of two and three, they endeavour to interpret this distinction in a way which shall nevertheless tally with their own opinions: so that, all in one Person, they distinguish two, Father and Son, understanding the Son to be flesh, that is man, that is Jesus; and the Father to be spirit, that is God, that is Christ. Thus they, while contending that the Father and the Son are one and the same, do in fact begin by dividing them rather than uniting them. For if Jesus is one, and Christ is another, then the Son will be different from the Father, because the Son is Jesus, and the Father is Christ. Such a monarchy as this they learnt, I suppose, in the school of Valentinus, making two-Jesus and Christ. But this conception of theirs has been, in fact, already confuted in what we have previously advanced, because the Word of God or the Spirit of God is also called the power of the Highest, whom they make the Father; whereas these relations[fn-108-P10842_3040974:384-nf] are not themselves the same as He whose relations they are said to be, but they proceed from Him and appertain to Him. However, another refutation awaits them on this point of their heresy. See, say they, it was announced by the angel: \"Therefore that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10843_3041312:385-nf] Therefore, (they argue, ) as it was the flesh that was born, it must be the flesh that is the Son of God. Nay, (I answer, ) this is spoken concerning the Spirit of God. For it was certainly of the Holy Spirit that the virgin conceived; and that which He conceived, she brought forth. That, therefore, had to be born which was conceived and was to be brought forth; that is to say, the Spirit, whose \"name should be called Emmanuel which, being interpreted, is, God with us.\"[fn-108-P10844_3041806:386-nf] Besides, the flesh is not God, so that it could not have been said concerning it, \"That Holy Thing shall be called the Son of God,\" but only that Divine Being who was born in the flesh, of whom the psalm also says, \"Since God became man in the midst of it, and established it by the will of the Father.\"[fn-108-P10845_3042130:387-nf] Now what Divine Person was born in it? The Word, and the Spirit which became incarnate with the Word by the will of the Father. The Word, therefore, is incarnate; and this must be the point of our inquiry: How the Word became flesh,-whether it was by having been transfigured, as it were, in the flesh, or by having really clothed Himself in flesh. Certainly it was by a real clothing of Himself in flesh. For the rest, we must needs believe God to be unchangeable, and incapable of form, as being eternal. But transfiguration is the destruction of that which previously existed. For whatsoever is transfigured into some other thing ceases to be that which it had been, and begins to be that which it previously was not. God, however, neither ceases to be what He was, nor can He be any other thing than what He is. The Word is God, and \"the Word of the Lord remaineth for ever,\"-even by holding on unchangeably in His own proper form. Now, if He admits not of being transfigured, it must follow that He be understood in this sense to have become flesh, when He comes to be in the flesh, and is manifested, and is seen, and is handled by means of the flesh; since all the other points likewise require to be thus understood. For if the Word became flesh by a transfiguration and change of substance, it follows at once that Jesus must be a substance compounded of[fn-108-P10846_3043533:388-nf] two substances-of flesh and spirit,-a kind of mixture, like electrum, composed of gold and silver; and it begins to be neither gold (that is to say, spirit) nor silver (that is to say, flesh),-the one being changed by the other, and a third substance produced. Jesus, therefore, cannot at this rate be God for He has ceased to be the Word, which was made flesh; nor can He be Man incarnate for He is not properly flesh, and it was flesh which the Word became. Being compounded, therefore, of both, He actually is neither; He is rather some third substance, very different from either. But the truth is, we find that He is expressly set forth as both God and Man; the very psalm which we have quoted intimating (of the flesh), that \"God became Man in the midst of it, He therefore established it by the will of the Father,\"-certainly in all respects as the Son of God and the Son of Man, being God and Man, differing no doubt according to each substance in its own especial property, inasmuch as the Word is nothing else but God, and the flesh nothing else but Man. Thus does the apostle also teach respecting His two substances, saying, \"who was made of the seed of David; \"[fn-108-P10847_3044719:389-nf] in which words He will be Man and Son of Man. \"Who was declared to be the Son of God, according to the Spirit; \"[fn-108-P10848_3044850:390-nf] in which words He will be God, and the Word-the Son of God. We see plainly the twofold state, which is not confounded, but conjoined in One Person-Jesus, God and Man. Concerning Christ, indeed, I defer what I have to say.[fn-108-P10849_3045087:391-nf] (I remark here), that the property of each nature is so wholly preserved, that the Spirit[fn-108-P10850_3045202:392-nf] on the one hand did all things in Jesus suitable to Itself, such as miracles, and mighty deeds, and wonders; and the Flesh, on the other hand, exhibited the affections which belong to it. It was hungry under the devil's temptation, thirsty with the Samaritan woman, wept over Lazarus, was troubled even unto death, and at last actually died. If, however, it was only a tertium quid, some composite essence formed out of the Two substances, like the electrum (which we have mentioned), there would be no distinct proofs apparent of either nature. But by a transfer of functions, the Spirit would have done things to be done by the Flesh, and the Flesh such as are effected by the Spirit; or else such things as are suited neither to the Flesh nor to the Spirit, but confusedly of some third character. Nay more, on this supposition, either the Word underwent death, or the flesh did not die, if so be the Word was converted into flesh; because either the flesh was immortal, or the Word was modal. Forasmuch, however, as the two substances acted distinctly, each in its own character, there necessarily accrued to them severally their own operations, and their own issues. Learn then, together with Nicodemus, that \"that which is born in the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.\"[fn-108-P10851_3046545:393-nf] Neither the flesh becomes Spirit, nor the Spirit flesh. In one Person they no doubt are well able to be co-existent. Of them Jesus consists-Man. of the flesh; of the Spirit, God-and the angel designated Him as \"the Son of God,\"[fn-108-P10852_3046793:394-nf] in respect of that nature, in which He was Spirit, reserving for the flesh the appellation \"Son of Man.\" In like manner, again, the apostle calls Him \"the Mediator between God and Men,\"[fn-108-P10853_3046998:395-nf] and so affirmed His participation of both substances. Now, to end the matter, will you, who interpret the Son of God to be flesh, be so good as as to show us what the Son of Man is? Will He then, I want to know, be the Spirit? But you insist upon it that the Father Himself is the Spirit, on the ground that \"God is a Spirit,\" just as if we did not read also that there is \"the Spirit of God; \"in the same manner as we find that as \"the Word was God,\" so also there is \"the Word of God.\"","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_41_treatise_on_rebuke_and_grace","source_chapter":46,"source_paragraph":"144","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"And what is written, that \"He wills all men' to be saved,\"[fn-66-P6606_2521126:154-nf] while yet all men are not saved, may be understood in many ways, some of which I have mentioned in other writings[fn-66-P6607_2521261:155-nf] of mine; but here I will say one thing: \"He wills all men to be saved,\" is so said that all the predestinated may be understood by it, because every kind of men is among them.

Whence it follows that you ought to know what is being done in things sacred in the church of Rome, in order that, by following her example, ye may be found to be true children of her who is called your mother. Accordingly, as we have received the institution from our fathers, we maintain seven deacons in the city of Rome distributed over seven districts of the state, who attend to the services enjoined on them week by week, and on the Lord's days and the solemn festivals, in concert with the subdeacons, and acolytes, and servants of the succeeding orders, and hold themselves in readiness every hour for religious duty, and for the discharge of all that is enjoined upon them. In like manner ought ye also to do throughout your different cities, as may be convenient, that religious duty may be discharged zealously and regularly, without any delay or negligence. Furthermore, we have ordained in like manner seven subdeacons who shall stand by (imminerent) the seven notaries, and bring into one full and accurate account the histories of the martyrs, and lay them before us for our examination. And this, too, we urge you all to do, so that no doubt or questioning of these things may arise in later times; \"for whatsoever things were written, were written for our learning.\"[fn-91-P9195_2985560:1-nf] And whatsoever things are written in truth in our times, are directed to the learning of future times. And therefore we enjoin these duties to be put in charge of the most faithful, that nothing false may be found in them, from which an offence (which may God forbid) may arise to the faithful. For this reason also we beg it of your love in paternal benignity, that the holy Church may now find the good-will of your love in all things, and obtain the comforts of your favour whenever there is necessity. And as the goodness of your zeal affords us the assurance that we ought to distrust it in nothing, but rather commit these things in all confidence to you as to wise sons of our church; so, small importance being attached to opportune occasions, your virtue ought to exert itself the more strenuously in labours, and keep off reproaches by all possible means, and with all zeal. We exhort you also, according to the word of the apostle, to be \"stedfast and immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not vain in the Lord.\"[fn-91-P9196_2986656:2-nf] And in another place: \"Watch ye, and pray, and stand fast in the faith. Quit you like men, and be strong. Let all things be done with charity.\"[fn-91-P9197_2986818:3-nf] Furthermore, we desire you to know this, that in our times, as our sins embarrassed us, and that ancient enemy who always goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour,[fn-91-P9198_2987024:4-nf] instigated him, Novatus came up out of Africa, and separated Novatianus and certain other confessors of Christ from the Church of Christ, and persuaded them into the acceptance of evil doctrine. From such persons, brethren, keep yourselves aloof, and beware of all who hold a faith and doctrine different from that which the apostles and their successors have held and taught, lest (which may God forbid) going after him ye fall into the toils of Satan, and be bound with his fetters. Wherefore with most earnest prayers we beg it of your brotherly love, that ye may deem it fit to remember our insignificance in your holy prayers, beseeching and entreating the Lord of heaven that we, as well as our holy mother the Church of Christ, redeemed with His precious blood, may be delivered from the toils of Satan, who lieth in wait for us; and from troublesome and wicked men, and that the Word of God may have free course and be glorified, and that the evil doctrine of them, and of all who teach things contrary to the truth, may be overthrown and perish. We beseech you also to be zealous in praying in your pious supplications, that our God and Lord Jesus Christ, who will have all men to be saved, and no one to perish,[fn-91-P9199_2988263:5-nf] may, by His vast omnipotence, cause their hearts to turn again to sound doctrine and to the Catholic faith, in order that they may be recovered from the toils of the devil who are held captive by him, and be united with the children of our mother the Church. Be mindful also of your brethren, and have pity upon them, and labour for them by all means in your power, that they be not lost, but be saved unto the Lord by your prayers, and other efforts of your goodness. So act therefore in these matters that ye may approve yourselves as obedient and faithful children of the holy Church of God, and that ye may obtain the recompense of reward. These men, and all else who do not teach the true doctrine, and hold not the true faith, cannot act as accusers of any true believer, because they are branded with infamy, and are cut off from the bosom of our holy mother the Church by the sword of the apostles, until their return to correct conversation and belief. Hence by apostolic authority, and in agreement with all the sons of the same apostolic and universal Church, we resolve that all who come under suspicion with respect to the Catholic faith cannot be admitted as accusers of those who hold the true creed; for suspicions are always to be set aside. Rightly therefore are charges which are preferred by those who are objects of suspicion in the matter of the true faith, rejected. Neither are they at all to be credited who are unacquainted with the faith of the Trinity. In like manner we set aside and withdraw from all part in the accusing of the faithful, all those whom the decrees of the holy fathers in times past and times future alike anathematize. Accordingly, the believing ought always to be kept distinct from the unbelieving, and the righteous from the unrighteous; since the unbelieving and evil-minded, by every means in their power, are always troubling the believing, and striving to undo them; and consequently they are not to be received, but rejected and kept entirely at a distance, lest they may undo or defame the believing. For this reason, dearly beloved, beware of the pit of such persons, into which we know many have fallen. Beware of the snares (or darts) of such persons, and of the efforts of the ancient enemy, by which we have seen even those closely connected with us fall wounded before us. Watch the nooses of the liers in wait, by which they are wont to strangle associates and comrades. Follow not such, but keep them far off from you. Be ye, according to the voice of Truth, wise as serpents and harmless as doves.[fn-92-P9200_2990844:6-nf] See to it that ye neither run nor labour in vain; but, sustained by each other's prayers and supplications, strive ye to do the will of God; and from those persons whom I have mentioned, if they show themselves incorrigible, keep yourselves separate in all things. In like manner keep yourselves separate from all those of whom the apostle makes mention when he says, \"with such persons, no, not to eat; \"[fn-92-P9201_2991266:7-nf] since these latter, as well as the former, are to be rejected, and are not to be admitted before they have given satisfaction to the Church. For those with whom it is not lawful to eat are manifestly separated from all intercourse with the rest of the brethren until such satisfaction is given. Wherefore they ought not and cannot be admitted to the preferring of charges against the faithful, but they ought to be debarred from their society until the satisfaction already mentioned is given, lest these too should be made like them, or underlie their excommunication; for to this effect have the apostles decreed, saying, With the excommunicated no fellowship is to be held. And if any one, setting aside the rules wittingly, sings with the excommunicated in his house, or speaks or prays in company with them, that man is to be deprived of the privilege of communion. Such persons, therefore, are in all things to be guarded against, and are not to be received, because, according to the apostle, not only those who commit such things are condemned, but also those who consent with those who do them.[fn-92-P9202_2992387:8-nf] Whence also the blessed chief of the apostles, Peter, addressing the people at the ordination of Clement, says this among other things:[fn-92-P9203_2992538:9-nf] If this Clement is hostile to any one on account of his deeds, wait not ye for his saying directly to you, Be not on terms of friendship with this man. But mark ye carefully his will as ye ought, and second it without need of direct injunction; and separate yourselves from that man to whom ye perceive him to be inimical, and speak not with those with whom he speaks not, in order that every one who may be in fault, as he desires to possess the friendship of all of you, may be zealous in effecting a reconciliation all the more quickly with him who presides over all, so that be may return to spiritual well-being (redeat et salutem) hereby, when he begins to yield obedience to the charges of the president.","title":"The First Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_129_tractate_cxxiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"5. I shall therefore, in the manifested mercy of Him whose justice is hidden, set about the discussion, in order to the solution of a question of such importance, in accordance with the strength which He may graciously bestow: for hitherto it has only been proposed, not expounded. Let this, then, be the commencement of its exposition, namely, that we bear in mind that in this corruptible body, which burdens the soul,[fn-39-P3906_2156569:8-nf] we live a miserable life. But we who are now redeemed by the Mediator, and have received the earnest of the Holy Spirit, have a blessed life in prospect, although we possess it not as yet in reality. But a hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.[fn-39-P3907_2156945:9-nf] And it is in the evils that every one suffers, not in the good things that he enjoys, that he has need of patience. The present life, therefore, whereof it is written, \"Is not the life of man a term of trial upon earth?\"[fn-39-P3908_2157189:10-nf] in which we are daily crying to the Lord, \"Deliver us from evil,\"[fn-39-P3909_2157272:11-nf] a man is compelled to endure, even when his sins are forgiven him, although it was the first sin that caused his falling into such misery. For the penalty is more protracted than the fault; test the fault should be accounted small, were the penalty to end with itself. On this account it is also, either for the demonstration of our debt of misery, or for the amendment of our passing life, or for the exercise of the necessary patience, that man is kept through time in the penalty, even when he is no longer held by his sin as liable to everlasting damnation. This is the truly lamentable but unblameable condition of the present evil days we pass in this mortal state, even while in it we look with loving eyes to the days that are good. For it comes from the righteous anger of God, whereof the Scriptures say, \"Man, that is born of woman, is of few days and full of anger:\"[fn-39-P3910_2158170:12-nf] for the anger of God is not like that of man, the disturbance of an excited man, but the calm fixing of righteous punishment. In this anger of His, God restraineth not, as it is written, His tender mercies;[fn-39-P3911_2158394:13-nf] but, besides other consolations to the miserable, which He ceaseth not to bestow on mankind, in the fullness of time, when He knew that such had to be done, He sent His only-begotten Son,[fn-39-P3912_2158602:14-nf] by whom He created all things, that He might become man while remaining God, and so be the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus:[fn-39-P3913_2158762:15-nf] that those who believe in Him, being absolved by the layer of regeneration from the guilt of all their sins,-to wit, both of the original sin they have inherited by generation, and to meet which, in particular, regeneration was instituted, and of all others contracted by evil conduct,-might be delivered from perpetual condemnation, and live in faith and hope and love while sojourning in this world, and be walking onward to His visible presence amid its toilsome and perilous temptations on the one hand, but the consolations of God, bothbodily and spiritual, on the other, ever keeping to the way which Christ has become to them. And because, even while walking in Him, they are not exempt from sins, which creep in through the infirmities of this life, He has given them the salutary remedies of alms whereby their prayers might be aided when He taught them to say, \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.\"[fn-39-P3914_2159709:16-nf] So does the Church act in blessed hope through this troublous life; and this Church symbolized in its generality, was personified in the Apostle Peter, on account of the primacy of his apostleship. For, as regards his proper personality, he was by nature one man, by grace one Christian, by still more abounding grace one, and yet also, the first apostle; but when it was said to him, \"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven,\" he represented the universal Church, which in this world is shaken by divers temptations, that come upon it like torrents of rain, floods and tempests, and falleth not, because it is founded upon a rock (petra), from which Peter received his name. For petra (rock) is not derived from Peter, but Peter from petra; just as Christ is not called so from the Christian, but the Christian from Christ. For on this very account the Lord said, \"On this rock will I build my Church,\" because Peter had said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"[fn-39-P3915_2160858:17-nf] On this rock, therefore, He said, which thou hast confessed. I will build my Church. For the Rock (Petra) was Christ;[fn-39-P3916_2160999:18-nf] and on this foundation was Peter himself also built. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus.[fn-39-P3917_2161148:19-nf] The Church, therefore, which is rounded in Christ received from Him the keys of the kingdom of heaven in the person of Peter, that is to say, the power of binding and loosing sins. For what the Church is essentially in Christ, such representatively is Peter in the rock (petra); and in this representation Christ is to be understood as the Rock, Peter as the Church. This Church, accordingly, which Peter represented, so long as it lives amidst evil, by loving and following Christ is delivered from evil. But its following is the closer in those who contend even unto death for the truth. But to the universality[fn-39-P3918_2161783:20-nf] [of the Church] is it said, \"Follow me,\" even as it was for the same universality that Christ suffered: of whom this same Peter saith, \"Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His footsteps.\"[fn-39-P3919_2162023:21-nf] This, then, you see is why it was said to him, \"Follow me.\" But there is another, an immortal life, that is not in the midst of evil: there we shall see face to face what is seen here through a glass and in a riddle,[fn-39-P3920_2162260:22-nf] even when much progress is made in the beholding of the truth. There are two states of life, therefore, preached and commended to herself from heaven, that are known to the Church, whereof the one is in faith, the other in sight; one in the temporal sojourn in a foreign land, the other in the eternity of the [heavenly] abode; one in labor, the other in repose; one on the way, the other in the fatherland; one in active work, the other in the wages of contemplation; one declines from evil and makes for good, the other has no evil to decline from, and has great good to enjoy; the one fights with a foe, the other reigns without a foe; the one is brave in the midst of adversities, the other has no experience of adversity; the one is bridling its carnal lusts, the other has full scope for spiritual delights; the one is anxious with the care of conquering, the other secure in the peace of victory; the one is helped in temptations, the other, free from all temptations, rejoices in the Helper Himself; the one is occupied in relieving the indigent, the other is there, where no indigence is found; the one pardons the sins of others, that its own may be pardoned to itself, the other neither has anything to pardon nor does aught for which pardon has to be asked; the one is scourged with evils that it may not be elated with good things, the other is free from all evil by such a fullness of grace that, without any temptation to pride, it may cleave to that which is supremely good; the one discerneth both good and evil, the other has only that which is good presented to view: therefore the one is good, but miserable as yet; the other, better and blessed. This one was signified by the Apostle Peter, that other by John. The whole of the one is passed here to the end of this world, and there finds its termination, the other is deferred for its completion till after the end of this world, but has no end in the world to come. Hence it is said to the latter, \"Follow me;\" but of the former, \"Thus I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee follow thou me.\" For what means this last? So far as my wisdom goes, so far as I comprehend, what is it but this, Follow thou me by imitating me in the endurance of temporal evils; let him remain till I come to restore everlasting good? And this may be expressed more clearly in this way: Let perfected action, informed by the example of my passion, follow me; but let contemplation only begun remain [so] till I come, to be perfected when I come. For the godly plenitude of patience, reaching forward even unto death, followeth Christ; but the fullness of knowledge tarrieth till Christ come, to be manifested then. For here the evils of this world are endured in the land of the dying, while there shall be seen the good things of the Lord in the land of the living. For in saying, \"I wish him to tarry till I come,\" we are not to understand Him as meaning to remain on, or abide permanently, but to wait; seeing that what is signified by him shall certainly not be fulfilled now, but when Christ is come. But what is signified by him to whom it was said, \"Follow thou me,\" unless it be done now, will never attain to the expected end. And in this life of activity. the more we love Christ the more easily are we delivered from evil. But He loveth us less as we now are, and therefore delivers from it, that we may not be always such as we are. There, however, He loveth us more; for we shall not have aught about us to displease Him, or aught that He will have to separate us from: nor is it for aught else that He loveth us here but that He may heal and translate us from everything He loveth not. Here, therefore, the loveth us] less, where He would not have us remain; there in larger measure, whither He would have us to be passing, and out of that wherein He would not that we should perish. Let Peter therefore love Him, that we may obtain deliverance from our present mortality; let John be loved by Him, that we may be preserved in the immortality to come.","title":"Tractate CXXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_123_letter_cxxiv_to_the_monks_of_palestine_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Although therefore from that beginning whereby in the Virgin's womb \"the Word became flesh,\" no sort of division ever arose between the Divine and the human substance, and through all the growth and changes of His body, the actions were of one Person the whole time, yet we do not by any mixing of them up confound those very acts which were done inseparably: and from the character of the acts we perceive what belonged to either form. For neither do His Divine acts affect[fn-22-P2203_527076:24-nf] His human, nor His human acts His Divine, since both concur in this way and to this very end that in their operation His twofold qualities be not absorbed the one by the other, nor His individuality doubled. Therefore let those Christian phantom-mongers[fn-22-P2204_527387:25-nf] tell us, what nature of the Saviour's it was that was fastened to the wood of the Cross, that lay in the tomb, and that on the third day rose in the flesh when the stone was rolled away from the grave: or what kind of body Jesus presented to His disciples' eyes entering when the doors were shut upon them: seeing that to drive away the beholders' disbelief, He required them to inspect with their eyes and to handle with their hands the still open prints of the nails and the flesh wound of His pierced side.

You have intimated, besides, that very many notice that not a few in places of ecclesiastical dignity do not live in a manner conformable to the discourses and sacraments with which the people are served by their means. O miserable men, who in looking at these forget Christ, who long since indeed told us how that the law of God should be obeyed, rather than that those should be looked to for imitation who do not the things which they say; and bearing with the traitor himself even to the end, He sent him also along with the rest to preach the Gospel. For the apostles had no such custom, neither did they teach that it was one fit to be had. And to like effect their successors also, foreseeing by the Spirit of God things to come, have determined largely on such subject. Besides, as you read in the Acts of the Apostles, \"There was at that time among them that believed one heart and one soul; neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.\"[fn-92-P9228_3002494:2-nf] For there was no laying of accusations against each other among them, except what was friendly; neither ought there ever to be such among their followers or among believers: for the Lord says, \"Do not that to another which thou wouldst not have done to thyself.\"[fn-92-P9229_3002773:3-nf] And He says also, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; \"[fn-92-P9230_3002863:4-nf] and,\" Love worketh no ill to his neighbour.\"[fn-92-P9231_3002941:5-nf] In accordance herewith, the apostles themselves and their successors decreed of old time that those persons should not be admitted to lay accusations who were under suspicion, or who but yesterday, or the day before, or a little time ago, were at enmity, as they come thus under suspicion, Or who are not of good conversation, or whose life is reprehensible, or who are doubtful in the matter of the true faith. In like manner is it decided to be with those whose faith and life and liberty are unknown, or who are marked with the stains of infamy, or entangled in the snares of offences. Again, those have neither the right nor the power to accuse the priests or the clergy, who are incapable themselves of being made priests legitimately, and are not of their order; for just as the, priests and the other members of the clerical order are debarred from laying accusations against the secular laity, so these latter, too, should be debarred and excluded from the right of bringing charges against the former. And as the former should not be admired by the latter, so the latter should not be; admired by the former: for as the conversation of the priests of the Lord ought to be something separate from the conversation of these others, so should they be separate from them also in the matter of litigation; \"for the servant of the Lord ought not to strive.\"[fn-92-P9232_3004321:6-nf] To the utmost of your power, dearly beloved brethren, do ye prohibit such accusations, and all unrighteous and injurious emulations, because contention is to be avoided by all means. \"For a just man will fall seven times in a day, and will rise again; but the wicked shall fall into mischief. Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,\" saith Solomon, \"and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth; lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him, and He turn away His wrath from him. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious at the wicked: for the evil have not the hope of the future, and the candle of the wicked shall be put out. Envy not evil men neither be thou desirous to be with them; for their mind meditates rapine, and their lips speak deceits.\"[fn-92-P9233_3005115:7-nf] Dearly beloved, beware of these things. Ponder these things, and minister comfort to the brethren in all things; for, as the Truth says in His own person, \"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\"[fn-92-P9234_3005381:8-nf] For if in things secular each man's right and his proper position are kept for him, how much more ought there to be no confusion induced in matters of ecclesiastical order! And this is a right which will be duly observed if no deference is paid to mere power, but all to equity. Whence it is an established duty, that the bishops of each several district should exercise a watchful care over all those who live under their rule, and in the fear of God should dispose of all cases in which they are concerned, and of all matters in which they are interested. It is therefore extremely inequitable that any bishops should neglect their own cases, and mix themselves up with those of others. But those whose part it is to ordain such persons to the priesthood, and by whom they have been already ordained, ought to order the life and judgment of such by the exercise of a competent and regular administration; for, as the law says, \"Cursed is every one that removeth his neighbour's landmarks. And all the people said Amen.\"[fn-92-P9235_3006421:9-nf] To this therefore, brethren, has God foreordained you, and all who hold the highest office of the priesthood, that ye should put all injustice out of the way, and cut off presumption, and help those who labour in the priesthood, and give no occasion for their reproach and trouble, but bring assistance to him who endures calumny and reproach, and cut off him who works calumny and reproach, and act for the help of the Lord in His priests. The Lord, moreover, has chosen the priests for Himself, that they should sacrifice to Him, and offer oblations to their Lord. He commanded the Levites also to be under them in their ministries. Whence He speaks to Moses in these terms: \"And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.\"[fn-92-P9236_3007277:10-nf] For of these the Lord spake to Moses in this wise: \"Take the Levites instead of the first-horn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the Lord.\"[fn-92-P9237_3007523:11-nf] If the Lord willed the Levites to be His own, how much more has He taken the priests for Himself! And of these He says: \"If any stranger cometh nigh, he shall be put to death.\"[fn-92-P9238_3007719:12-nf] All objects, moreover, that are the Lord's are to be handled carefully, and are not lightly to be injured; for even among men, those are reckoned faithful who attend to the interests of their masters rightly, and deal with them faithfully, and rightly observe the commands of their masters, and transgress them not.And those, on the other hand, are reputed unfaithful who deal with the interests of their masters carelessly and negligently, and despise their commands, and do not observe them as they ought.","title":"The Second Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":2,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_39_oration_xviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"14.

Although, however, I must hasten to other matters, I do not think that I must pass over this point, that in the Gospel the Lord declared, by way of signifying His majesty, saying, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will build it up again.\"[fn-103-P10320_3237144:166-nf] Or when, in another passage, and on another subject, He declares, \"I have power to lay down my life, and again to take it up; for this commandment I have received of my Father.\"[fn-103-P10321_3237343:167-nf] Now who is it who says that He can lay down His life, or can Himself recover His life again, because He has received it of His Father?

And if by the apostle Christ is called \"the first-born of every creature,\"[fn-103-P10328_3238789:174-nf] how could He be the first-born of every creature, unless because according to His divinity the Word proceeded from the Father before every creature? And unless the heretics receive it thus, they will be constrained to show that Christ the man was the first-born of every creature; which they will not be able to do. Either, therefore, He is before every creature, that He may be the first-born of every creature, and He is not man only, because man is after every creature; or He is man only, and He is after every creature. And how is He the first-born of every creature, except because being that Word which is before every creature; and therefore, the first-born of every creature, He becomes flesh and dwells in us, that is, assumes that man's nature which is after every creature, and so dwells with him and in him, in us, that neither is humanity taken away from Christ, nor His divinity denied? For if He is only before every creature, humanity is taken away from Him; but if He is only man, the divinity which is before every creature is interfered with. Both of these, therefore, are leagued together in Christ, and both are conjoined, and both are linked with one another. And rightly, as there is in Him something which excels the creature, the agreement of the divinity and the humanity seems to be pledged in Him: for which reason He who is declared as made the \"Mediator between God and man\"[fn-103-P10329_3240515:175-nf] is revealed to have associated in Himself God and man. And if the same apostle says of Christ, that \"having put off the flesh, He spoiled powers, they being openly triumphed over in Himself,\"[fn-103-P10330_3240729:176-nf] he certainly did not without a meaning propound that the flesh was put off, unless because he wished it to be understood that it was again put on also at the resurrection. Who, therefore, is He that thus put off and put on the flesh? Let the heretics seek out. For we know that the Word of God was invested with the substance of flesh, and that He again was divested of the same bodily material, which again He took up in the resurrection and resumed as a garment. And yet Christ could neither have been divested of nor invested with manhood, had He been only man: for man is never either deprived of nor invested with himself. For that must be something else, whatever it may be, which by any other is either taken away or put on. Whence, reasonably, it was the Word of God who put off the flesh, and again in the resurrection put it on, since He put it off because at His birth He had been invested with it. Therefore in Christ it is God who is invested, and moreover must be divested, because He who is invested must also likewise be He who is divested; whereas, as man, He is invested with and divested of, as it were, a certain tunic of the compacted body.[fn-103-P10331_3241913:177-nf] And therefore by consequence He was, as we have said, the Word of God, who is revealed to be at one time invested, at another time divested of the flesh. For this, moreover, He before predicted in blessings: \"He shall wash His garment in wine, and His clothing in the blood of the grape.\"[fn-103-P10332_3242355:178-nf] If the garment in Christ be the flesh, and the clothing itself be the body, let it be asked who is He whose body is clothing, and garment flesh? For to us it is evident that the flesh is the garment, and the body the clothing of the Word; and He washed His bodily substance, and purified the material of the flesh in blood, that is, in wine, by His passion, in the human character that He had undertaken. Whence, if indeed He is washed, He is man, because the garment which is washed is the flesh; but He who washes is the Word of God, who, in order that He might wash the garment, was made the taker-up of the garment. Rightly, from that substance which is taken that it might be washed, He is revealed as a man, even as from the authority of the Word who washed it He is manifested to be God.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_54_book_iii_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"189","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The Instructor orders them to go forth \"in becoming apparel, and adorn themselves with shamefacedness and sobriety,\"[fn-44-P4498_1390467:116-nf] \"subject to their own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; while they behold,\" he says, \"your chaste conversation.

This then is the third cause of affliction; and the fourth is, that the saints might not be supposed to serve God from a hope of present prosperity. For many of those who live in debauchery, when blamed as they often are by many, and invited to the labours of virtue; and when they hear the saints commended for their cheerfulness under great hardships,[fn-16-P1602_1279060:36-nf] attack their character on this ground; and not men only, but the devil himself hath taken up this suspicion. For when Job was surrounded with great wealth, and enjoyed much opulence, that wicked demon,[fn-16-P1603_1279349:37-nf] being reproached by God on his account, and having nothing to say; when he could neither answer the accusations against himself, nor impugn the virtue of this just man; took refuge at once in this defence, speaking thus, \"Doth Job fear thee for nought? Hast thou not made an hedge about him on all sides.\"[fn-16-P1604_1279875:38-nf] \"For reward then,\" saith he, \"that man is virtuous, enjoying thereby so much opulence.\" What then did God? Being desirous to show, that it was not for reward that his saints serve Him, He stripped him of all his opulence; gave him over to poverty; and permitted him to fall into grievous disease. Afterwards reproving him,[fn-16-P1605_1280235:39-nf] that he had suspected thus without cause, He saith, \"He let holdeth fast his integrity; to no purpose didst thou move me to destroy his substance.\" For it is a sufficient reward, and compensation to the saints, that they are serving God; since this indeed to the lover is reward enough, to love the object of his love;[fn-16-P1606_1280623:40-nf] and he seeks nothing besides, nor accounts anything greater than this. And if such be the case with regard to a man, much more in relation to God; which therefore that God might demonstrate, He gave more than the devil asked; for the latter said, \"Put forth thine hand, and touch him;\"[fn-16-P1607_1281102:41-nf] but God said not thus, but, \"I deliver him unto thee.\" For just as in the contests[fn-16-P1608_1281206:42-nf] of the outer world, the combatants that are vigorous, and in high condition of body,[fn-16-P1609_1281508:43-nf] are not so well discerned, when they are enwrapt all around with the garment soaked in oil; but when casting this aside, they are brought forward unclothed into the arena; then above all they strike the spectators on every side with astonishment at the proportion of their limbs, there being no longer anything to conceal them; so also was it with Job. When he was enveloped in all that wealth, it was not visible to the many, what a man he was. But when, like the wrestler, that strips off his garment, he threw it aside, and came naked to the conflicts of piety, thus unclothed, he astonished all who saw him;[fn-16-P1610_1282141:44-nf] so that the very theatre of angels shouted at beholding his fortitude of soul, and applauded him as he won his crown! For, as I have already observed, he was not so well seen of men, when clad in all that wealth, as when, casting it away like a garment, he exhibited himself naked as it were in a theatre, in the midst of the world, and all admired his vigor of soul, evidenced as this was not only by his being stripped of all things, but by the conflict, and by his patience in respect of his infirmity. And as I said before, God Himself did not smite him; in order that the devil might not again say, \"Thou hast spared him, and hast not inflicted so great a trial as was necessary:\" but he gave to the adversary the destruction of his cattle, and power over his flesh. \"I am sure,\" saith He, \"of this wrestler; therefore I do not forbid thee to impose on him whatever struggles thou desirest.\" But as those who are well skilled in the sports of the palaestra, and have reason to rely on their art and bodily strength, often do not seize their antagonists upright, nor take an equal advantage, but suffer them to take them by the middle,[fn-16-P1611_1283421:45-nf] that they may make a more splendid conquest; so also God gave to the devil to take this saint by the waist, that when he had overcome, after an attack so greatly to his disadvantage, and stretched his adversary on the ground, his crown might be so much the more glorious!","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_55_homily_xlix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But not these only, but not even painting, or embroidery, would I for one allow to be an art, for they do but throw men into useless expense.

And that we ought earnestly to seek after this condition the formula of the Lord's prayer teaches us, saying \"Our Father.\" When then we confess with our own mouths that the God and Lord of the universe is our Father, we profess forthwith that we have been called from our condition as slaves to the adoption of sons, adding next \"Which art in heaven,\" that, by shunning with the utmost horror all lingering in this present life, which we pass upon this earth as a pilgrimage, and what separates us by a great distance from our Father, we may the rather hasten with all eagerness to that country where we confess that our Father dwells, and may not allow anything of this kind, which would make us unworthy of this our profession and the dignity of an adoption of this kind, and so deprive us as a disgrace to our Father's inheritance, and make us incur the wrath of His justice and severity.

For it is utterly wrong and unjustifiable if, after the vanity of the world and all that is in it has been renounced, whatever miserable furniture remains is more regarded than what is most valuable; viz., the love of a brother. The second is for each man so to prune his own wishes that he may not imagine himself to be a wise and experienced person, and so prefer his own opinions to those of his neigh-bout. The third is for him to recognize that everything, even what he deems useful ant necessary, must come after the blessing of love and peace. The fourth for him to realize that he should never be angry for any reason good or bad. The fifth for him to try to cure any wrath which a brother may have conceived against him however unreasonably, in the same way that he would cure his own, knowing that the vexation of another is equally bad for him, as if he himself were stirred against another, unless he removes it, to the best of his ability, from his brother's mind. The last is what is undoubtedly generally decisive in regard to all faults; viz., that he should realize daily that he is to pass away from this world; as the realization of this not only permits no vexation to linger in the heart, but also represses all the motionsof lusts and sins of all kinds. Whoever then has got hold of this, can neither suffer nor be the cause of bitter wrath and discord. But when this fails, as soon as he who is jealous of love has little by little infused the poison of vexation in the hearts of friends, it is certain that owing to frequent quarrels love will gradually grow cool, and at sometime or other he will part the hearts of the lovers, that have been for a long while exasperated. For if one is walking along the course previously marked out, how can he ever differ from his friend, for if he claims nothing for himself, he entirely cuts off the first cause of quarrel (which generally springs from trivial things and most unimportant matters), as he observes to the best of his power what we read in the Acts of the Apostles on the unity of believers: \"But the multitude of believers was of one heart and soul; neither did any of them say that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common.\"[fn-56-P5692_2029638:6-nf] Then how can any seeds of discussion arise from him who serves not his own but his brother's will, and becomes a follower of his Lord and Master, who speaking in the character[fn-56-P5693_2029830:7-nf] of man which He had taken, said: \"I am not come to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me?\"[fn-56-P5694_2029973:8-nf] But how can he arouse any incitement to contention, who has determined to trust not so much to his own judgment as to his brother's decision, on his own intelligence and meaning, in accordance with his will either approving or disapproving his discoveries, and fulfilling in the humility of a pious heart these words from the Gospel: \"Nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-56-P5695_2030375:9-nf] Or in what way will he admit anything which grieves the brother, who thinks that nothing is more precious than the blessing of peace, and never forgets these words of the Lord: \"By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, that ye love one another;\"[fn-56-P5696_2030656:10-nf] for by this, as by a special mark, Christ willed that the flock of His sheep should be known in this world, and be separated from all others by this stamp, so to speak? But on what grounds will he endure either to admit the rancour of vexation in himself or for it to remain in another, if his firm decision is that there cannot be any good ground for anger, as it is dangerous and wrong, and that when his broker is angry with him he cannot pray, in just the same way as when he himself is angry with his brother, as he ever keeps in an humble heart these words of our Lord and Saviour: \"If thou bring thy gift to the altar and there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift at the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.\"[fn-56-P5697_2031487:11-nf] For it will be of no use for you to declare that you are not angry, and to believe that you are fulfilling the command which says: \"Let not the sun go down upon thy wrath;\" and: \"Whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment,\"[fn-56-P5698_2031765:12-nf] if you are with obstinate heart disregarding the vexation of another which you could smooth down by kindness on your part. For in the same way you will be punished for violating the Lord's command. For He who said that you should not be angry with another, said also that you should not disregard the vexations of another, for it makes no difference in the sight of God, \"Who willeth all men to be saved,\"[fn-56-P5699_2032205:13-nf] whether you destroy yourself or someone else. Since the death of any one is equally a loss to God, and at the same time it is equally a gain to him to whom all destruction is delightful, whether it is acquired by your death or by the death of your brother.

From this bondage, then, we are set free by the Lord alone. He who had it not, Himself delivers us from it; for He alone came without sin in the flesh. For the little ones whom you see carried in their mothers' hands cannot yet walk, and are already in fetters; for they have received from Adam what they are loosened from by Christ. To them also, when baptized, pertains that grace which is promised by the Lord; for He only can deliver from sin who came without sin, and was made a sacrifice for sin. For you heard when the apostle was read: \"We are ambassadors,\" he says, \"for Christ, as though God were exhorting you by us; we beseech you in Christ's stead,\"-that is, as if Christ were beseeching you, and for what? -\"to be reconciled unto God.\" If the apostle exhorts and beseeches us to be reconciled unto God, then were we enemies to God. For no one is reconciled unless from a state of enmity. And we have become enemies not by nature, but by sin. From the same source are we the servants of sin, that we are the enemies of God. God has no enemies in a state of freedom. They must be slaves; and slaves will they remain unless delivered by Him to whom they wished by their sins to be enemies. Therefore, says be, \"We beseech you in Christ's stead to be reconciled unto God.\" But how are we reconciled, save by the removal of that which separates between us and Himself? For He says by the prophet, \"He hath not made the ear heavy that it should not hear; but your iniquities have separated between you and your God.\"[fn-17-P1739_1105187:11-nf] And so, then, we are not reconciled, unless that which is in the midst is taken away, and something else is put in its place. For there is a separating medium, and, on the other hand, there is a reconciling Mediator. The separating medium is sin, the reconciling Mediator is the Lord Jesus Christ: \"For there is one God and Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.\"[fn-17-P1740_1105585:12-nf] To take then away the separating wall, which is sin, that Mediator has come, and the priest has Himself become the sacrifice. And because He was made a sacrifice for sin, offering Himself as a whole burnt-offering on the cross of His passion, the apostle, after saying, \"We beseech you in Christ's stead to be reconciled unto God,\"-as if we had said, How shall we be able to be reconciled?-goes on to say, \"He hath made Him,\" that is, Christ Himself, \"who knew no sin, [to be] sin for us, that we may be the righteousness of God in Him,\"[fn-17-P1741_1106143:13-nf] \"Him,\" he says, Christ Himself our God, \"who knew no sin.\" For He came in the flesh, that is, in the likeness of sinful flesh,[fn-17-P1742_1106294:14-nf] but not in Sinful flesh, because He had no sin at all; and therefore became a true sacrifice for sin, because He Himself had no sin.","title":"Tractate XLI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_79_sermon_lxii_xcii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1.

And captives indeed have no further foe after they are led away, but they even experience great care from those who have taken them.

For if all the righteous are not to enjoy the same lot, if they exceed others even a little (\"for one star,\" it says, \"differeth from another star in glory,\") (1 Cor. xv. 41), how are sinners to be in the same lot with the righteous? Such a confusion as this even man would not make, much less God! But if ye will, I will show you that even in the case of sinners, arguing from existing facts, there is this distinction, and exact just judgment. Now consider; Adam sinned, and Eve sinned, and both transgressed, yet they were not equally sinful. And therefore neither were they equally punished. For the difference was so great that Paul said, \"Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.\"[fn-34-P3427_3121807:22-nf] And yet the deceit was one. But still God's searching examination pointed out a difference so great, as that Paul should make this assertion. Again, Cain was punished, but Lamech, who committed a murder after him, did not suffer near so great a punishment. And yet this was a murder, and that was a murder, and that so much the worse, because even by the example he had not become the better. But since the one neither killed his brother after exhortation, nor needed an accuser, nor shrunk from answering when God questioned him, but even without any accuser both pleaded again himself, and condemned himself more severely, he obtained pardon. But the other as having done the opposite was punished. See with what exactness God sifteth the facts. For this reason He punished those in the flood in one way, and those in Sodom in another; and the Israelites again, both those in Babylon, and those in Antiochus' time, in different ways: so showing that He keeps a strict account of our doings. And these were slaves for seventy years, and those for four hundred, but others again ate their children, and underwent countless other more grievous calamities, and even in this way were not freed, either they or those that were burnt alive in Sodom. \"For it shall be more tolerable,\" He says, \"for the land of Sodore and Gomorrha, than for that city.\" (Matt. x. 15.) For if He hath no care for us, either when we sin or when we do aright, perhaps there will be some reason in saying that there is no punishment. But since He is so exceedingly urgent about our not sinning, and adopts so many means to keep us in the right, it is very plain that He punisheth the wicked, and also crowneth those that do right. But let me beg you to consider the unfairness of the generality. For they find fault with God because He so often long-suffering, overlooks so many that are impious, impure, or violent, without now suffering punishment. Again, if He threaten to punish them in the other world, they are vehement and pressing in their accusations. And yet if this be painful, they ought to accept and admire the other. But alas the folly! the unreasonable and asinine spirit! alas the sin-loving[fn-34-P3428_3124161:23-nf] soul, that gazes after vice! For it is from this that all these opinions have their birth. And so if they who utter these things should be minded to lay hold upon virtue, they will presently find themselves satisfied concerning hell also, and will not doubt. And where (it is said) and in what place is this hell? For some fablers say that it is in the valley of Josaphat, thus drawing that which was said about a certain by-gone war, to apply to hell.[fn-34-P3429_3124688:24-nf] But the Scripture does not say this. But in what place, pray, will it be? Somewhere as I think at least quite out of the pale of this world. For as the prisons and mines are at a great distance from royal residences,[fn-34-P3430_3125049:25-nf] so will hell be somewhere out of this world. Seek we not then to know where it is, but how we may escape it. Neither yet because God doth not punish all here, therefore disbelieve things to come. For merciful and long-suffering He is: that is why he threatens, and does not east us into it forthwith. For \"I desire not,\" He says, \"the death of a sinner.\" (Ez. xviii. 32.) But if there is no death of a sinner, the words are but idle. And I know indeed that there is nothing less pleasant to you than these words. But to me nothing is pleasanter. And would it were possible at our dinner, and our supper, and our baths, and everywhere, to be discoursing about hell. For we should not then feel the pain at the evils in this world, nor the pleasure of its good things. For what would you tell me was an evil? poverty? disease? captivity? maiming of the body? Why all these things are sport compared to the punishment there, even should you speak of those who are tormented with famine all their life long; or those who are maimed from their earliest days, and beg, even this is luxury compared to those other evils. Let us then continually employ ourselves with talking about these things.[fn-34-P3431_3126269:26-nf] For to remember hell prevents our falling into hell. Dost thou not hear St. Paul saying, \"Who shall suffer everlasting punishment from the face of the Lord?\" (2 Thess. i. 9.) Dost thou not hear what Nero's character was, whom Paul even calls the Mystery of Antichrist? For \"the mystery of iniquity,\" he says, \"already worketh.\" (ib. ii. 7.) What then? Is Nero to suffer nothing? Is Antichrist to suffer nothing? or the Devil nothing? Then he will always be Antichrist, and so the Devil. For from mischief they will not leave off, unless they be punished. \"Yea,\" you say, \"but that there is a hell everybody sees. But the unbelievers only are to fall into it.\" What is the reason, pray? It is because the believers acknowledge their Master. And what is this to the purpose? when their life is impure, they will on this ground be punished more severely than the unbelievers. \"For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: but as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\" (Rom. ii. 12.) And, \"The servant that knew his master's will, and did it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.\" (Luke xii. 47.) But if there is no such thing as giving an account of one's life, and all this is said in a loose way then neither will the Devil have vengeance taken upon him. For he too knows God, and far more than[fn-34-P3432_3127775:27-nf] men too, and all the demons know Him, and tremble, and own He is their Judge. If then there is no giving an account of our life, nor of evil deeds, then will they also clean escape. These things are not so, surely they are not! Deceive not yourselves, beloved. For if there is no hell, how are the Apostles to judge the twelve tribes of Israel? How cometh Paul to say, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more things of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) How came Christ to say, \"The men of Nineveh shall arise and condemn this generation\" (Matt. xii. 41); and, \"It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment?\" ib. xi. 24.) Why then make merry with things that are no subjects for merriment? Why deceive thyself and put cheats upon thy reason (paralogizh, om. thn yuxhnsou)? Why fight with the love of God toward man? For it was through this that He prepared it, and threatened, that we might not be east into it, as having by this fear become better. And thus he that does away with speaking on these subjects doth nothing else than thrust us into it, and drive us thither by this deceit. Slacken not the hands of them then that labor for virtue, nor make the listlessness of them that sleep greater. For if the many be persuaded that there is no hell, when will they leave off vice? Or when will right be seen? I do not say between sinners and righteous men, but between sinners and sinners? For why is it that one is punished here, and another not punished, though he does the same sins, or even far worse? For if there be no hell, you will having nothing to say in defence of this to those who make it an objection. Wherefore my advice is, that we leave off this trifling, and stop the mouths of those that are gainsayers upon these subjects. For there will be an exact searching into the smallest things, both in the way of sins and in the way of good deeds, and we shall be punished for unchaste looks, and for idle words, and for mere reproachful words, and for drunkenness we shall render an account, as even for a cup of cold water we shall receive a reward, and a sigh only. (Eccl. xii. 14.) For it says, \"Set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry.\" (Ez. ix. 4.) How then darest thou to say that He, who with so great exactness will search into our doings, threatened hell in bare words, and lightly? Do not, I beseech you, do not with these vain hopes destroy thyself and those that are persuaded by thee! For if thou disbelievest our words, make enquiry of Jews and Gentiles,[fn-34-P3433_3130360:28-nf] and all heretics.

Let us celebrate it then, even heavenly joy, with those saints who formerly proclaimed a like feast, and were ensamples to us of conversation in Christ. For not only were they entrusted with the charge of preaching the Gospel, but, if we enquire, we shall see, as it is written, that its power was displayed in them. `Be ye therefore followers of me[fn-88-P8857_3253989:1-nf] ,' he wrote to the Corinthians. Now the apostolic precept exhorts us all, for those commands which he sent to individuals, he at the same time enjoined upon every man in every place, for he was `a teacher of all nations in faith and truth[fn-88-P8858_3254246:2-nf] .' And, generally, the commands of all the saints urge us on similarly, as Solomon makes use of proverbs, saying, `Hear, my children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding; for I give you a good gift, forsake ye not my word: for I was an obedient son to my father, and beloved in the sight of my mother[fn-88-P8859_3254606:3-nf] .'

And now when He saith, \"As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father,\" who can be ignorant of His meaning? For He knoweth the Father by Himself, and we by Him. That He hath knowledge by Himself, we know already: that we also have knowledge by Him, we have likewise learned, for this also we have learned of Him. For He Himself hath said: \"No one hath seen God at any time; but the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.\"[fn-20-P2015_1248741:7-nf] And so by Him do we also get this knowledge, to whom He hath declared Him. In another place also He saith: \"No one knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any one the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.\"[fn-20-P2016_1249003:8-nf] As He then knoweth the Father by Himself, and we know the Father by Him; so into the sheepfold He entereth by Himself, and we by Him. We were saying that by Christ we have a door of entrance to you; and why? Because we preach Christ. We preach Christ; and therefore we enter in by the door. But Christ preacheth Christ, for He preacheth Himself; and so the Shepherd entereth in by Himself. When the light shows the other things that are seen in the light, does it need some other means of being made visible itself? The light, then, exhibits both other things and itself. Whatever we understand, we understand with the intellect: and how, save by the intellect, do we understand the intellect itself? But does one in the same way with the bodily eye see both other things and [the eye] itself? For though men see with their eyes, yet their own eyes they see not. The eye of the flesh sees other things, itself it cannot [see]: but the intellect understands itself as well other things. In the same way as the intellect seeth itself, so also cloth Christ preach Himself. If He preacheth Himself, and by preaching entereth into thee, He entereth into thee by Himself. And He is the door to the Father, for there is no way of approach to the Father but by Him. \"For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.\"[fn-20-P2017_1250362:9-nf] Many things are expressed by a word: all that I have just said, I have said, of course, by means of words. If I were wishing to speak also of a word itself, how could I do so but by the use of the word? And thus both many things are expressed by a word, which are not the same as the word, and the word itself can only be expressed by means of the word. By the Lord's help we have been copious in illustration. Remember, then, how the Lord Jesus Christ is both the door and the Shepherd: the door, in presenting Himself to view; the Shepherd, in entering in by Himself. And indeed, brethren, because He is the Shepherd, He hath given to His members to be so likewise. For both Peter, and Paul, and the other apostles were, as all good bishops are, shepherds. But none of us calleth himself the door. This-the way of entrance for the sheep-He has retained as exclusively belonging to Himself. In short, Paul discharged the office of a good shepherd when he preached Christ, because he entered by the door. But when the undisciplined sheep began to create schisms, and to set up other doors before them, not of entrance to their joint assembly, but for falling away into divisions, saying, some of them, \"I am of Paul;\" others, \"I am of Cephas;\" others,\" I of Apollos;\" others, \"I of Christ:\" terrified for those who said, \"I am of Paul,\"-as if calling out to the sheep, Wretched ones, whither are you going? I am not the door,-he said, \"Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?\"[fn-20-P2018_1251886:10-nf] But those who said, \"I am of Christ,\" had found the door.","title":"Tractate XLVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_78_letter_vii_for_335_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"3.

These, having become dead to the world, and renounced the merchandise of the world, gain an honourable death; for, `precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints[fn-91-P9150_3330483:19-nf] .' They are also able, preserving the Apostolic likeness, to say, `I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me[fn-91-P9151_3330653:20-nf] .' For that is the true life, which a man lives in Christ; for although they are dead to the world, yet they dwell as it were in heaven, minding those things which are above, as he who was a lover of such a habitation said, `While we walk on earth, our dwelling is in heaven[fn-91-P9152_3330946:21-nf] .' Now those who thus live, and are partakers in such virtue, are alone able to give glory to God, and this it is which essentially constitutes a feast and a holiday[fn-91-P9153_3331345:22-nf] . For the feast does not consist in pleasant intercourse at meals, nor splendour[fn-91-P9154_3331497:23-nf] of clothing, nor days of leisure, but in the acknowledgment of God, and the offering of thanksgiving and of praise to Him[fn-91-P9155_3331650:24-nf] . Now this belongs to the saints alone, who live in Christ; for it is written, `The dead shall not praise Thee, O Lord, neither all those who go down into silence; but we who live will bless the Lord, from henceforth even for ever[fn-91-P9156_3331913:25-nf] .' So was it with Hezekiah, who was delivered from death, and therefore praised God, saying, `Those who are in hades cannot praise Thee I the dead cannot bless Thee; but the living shall bless Thee, as I also do[fn-91-P9157_3332156:26-nf] .' For to praise and bless God belongs to those only who live in Christ, and by means of this they go up to the feast; for the Passover is not of the Gentiles, nor of those who are yet Jews in the flesh; but of those who acknowledge the truth in Christ[fn-91-P9158_3332431:27-nf] , as he declares who was sent to proclaim such a feast; `Our Passover, Christ, is sacrificed[fn-91-P9159_3332557:28-nf] .'","title":"Letter VII.

Or was it that the Apostle Peter, as some with a perverse kind of favor strive to excuse him,[fn-26-P2616_1539807:1-nf] did not deny Christ, because, when questioned by the maid, he replied that he did not know the man, as the other evangelists more expressly affirm? As if, indeed, he that denies the man Christ does not deny Christ; and so denies Him in respect of what He became on our account, that the nature He had given us might not be lost. Whoever, therefore, acknowledges Christ as God, and disowns Him as man, Christ died not for him; for as man it was that Christ died. He who disowns Christ as man, finds no reconciliation to God by the Mediator. For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.[fn-26-P2617_1540459:2-nf] He that denies Christ as man is not justified: for as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so also by the obedience of one man shall many be made righteous.[fn-26-P2618_1540652:3-nf] He that denies Christ as man, shall not rise again into the resurrection of life; for by man is death, and by man is also the resurrection of the dead: for as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.[fn-26-P2619_1540886:4-nf] And by what means is He the Head of the Church, but by His manhood, because the Word was made flesh, that is, God, the Only-begotten of God the Father, became man. And how then canone be in the body of Christ who denies the man Christ? Or how can one be a member who disowns the Head? But why linger over a multitude of reasons when the Lord Himself undoes all the windings of human argumentation? For He says not, The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied the man; or, as He was wont to speak in His more familiar condescension with men, The cock shall not crow till thou hast thrice denied the Son of man; but He says, \"till thou hast denied me thrice.\" What is that \"me,\" but just what He was, and what was He but Christ? Whatever of Him, therefore, he denied, he denied Himself, he denied the Christ, he denied the Lord his God. For Thomas also, his fellow-disciple, when he exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God,\" did not handle the Word, but only His flesh; and laid not his inquisitive hands on the incorporeal nature of God, but on His human body.[fn-26-P2620_1541961:5-nf] And so he touched the man, and yet recognized his God. If, then, what the latter touched, Peter denied; what the latter invoked, Peter offended. \"The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.\" Although thou say, \"I know not the man;\" although thou say, \"Man, I know not what thou sayest;\" although thou say, \"I am not one of His disciples;\"[fn-26-P2621_1542334:6-nf] thou wilt be denying me. If, which it were sinful to doubt, Christ so spake, and foretold the truth, then doubtless Peter denied Christ. Let us not accuse Christ in defending Peter. Let infirmity acknowledge its sin; for there is no falsehood in the Truth. When Peter's infirmity acknowledged its sin, his acknowledgment was full; and the greatness of the evil he had committed in denying Christ, he showed by his tears. He himself reproves his defenders, and for their conviction, brings his tears forward as witnesses. Nor have we, on our part, in so speaking, any delight in accusing the first of the apostles; but in looking on him, we ought to take home the lesson to ourselves, that no man should place his confidence in human strength. For what else had our Teacher and Saviour in view, but to show us, by making the first of the apostles himself an example, that no one ought in any way to presume of himself? And that, therefore, really took place in Peter's soul, for which he gave cause in his body. And yet he did not go before in the Lord's behalf, as he rashly presumed, but did so otherwise than he reckoned. For before the death and resurrection of the Lord, he both died when he denied, and returned to life when he wept; but he died, because he himself had been proud in his presumption, and he lived again, because that Other had looked on him with kindness.

[But why should it seem unsuitable or impossible that the Word and flesh and soul should be one Jesus Christ, and that the Son of God and the Son of Man should be one, if flesh and soul which are of different natures make one person even without the Incarnation of the Word: since it is much easier for the power of the Godhead to produce this union of Himself and man than for the weakness of manhood by itself to effect it in its own substance.] Therefore neither was the Word changed into flesh nor flesh into the Word: but both remains in one and one is in both, not divided by the diversity and not confounded by intermixture: He is not one by His Father and another by His mother, but the same, in one way by His Father before every beginning, and in another by His mother at the end of the ages: so that He was \"mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus[fn-12-P1253_307459:7-nf] ,\" in whom dwelt \"the fulness of the Godhead bodily[fn-12-P1254_307528:8-nf] :\" because it was the assumed (nature) not the Assuming (nature) which was raised, because God \"exalted Him and gave Him the Name which is above every name: that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ the Lord is in the glory of God the Father[fn-12-P1255_307915:9-nf] .\"","title":"Letter XXXV.to Julian, Bishop of Cos .","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_98_letter_xcviii_from_the_synod_of_chalcedon_to_leo_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"And we ought to have left him in the position where he had placed himself: but, since we profess the teaching of the Saviour \"who wishes all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the Truth[fn-18-P1807_420840:6-nf] ,\" as a fact we took pains to carry out this merciful policy towards him, and called him in brotherly fashion to judgment, not as if trying to cut him off but affording him room for defence and healing; and we prayed that he might be victorious over the many charges they had brought against him, in order that we might conclude our meeting in peace and happiness and Satan might gum no advantage over us. But he, being absolutely convicted by his own conscience[fn-18-P1808_421320:7-nf] , by shirking the trial gave countenance to the accusations and rejected the three lawful summonses he received. In consequence of which, we ratified with such moderation as we could the vote which he had passed against himself by his blunders, stripping the wolf of his shepherd's skin, which he had long been convicted of wearing for a pretence. Thereupon our troubles ceased and straightway a time of welcome happiness set in: and having pulled up one tare, we filled the whole world to our delight with pure grain: and having received, as it were, full power to rootup and to plant, we limited the up-rooting to one and carefully plant a crop of good fruit.

Many things are set forth by inspired Scripture as binding upon all who are anxious to please God. But, for the present, I have only deemed it necessary to speak by way of brief reminder concerning the questions which have recently been stirred among you, so far as I have learnt from the study of inspired Scripture itself. I shall thus leave behind me detailed evidence, easy of apprehension, for the information of industrious students, who in their turn will be able to inform others. The Christian ought to be so minded as becomes his heavenly calling,[fn-28-P2894_958820:2-nf] and his life and conversation ought to be worthy of the Gospel of Christ.[fn-28-P2895_958911:3-nf] The Christian ought not to be of doubtful mind,[fn-28-P2896_958979:4-nf] nor by anything drawn away from the recollection of God and of His purposes and judgments. The Christian ought in all things to become superior to the righteousness existing under the law, and neither swear nor lie.[fn-28-P2897_959216:5-nf] He ought not to speak evil;[fn-28-P2898_959264:6-nf] to do violence;[fn-28-P2899_959296:7-nf] to fight;[fn-29-P2900_959324:8-nf] to avenge himself;[fn-29-P2901_959360:9-nf] to return evil for evil;[fn-29-P2902_959403:10-nf] to be angry.[fn-29-P2903_959435:11-nf] The Christian ought to be patient,[fn-29-P2904_959488:12-nf] whatever he have to suffer, and to convict the wrong-doer in season,[fn-29-P2905_959574:13-nf] not with the desire of his own vindication, but of his brother's reformation,[fn-29-P2906_959670:14-nf] according to the commandment of the Lord. The Christian ought not to say anything behind his brother's back with the object of calumniating him, for this is slander, even if what is said is true.[fn-29-P2907_959885:15-nf] He ought to turn away from the brother who speaks evil against him;[fn-29-P2908_959997:16-nf] he ought not to indulge in jesting.[fn-29-P2909_960081:17-nf] he ought not to laugh nor even to suffer laugh makers.[fn-29-P2910_960151:18-nf] He must not talk idly, saying things which are of no service to the hearers nor to such usage as is necessary and permitted us by God;[fn-29-P2911_960597:19-nf] so that workers may do their best as far as possible to work in silence; and that good words be suggested to them by those who are entrusted with the duty of carefully dispensing the word to the building up of the faith, lest God's Holy Spirit be grieved. Any one who comes in ought not to be able, of his own tree will, to accost or speak to any of the brothers, before those to whom the responsibility of general discipline is committed have approved of it as pleasing to God, with a view to the common good.[fn-29-P2912_961124:20-nf] The Christian ought not to be enslaved by wine;[fn-29-P2913_961517:21-nf] nor to be eager for flesh meat,[fn-29-P2914_961568:22-nf] and as a general rule ought not to be a lover of pleasure in eating or drinking,[fn-29-P2915_961668:23-nf] \"for every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.\"[fn-29-P2916_961762:24-nf] The Christian ought to regard all the things that are given him for his use, not as his to hold as his own or to lay up;[fn-29-P2917_961903:25-nf] and, giving careful heed to all things as the Lord's, not to overlook any of the things that are being thrown aside and disregarded, should this be the case. No Christian ought to think of himself as his own master, but each should rather so think and act as though given by God to be slave to his like minded brethren;[fn-29-P2918_962245:26-nf] but \"every man in his own order.\"[fn-29-P2919_962301:27-nf] ","title":"Letter XXII","author":"St. Basil"}]
