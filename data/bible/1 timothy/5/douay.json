{"verses":["An ancient man rebuke not, but entreat him as a father:  young men,\nas brethren:","Old women, as mothers:  young women, as sisters, in all chastity.","Honour widows that are widows indeed.","But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let her learn\nfirst to govern her own house and to make a return of duty to her\nparents; for this is acceptable before God.","But she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, let her trust in God\nand continue in supplications and prayers night and day.","For she that liveth in pleasures is dead while she is living.","And this give in charge, that they may be blameless.","But if any man have not care of his own and especially of those of\nhis house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.","Let a widow be chosen of no less than threescore years of age, who\nhath been the wife of one husband.","Having testimony for her good works, if she have brought up\nchildren, if she have received to harbour, if she have washed the\nsaints' feet, if she have ministered to them that suffer tribulation,\nif she have diligently followed every good work.","But the younger widows avoid.  For when they have grown wanton in\nChrist, they will marry:","Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith.","And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house:\nand are not only idle, but tattlers also and busy bodies, speaking\nthings which they ought not.","I will, therefore, that the younger should marry, bear children,\nbe mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak\nevil.","For some are already turned aside after Satan.","If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to them, and\nlet not the church be charged:  that there may be sufficient for them\nthat are widows indeed.","Let the priests that rule well be esteemed worthy of double\nhonour:  especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.","For the scripture saith:  Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that\ntreadeth out the corn:  and, The labourer is worthy of his reward.","Against a priest receive not an accusation, but under two or\nthree witnesses.","Them that sin reprove before all that the rest also may have\nfear.","I charge thee, before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels,\nthat thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by\ndeclining to either side.","Impose not hands lightly upon any man, neither be partaker of\nother men's sins.  Keep thyself chaste.","Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's\nsake and thy frequent infirmities.","Some men's sins are manifest, going before to judgment:  and some\nmen they follow after.","In like manner also good deeds are manifest:  and they that are\notherwise cannot be hid."]}
