{"verses":["Now the Spirit manifestly saith that in the last times some shall\ndepart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error and doctrines of\ndevils,","Speaking lies in hypocrisy and having their conscience seared,","Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats, which God hath created\nto be received with thanksgiving by the faithful and by them that have\nknown the truth.","For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that\nis received with thanksgiving:","For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.","These things proposing to the brethren, thou shalt be a good\nminister of Christ Jesus, nourished up in the words of faith and of the\ngood doctrine which thou hast attained unto.","But avoid foolish and old wives fables:  and exercise thyself unto\ngodliness.","For bodily exercise is profitable to little:  but godliness is\nprofitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is and of\nthat which is to come.","A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.","For therefore we labour and are reviled, because we hope in the\nliving God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.","These things command and teach:","Let no man despise thy youth:  but be thou an example of the\nfaithful, in word, in conversation, in charity, in faith, in chastity.","Till I come, attend unto reading, to exhortation and to doctrine.","Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given thee by\nprophecy, with imposition of the hands of the priesthood.","Meditate upon these things, be wholly in these things:  that thy\nprofiting may be manifest to all.","Take heed to thyself and to doctrine:  be earnest in them.  For in\ndoing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee."]}
