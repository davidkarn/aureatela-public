For what boots it to exhibit in your face temperance and unaffectedness, and a simplicity altogether worthy of the divine discipline, but to invest all the other parts of the body with the luxurious absurdities of pomps and delicacies? How intimate is the connection which these pomps have with the business of voluptuousness, and how they interfere with modesty, is easily discernible from the fact that it is by the allied aid of dress that they prostitute the grace of personal comeliness: so plain is it that if (the pomps) be wanting, they render (that grace) bootless and thankless, as if it were disarmed and wrecked. On the other hand, if natural beauty fails, the supporting aid of outward embellishment supplies a grace, as it were, from its own inherent power.[fn-4-P460_95917:82-nf] Those times of life, in fact, which are at last blest with quiet and withdrawn into the harbour of modesty, the splendour and dignity of dress lure away (from that rest and that harbour), and disquiet seriousness by seductions of appetite, which compensate for the chili of age by the provocative charms of apparel. First, then, blessed (sisters), (take heed) that you admit not to your use meretricious and prostitutionary garbs and garments: and, in the next place, if there are any of you whom the exigencies of riches, or birth, or past dignities, compel to appear in public so gorgeously arrayed as not to appear to have attained wisdom, take heed to temper an evil of this kind; lest, under the pretext of necessity, you give the rein without stint to the indulgence of licence. For how will you be able to fulfil (the requirements of) humility, which our (school) profess,[fn-4-P461_96884:83-nf] if you do not keep within bounds[fn-4-P462_96934:84-nf] the enjoyment of your riches and elegancies, which tend so much to \"glory? \"Now it has ever been the wont of glory to exalt, not to humble. \"Why, shall we not use what is our own? \"Who prohibits your using it?

Read the rest: it is too long to quote all. You will find that those able to think lightly of such things,-that is, those of greater strength and stability,-are told that they must nevertheless abstain, lest those should be offended who from their weakness are still in need of such abstinence. The people I was describing know and observe these things; for they are Christians, not heretics. They understand Scripture according to the apostolic teaching, not according to the presumptuous and fictitious name of apostle.[fn-5-P545_243904:103-nf] Him that eats not no one despises; him that eats no one judges; he who is weak eats herbs. Many who are strong, however, do this for the sake of the weak; with many the reason for so doing is not this, but that they may have a cheaper diet, and may lead a life of the greatest tranquillity, with the least expensive provision for the support of the body. \"For all things are lawful for me,\" he says; \"but I will not be brought under the power of any.\"[fn-5-P546_244427:104-nf] Thus many do not eat flesh, and yet do not superstitiously regard it as unclean.

Many drink no wine; but they do not think that wine defiles them; for they cause it to be given with the greatest propriety and moderation to people of languid temperament, and, in short, to all who cannot have bodily health without it. When some foolishly refuse it, they counsel them as brothers not to let a silly superstition make them weaker instead of making them holier. They read to them the apostle's precept to his disciple to \"take a little wine for his many infirmities.\"[fn-5-P547_245131:105-nf] Then they diligently exercise piety; bodily exercise, they know, profiteth for a short time, as the same apostle says.[fn-5-P548_245271:106-nf] ","title":"Of the Morals of the Catholic Church.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"323","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"13.

You may see many women widows before wedded, who try to conceal their miserable fall by a lying garb. Unless they are betrayed by swelling wombs or by the crying of their infants, they walk abroad with tripping feet and heads in the air. Some go so fat as to take potions, that they may insure barrenness, and thus murder human beings almost before their conception. Some, when they find themselves with child through their sin, use drugs to procure abortion, and when (as often happens) they die with their offspring, they enter the lower world laden with the guilt not only of adultery against Christ but also of suicide and child murder. Yet it is these who say: \"`Unto the pure all things are pure;'[fn-6-P697_135345:428-nf] my conscience is sufficient guide for me. A pure heart is what God looks for.

Certain persons find fault with me because in the books which I have written against Jovinian I have been excessive (so they say) in praise of virginity and in depreciation of marriage; and they affirm that to preach up chastity till no comparison is left between a wife and a virgin is equivalent to a condemnation of matrimony. If I remember aright the point of the dispute, the question at issue between myself and Jovinian is that he puts marriage on a level with virginity, while I make it inferior; he declares that there is little or no difference between the two states, I assert that there is a great deal. Finally-a result due under God to your agency-he has been condemned because he has dared to set matrimony on an equality with perpetual chastity. Or, if a virgin and a wife are to be looked on as the same, how comes it that Rome has refused to listen to this impious doctrine? A virgin owes her being to a man, but a man does not owe his to a virgin. There can be no middle course. Either my view of the matter must be embraced, or else that of Jovinian. If I am blamed for putting wedlock below virginity, he must be praised for putting the two states on a level. If, on the other hand, he is condemned for supposing them equal, his condemnation must be taken as testimony in favor of my treatise. If men of the world chafe under the notion that they occupy a position inferior to that of virgins, I wonder that clergymen and monks-who both live celibate lives-refrain from praising what they consistently practise. They cut themselves off from their wives to imitate the chastity of virgins, and yet they will have it that married women are as good as these. They should either be joined again to their wives whom they have renounced, or, if they persist in living apart from them, they will have to confess-by their lives if not by their words-that, in preferring virginity to marriage, they have chosen the better course, Am I then a mere novice in the Scriptures, reading the sacred volumes for the first time? And is the line there drawn between virginity and marriage so fine that I have been unable to observe it? I could know nothing, forsooth, of the saying, \"Be not righteous overmuch!\"[fn-15-P1526_344276:1038-nf] Thus, while I try to protect myself on one side, I am wounded on the other; to speak more plainly still, while I close with Jovinian in hand-to-hand combat, Manichaeus stabs me in the back. Have I not, I would ask, in the very forefront of my work set the following preface:[fn-15-P1527_344595:1039-nf] \"We are no disciples of Marcion[fn-15-P1528_344655:1040-nf] or of Manichaeus,[fn-15-P1529_344756:1041-nf] to detract from marriage. Nor are we deceived by the error of Tatian,[fn-15-P1530_344947:1042-nf] the chief of the Encratites,[fn-15-P1531_345104:1043-nf] into supposing all cohabitation unclean. For he condemns and reprobates not marriage only, but foods also which God has created for us to enjoy.[fn-15-P1532_345339:1044-nf] We know that in a large house there are vessels not only of silver and of gold, but of wood also and of earth.[fn-15-P1533_345473:1045-nf] We know, too, that on the foundation of Christ which Paul the master builder has laid, some build up gold, silver, and precious stones; others, on the contrary, hay, wood, and stubble.[fn-15-P1534_345682:1046-nf] We are not ignorant that `marriage is honorable ...and the bed undefiled.'[fn-15-P1535_345783:1047-nf] We have read the first decree of God: `Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth.'[fn-15-P1536_345896:1048-nf] But while we allow marriage, we prefer the virginity which springs from it. Gold is more precious than silver, but is silver on that account the less silver? Is it an insult to a tree to prefer its apples to its roots or its leaves? Is it an injury to corn to put the ear before the stalk and the blade? As apples come from the tree and grain from the straw, so virginity comes from wedlock. Yields of one hundredfold, of sixtyfold, and of thirtyfold[fn-15-P1537_346368:1049-nf] may all come from one soil and from one sowing, yet they will differ widely in quantity. The yield thirtyfold signifies wedlock, for the joining together of the fingers to express that number, suggestive as it is of a loving gentle kiss or embracing, aptly represents the relation of husband and wife. The yield sixtyfold refers to widows who are placed in a position of distress and tribulation. Accordingly, they are typified by that finger which is placed under the other to express the number sixty; for, as it is extremely trying when one has once tasted pleasure to abstain from its enticements, so the reward of doing this is proportionately great. Moreover, a hundred-I ask the reader to give me his best attention-necessitates a change from the left hand to the right; but while the hand is different the fingers are the same as those which on the left hand signify married women and widows; only in this instance the circle formed by them indicates the crown of virginity.\"[fn-15-P1538_347376:1050-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"532","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"\"Vanity of vanities,\" says the Preacher, \"all is vanity.\"[fn-16-P1629_379118:1125-nf] But if all created things are good,[fn-16-P1630_379177:1126-nf] as being the handiwork of a good Creator, how comes it that all things are vanity?

I do not adduce these instances because I have anything in me from which you either can or will learn a lesson, but to show you that your zeal and eagerness to learn-even though you cannot rely on help from me-are in themselves worthy of praise. A mind willing to learn deserves commendation even when it has no teacher. What is of importance to me is not what you find but what you seek to find. Wax is soft and easy to mould even where the hands of craftsman and modeller are wanting to work it. It is already potentially all that it can be made. The apostle Paul learned the Law of Moses and the prophets at the feet of Gamaliel and was glad that he had done so, for armed with this spiritual armour, he was able to say boldly \"the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds;\" armed with these we war \"casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; and being in a readiness to revenge all disobedience.\"[fn-20-P2014_502088:1412-nf] He writes to Timothy who had been trained in the holy writings from a child exhorting him to study them diligently[fn-20-P2015_502227:1413-nf] and not to neglect the gift which was given him with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.[fn-20-P2016_502367:1414-nf] To Titus he gives commandment that among a bishop's other virtues (which he briefly describes) he should be careful to seek a knowledge of the scriptures: A bishop, he says, must hold fast \"the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.\"[fn-20-P2017_502708:1415-nf] In fact want of education in a clergyman[fn-20-P2018_502769:1416-nf] prevents him from doing good to any one but himself and much as the virtue of his life may build up Christ's church, he does it an injury as great by failing to resist those who are trying to pull it down. The prophet Haggai says-or rather the Lord says it by the mouth of Haggai-\"Ask now the priests concerning the law.\"[fn-20-P2019_503119:1417-nf] For such is the important function of the priesthood to give answers to those who question them concerning the law. And in Deuteronomy we read \"Ask thy father and he will shew thee; thy elders and they will tell thee.\"[fn-20-P2020_503360:1418-nf] Also in the one hundred and nineteenth psalm \"thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.\" David too, in the description of the righteous man whom he compares to the tree of life in paradise, amongst his other excellences speaks of this, \"His delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.\"[fn-20-P2021_503730:1419-nf] In the close of his most solemn vision Daniel declares that \"the righteous shall shine as the stars; and the wise, that is the learned, as the firmament.\"[fn-20-P2022_503904:1420-nf] You can see, therefore, how great is the difference between righteous ignorance and instructed righteousness. Those who have the first are compared with the stars, those who have the second with the heavens. Yet, according to the exact sense of the Hebrew, both statements may be understood of the learned, for it is to be read in this way:-\"They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.\" Why is the apostle Paul called a chosen vessel?[fn-20-P2023_504456:1421-nf] Assuredly because he is a repertory of the Law and of the holy scriptures. The learned teaching of our Lord strikes the Pharisees dumb with amazement, and they are filled with astonishment to find that Peter and John know the Law although they have not learned letters. For to these the Holy Ghost immediately suggested what comes to others by daily study and meditation; and, as it is written,[fn-20-P2024_504873:1422-nf] they were \"taught of God.\" The Saviour had only accomplished his twelfth year when the scene in the temple took place;[fn-20-P2025_505017:1423-nf] but when he interrogated the elders concerning the Law His wise questions conveyed rather than sought information.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"664","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"9. In saying this, I do not of course condemn food which God created to be enjoyed with thanksgiving,[fn-22-P2212_544483:1570-nf] but I seek to remove from youths and girls what are incentives to sensual pleasure. Neither the fiery Etna nor the country of Vulcan,[fn-22-P2213_544640:1571-nf] nor Vesuvius, nor Olympus, burns with such violent heat as the youthful marrow of those who are flushed with wine and filled with food. Many trample covetousness under foot, and lay it down as readily as they lay down their purse. An enforced silence serves to make amends for a railing tongue. The outward appearance and the mode of dress can be changed in a single hour. All other sins are external, and what is external can easily be cast away. Desire alone, implanted in men by God to lead them to procreate children, is internal; and this, if it once oversteps its own bounds, becomes a sin, and by a law of nature cries out for sexual intercourse. It is therefore a work of great merit, and one which requires unremitting diligence to overcome that which is innate in you; while living in the flesh not to live after the flesh; to strive with yourself day by day and to watch the foe shut up within you with the hundred eyes of the fabled Argus.[fn-22-P2214_545641:1572-nf] This is what the apostle says in other words: \"Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.\"[fn-22-P2215_545887:1573-nf] Physicians and others who have written on the nature of the human body, and particularly Galen in his books entitled On matters of health, say that the bodies of boys and of young men and of full grown men and women glow with an interior heat and consequently that for persons of these ages all food is injurious which tends to promote this heat: while on the other hand it is highly conducive to health in eating and in drinking to take things cold and cooling. Contrariwise they tell us that warm food and old wine are good for the old who suffer from humours and from chilliness.

All that was due to him you can give to them. Temper grief with love, for if he is gone they are still with you. It is no small merit in God's eyes to bring up children well. Hear the apostle's counsel: \"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.\"[fn-33-P3355_880507:2435-nf] Here you learn the roll of the virtues which God requires of you, what is due to the name of widow which you bear, and by what good deeds you can attain to that second degree of chastity[fn-33-P3356_880730:2436-nf] which is still open to you. Do not be disturbed because the apostle allows none to be chosen as a widow under threescore years old, neither suppose that he intends to reject those who are still young.

Again he avers that my brother[fn-34-P3484_920818:2526-nf] is the cause of the disagreement which has arisen, a man who is content to stay in a monastic cell and who regards the clerical office as onerous rather than honourable. And although up to this very day he has spoon-fed us with insincere protestations of peace, he has caused commotion in the minds of the western bishops[fn-34-P3485_921197:2527-nf] by telling them that a mere youth, hardly more than a boy, has been ordained[fn-34-P3486_921325:2528-nf] presbyter of Bethlehem in his own diocese. If this is the truth, all the bishops of Palestine must be aware of it. For the monastery of the reverend pope Epiphanius-called the old monastery-where my brother was ordained presbyter is situated in the district of Eleutheropolis[fn-34-P3487_921644:2529-nf] and not in that of Aelia.[fn-34-P3488_921763:2530-nf] Furthermore his age is well known to your Holiness; and as he has now attained to thirty years I apprehend that no blame can attach to him on that score. Indeed this particular age is stamped as full and complete by the mystery of Christ's assumed manhood. Let him call to mind the ancient law, and he will see that after his twenty-fifth year a Levite might be chosen to the priesthood;[fn-34-P3489_922266:2531-nf] or if in this passage he prefers to follow the Hebrew he will find that candidates for the priesthood must be thirty years old.

And if he argues that youth is no hindrance to a bishop but that it is to a presbyter because a young elder[fn-34-P3492_922887:2534-nf] is a contradiction in terms, I ask him this question: Why has he himself ordained a presbyter of this age or younger still, and that too to minister in another man's church? But if he cannot be at peace with my brother unless he consents to submit and to renounce the bishop who has ordained him, he shews plainly that his object is not peace but revenge, and that he will not rest satisfied with the quietude of repose and peace unless he is able to inflict to the full every penalty that he now threatens. Had he himself ordained my brother, it would have made no difference to this latter. So dearly does he love seclusion that he would even then have continued to live quietly and would not have exercised his office. And should the bishop have seen fit to rend the church on that score, he would then have owed him nothing save the respect which is due to all who offer sacrifice.[fn-34-P3493_923819:2535-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_09_book_iv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"8.

But when by that liberty we have done something and the pernicious sweetness and pleasure of that deed has taken hold upon the mind, by its own habit the mind is so implicated that afterwards it cannot conquer what by sinning it has fashioned for itself. We see many who do not wish to swear, but because the tongue has already become habituated, they are not able to prevent those things from going forth from the mouth which we cannot but ascribe to the root of evil. For that I may discuss with you those words, which as they do not withdraw from your mouth so may they be understood by your heart: you swear by the Paraclete. If therefore you wish to find out experimentally whether what I say is true, determine not to swear. You will see, that that habit is borne along as it has become accustomed to be. And this is what wars against the soul, habit formed in the flesh. This is indeed the mind of the flesh, which, as long as it cannot thus be subject to the law of God, so long is it the mind of the flesh; but when the soul has been illuminated it ceases to be the mind of the flesh. For thus it is said the mind of the flesh cannot be subject to the law of God, just as if it were said, that snow cannot be warm. Far so long as it is snow, it can in no way be warm. But as the snow is melted by heat, so that it may become warm, so the mind of the flesh, that is, habit formed with the flesh, when our mind has become illuminated, that is, when God has subjected for Himself the whole man to the choice of the divine law, instead of the evil habit of the soul, makes a good habit. Accordingly it is most truly said by the Lord of the two trees, the one good and the other evil, which you have called to mind, that they have their own fruits; that is, neither can the good tree yield evil fruit, nor the evil tree good fruit, but so long as it is evil. Let us take two men, a good and a bad. As long as he is good he cannot yield evil fruit; as long as he is bad he cannot yield good fruit. But that you may know that those two trees are so placed by the Lord, that free choice may be there signified, that these two trees are not natures but our wills, He Himself says in the gospel: \"Either make the tree good, or make the tree evil.\"[fn-9-P904_473740:9-nf] Who is it that can make nature? If therefore we are commanded to make a tree either good or evil, it is ours to choose what we will. Therefore concerning that sin of man and concerning that habit of soul formed with the flesh the apostle says: \"Let no one seduce you;\"[fn-9-P905_474028:10-nf] \"Every creature that has been made by God is good.\"[fn-9-P906_474096:11-nf] The same apostle whom you also have cited says: \"As through the disobedience of the one the many were constituted sinners; so also through the obedience of the one the many are constituted righteous.\"[fn-9-P907_474316:12-nf] \"Since through man is death, through man also is resurrection of the dead.\" As long therefore as we bear the image of the earthly man,[fn-9-P908_474468:13-nf] that is, as long as we live according to the flesh, which is also called the old man, we have the necessity of our habit, so that we may not do what we will. But when the grace of God has breathed the divine love into us and has made us subject to His will, to us it is said: \"Ye are called for freedom,\"[fn-9-P909_474798:14-nf] and \"the grace of God has made me free from the law of sin and of death.\"[fn-9-P910_474889:15-nf] But the law of sin is that whoever has sinned shall die. From this law we are freed when we have begun to be righteous. The law of death is that by which it was said to man: \"Earth thou art and into earth thou shalt go.\"[fn-9-P911_475129:16-nf] For from this very fact we are all so born, because we are earth, and from the fact that we are all so born because we are earth, we shall all go into earth on account of the desert of the sins of the first man. But on account of the grace of God, which frees us from the law of sin and of death, having been converted to righteousness we are freed; so that afterwards this same flesh tortures us with its punishment so long as we remain in sins, is subjected to us in resurrection, and shakes us by no adversity from keeping the law of God and His precepts. Whence, since I have replied to your questions, deign to reply as I desire, how it can happen, that if nature is contrary to God, sin should be imputed to us, who were sent into that nature not voluntarily, but by God Himself, whom nothing could injure?","title":"Disputation of the Second Day.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"33.

[XXVI.] Sanctification is not of merely one measure; for even catechumens, I take it, are sanctified in their own measure by the sign of Christ, and the prayer of imposition of hands; and what they receive is holy, although it is not the body of Christ, - holier than any food which constitutes our ordinary nourishment, because it is a sacrament.[fn-10-P1015_554411:164-nf] However, that very meat and drink, wherewithal the necessities of our present life are sustained, are, according to the same apostle, \"sanctified by the word of God and prayer,\"[fn-10-P1016_555041:165-nf] even the prayer with which we beg that our bodies may be refreshed. Just as therefore this sanctification of our ordinary food does not hinder what enters the mouth from descending into the belly, and being ejected into the draught,[fn-10-P1017_555295:166-nf] ] and partaking of the corruption into which everything earthly is resolved, whence the Lord exhorts us to labour for the other food which never perishes:[fn-10-P1018_555471:167-nf] so the sanctification of the catechumen, if he is not baptized, does not avail for his entrance into the kingdom of heaven, nor for the remission of his sins. And, by parity of reasoning, that sanctification likewise, of whatever measure it be, which, according to the apostle, is in the children of believers, has nothing whatever to do with the question of baptism and of the origin or the remission of sin.[fn-10-P1019_555901:168-nf] The apostle, in this very passage which has occupied our attention, says that the unbeliever of a married couple is sanctified by a believing partner: \"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband.

We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

Nor need we wonder if the Apostle commands that everything sold in the market be bought and eaten, since with idolaters, and with those who still ate in the temples of the idols meats offered to idols as such, it passed for the highest abstinence to abstain only from food eaten by the Gentiles.

Xerophagies, however, (they consider) the novel name of a studied duty, and very much akin to heathenish superstition, like the abstemious rigours which purify an Apis, an Isis, and a Magna Mater, by a restriction laid upon certain kinds of food; whereas faith, free in Christ,[fn-17-P1713_503027:7-nf] owes no abstinence from particular meats to the Jewish Law even, admitted as it has been by the apostle once for all to the whole range of the meat-market[fn-17-P1714_503202:8-nf] -(the apostle, I say), that detester of such as, in like manner as they prohibit marrying, so bid us abstain from meats created by God.[fn-17-P1715_503361:9-nf] And accordingly (they think) us to have been even then prenoted as \"in the latest times departing from the faith, giving heed to spirits which seduce the world, having a conscience inburnt with doctrines of liars.\"[fn-17-P1716_503600:10-nf] (Inburnt?)

But you have received it, beloved Dracontius; do not tolerate your advisers nor deceive yourself. For this will be required of you by the God who gave it. Have you not heard the Apostle say, `Neglect not the gift that is in thee[fn-98-P9843_3516232:11-nf] ?' or have you not read how he accepts the man that had doubled his money, while he condemned the one that had hidden it? But may it come to pass that you may quickly return, in order that you too may be one of those who are praised. Or tell me, whom do your advisers wish you to imitate? For we ought to walk by the standard of the saints and the fathers, and imitate them, and to be sure that if we depart from them we put ourselves also out of their fellowship. Whom then do they wish you to imitate? The one who hesitated, and while wishing to follow, delayed it and took counsel because of his family[fn-98-P9844_3516858:12-nf] , or blessed Paul, who, the moment the stewardship was entrusted to him, `straightway conferred not with flesh and blood[fn-98-P9845_3516997:13-nf] ?'

But, as it was `woe to me' if he did not preach, so, in teaching and preaching the gospel, he had his converts as his joy and crown[fn-98-P9848_3517378:16-nf] . This explains why the saint[fn-98-P9849_3517427:17-nf] was zealous to preach as far as Illyricum, and not to shrink from proceeding to Rome[fn-98-P9850_3517555:18-nf] , or even going as far as the Spains[fn-98-P9851_3517609:19-nf] , in order that the more he laboured, he might receive so much the greater reward for his labour.

On its being objected to him, from the fifth chapter of Coelestius' book, that\" they say that every individual has the ability to possess all powers and graces, thus taking away that `diversity of graces,' which the apostle teaches,\" Pelagius replied: \"We have certainly said so much; but yet they have laid against us a malignant and blundering charge. We do not take away the diversity of graces; but we declare that God gives to the person, who has proved himself worthy to receive them, all graces, even as He conferred them on the Apostle Paul.\" Hereupon the Synod said: \"You accordingly do yourself hold the doctrine of the Church touching the gift of the graces, which are collectively possessed by the apostle.\" Here some one may say, \"Why then is he anxious? Do you on your side deny that all the powers and graces were combined in the apostle?\" For my own part, indeed, if all those are to be understood which the apostle has himself mentioned together in one passage,-as, I suppose, the bishops understood Pelagius to mean when they approved of his answer, and pronounced it to be in keeping with the sense of the Church,-then I do not doubt that the apostle had them all; for he says: \"And God hath set some in the Church, first, apostles; secondarily, prophets; thirdly, teachers; after that miracles; then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.\"[fn-29-P2989_1160021:89-nf] What then? shall we say that the Apostle Paul did not possess all these gifts himself? Who would be bold enough to assert this? The very fact that he was an apostle showed, of course, that he possessed the grace of the apostolate. He possessed also that of prophecy; for was not that a prophecy of his in which lie says: \"In the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils?\"[fn-29-P2990_1160475:90-nf] He was, moreover, \"the teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity?[fn-29-P2991_1160562:91-nf] He performed miracles also and cures; for he shook off from his hand, unhurt, the biting viper;[fn-29-P2992_1160677:92-nf] and the cripple stood upright on his feet at the apostle's word, and his strength was at once restored.[fn-29-P2993_1160802:93-nf] It is not clear what he means by helps, for the term is of very wide application; but who can say that he was wanting even in this grace, when through his labours such helps were manifestly afforded towards the salvation of mankind? Then as to his possessing the grace of \"government,\" what could be more excellent than his administration, when the Lord at that time governed so many churches by his personal agency, and governs them still in our day through his epistles? And in respect of the \"diversities of tongues,\" what tongues could have been wanting to him, when he says himself: \"I thank my God that I speak with tongues more than you all?\"[fn-29-P2994_1161473:94-nf] It being thus inevitable to suppose that not one of these was wanting to the Apostle Paul, the judges approved of Pelagius' answer, wherein he said \"that all graces were conferred upon him.\" But there are other graces in addition to these which are not mentioned here. For it is not to be supposed, however greatly the Apostle Paul excelled others as a member of Christ's body, that the very Head itself of the entire body did not receive more and ampler graces still, whether in His flesh or His soul as man; for such a created nature did the Word of God assume as His own into the unity of His Person, that He might be our Head, and we His body. And in very deed, if all gifts could be in each member, it would be evident that the similitude, which is used to illustrate this subject, of the several members of our body is inapplicable; for some things are common to the members in general, such as life and health, whilst other things arepeculiar to the separate members, since the ear has no perception of colours, nor the eye of voices. Hence it is written: \"If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? if the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?\"[fn-29-P2995_1162667:95-nf] Now this of course is not said as if it were impossible for God to impart to the ear the sense of seeing, or to the eye the function of hearing. However, what He does in Christ's body, which is the Church, and what the apostle meant by diversity of graces[fn-29-P2996_1162944:96-nf] as if through the different members, there might be gifts proper even to every one separately, is clearly known. Why, too, and on what ground they who raised the objection were so unwilling to have taken away all difference in graces, why, moreover, the bishops of the synod were able to approve of the answer given by Pelagius in deference to the Apostle Paul, in whom we admit the combination of all those graces which he mentioned in the one particular passage, is by this time clear also.","title":"On the Proceedings of Pelagius,","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_24_the_prescription_against_heretics_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The character of the times in which we live is such as to call forth from us even this admonition, that we ought not to be astonished at the heresies (which abound)[fn-31-P3132_1135045:2-nf] neither ought their existence to surprise us, for it was foretold that they should come to pass;[fn-31-P3133_1135152:3-nf] nor the fact that they subvert the faith of some, for their final cause is, by affording a trial to faith, to give it also the opportunity of being \"approved.\"[fn-31-P3134_1135377:4-nf] Groundless, therefore, and inconsiderate is the offence of the many[fn-31-P3135_1135463:5-nf] who are scandalized by the very fact that heresies prevail to such a degree.

Paul, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, sets his mark on certain who denied and doubted the resurrection.[fn-35-P3572_1214946:344-nf] This opinion was the especial property of the Sadducees.[fn-35-P3573_1215025:345-nf] A part of it, however, is maintained by Marcion and Apelles and Valentinus, and all other impugners of the resurrection. Writing also to the Galatians, he inveighs against such men as observed and defend circumcision and the (Mosaic) law.[fn-35-P3574_1215311:346-nf] Thus runs Hebion's heresy. Such also as \"forbid to marry\" he reproaches in his instructions to Timothy.[fn-35-P3575_1215433:347-nf] Now, this is the teaching of Marcion and his follower Apelles. (The apostle) directs a similar blow[fn-35-P3576_1215554:348-nf] against those who said that \"the resurrection was past already.\"[fn-35-P3577_1215640:349-nf] Such an opinion did the Valentinians assert of themselves.

From these primary eight[fn-35-P3582_1216142:354-nf] ten other ¦ons after them spring, and then the twelve others arise with their wonderful names, to complete the mere story of the thirty ¦ons. The same apostle, when disapproving of those who are \"in bondage to elements,\"[fn-35-P3583_1216440:355-nf] points us to some dogma of Hermogenes, who introduces matter as having no beginning,[fn-35-P3584_1216544:356-nf] and then compares it with God, who has no beginning.[fn-35-P3585_1216649:357-nf] By thus making the mother of the elements a goddess, he has it in his power \"to be in bondage\" to a being which he puts on a par with[fn-35-P3586_1216804:358-nf] God. John, however, in the Apocalypse is charged to chastise those \"who eat things sacrificed to idols,\" and \"who commit fornication.\"[fn-35-P3587_1216956:359-nf] There are even now another sort of Nicolaitans.Theirs is called the Gaian[fn-35-P3588_1217050:360-nf] heresy. But in his epistle he especially designates those as \"Antichrists\" who \"denied that Christ was come in the flesh,\"[fn-35-P3589_1217234:361-nf] and who refused to think that Jesus was the Son of God. The one dogma Marcion maintained; the other, Hebion.[fn-35-P3590_1217364:362-nf] The doctrine, however, of Simon's sorcery, which inculcated the worship of angels,[fn-35-P3591_1217479:363-nf] was itself actually reckoned amongst idolatries and condemned by the Apostle Peter in Simon's own person.","title":"The Prescription Against Heretics.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_17_book_vi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"How comes it, then, that you fail to see that the whole conception of your argument on the subject is being overthrown, and go on making yourself ridiculous with your childish web of sophistry, saying that, if we believe that He who was apparent to the senses has been made by God to be Christ and Lord, it necessarily follows that the Lord once more \"emptied Himself\" anew to become Man, and underwent a second birth? What advantage does your doctrine get from this? How does what you say show the King of creation to be created? For my own part I assert on the other side that our view is supported by those who contend against us, and that the rhetorician, in his exceeding attention to the matter, has failed to see that in pushing, as he supposed, the argument to an absurdity, he is fighting on the side of those whom he attacks, with the very weapons he uses for their overthrow. For if we are to believe that the change of condition in the case of Jesus was from a lofty state to a lowly one, and if the Divine and uncreated Nature alone transcends the creation, he will, perhaps, when he thoroughly surveys his own argument, come over to the ranks of truth, and agree that the Uncreated came to be in the created, in His love for man. But if he imagines that he demonstrates the created character of the Lord by showing that He, being God, took part in human nature, he will find many such passages to establish the same opinion which carry out their support of his argument in a similar way. For since He was the Word and was God, and \"afterwards,\" as the prophet says, \"was seen upon earth and conversed with men[fn-17-P1730_999407:54-nf] ,\" He will hereby be proved to be one of the creatures! And if this is held to be beside the question, similar passages too are not quite akin to the subject. For in sense it is just the same to say that the Word that was in the beginning was manifested to men through the flesh, and to say that being in the form of God He put on the form of a servant: and if one of these statements gives no help for the establishment of his blasphemy, he must needs give up the remaining one also. He is kind enough, however, to advise us to abandon our error, and to point out the truth which He himself maintains. He tells us that the Apostle Peter declares Him to have been made Who was in the beginning the Word and God. Well, if he were making up dreams for our amusement, and giving us information about the prophetic interpretation of the visions of sleep, there might be no risk in allowing him to set forth the riddles of his imagination at his pleasure. But when he tells us that he is explaining the Divine utterances, it is no longer safe for us to leave him to interpret the words as he likes. What does the Scripture say? \"God made Lord and Christ this Jesus whom ye crucified[fn-17-P1731_1000603:55-nf] .\" When everything, then, is found to concur-the demonstrative word denoting Him Who is spoken of by the Name of His Humanity, the charge against those who were stained with blood-guiltiness, the suffering of the Cross-our thought necessarily turns to that which was apparent to the senses. But he asserts that while Peter uses these words it is the pretemporal existence that is indicated by the word \"made\"[fn-17-P1732_1001030:56-nf] . Well, we may safely allow nurses and old wives to jest with children, and to lay down the meaning of dreams as they choose: but when inspired Scripture is set before us for exposition, the great Apostle forbids us to have recourse to old wives' tattle[fn-17-P1733_1001439:57-nf] . When I hear \"the Cross\" spoken of, I understand the Cross, and when I hear mention of a human name, I understand the nature which that name connotes. So when I hear from Peter that \"this\" one was made Lord and Christ, I do not doubt that he speaks of Him Who had been before the eyes of men, since the saints agree with one another in this matter as well as in others. For, as he says that He Who was crucified has been made Lord, so Paul also says that He was \"highly exalted[fn-17-P1734_1001970:58-nf] ,\" after the Passion and the Resurrection, not being exalted in so far forth as He is God. For what height is there more sublime than the Divine height, that he should say God was exalted thereunto? But he means that the lowliness of the Humanity was exalted, the word, I suppose, indicating the assimilation and union of the Man Who was assumed to the exalted state of the Divine Nature. And even if one were to allow him licence to misinterpret the Divine utterance, not even so will his argument conclude in accordance with the aim of his heresy. For be it granted that Peter does say of Him Who was in the beginning, \"God made Him Lord and Christ, this Jesus Whom ye crucified,\" we shall find that even so his blasphemy does not gain any strength against the truth. \"God made Him,\" he says, \"Lord and Christ.\" To which of the words are we to refer the word made? with which of those that are employed in this sentence are we to connect the word? There are three before us:-\"this,\" and \"Lord,\" and \"Christ.\" With which of these three will he construct the word \"made\"? No one is so bold against the truth as to deny that \"made\" has reference to \"Christ\" and \"Lord\"; for Peter says that He, being already whatever He was, was \"made Christ and Lord\" by the Father.","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_17_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"2.

They confirm the falsehoods of pretended godliness, for a canting hypocrisy always succeeds to defection from the faith: so that at least in word the reverence is retained, which the conscience has lost. Even that pretended piety they make impious by all manner of lies, violating by schemes of false doctrine the sacredness of the faith: for they pile up doctrines to suit their desires, and not according to the faith of the Gospel. They delight, with an uncontrollable pleasure, to have their itching ears tickled by the novelty of their favourite preaching; they estrange themselves utterly from the hearing of the truth, and surrender themselves entirely to fables: so that their incapacity for either speaking or understanding the truth invests their discourse with what is, to them, a semblance of truth.","title":"Book X","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_28_book_i_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But as God is eternal and rational, so, I think, He is perfect in all things. \"Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\"[fn-41-P4179_1362098:300-nf] Prove, then, that the goodness of your god also is a perfect one. That it is indeed imperfect has been already sufficiently shown, since it is found to be neither natural nor rational. The same conclusion, however, shall now be made clear[fn-41-P4180_1362357:301-nf] by another method; it is not simply[fn-41-P4181_1362412:302-nf] imperfect, but actually[fn-41-P4182_1362452:303-nf] feeble, weak, and exhausted, failing to embrace the full number[fn-41-P4183_1362529:304-nf] of its material objects, and not manifesting itself in them all. For all are not put into a state of salvation[fn-41-P4184_1362661:305-nf] by it; but the Creator's subjects, both Jew and Christian, are all excepted.[fn-41-P4185_1362778:306-nf] Now, when the greater part thus perish, how can that goodness be defended as a perfect one which is inoperative in most cases, is somewhat only in few, naught in many, succumbs to perdition, and is a partner with destruction?[fn-41-P4186_1363022:307-nf] And if so many shall miss salvation, it will not be with goodness, but with malignity, that the greater perfection will lie. For as it is the operation of goodness which brings salvation, so is it malevolence which thwarts it.[fn-41-P4187_1363274:308-nf] Since, however, this goodness) saves but few, and so rather leans to the alternative of not saving, it will show itself to greater perfection by not interposing help than by helping. Now, you will not be able to attribute goodness (to your god) in reference to the Creator, (if accompanied with) failure towards all. For whomsoever you call in to judge the question, it is as a dispenser of goodness, if so be such a title can be made out,[fn-41-P4188_1363739:309-nf] and not as a squanderer thereof, as you claim your god to be, that you must submit the divine character for determination. So long, then, as you prefer your god to the Creator on the simple ground of his goodness, and since he professes to have this attribute as solely and wholly his own, he ought not to have been wanting in it to any one. However, I do not now wish to prove that Marcion's god is imperfect in goodness because of the perdition of the greater number. I am content to illustrate this imperfection by the fact that even those whom he saves are found to possess but an imperfect salvation-that is, they are saved only so far as the soul is concerned,[fn-41-P4189_1364511:310-nf] but lost in their body, which, according to him, does not rise again. Now, whence comes this halving of salvation, if not from a failure of goodness? What could have been a better proof of a perfect goodness, than the recovery of the whole man to salvation? Totally damned by the Creator, he should have been totally restored by the most merciful god. I rather think that by Marcion's rule the body is baptized, is deprived of marriage,[fn-41-P4190_1365172:311-nf] is cruelly tortured in confession. But although sins are attributed to the body, yet they are preceded by the guilty concupiscence of the soul; nay, the first motion of sin must be ascribed to the soul, to which the flesh acts in the capacity of a servant. By and by, when freed from the soul, the flesh sins no more.[fn-41-P4191_1365607:312-nf] So that in this matter goodness is unjust, and likewise imperfect, in that it leaves to destruction the more harmless substance, which sins rather by compliance than in will. Now, although Christ put not on the verity of the flesh, as your heresy is pleased to assume, He still vouchsafed to take upon Him the semblance thereof. Surely, therefore, some regard was due to it from Him, because of this His reigned assumption of it. Besides, what else is man than flesh, since no doubt it was the corporeal rather than the spiritual[fn-41-P4192_1366170:313-nf] element from which the Author of man's nature gave him his designation?[fn-41-P4193_1366344:314-nf] \"And the Lord God made man of the dust of the ground,\" not of spiritual essence; this afterwards came from the divine afflatus: \"and man became a living soul.\" What, then, is man? Made, no doubt of it, of the dust; and God placed him in paradise, because He moulded him, not breathed him, into being-a fabric of flesh, not of spirit. Now, this being the case, with what face will you contend for the perfect character of that goodness which did not fail in some one particular only of man's deliverance, but in its general capacity? If that is a plenary grace and a substantial mercy which brings salvation to the soul alone, this were the better life which we now enjoy whole and entire; whereas to rise again but in part will be a chastisement, not a liberation. The proof of the perfect goodness is, that man, after his rescue, should be delivered from the domicile and power of the malignant deity unto the protection of the most good and merciful God. Poor dupe of Marcion, fever[fn-41-P4194_1367416:315-nf] is hard upon you; and your painful flesh produces a crop of all sorts of briers and thorns. Nor is it only to the Creator's thunderbolts that you lie exposed, or to wars, and pestilences, and His other heavier strokes, but even to His creeping insects. In what respect do you suppose yourself liberated from His kingdom when His flies are still creeping upon your face? If your deliverance lies in the future, why not also in the present, that it may be perfectly wrought? Far different is our condition in the sight of Him who is the Author, the Judge, the injured[fn-41-P4195_1368001:316-nf] Head of our race!

For God hath not preferred these eunuchs to such as have no place in His house, but assuredly to those who keep the desert of married life in begetting sons. For, when He saith, \"I will give unto them a place much better;\" He shows that one is also given unto the married, but much inferior. Therefore, to allow that in the house of God there will be the eunuchs after the flesh spoken of above, who were not in the People of Israel: because we see that these also themselves, whereas they become not Jews, yet become Christians: and that the Prophet spake not of them, who through purpose of continence seeking not marriage, make themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven: is any one so madly opposed to the truth as to believe that eunuchs made so in the flesh have a better place than married persons in the house of God, and to contend that persons being of pious purpose continent, chastening the body even unto contempt of marriage, making themselves eunuchs, not in the body, but in the very root of concupiscence, practising an heavenly and angelic life in an earthly mortal state, are on a level with the deserts of the married; and, being a Christian, to gainsay Christ when He praises those who have made themselves eunuchs, not for the sake of this world, but for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, affirming that this is of use for the present life, not for a future? What else remains for these, save to assert that the kingdom of heaven itself pertains unto this temporal life, wherein we now are? For why should not blind presumption advance even to this madness? And what more full of phrensy than this assertion? For, although at times the Church, even that which is at this time, is called the kingdom of heaven; certainly it is so called for this end, because it is being gathered together for a future and eternal life. Although, therefore, it have the promise of the present, and of a future life, yet in all its good works it looks not to \"the things that are seen, but to what are not seen. For what are seen are temporal; but what are not seen, are eternal.\"[fn-39-P3940_1880851:44-nf] ","title":"Of Holy Virginity.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_28_on_not_three_gods_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"If, then, every good thing and every good name, depending on that power and purpose which is without beginning, is brought to perfection in the power of the Spirit through the Only-begotten God, without mark of time or distinction (since there is no delay, existent or conceived, in the motion of the Divine will from the Father, through the Son, to the Spirit): and if Godhead also is one of the good names and concepts, it would not be proper to divide the name into a plurality, since the unity existing in the action prevents plural enumeration.

Now if any one says that we need not direct men how or what they should teach, since the Holy Spirit makes them teachers, he may as well say that we need not pray, since our Lord says, \"Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask Him;\"[fn-53-P5379_2855324:25-nf] or that the Apostle Paul should not have given directions to Timothy and Titus as to how or what they should teach others. And these three apostolic epistles ought to be constantly before the eyes of every one who has obtained the position of a teacher in the Church. In the First Epistle to Timothy do we not read: \"These things command and teach?\"[fn-53-P5380_2855691:26-nf] What these things are, has been told previously. Do we not read there: \"Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father?\"[fn-53-P5381_2855834:27-nf] Is it not said in the Second Epistle: \"Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me?\"[fn-53-P5382_2855956:28-nf] And is he not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth?\"[fn-53-P5383_2856038:29-nf] And in the same place: \"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine.\"[fn-53-P5384_2856199:30-nf] And so in the Epistle to Titus, does he not say that a bishop ought to \"hold fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers?\"[fn-53-P5385_2856427:31-nf] There, too, he says: \"But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: that the aged men be sober,\" and so on.[fn-53-P5386_2856560:32-nf] And there, too: \"These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers\"[fn-53-P5387_2856746:33-nf] and so on. What then are we to think? Does the apostle in any way contradict himself, when, though he says that men are made teachers by the operation of the Holy Spirit, he yet himself gives them directions how and what they should teach? Or are we to understand, that though the duty of men to teach even the teachers does not cease when the Holy Spirit is given, yet that neither is he who planteth anything, nor he who watereth, but God who giveth the increase?[fn-53-P5388_2857237:34-nf] Wherefore though holy men be our helpers, or even holy angels assist us, no one learns aright the things that pertain to life with God, until God makes him ready to learn from Himself, that God who is thus addressed in the psalm: \"Teach me to do Thy will; for Thou art my God.\"[fn-53-P5389_2857535:35-nf] And so the same apostle says to Timothy himself, speaking, of course, as teacher to disciple: \"But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.\"[fn-53-P5390_2857775:36-nf] For as the medicines which men apply to the bodies of their fellow-men are of no avail except God gives them virtue (who can heal without their aid, though they cannot without His), and yet they are applied; and if it be done from a sense of duty, it is esteemed a work of mercy or benevolence; so the aids of teaching, applied through the instrumentality of man, are of advantage to the soul only when God works to make them of advantage, who could give the gospel to man even without the help or agency of men.

We are well aware that it is not a stranger to God's blessing. But since the common instincts of mankind can plead sufficiently on its behalf, instincts which prompt by a spontaneous bias to take the high road of marriage for the procreation of children, whereas Virginity in a way thwarts this natural impulse, it is a superfluous task to compose formally an Exhortation to marriage. We put forward the pleasure of it instead, as a most doughty champion on its behalf. It may be however, notwithstanding this, that there is some need of such a treatise, occasioned by those who travesty the teaching of the Church. Such persons[fn-27-P2707_1849126:36-nf] \"have their conscience seared with a hot iron,\" as the Apostle expresses it; and very truly too, considering that, deserting the guidance of the Holy Spirit for the \"doctrines of devils,\" they have some ulcers and blisters stamped upon their hearts, abominating God's creatures, and calling them \"foul,\" \"seducing,\" \"mischievous,\" and so on. \"But what have I to do to judge them that are without[fn-27-P2708_1849541:37-nf] ?\" asks the Apostle. Truly those persons are outside the Court in which the words of our mysteries are spoken; they are not installed under God's roof, but in the monastery of the Evil One. They \"are taken captive by him at his will[fn-27-P2709_1849793:38-nf] .\" They therefore do not understand that all virtue is found in moderation, and that any declension to either side[fn-27-P2710_1849928:39-nf] of it becomes a vice. He, in fact, who grasps the middle point between doing too little and doing too much has hit the distinction between vice and virtue. Instances will make this clearer. Cowardice and audacity are two recognized vices opposed to each other; the one the defect, the other the excess of confidence; between them lies courage. Again, piety is neither atheism nor superstition; it is equally impious to deny a God and to believe in many gods. Is there need of more examples to bring this principle home? The man who avoids both meanness and prodigality will by this shunning of extremes form the moral habit of liberality; for liberality is the thing which is neither inclined to spend at random vast and useless sums, nor yet to be closely calculating in necessary expenses. We need not go into details in the case of all good qualities. Reason, in all of them, has established virtue to be a middle state between two extremes. Sobriety itself therefore is a middle state, and manifestly involves the two declensions on either side towards vice; he, that is, who is wanting in firmness of soul, and is so easily worsted in the combat with pleasure as never even to have approached the path of a virtuous and sober life, slides into shameful indulgence; while he who goes beyond the safe ground of sobriety and overshoots the moderation of this virtue, falls as it were from a precipice into the \"doctrines of devils,\" \"having his conscience seared with a hot iron.\" In declaring marriage abominable he brands himself with such reproaches; for \"if the tree is corrupt\" (as the Gospel says), \"the fruit also of the tree will be like it[fn-27-P2711_1851679:40-nf] \"; if a man is the shoot and fruitage of the tree of marriage, reproaches cast on that turn upon him who casts them[fn-27-P2712_1851937:41-nf] . These persons, then, are like branded criminals already; their conscience is covered with the stripes of this unnatural teaching. But our view of marriage is this; that, while the pursuit of heavenly things should be a man's first care, yet if he can use the advantages of marriage with sobriety and moderation, he need not despise this way of serving the state. An example might be found in the patriarch Isaac. He married Rebecca when he was past the flower of his age and his prime was well-nigh spent, so that his marriage was not the deed of passion, but because of God's blessing that should be upon his seed. He cohabited with her till the birth of her only children[fn-27-P2713_1852693:42-nf] , and then, closing the channels of the senses, lived wholly for the Unseen; for this is what seems to be meant by the mention in his history of the dimness of the Patriarch's eyes. But let that be as those think who are skilled in reading these meanings, and let us proceed with the continuity of our discourse. What then, were we saying? That in the cases where it is possible at once to be true to the diviner love, and to embrace wedlock, there is no reason for setting aside this dispensation of nature and misrepresenting as abominable that which is honourable. Let us take again our illustration of the water and the spring. Whenever the husbandman, in order to irrigate a particular spot, is bringing the stream thither, but there is need before it gets there of a small outlet, he will allow only so much to escape into that outlet as is adequate to supply the demand, and can then easily be blended again with the main stream. If, as an inexperienced and easy-going steward, he opens too wide a channel, there will be danger of the whole stream quitting its direct bed and pouring itself sideways. In the same way, if (as life does need a mutual succession) a man so treats this need as to give spiritual things the first thought, and because of the shortness[fn-27-P2714_1854143:43-nf] of the time indulges but sparingly the sexual passion and keeps it under restraint, that man would realize the character of the prudent husband man to which the Apostle exhorts us. About the details of paying these trifling debts of nature he will not be over-calculating, but the long hours of his prayers[fn-27-P2715_1854471:44-nf] will secure the purity which is the key-note of his life. He will always fear lest by this kind of indulgence he may become nothing but flesh and blood; for in them God's Spirit does not dwell. He who is of so weak a character that he cannot make a manful stand against nature's impulse had better[fn-27-P2716_1855070:45-nf] keep himself very far away from such temptations, rather than descend into a combat which is above his strength. There is no small danger for him lest, cajoled in the valuation of pleasure, he should think that there exists no other good but that which is enjoyed along with some sensual emotion, and, turning altogether from the love of immaterial delights, should become entirely of the flesh, seeking always his pleasure only there, so that his character will be a Pleasure-lover, not a God-lover. It is not every man's gift, owing to weakness of nature, to hit the due proportion in these matters; there is a danger of being carried far beyond it, and \"sticking fast in the deep mire[fn-27-P2717_1855821:46-nf] ,\" to use the Psalmist's words. It would therefore be for our interest, as our discourse has been suggesting, to pass through life without a trial of these temptations, lest under cover of the excuse of lawful indulgence passion should gain an entrance into the citadel of the soul.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"This reasoning and intelligent creature, man, at once the work and the likeness of the Divine and Imperishable Mind (for so in the Creation it is written of him that \"God made man in His image[fn-27-P2750_1875856:67-nf] \"), this creature, I say, did not in the course of his first production have united to the very essence of his nature the liability to passion and to death. Indeed, the truth about the image could never have been maintained if the beauty reflected in that image had been in the slightest degree opposed[fn-27-P2751_1876176:68-nf] to the Archetypal Beauty. Passion was introduced afterwards, subsequent to man's first organization; and it was in this way. Being the image and the likeness, as has been said, of the Power which rules all things, man kept also in the matter of a Free-Will this likeness to Him whose Will is over all. He was enslaved to no outward necessity whatever; his feeling towards that which pleased him depended only on his own private judgment; he was free to choose whatever he liked; and so he was a free agent, though circumvented with cunning, when he drew upon himself that disaster which now overwhelms humanity. He became himself the discoverer of evil, but he did not therein discover what God had made; for God did not make death. Man became, in fact, himself the fabricator, to a certain extent, and the craftsman of evil. All who have the faculty of sight may enjoy equally the sunlight; and any one can if he likes put this enjoyment from him by shutting his eyes: in that case it is not that the sun retires and produces that darkness, but the man himself puts a barrier between his eye and the sunshine; the faculty of vision cannot indeed, even in the closing of the eyes, remain inactive[fn-27-P2752_1877419:69-nf] , and so this operative sight necessarily becomes an operative darkness[fn-27-P2753_1877504:70-nf] rising up in the man from his own free act in ceasing to see. Again, a man in building a house for himself may omit to make in it any way of entrance for the light; he will necessarily be in darkness, though he cuts himself off from the light voluntarily. So the first man on the earth, or rather he who generated evil in man, had for choice the Good and the Beautiful lying all around him in the very nature of things; yet he wilfully cut out a new way for himself against this nature, and in the act of turning away from virtue, which was his own free act, he created the usage of evil. For, be it observed, there is no such thing in the world as evil irrespective of a will, and discoverable in a substance apart from that. Every creature of God is good, and nothing of His \"to be rejected\"; all that God made was \"very good[fn-27-P2754_1878356:71-nf] .\" But the habit of sinning entered as we have described, and with fatal quickness, into the life of man; and from that small beginning spread into this infinitude of evil. Then that godly beauty of the soul which was an imitation of the Archetypal Beauty, like fine steel blackened[fn-27-P2755_1878669:72-nf] with the vicious rust, preserved no longer the glory of its familiar essence, but was disfigured with the ugliness of sin. This thing so great and precious[fn-27-P2756_1878843:73-nf] , as the Scripture calls him, this being man, has fallen from his proud birthright. As those who have slipped and fallen heavily into mud, and have all their features so besmeared with it, that their nearest friends do not recognize them, so this creature has fallen into the mire of sin and lost the blessing of being an image of the imperishable Deity; he has clothed himself instead with a perishable and foul resemblance to something else; and this Reason counsels him to put away again by washing it off in the cleansing water of this calling[fn-27-P2757_1879651:74-nf] . The earthly envelopment once removed, the soul's beauty will again appear. Now the putting off of a strange accretion is equivalent to the return to that which is familiar and natural; yet such a return cannot be but by again becoming that which in the beginning we were created. In fact this likeness to the divine is not our work at all; it is not the achievement of any faculty of man; it is the great gift of God bestowed upon our nature at the very moment of our birth; human efforts can only go so far as to clear away the filth of sin, and so cause the buried beauty of the soul to shine forth again. This truth is, I think, taught in the Gospel, when our Lord says, to those who can hear what Wisdom speaks beneath a mystery, that \"the Kingdom of God is within you[fn-27-P2758_1880490:75-nf] .\" That word[fn-27-P2759_1880526:76-nf] points out the fact that the Divine good is not something apart from our nature, and is not removed far away from those who have the will to seek it; it is in fact within each of us, ignored indeed, and unnoticed while it is stifled beneath the cares and pleasures of life, but found again whenever we can turn our power of conscious thinking towards it. If further confirmation of what we say is required, I think it will be found in what is suggested by our Lord in the searching for the Lost Drachma[fn-27-P2760_1881122:77-nf] . The thought, there, is that the widowed soul reaps no benefit from the other virtues (called drachmas in the Parable) being all of them found safe, if that one other is not amongst them. The Parable therefore suggests that a candle should first be lit, signifying doubtless our reason which throws light on hidden principles; then that in one's own house, that is, within oneself, we should search for that lost coin; and by that coin the Parable doubtless hints at the image of our King, not yet hopelessly lost, but hidden beneath the dirt; and by this last we must understand the impurities of the flesh, which, being swept and purged away by carefulness of life, leave clear to the view the object of our search. Then it is meant that the soul herself who finds this rejoices over it, and with her the neighbours, whom she calls in to share with her in this delight. Verily, all those powers which are the housemates of the soul, and which the Parable names her neighbours for this occasion[fn-27-P2761_1882139:78-nf] , when so be that the image of the mighty King is revealed in all its brightness at last (that image which the Fashioner of each individual heart of us has stamped upon this our Drachma[fn-27-P2762_1882335:79-nf] ), will then be converted to that divine delight and festivity, and will gaze upon the ineffable beauty of the recovered one. \"Rejoice with me,\" she says, \"because I have found the Drachma which I had lost.\" The neighbours, that is, the soul's familiar powers, both the reasoning and the appetitive, the affections of grief and of anger, and all the rest that are discerned in her, at that joyful feast which celebrates the finding of the heavenly Drachma are well called her friends also; and it is meet that they should all rejoice in the Lord when they all look towards the Beautiful and the Good, and do everything for the glory of God, no longer instruments of sin[fn-27-P2763_1883036:80-nf] . If, then, such is the lesson of this Finding of the lost, viz. that we should restore the divine image from the foulness which the flesh wraps round it to its primitive state, let us become that which the First Man was at the moment when he first breathed. And what was that? Destitute he was then of his covering of dead skins, but he could gaze without shrinking upon God's countenance. He did not yet judge of what was lovely by taste or sight; he found in the Lord alone all that was sweet; and he used the helpmeet given him only for this delight, as Scripture signifies when it said that \"he knew her not[fn-27-P2764_1883667:81-nf] \" till he was driven forth from the garden, and till she, for the sin which she was decoyed into committing, was sentenced to the pangs of childbirth. We, then, who in our first ancestor were thus ejected, are allowed to return to our earliest state of blessedness by the very same stages by which we lost Paradise. What are they? Pleasure, craftily offered, began the Fall, and there followed after pleasure shame, and fear, even to remain longer in the sight of their Creator, so that they hid themselves in leaves and shade; and after that they covered themselves with the skins of dead animals; and then were sent forth into this pestilential and exacting land where, as the compensation for having to die, marriage was instituted[fn-27-P2765_1884419:82-nf] . Now if we are destined \"to depart hence, and be with Christ[fn-27-P2766_1884500:83-nf] ,\" we must begin at the end of the route of departure (which ties nearest to ourselves); just as those who have travelled far from their friends at home, when they turn to reach again the place from which they started, first leave that district which they reached at the end of their outward journey. Marriage, then, is the last stage of our separation from the life that was led in Paradise; marriage therefore, as our discourse has been suggesting, is the first thing to be left; it is the first station as it were for our departure to Christ. Next, we must retire from all anxious toil upon the land, such as man was bound to after his sin. Next we must divest ourselves of those coverings of our nakedness, the coats of skins, namely the wisdom of the flesh; we must renounce all shameful things done in secret[fn-27-P2767_1885336:84-nf] , and be covered no longer with the fig-leaves of this bitter world; then, when we have torn off the coatings of this life's perishable leaves, we must stand again in the sight of our Creator; and repelling all the illusion of taste and sight, take for our guide God's commandment only, instead of the venom-spitting serpent. That commandment was, to touch nothing but what was Good, and to leave what was evil untasted; because impatience to remain any longer in ignorance of evil would be but the beginning of the long train of actual evil. For this reason it was forbidden to our first parents to grasp the knowledge of the opposite to the good, as well as that of the good itself; they were to keep themselves from \"the knowledge of good and evil[fn-27-P2768_1886106:85-nf] ,\" and to enjoy the Good in its purity, unmixed with one particle of evil: and to enjoy that, is in my judgment nothing else than to be ever with God, and to feel ceaselessly and continually this delight, unalloyed by aught that could tear us away from it. One might even be bold to say that this might be found the way by which a man could be again caught up into Paradise out of this world which lieth in the Evil, into that Paradise where Paul was when he saw the unspeakable sights which it is not lawful for a man to talk of[fn-27-P2769_1886654:86-nf] .","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"This reasoning and intelligent creature, man, at once the work and the likeness of the Divine and Imperishable Mind (for so in the Creation it is written of him that \"God made man in His image[fn-27-P2750_1875856:67-nf] \"), this creature, I say, did not in the course of his first production have united to the very essence of his nature the liability to passion and to death.

All who have the faculty of sight may enjoy equally the sunlight; and any one can if he likes put this enjoyment from him by shutting his eyes: in that case it is not that the sun retires and produces that darkness, but the man himself puts a barrier between his eye and the sunshine; the faculty of vision cannot indeed, even in the closing of the eyes, remain inactive[fn-27-P2752_1877419:69-nf] , and so this operative sight necessarily becomes an operative darkness[fn-27-P2753_1877504:70-nf] rising up in the man from his own free act in ceasing to see. Again, a man in building a house for himself may omit to make in it any way of entrance for the light; he will necessarily be in darkness, though he cuts himself off from the light voluntarily. So the first man on the earth, or rather he who generated evil in man, had for choice the Good and the Beautiful lying all around him in the very nature of things; yet he wilfully cut out a new way for himself against this nature, and in the act of turning away from virtue, which was his own free act, he created the usage of evil. For, be it observed, there is no such thing in the world as evil irrespective of a will, and discoverable in a substance apart from that. Every creature of God is good, and nothing of His \"to be rejected\"; all that God made was \"very good[fn-27-P2754_1878356:71-nf] .\" But the habit of sinning entered as we have described, and with fatal quickness, into the life of man; and from that small beginning spread into this infinitude of evil. Then that godly beauty of the soul which was an imitation of the Archetypal Beauty, like fine steel blackened[fn-27-P2755_1878669:72-nf] with the vicious rust, preserved no longer the glory of its familiar essence, but was disfigured with the ugliness of sin. This thing so great and precious[fn-27-P2756_1878843:73-nf] , as the Scripture calls him, this being man, has fallen from his proud birthright. As those who have slipped and fallen heavily into mud, and have all their features so besmeared with it, that their nearest friends do not recognize them, so this creature has fallen into the mire of sin and lost the blessing of being an image of the imperishable Deity; he has clothed himself instead with a perishable and foul resemblance to something else; and this Reason counsels him to put away again by washing it off in the cleansing water of this calling[fn-27-P2757_1879651:74-nf] . The earthly envelopment once removed, the soul's beauty will again appear. Now the putting off of a strange accretion is equivalent to the return to that which is familiar and natural; yet such a return cannot be but by again becoming that which in the beginning we were created. In fact this likeness to the divine is not our work at all; it is not the achievement of any faculty of man; it is the great gift of God bestowed upon our nature at the very moment of our birth; human efforts can only go so far as to clear away the filth of sin, and so cause the buried beauty of the soul to shine forth again. This truth is, I think, taught in the Gospel, when our Lord says, to those who can hear what Wisdom speaks beneath a mystery, that \"the Kingdom of God is within you[fn-27-P2758_1880490:75-nf] .\" That word[fn-27-P2759_1880526:76-nf] points out the fact that the Divine good is not something apart from our nature, and is not removed far away from those who have the will to seek it; it is in fact within each of us, ignored indeed, and unnoticed while it is stifled beneath the cares and pleasures of life, but found again whenever we can turn our power of conscious thinking towards it. If further confirmation of what we say is required, I think it will be found in what is suggested by our Lord in the searching for the Lost Drachma[fn-27-P2760_1881122:77-nf] . The thought, there, is that the widowed soul reaps no benefit from the other virtues (called drachmas in the Parable) being all of them found safe, if that one other is not amongst them. The Parable therefore suggests that a candle should first be lit, signifying doubtless our reason which throws light on hidden principles; then that in one's own house, that is, within oneself, we should search for that lost coin; and by that coin the Parable doubtless hints at the image of our King, not yet hopelessly lost, but hidden beneath the dirt; and by this last we must understand the impurities of the flesh, which, being swept and purged away by carefulness of life, leave clear to the view the object of our search. Then it is meant that the soul herself who finds this rejoices over it, and with her the neighbours, whom she calls in to share with her in this delight. Verily, all those powers which are the housemates of the soul, and which the Parable names her neighbours for this occasion[fn-27-P2761_1882139:78-nf] , when so be that the image of the mighty King is revealed in all its brightness at last (that image which the Fashioner of each individual heart of us has stamped upon this our Drachma[fn-27-P2762_1882335:79-nf] ), will then be converted to that divine delight and festivity, and will gaze upon the ineffable beauty of the recovered one. \"Rejoice with me,\" she says, \"because I have found the Drachma which I had lost.\" The neighbours, that is, the soul's familiar powers, both the reasoning and the appetitive, the affections of grief and of anger, and all the rest that are discerned in her, at that joyful feast which celebrates the finding of the heavenly Drachma are well called her friends also; and it is meet that they should all rejoice in the Lord when they all look towards the Beautiful and the Good, and do everything for the glory of God, no longer instruments of sin[fn-27-P2763_1883036:80-nf] . If, then, such is the lesson of this Finding of the lost, viz. that we should restore the divine image from the foulness which the flesh wraps round it to its primitive state, let us become that which the First Man was at the moment when he first breathed. And what was that? Destitute he was then of his covering of dead skins, but he could gaze without shrinking upon God's countenance. He did not yet judge of what was lovely by taste or sight; he found in the Lord alone all that was sweet; and he used the helpmeet given him only for this delight, as Scripture signifies when it said that \"he knew her not[fn-27-P2764_1883667:81-nf] \" till he was driven forth from the garden, and till she, for the sin which she was decoyed into committing, was sentenced to the pangs of childbirth. We, then, who in our first ancestor were thus ejected, are allowed to return to our earliest state of blessedness by the very same stages by which we lost Paradise. What are they? Pleasure, craftily offered, began the Fall, and there followed after pleasure shame, and fear, even to remain longer in the sight of their Creator, so that they hid themselves in leaves and shade; and after that they covered themselves with the skins of dead animals; and then were sent forth into this pestilential and exacting land where, as the compensation for having to die, marriage was instituted[fn-27-P2765_1884419:82-nf] . Now if we are destined \"to depart hence, and be with Christ[fn-27-P2766_1884500:83-nf] ,\" we must begin at the end of the route of departure (which ties nearest to ourselves); just as those who have travelled far from their friends at home, when they turn to reach again the place from which they started, first leave that district which they reached at the end of their outward journey. Marriage, then, is the last stage of our separation from the life that was led in Paradise; marriage therefore, as our discourse has been suggesting, is the first thing to be left; it is the first station as it were for our departure to Christ. Next, we must retire from all anxious toil upon the land, such as man was bound to after his sin. Next we must divest ourselves of those coverings of our nakedness, the coats of skins, namely the wisdom of the flesh; we must renounce all shameful things done in secret[fn-27-P2767_1885336:84-nf] , and be covered no longer with the fig-leaves of this bitter world; then, when we have torn off the coatings of this life's perishable leaves, we must stand again in the sight of our Creator; and repelling all the illusion of taste and sight, take for our guide God's commandment only, instead of the venom-spitting serpent. That commandment was, to touch nothing but what was Good, and to leave what was evil untasted; because impatience to remain any longer in ignorance of evil would be but the beginning of the long train of actual evil. For this reason it was forbidden to our first parents to grasp the knowledge of the opposite to the good, as well as that of the good itself; they were to keep themselves from \"the knowledge of good and evil[fn-27-P2768_1886106:85-nf] ,\" and to enjoy the Good in its purity, unmixed with one particle of evil: and to enjoy that, is in my judgment nothing else than to be ever with God, and to feel ceaselessly and continually this delight, unalloyed by aught that could tear us away from it. One might even be bold to say that this might be found the way by which a man could be again caught up into Paradise out of this world which lieth in the Evil, into that Paradise where Paul was when he saw the unspeakable sights which it is not lawful for a man to talk of[fn-27-P2769_1886654:86-nf] .","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"ANF-10","text":"First let us look at the words, \"He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\" That is equivalent to saying that He is not the God of sinners but of saints. For it was a great gift to the Patriarchs that God in place of His own name should add their name to His own designation as God, as Paul says,[fn-65-P6503_1100686:48-nf] \"Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God.\" He is the God, therefore, of the fathers and of all the saints; it might be hard to find a passage to the effect that God is the God of any of the wicked. If, then, He is the God of the saints, and is said to be the God of the living, then the saints are the living and the living are saints; neither is there any saint outside the living, nor when any one is called living is the further implication absent that in addition to his having life he is a holy one. Near akin to this is the lesson to be drawn from the saying,[fn-65-P6504_1101282:49-nf] \"I shall be well pleasing to the Lord in the land of the living.\" The good pleasure of tile Lord, he appears to say, is in the ranks of the saints, or in the place of the saints, and it is there that he hopes to be. No one pleases God well who has not entered the rank of the saints, or the place of the saints; and to that place every one must come who has assumed beforehand, as it were in this life, the shadow and image of true God-pleasing. The passage which declares that before God no living being shall be justified shows that in comparison with God and the righteousness that is in Him none, even of the most finished saints, will be justified. We might take a parable from another quarter and say that no candle can give light before the sun, not that the candle will not give light, only it will not when the sun out-shines it. In the same way every \"living\" will be justified, only not before God, when it is compared with those who are below and who are in the power of darkness. To them the light of the saints will shine. Here, perhaps, we have the key to the meaning of that verse:[fn-65-P6505_1102398:50-nf] \"Let your light shine before men.\" He does not say, Let your light shine before God; had he said so he would have given a commandment impossible of fulfilment, as if he had bidden those lights which have souls to let their light shine before the sun. It is not only, therefore, the ordinary mass of the living who will not be justified before God, but even those among the living who are distinguished above the rest, or, to put it more truly, the whole righteousness of the living will not be justified before God, as compared with the righteousness of God, as if I were to call together all the lights which shine on the earth by night, and to say that they could not give light in comparison with the rays of the sun. We rise from these considerations to a higher level when we take the words before our minds, \"I live, saith the Lord.\" Life, in the full sense of the word, especially after what we have been saying on the subject, belongs perhaps to God and none but Him. Is this the reason why the Apostle, after speaking of the supreme excellency of the life of God and being led to the highest expression about it, says about God (showing in this a true understanding of that saying, \"I live, saith the Lord\"); \"who only hath immortality.\"[fn-65-P6506_1103663:51-nf] No living being besides God has life free from change and variation.

Then again, there are so many commandments which in some way are expressly adapted to the human will; for instance, there is, \"Be not overcome of evil,\"[fn-59-P5905_2315286:11-nf] and others of similar import, such as, \"Be not like a horse or a mule, which have no understanding;\"[fn-59-P5906_2315405:12-nf] and, \"Reject not the counsels of thy mother;\"[fn-59-P5907_2315470:13-nf] and, \"Be not wise in thine own conceit;\"[fn-59-P5908_2315528:14-nf] and, \"Despise not the chastening of the Lord;\"[fn-59-P5909_2315594:15-nf] and, \"Forget not my law;\"[fn-59-P5910_2315640:16-nf] and, \"Forbear not to do good to the poor;\"[fn-59-P5911_2315702:17-nf] and, \"Devise not evil against thy friend;\"[fn-59-P5912_2315765:18-nf] and, \"Give no heed to a worthless woman;[fn-59-P5913_2315826:19-nf] and, \"He is not inclined to understand how to do good;\"[fn-59-P5914_2315899:20-nf] and, \"They refused to attend to my counsel;\"[fn-59-P5915_2315963:21-nf] with numberless other passages of the inspired Scriptures of the Old Testament. And what do they all show us but the free choice of the human will? So, again, in the evangelical and apostolic books of the New Testament what other lesson is taught us? As when it is said, \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth; \"[fn-59-P5916_2316303:22-nf] and, \"Fear not them which kill the body;\"[fn-59-P5917_2316364:23-nf] and, \"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself;\"[fn-59-P5918_2316441:24-nf] and again, \"Peace on earth to men of good will.\"[fn-59-P5919_2316510:25-nf] So also that the Apostle Paul says: \"Let him do what he willeth; he sinneth not if he marry. Nevertheless, he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.\"[fn-59-P5920_2316806:26-nf] And so again,\" If I do this willingly, I have a reward;\"[fn-59-P5921_2316888:27-nf] while in another passage he says, \"Be ye sober and righteous, and sin not;\"[fn-59-P5922_2316984:28-nf] and again, \"As ye have a readiness to will, so also let there be a prompt performance;\"[fn-59-P5923_2317092:29-nf] then he remarks to Timothy about the younger widows, \"When they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they choose to marry.\" So in another passage, \"All that will to live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution;\"[fn-59-P5924_2317337:30-nf] while to Timothy himself he says, \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee.\"[fn-59-P5925_2317432:31-nf] Then to Philemon he addresses this explanation: \"That thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but of thine own will.\"[fn-59-P5926_2317581:32-nf] Servants also he advises to obey their masters \"with a good will.\"[fn-59-P5927_2317666:33-nf] In strict accordance with this, James says: \"Do not err, my beloved brethren . . . and have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect to persons;\"[fn-59-P5928_2317840:34-nf] and,\" Do not speak evil one of another.\"[fn-59-P5929_2317908:35-nf] So also John in his Epistle writes,\" Do not love the world,\"[fn-59-P5930_2317987:36-nf] and other things of the same import. Now wherever it is said, \"Do not do this,\" and \"Do not do that,\" and wherever there is any requirement in the divine admonitions for the work of the will to do anything, or to refrain from doing anything, there is at once a sufficient proof of free will. No man, therefore, when he sins, can in his heart blame God for it, but every man must impute the fault to himself. Nor does it detract at all from a man's own will when he performs any act in accordance with God. Indeed, a work is then to be pronounced a good one when a person does it willingly; then, too, may the reward of a good work be hoped for from Him concerning whom it is written, \"He shall reward every man according to his works.\"[fn-59-P5931_2318743:37-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_13_book_ix_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And they continue in an orderly manner, and with perseverance pray from early dawn, and they do not speak a word unless they have praised God in a hymn.

You are unjust in condemning us, as you do now, as followers of the doctrine of devils, because we require the priestly class to abstain from animal food; for we limit the prohibition to the priesthood, while you hold that your prophets, and Moses himself, who forbade all classes of men to eat the flesh of swine, and hares, and conies, besides all varieties of cuttle-fish, and all fish wanting scales, said this not in a lying spirit, nor in the doctrine of devils, but from God, and in the Holy Spirit.

Augustin replied: Listen, and you shall hear what we mean and intend by quoting this verse against you, since you say that you do not know. It is not that you abstain from animal food; for, as you observe, our ancient fathers abstained from some kinds of food, not, however, as condemning them, but with a typical meaning, which you do not understand, and of which I have said already in this work all that appeared necessary. Besides, Christians, not heretics, but Catholics, in order to subdue the body, that the soul may be more humbled in prayer, abstain not only from animal food, but also from some vegetable productions, without, however, believing them to be unclean. A few do this always; and at certain seasons or days, as in Lent, almost all, more or less, according to the choice or ability of individuals. You, on the other hand, deny that the creature is good, and call it unclean, saying that animals are made by the devil of the worst impurities in the substance of evil and so you reject them with horror, as being the most cruel and loathsome places of confinement of your god. You, as a concession, allow your followers, as distinct from the priests, to eat animal food; as the apostle allows, in certain cases, not marriage in the general sense, but the indulgence of passion in marriage.[fn-24-P2443_1480696:6-nf] It is only sin which is thus made allowance for. This is the feeling you have toward all animal food; you have learned it from your heresy, and you teach it to your followers. You make allowance for your followers, because, as I said before, they supply you with necessaries; but you grant them indulgence without saying that it is not sinful. For yourselves, you shun contact with this evil and impurity; and hence our reason for quoting this verse against you is found in the words of the apostle which follow those with which you end the quotation. Perhaps it was for this reason that you left out the words, and then say that you do not know what we mean or intend by the quotation; for it suited you better to omit the account of our intention than to express it. For, after speaking of abstaining from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by believers, the apostle goes on, \"And by them who know the truth; for every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.\"[fn-24-P2444_1481807:7-nf] This you deny; for your idea, and motive, and belief in abstaining from such food is, that they are not typically, but naturally, evil and impure.

The world of thought is bodiless, impalpable, and figureless; but the sensible is, by its very name, bounded by those perceptions which come through the organs of sense. But as in the sensible world itself, though there is a considerable mutual opposition of its various elements, yet a certain harmony maintained in those opposites has been devised by the wisdom that rules the Universe, and thus there is produced a concord of the whole creation with itself, and the natural contrariety does not break the chain of agreement;in like manner, owing to the Divine wisdom,there is an admixture and interpenetration ofthe sensible with the intellectual department, in order that all things may equally have a share in the beautiful, and no single one of existing things be without its share in that superior world.For this reason the corresponding locality of the intellectual world is a subtitle and mobile essence, which, in accordance with its supramundane habitation, has in its peculiar nature large affinity with the intellectual part. Now, by a provision of the supreme Mind there is an intermixture of the intellectual with the sensible world, in order that nothing in creation may be thrown aside[fn-38-P3875_2546975:24-nf] as worthless, as says the Apostle, or be left without its portion of the Divine fellowship. On this account it is that the com mixture of the intellectual and sensible in man is effected by the Divine Being, as the description of the cosmogony instructs us. It tells us that God, taking dust of the ground, formed the man, and by an inspiration from Himself He planted life in the work of His hand, that thus the earthy might be raised up to the Divine, and so one certain grace of equal value might pervade the whole creation, the lower nature being mingled with the supramundane. Since, then, the intellectual nature had a previous existence, and to each of the angelic powers a certain operation was assigned, for the organization of the whole, by the authority that presides over all things, there was a certain power ordained to hold together and sway the earthly region[fn-38-P3876_2547919:25-nf] , constituted for this purpose by the power that administers the Universe. Upon that there was fashioned that thing moulded of earth, an \"image\" copied from the superior Power. Now this living being was man. In him, by an ineffable influence, the godlike beauty of the intellectual nature was mingled. He to whom the administration of the earth has been consigned takes it ill and thinks it not to be borne, if, of that nature which has been subjected to him, any being shall be exhibited bearing likeness to his transcendent dignity. But the question, how one who had been created for no evil purpose by Him who framed the system of the Universe in goodness fell away, nevertheless, into this passion of envy, it is not a part of my present business minutely to discuss; though it would not be difficult, and it would not take long, to offer an account to those who are amenable to persuasion. For the distinctive difference between virtue and vice is not to be contemplated as that between two actually subsisting phenomena; but as there is a logical opposition between that which is and that which is not, and it is not possible to say that, as regards subsistency, that which is not is distinguished from that which is, but we say that nonentity is only logically opposed to entity, in the same way also the word vice is opposed to the word virtue, not as being any existence in itself, but only as becoming thinkable by the absence of the better. As we say that blindness is logically opposed to sight, not that blindness has of itself a natural existence, being only a deprivation of a preceding faculty, so also we say that vice is to be regarded as the deprivation of goodness, just as a shadow which supervenes at the passage of the solar ray. Since, then, the uncreated nature is incapable of admitting of such movement as is implied in turning or change or alteration, while everything that subsists through creation has connection with change, inasmuch as the subsistence itself of the creation had its rise in change, that which was not passing by the Divine power into that which is; and since the above-mentioned power was created too, and could choose by a spontaneous movement whatever he liked, when he had closed his eyes to the good and the ungrudging like one who in the sunshine lets his eyelids down upon his eyes and sees only darkness, in this way that being also, by his very unwillingness to perceive the good, became cognisant of the contrary to goodness. Now this is Envy. Well, it is undeniable that the beginning of any matter is the cause of everything else that by consequence follows upon it, as, for instance, upon health there follows a good habit of body, activity, and a pleasurable life, but upon sickness, weakness, want of energy, and life passed in distaste of everything; and so, in all other instances, things follow by consequence their proper beginnings. As, then, freedom from the agitation of the passions is the beginning and groundwork of a life in accordance with virtue, so the bias to vice generated by that Envy is the constituted road to all these evils which have been since displayed. For when once he, who by his apostacy from goodness had begotten in himself this Envy, had received this bias to evil[fn-38-P3877_2552463:26-nf] , like a rock, torn asunder from a mountain ridge, which is driven down headlong by its own weight, in like manner he, dragged away from his original natural propension to goodness and gravitating with all his weight in the direction of vice, was deliberately forced and borne away as by a kind of gravitation to the utmost limit of iniquity; and as for that intellectual power which he had received from his Creator to co-operate with the better endowments, this he made his assisting instrument in the discovery of contrivances for the purposes of vice, while by his crafty skill he deceives and circumvents man, persuading him to become his own murderer with his own hands. For seeing that man by the commission of the Divine blessing had been elevated to a lofty pre-eminence (for he was appointed king over the earth and all things on it; he was beautiful in his form, being created an image of the archetypal beauty; he was without passion in his nature, for he was an imitation of the unimpassioned; he was full of frankness, delighting in a face-to-face manifestation of the personal Deity),-all this was to the adversary the fuel to his passion of envy. Yet could he not by any exercise of strength or dint of force accomplish his purpose, for the strength of God's blessing over-mastered his own force. His plan, therefore, is to withdraw man from this enabling strength, that thus he may be easily captured by him and open to his treachery. As in a lamp when the flame has caught the wick and a person is unable to blow it out, he mixes water with the oil and by this devices will dull the flame, in the same way the enemy, by craftily mixing up badness in man's will, has produced a kind of extinguishment and dulness in the blessing, on the failure of which that which is opposed necessarily enters. For to life is opposed death, to strength weakness, to blessing curse, to frankness shame, and to all that is good whatever can be conceived as opposite. Thus it is that humanity is in its present evil condition, since that beginning introduced the occasions for such an ending.","title":"The Great Catechism","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_39_the_great_catechism","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But you will perhaps seek to know the cause of this error of judgment; for it is to this point that the train of our discussion tends.

Accordingly, the soul being fused into Him through faith derives from that the means and occasion of salvation; for the act of union with the life implies a fellowship with the life. But the body comes into fellowship and blending with the Author of our salvation in another way. For as they who owing to some act of treachery have taken poison, allay its deadly influence by means of some other drug (for it is necessary that the antidote should enter the human vitals in the same way as the deadly poison, in order to secure, through them, that the effect of the remedy may be distributed through the entire system), in like manner we, who have tasted the solvent of our nature[fn-40-P4048_2685745:103-nf] , necessarily need something that may combine what has been so dissolved, so that such an antidote entering within us may, by its own counter-influence, undo the mischief introduced into the body by the poison. What, then, is this remedy to be? Nothing else than that very Body which has been shown to be superior to death, and has been the First-fruits of our life. For, in the manner that, as the Apostle says[fn-40-P4049_2686476:104-nf] , a little leaven assimilates to itself the whole lump, so in like manner that body to which immortality has been given it by God, when it is in ours, translates and transmutes the whole into itself. For as by the admixture of a poisonous liquid with a wholesome one the whole drought is deprived of its deadly effect, so too the immortal Body, by being within that which receives it, changes the whole to its own nature. Yet in no other way can anything enter within the body but by being transfused through the vitals by eating and drinking. It is, therefore, incumbent on the body to admit this life-producing power in the one way that its constitution makes possible. And since that Body only which was the receptacle of the Deity received this grace of immortality, and since it has been shown that in no other way was it possible for our body to become immortal, but by participating in incorruption through its fellowship with that immortal Body, it will be necessary to consider how it was possible that that one Body, being for ever portioned to so many myriads of the faithful throughout the whole world, enters through that portion, whole into each individual, and yet remains whole in itself. In order, therefore, that our faith, with eyes fixed on logical probability, may harbour no doubt on the subject before us, it is fitting to make a slight digression in our argument, to consider the physiology of the body. Who is there that does not know that our bodily frame, taken by itself, possesses no life in its own proper subsistence, but that it is by the influx of a force or power from without that it holds itself together and continues in existence, and by a ceaseless motion that it draws to itself what it wants, and repels what is superfluous? When a leathern bottle is full of some liquid, and then the contents leak out at the bottom, it would not retain the contour of its full bulk unless there entered? at the top something else to fill up the vacuum; and thus a person, seeing the circumference of this bottle swollen to its full size, would know that this circumference did not really belong to the object which he sees, but that what was being poured in, by being in it, gave shape and roundness to the bulk. In the same way the mere framework of our body possesses nothing belonging to itself that is cognizable by us, to hold it together, but remains in existence owing to a force that is introduced into it. Now this power or force both is, and is called, nourishment. But it is not the same in all bodies that require aliment, but to each of them has been assigned a food adapted to its condition by Him who governs Nature. Some animals feed on roots which they dig up. Of others grass is the food, of others different kinds of flesh, but for man above all things bread; and, in order to continue and preserve the moisture of his body, drink, not simply water, but water frequently sweetened with wine, to join forces with our internal heat. He, therefore, who thinks of these things, thinks by implication[fn-40-P4050_2689538:105-nf] of the particular bulk of our body. For those things by being within me became my blood and flesh, the corresponding nutriment by its power of adaptation being changed into the form of my body. With these distinctions we must return to the consideration of the question before us. The question was, how can that one Body of Christ vivify the whole of mankind, all, that is, in whomsoever there is Faith, and yet, though divided amongst all, be itself not diminished? Perhaps, then, we are now not far from the probable explanation. If the subsistence of every body depends on nourishment, and this is eating and drinking, and in the case of our eating there is bread and in the case of our drinking water sweetened with wine, and if, as was explained at the beginning, the Word of God, Who is both God and the Word, coalesced with man's nature, and when He came in a body such as ours did not innovate on man's physical constitution so as to make it other than it was, but secured continuance for His own body by the customary and proper means, and controlled its subsistence by meat and drink, the former of which was bread,-just, then, as in the case of ourselves, as has been repeatedly said already, if a person sees bread he also, in a kind of way, looks on a human body, for by the bread being within it the bread becomes it, so also, in that other case, the body into which God entered, by partaking of the nourishment of bread, was, in a certain measure, the same with it; that nourishment, as we have said, changing itself into the nature of the body. For that which is peculiar to all flesh is acknowledged also in the case of that flesh, namely, that that Body too was maintained by bread; which Body also by the indwelling of God the Word was transmuted to the dignity of Godhead. Rightly, then, do we believe that now also the bread which is consecrated by the Word of God is changed into the Body of God the Word. For that Body was once, by implication, bread, but has been consecrated by the inhabitation of the Word that tabernacled in the flesh. Therefore, from the same cause as that by which the bread that was transformed in that Body was changed to a Divine potency, a similar result takes place now. For as in that case, too, the grace of the Word used to make holy the Body, the substance of which came of the bread, and in a manner was itself bread, so also in this case the bread, as says the Apostle[fn-40-P4051_2691980:106-nf] , \"is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer\"; not that it advances by the process of eating[fn-40-P4052_2692096:107-nf] to the stage of passing into the body of the Word, but it is at once changed into the body by means of the Word, as the Word itself said, \"This is My Body.\" Seeing, too, that all flesh is nourished by what is moist (for without this combination our earthly part would not continue to live), just as we support by food which is firm and solid the solid part of our body, in like manner we supplement the moist part from the kindred element; and this, when within us, by its faculty of being transmitted, is changed to blood, and especially if through the wine it receives the faculty of being transmuted into heat. Since, then, that God-containing flesh partook for its substance and support of this particular nourishment also, and since the God who was manifested infused Himself into perishable humanity for this purpose, viz. that by this communion with Deity mankind might at the same time be deified, for this end it is that, by dispensation of His grace, He disseminates Himself in every believer through that flesh, whose substance comes from bread and wine, blending Himself with the bodies of believers, to secure that, by this union with the immortal, man, too, may be a sharer in incorruption. He gives these gifts by virtue of the benediction through which He transelements[fn-40-P4053_2695586:108-nf] the natural quality of these visible things to that immortal thing.","title":"The Great Catechism","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_46_book_x_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid.\"[fn-73-P7306_1481384:19-nf] The former parables He spoke to the multitudes; but this and the two which follow it, which are not parables but similitudes in relation to the kingdom of heaven, He seems to have spoken to the disciples when in the house. In regard to this and the next two, let him who \"gives heed to reading\"[fn-73-P7307_1481700:20-nf] inquire whether they are parables at all. In the case of the latter the Scripture does not hesitate to attach in each case the name of parable; but in the present case it has not done so; and that naturally. For if He spoke to the multitudes in parables, and \"spake all these things in parables, and without a parable spake nothing to them,\"[fn-73-P7308_1482062:21-nf] but on going to the house He discourses not to the multitudes but to the disciples who came to Him there, manifestly the things spoken in the house were not parables: for, to them that are without. even to those to whom \"it is not given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,\"[fn-73-P7309_1482369:22-nf] He speaks in parables.

The similitude seems to be generic, and the parable specific. And perhaps also as the similitude, which is the highest genus of the parable, contains the parable as one of its species, so it contains that particular form of similitude which has the same name as the genus. This is the case with other words as those skilled in the giving of many names have observed; who say that \"impulse\"[fn-73-P7311_1483241:24-nf] is the highest genus of many species, as, for example, of \"disinclination\"[fn-73-P7312_1483349:25-nf] and \"inclination.\" and say that, in the case of the species which has the same name as the genus, \"inclination\" is taken in opposition to and in distinction from \"disinclination.\"","title":"Book X.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_50_exhortation_to_the_heathen","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"361","folder":"ANF-02","text":"And, indeed, the old Hebrew wanderers in the desert received typically the end of the threatening; for they are said not to have entered into the rest, because of unbelief, till, having followed the successor of Moses, they learned by experience, though late, that they could not be saved otherwise than by believing on Jesus.

The first man, when in Paradise, sported free, because he was the child of God; but when he succumbed to pleasure (for the serpent allegorically signifies pleasure crawling on its belly, earthly wickedness nourished for fuel to the flames), was as a child seduced by lusts, and grew old in disobedience; and by disobeying his Father, dishonoured God. Such was the influence of pleasure. Man, that had been free by reason of simplicity, was found fettered to sins. The Lord then wished to release him from his bonds, and clothing Himself with flesh-O divine mystery!-vanquished the serpent, and enslaved the tyrant death; and, most marvellous of all, man that had been deceived by pleasure, and bound fast by corruption, had his hands unloosed, and was set free. O mystic wonder! The Lord was laid low, and man rose up; and he that fell from Paradise receives as the reward of obedience something greater [than Paradise]-namely, heaven itself. Wherefore, since the Word Himself has come to us from heaven, we need not, I reckon, go any more in search of human learning to Athens and the rest of Greece, and to Ionia. For if we have as our teacher Him that filled the universe with His holy energies in creation, salvation, beneficence, legislation, prophecy, teaching, we have the Teacher from whom all instruction comes; and the whole world, with Athens and Greece, has already become the domain of the Word.[fn-32-P3224_956248:153-nf] For you, who believed the poetical fable which designated Minos the Cretan as the bosom friend of Zeus, will not refuse to believe that we who have become the disciples of God have received the only true wisdom; and that which the chiefs of philosophy only guessed at, the disciples of Christ have both apprehended and proclaimed. And the one whole Christ is not divided: \"There is neither barbarian, nor Jew, nor Greek, neither male nor female, but a new man,\"[fn-32-P3225_956826:154-nf] transformed by God's Holy Spirit. Further, the other counsels and precepts are unimportant, and respect particular things,-as, for example, if one may marry, take part in public affairs, beget children; but the only command that is universal, and over the whole course of existence, at all times and in all circumstances, tends to the highest end, viz., life, is piety,[fn-32-P3226_957225:155-nf] -all that is necessary, in order that we may live for ever, being that we live in accordance with it.

Man did not therefore strive after an evil nature when he touched the forbidden tree; but by deserting what was better, he committed an evil deed. Since the Creator is better than any creature which He has made, His command should not have been deserted, that the thing forbidden, however good, might be touched; since the better having been deserted, the good of the creature was striven for, which was touched contrary to the command of the Creator.

For He was promised by Joel the prophet, but given by Christ. \"In the last days,\" says the prophet, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants and my handmaids.\"[fn-104-P10421_3281470:243-nf] And the Lord said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins ye remit, they shall be remitted; and whose ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-104-P10422_3281643:244-nf] But this Holy Spirit the Lord Christ calls at one time \"the Paraclete,\" at another pronounces to be the \"Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10423_3281790:245-nf] And He is not new in the Gospel, nor yet even newly given; for it was He Himself who accused the people in the prophets, and in the apostles gave them the appeal to the Gentiles. For the former deserved to be accused, because they had contemned the law; and they of the Gentiles who believe deserve to be aided by the defence of the Spirit, because they earnestly desire to attain to the Gospel law. Assuredly in the Spirit there are different kinds of offices, because in the times there is a different order of occasions; and yet, on this account, He who discharges these offices is not different, nor is He another in so acting, but He is one and the same, distributing His offices according to the times, and the occasions and impulses of things. Moreover, the Apostle Paul says, \"Having the same Spirit; as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-104-P10424_3282722:246-nf] He is therefore one and the same Spirit who was in the prophets and apostles, except that in the former He was occasional, in the latter always. But in the former not as being always in them, in the latter as abiding always in them; and in the former distributed with reserve, in the latter all poured out; in the former given sparingly, in the latter liberally bestowed; not yet manifested before the Lord's resurrection, but conferred after the resurrection. For, said He, \"I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Advocate, that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10425_3283345:247-nf] And, \"When He, the Advocate, shall come, whom I shall send unto you from my Father, the Spirit of truth who proceedeth from my Father.\"[fn-104-P10426_3283506:248-nf] And, \"If I go not away, that Advocate shall not come to you; but if I go away, I will send Him to you.\"[fn-104-P10427_3283631:249-nf] And, \"When the Spirit of truth shall come, He will direct you into all the truth.\"[fn-104-P10428_3283735:250-nf] And because the Lord was about to depart to the heavens, He gave the Paraclete out of necessity to the disciples; so as not to leave them in any degree orphans,[fn-104-P10429_3283918:251-nf] which was little desirable, and forsake them without an advocate and some kind of protector. For this is He who strengthened their hearts and minds, who marked out the Gospel sacraments, who was in them the enlightener of divine things; and they being strengthened, feared, for the sake of the Lord's name, neither dungeons nor chains, nay, even trod under foot the very powers of the world and its tortures, since they were henceforth armed and strengthened by the same Spirit, having in themselves the gifts which this same Spirit distributes, and appropriates to the Church, the spouse of Christ, as her ornaments. This is He who places prophets in the Church, instructs teachers, directs tongues, gives powers and healings, does wonderful works, often discrimination of spirits, affords powers of government, suggests counsels, and orders and arranges whatever other gifts there are of charismata; and thus make the Lord's Church everywhere, and in all, perfected and completed. This is He who, after the manner of a dove, when our Lord was baptized, came and abode upon Him, dwelling in Christ full and entire, and not maimed in any measure or portion; but with His whole overflow copiously distributed and sent forth, so that from Him others might receive some enjoyment of His graces: the source of the entire Holy Spirit remaining in Christ, so that from Him might be drawn streams of gifts and works, while the Holy Spirit dwelt affluently in Christ. For truly Isaiah, prophesying this, said: \"And the Spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and piety; and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-104-P10430_3285641:252-nf] This self-same thing also he said in the person of the Lord Himself, in another place, ' \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because He has anointed me, He has sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor.\"[fn-104-P10431_3285866:253-nf] Similarly David: \"Wherefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\"[fn-104-P10432_3285998:254-nf] Of Him the Apostle Paul says: \"For he who hath not the Spirit of Christ is none of His.\"[fn-104-P10433_3286107:255-nf] \"And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"[fn-104-P10434_3286186:256-nf] He it is who effects with water the second birth as a certain seed of divine generation, and a consecration of a heavenly nativity, the pledge of a promised inheritance, and as it were a kind of handwriting of eternal salvation; who can make us God's temple, and fit us for His house; who solicits the divine hearing for us with groanings that cannot be uttered; filling the offices of advocacy, and manifesting the duties of our defence,-an inhabitant given for our bodies and an effector of their holiness. Who, working in us for eternity, can also produce our bodies at the resurrection of immortality, accustoming them to be associated in Himself with heavenly power, and to be allied with the divine eternity of the Holy Spirit. For our bodies are both trained in Him and by Him to advance to immortality, by learning to govern themselves with moderation according to His decrees. For this is He who \"desireth against the flesh,\" because \"the flesh resisteth against the Spirit.\"[fn-104-P10435_3287195:257-nf] This is He who restrains insatiable desires, controls immoderate lusts, quenches unlawful fires, conquers reckless impulses, repels drunkenness, checks avarice, drives away luxurious revellings, links love, binds together affections, keeps down sects, orders the rule of truth, overcomes heretics, turns out the wicked, guards the Gospel, Of this says the same apostle: \"We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God.\"[fn-104-P10436_3287665:258-nf] Concerning Him he exultingly says: \"And I think also that I have the Spirit of God.\"[fn-104-P10437_3287773:259-nf] Of Him he says: \"The Spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets.\"[fn-104-P10438_3287870:260-nf] Of Him also he tells: \"Now the Spirit speaketh plainly, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, doctrines of demons, who speak lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience cauterized.\"[fn-104-P10439_3288127:261-nf] Established in this Spirit, \"none ever calleth Jesus anathema; \"[fn-104-P10440_3288214:262-nf] no one has ever denied Christ to be the Son of God, or has rejected God the Creator; no one utters any words of his own contrary to the Scriptures; no one ordains other and sacrilegious decrees; no one draws up different laws.[fn-104-P10441_3288464:263-nf] Whosoever shall blaspheme against Him, \"hath not forgiveness, not only in this world, but also not in the world to come.\"[fn-104-P10442_3288722:264-nf] This is He who in the apostles gives testimony to Christ; in the martyrs shows forth the constant faithfulness of their religion; in virgins restrains the admirable continency of their sealed chastity; in others, guards the laws of the Lord's doctrine incorrupt and uncontaminated; destroys heretics, corrects the perverse, condemns infidels, makes known pretenders; moreover, rebukes the wicked, keeps the Church uncorrupt and inviolate, in the sanctity of a perpetual virginity and truth.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_138_book_v_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"ANF-06","text":"14.

There is nothing so good as thanksgiving; even as there is nothing worse than blasphemy. We should not wonder that when we become intent upon spiritual things, we suffer much that is grievous. For as thieves do not dig through and assiduously keep watch there, where there is hay, and chaff, and straw, but where there is gold and silver; so also the devil besets those especially who are engaged in spiritual matters. Where virtue is, there are many snares! where alms-giving is, there is envy! But we have one weapon which is the best, and sufficient to repel all such engines as these; in everything to give thanks to God. Tell me, did not Abel, when offering the first fruits to God, fall by the hand of his brother? But yet God permitted it, not hating one who had honoured him, but loving him greatly; and beside that which came of that excellent sacrifice, providing him another crown by martyrdom.

They, therefore, who are wicked, evildoers, carnal, fleshly, devilish, think that they receive at the hands of their seducers what are the gifts of God alone, whether sacraments, or any spiritual workings about present salvation. But these men have not love towards God, but are busied about those by whose pride they are led astray, and are compared to the adulterous woman, whom the prophet introduces as saying, \"I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, and my oil, and everything that befits me.\" For thus arise heresies and schisms, when the fleshly people which is not rounded on the love of God says, \"I will go after my lovers,\" with whom, either by corruption of her faith, or by the puffing up of her pride, she shamefully commits adultery. But for the sake of those who, having undergone the difficulties, and straits, and barriers of the empty reasoning of those by whom they are led astray, afterwards feel the prickings of fear, and return to the way of peace, to seeking God in all sincerity,-for their sake He goes on to say, \"Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them: and she shall seek them, but she shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.\" Then, that they may not attribute to their seducers what they have that is sound, and derived from the doctrine of truth, by which they lead them astray to the falseness of their own dogmas and dissensions; that they may not think that what is sound in them belongs to them, he immediately added, \"And she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her money; but she made vessels of gold and silver for Baal.\"[fn-34-P3401_1946163:66-nf] For she had said above, \"I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread,\" etc., not at all understanding that all this, which was held soundly and lawfully by her seducers, was of God, and not of men. Nor would even they themselves claim these things for themselves, and as it were assert a right in them, had not they in turn been led astray by a people which had gone astray, when faith is reposed in them, and such honors are paid to them, that they should be enabled thereby to say such things, and claim such things for themselves, that their error should be called truth, and their iniquity be thought righteousness, in virtue of the sacraments and Scriptures, which they hold, not for salvation, but only in appearance. Accordingly, the same adulterous woman is addressed by the mouth of Ezekiel: \"Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them; and tookest my[fn-34-P3402_1947177:67-nf] broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them. My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before thine idols for a sweet savor: and this thou hast done.\"[fn-34-P3403_1947602:68-nf] For she turns all the sacraments, and the words of the sacred books, to the images of her own idols, with which her carnal mind delights to wallow. Nor yet, because those images are false, and the doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy,[fn-34-P3404_1947871:69-nf] are those sacraments and divine utterances therefore so to lose their due honor, as to be thought to belong to such as these; seeing that the Lord says,\" Of my gold, and my silver, and my broidered garments, and mine oil, and mine incense, and my meat,\" and so forth. Ought we, because those erring ones think that these things belong to their seducers, therefore not to recognize whose they really are, when He Himself says, \"And she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her money\"? For He did not say that she did not have these things because she was an adulteress; but she is said to have had them, and that not as belonging to herself or her lovers, but to God, whose alone they are. Although, therefore, she had her fornication, yet those things wherewith she adorned it, whether as seduced or in her turn seducing, belonged not to her, but to God. If these things were spoken in a figure of the Jewish nation, when the scribes and Pharisees were rejecting the commandment of God in order to set up their own traditions, so that they were in a manner committing whoredom with a people which was abandoning their God; and yet for all that, whoredom at that time among the people, such as the Lord brought to light by convicting it, did not cause that the mysteries should belong to them, which were not theirs but God's, who, in speaking to the adulteress, says that all these things were His; whence the Lord Himself also sent those whom He cleansed from leprosy to the same mysteries, that they should offer sacrifice for themselves before the priests, because that sacrifice had not become efficacious for them, which He Himself afterwards wished to be commemorated in the Church for all of them, because He Himself proclaimed the tidings to them all;-if this be so, how much the more ought we, when we find the sacraments of the New Testament among certain heretics or schismatics, not to attribute them to these men, nor to condemn them, as though we could not recognize them? We ought to recognize the gifts of the true husband, though in the possession of an adulteress, and to amend, by the word of truth, that whoredom which is the true possession of the unchaste woman, instead of finding fault with the gifts, which belong entirely to the pitying Lord.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_58_book_i","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"180","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2.

Nor are those women who vow virginity to God, although they hold a higher place of honor and sanctity in the Church, without marriage. For they too, together with the whole Church, attain to a marriage, a marriage in which Christ is the Bridegroom.

Respecting this being the poet Hesiod has strikingly expressed himself, styling him Pandora-that is, \"The gift of all\"-for this reason, that the best gift in the possession of all was centred in him.

For the term \"for a little\" may mean either of the two things, i.e., it may refer to the shortness of the time, because bodily exercise cannot possibly last on with man both in this life and in the world to come: or it may refer to the smallness of the profit which results from exercising the flesh, because bodily austerities produce some sort of beginnings of progress, but not the actual perfection of love, which has the promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come: and therefore we deem that the practice of the aforesaid works is needful, because without them we cannot climb the heights of love. For what you call works of religion and mercy are needful in this life while these inequalities and differences of conditions still prevail; but even here we should not look for them to be performed, unless such a large proportion of poor, needy, and sick folk abounded, which is brought about by the wickedness of men; viz., of those who have grasped and kept for their own use (without however using them) those things which were granted to all by the Creator of all alike. As long then as this inequality lasts in this world, this sort of work will be needful and useful to the man that practises it, as it brings to a good purpose and pious will the reward of an eternal inheritance: but it will come to an end in the life to come, where equality will reign, when there will be no longer inequality, on account of which these things must be done, but all men will pass from these manifold practical works to the love of God, and contemplation of heavenly things in continual purity of heart: to which those men who are urgent in devoting themselves to knowledge and purifying the heart, have chosen to give themselves up with all their might and main, betaking themselves, while they are still in the flesh, to that duty, in which they are to continue, when they have laid aside corruption, and when they come to that promise of the Lord the Saviour, which says \"Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.\"[fn-35-P3525_1318808:12-nf] ","title":"I.

Wherefore also to those capable of perceiving he showed resurrection, that of the life still in the flesh, creeping on its belly. Whence also he applied the name \"brood of vipers\" to the voluptuous, who serve the belly and the pudenda, and cut off one another's heads for the sake of worldly pleasures. \"Little children, let us not love in word, or in tongue,\" says John, teaching them to be perfect, \"but in deed and in truth; hereby shall we know that we are of the truth.\"[fn-68-P6884_2109502:143-nf] And if \"God be love,\" piety also is love: \"there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.\"[fn-68-P6885_2109634:144-nf] \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.\"[fn-68-P6886_2109718:145-nf] And again, to him who desires to become a Gnostic, it is written, \"But be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in love, in faith, in purity.\"[fn-68-P6887_2109903:146-nf] For perfection in faith differs, I think, from ordinary faith. And the divine apostle furnishes the rule for the Gnostic in these words, writing as follows: \"For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to lack. I can do all things through Him who strengtheneth me.\"[fn-68-P6888_2110362:147-nf] And also when discussing with others in order to put them, to shame, he does not shrink from saying, \"But call to mind the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly, whilst ye were made a gazing-stock, both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took with joy the spoiling of your goods, knowing that you have a better and enduring substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after doing the will of God, ye may obtain the promise. For yet a little while, and He that cometh will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: and if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.\"[fn-68-P6889_2111342:148-nf] He then brings forward a swarm of divine examples. For was it not \"by faith,\" he says, this endurance, that they acted nobly who \"had trial of mockeries and scourgings, and, moreover, of bonds and imprisonments? They were stoned, they were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts, in mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth. And all having received a good report, through faith, received not the promise of God\" (what is expressed by a parasiopesis is left to be understood, viz., \"alone \"). He adds accordingly, \"God having provided some better thing for us (for He was good), that they should not without us be made perfect. Wherefore also, having encompassing us such a cloud,\" holy and transparent, \"of witnesses, laying aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, let us run with patience the race set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.\"[fn-68-P6890_2112408:149-nf] Since, then, he specifies one salvation in Christ of the righteous,[fn-68-P6891_2112510:150-nf] and of us he has expressed the former unambiguously, and saying nothing less respecting Moses, adds, \"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.\"[fn-68-P6892_2112908:151-nf] The divine Wisdom says of the martyrs, \"They seemed in the eyes of the foolish to die, and their departure was reckoned a calamity, and their migration from us an affliction. But they are in peace. For though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope was full of immortality.\"[fn-68-P6893_2113261:152-nf] He then adds, teaching martyrdom to be a glorious purification, \"And being chastened a little, they shall be benefited much; because God proved them,\" that is, suffered them to be tried, to put them to the proof, and to put to shame the author of their trial, \"and found them worthy of Himself,\" plainly to be called sons. \"As gold in the furnace He proved them, and as a whole burned-offering of sacrifice He accepted them. And in the time of their visitation they will shine forth, even as sparks run along the stubble.

The command of an Emperor is wont to give great boldness to those entrusted with it; but their desire to act secretly made the suspicion stronger that they had received no command. And did I require anything so very absurd? Let your Majesty's candour decide. Will not every one say, that such a demand was reasonable for a Bishop to make? You know, for you have read the Scriptures, how great an offence it is for a Bishop to desert his Church, and to neglect the flocks of God. For the absence of the Shepherd gives the wolves an opportunity to attack the sheep. And this was what the Arians and all the other heretics desired, that during my absence they might find an opportunity to entrap the people into impiety. If then I had fled, what defence could I have made before the true Bishops? or rather before Him Who has committed to me His flock? He it is Who judges the whole earth, the true King of all, our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Would not every one have rightly charged me with neglect of my people? Would not your Piety have blamed me, and have justly asked, `After you had returned under the authority of our letters, why did you withdraw without such authority, and desert your people?' Would not the people themselves at the day of judgment have reasonably imputed to me this neglect of them, and have said, `He that had the oversight of us fled, and we were neglected, there being no one to put us in mind of our duty?' When they said this, what could I have answered? Such a complaint was made by Ezekiel against the Pastors of old[fn-42-P4260_1774733:77-nf] ; and the blessed Apostle Paul, knowing this, has charged every one of us through his disciple, saying, `Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery[fn-42-P4261_1774971:78-nf] .' Fearing this, I wished not to flee, but to receive your commands, if indeed such was the will of your Piety. But I never obtained what I so reasonably requested, and now I am falsely accused before you; for I resisted no commands of your Piety; nor will I now attempt to return to Alexandria, until your Grace shall desire it.

And, in this case how will that first statement of the Lord made about men after the fall stand: \"Behold, Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil?\"[fn-53-P5348_1915089:59-nf] For we cannot think that before, he was such as to be altogether ignorant of good. Otherwise we should have to admit that he was formed like some irrational and insensate beast: which is sufficiently absurd and altogether alien from the Catholic faith. Moreover as the wisest Solomon says: \"God made man upright,\" i.e., always to enjoy the knowledge of good only, \"But they have sought out many imaginations,\"[fn-53-P5349_1915518:60-nf] for they came, as has been said, to know good and evil. Adam therefore after the fall conceived a knowledge of evil which he had not previously, but did not lose the knowledge of good which he had before. Finally the Apostle's words very clearly show that mankind did not lose after the fall of Adam the knowledge of good: as he says: \"For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have not the law, are a law to themselves, as they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to these, and their thoughts within them either accusing or else excusing them, in the day in which God shall judge the secrets of men.\"[fn-53-P5350_1916254:61-nf] And with the same meaning the Lord rebukes by the prophet the unnatural but freely chosen blindness of the Jews, which they by their obstinacy brought upon themselves, saying: \"Hear ye deaf, and ye blind, behold that you may see. Who is deaf but My servant? and blind, but he to whom I have sent My messengers?\"[fn-53-P5351_1916588:62-nf] And that no one might ascribe this blindness of theirs to nature instead of to their own will, elsewhere He says: \"Bring forth the people that are blind and have eyes: that are deaf and have ears;\" and again: \"having eyes, but ye see not; and ears, but ye hear not.\"[fn-53-P5352_1916878:63-nf] The Lord also says in the gospel: \"Because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not neither do they understand.\"[fn-53-P5353_1917028:64-nf] And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: \"Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand: and seeing ye shall see and shall not see. For the heart of this people is waxed fat, and their ears are dull of hearing: and they have closed their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and be turned and I should heal them.\"[fn-53-P5354_1917450:65-nf] Finally in order to denote that the possibility of good was in them, in chiding the Pharisees, He says: \"But why of your own selves do ye not judge what is right?\"[fn-53-P5355_1917634:66-nf] And this he certainly would not have said to them, unless He knew that by their natural judgment they could discern what was fair. Wherefore we must take care not to refer all the merits of the saints to the Lord in such a way as to ascribe nothing but what is evil and perverse to human nature: in doing which we are confuted by the evidence of the most wise Solomon, or rather of the Lord Himself, Whose words these are; for when the building of the Temple was finished and he was praying, he spoke as follows: \"And David my father would have built a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel: and the Lord said to David my father: Whereas thou hast thought in thine heart to build a house to My name, thou hast well done in having this same thing in thy mind. Nevertheless thou shall not build a house to My name.\"[fn-53-P5356_1918476:67-nf] This thought then and this purpose of king David, are we to call it good and from God or bad and from man? For if that thought was good and from God, why did He by whom it was inspired refuse that it should be carried into effect? But if it is bad and from man, why is it praised by the Lord? It remains then that we must take it as good and from man. And in the same way we can take our own thoughts today. For it was not given only to David to think what is good of himself, nor is it denied to us naturally to think or imagine anything that is good. It cannot then be doubted that there are by nature some seeds of goodness in every soul implanted by the kindness of the Creator: but unless these are quickened by the assistance of God, they will not be able to attain to an increase of perfection, for, as the blessed Apostle says: \"Neither is he that planteth anything nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.\"[fn-53-P5357_1919433:68-nf] But that freedom of the will is to some degree in a man's own power is very clearly taught in the book termed the Pastor,[fn-53-P5358_1919575:69-nf] where two angels are said to be attached to each one of us, i.e., a good and a bad one, while it lies at a man's own option to choose which to follow. And therefore the will always remains free in man, and can either neglect or delight in the grace of God. For the Apostle would not have commanded saying: \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,\" had he not known that it could be advanced or neglected by us. But that men might not fancy that they had no need of Divine aid for the work of Salvation, he subjoins: \"For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of His good pleasure.\"[fn-53-P5359_1920216:70-nf] And therefore he warns Timothy and says: \"Neglect not the grace of God which is in thee;\" and again: \"For which cause I exhort thee to stir up the grace of God which is in thee.\"[fn-53-P5360_1920418:71-nf] Hence also in writing to the Corinthians he exhorts and warns them not through their unfruitful works to show themselves unworthy of the grace of God, saying: \"And we helping, exhort you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:\"[fn-53-P5361_1920685:72-nf] for the reception of saving grace was of no profit to Simon doubtless because he had received it in vain; for he would not obey the command of the blessed Peter who said: \"Repent of thine iniquity, and pray God if haply the thoughts of thine heart may be forgiven thee; for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity.\"[fn-53-P5362_1921057:73-nf] It prevents therefore the will of man, for it is said: \"My God will prevent me with His mercy;\"[fn-53-P5363_1921177:74-nf] and again when God waits and for our good delays, that He may put our desires to the test, our will precedes, for it is said: \"And in the morning my prayer shall prevent Thee;\" and again: \"I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;\" and: \"Mine eyes have prevented the morning.\"[fn-53-P5364_1921485:75-nf] For He calls and invites us, when He says: \"All the day long I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people;\"[fn-53-P5365_1921674:76-nf] and He is invited by us when we say to Him: \"All the day long I have stretched forth My hands unto Thee\"[fn-53-P5366_1921796:77-nf] He waits for us, when it is said by the prophet: \"Wherefore the Lord waiteth to have compassion upon us;\"[fn-53-P5367_1921937:78-nf] and He is waited for by us, when we say: \"I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto me;\" and: \"I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.\"[fn-53-P5368_1922104:79-nf] He strengthens us when He says: \"And I have chastised them, and strengthened their arms; and they have imagined evil against me;\"[fn-53-P5369_1922280:80-nf] and He exhorts us to strengthen ourselves when He says: \"Strengthen ye the weak hands, and make strong the feeble knees.\"[fn-53-P5370_1922422:81-nf] Jesus cries: \"If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink;\"[fn-53-P5371_1922504:82-nf] the prophet also cries to Him: \"I have laboured with crying, my jaws are become hoarse: mine eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.\"[fn-53-P5372_1922663:83-nf] The Lord seeks us, when He says: \"I sought and there was no man.

For the evangelists have given different descriptions of the parties who came to the sepulchre one after another,[fn-15-P1582_445884:141-nf] and all have declared that they found the Lord risen already. It was \"in the end of the Sabbath,\" as Matthew has said;[fn-15-P1583_446042:142-nf] it was \"early, when it was yet dark,\" as John writes;[fn-15-P1584_446120:143-nf] it was \"very early in the morning,\" as Luke puts it; and it was \"very early in the morning, at the rising of the sun,\" as Mark tells us. Thus no one has shown us clearly the exact time when He rose. It is admitted, however, that those who came to the sepulchre in the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,[fn-15-P1585_446481:144-nf] found Him no longer lying in it. And let us not suppose that the evangelists disagree or contradict each other. But even although there may seem to be some small difficulty as to the subject of our inquiry, if they all agree that the light of the world, our Lord, rose on that one night, while they differ with respect to the hour, we may well seek with wise and faithful mind to harmonize their statements. The narrative by Matthew then, runs thus: \"In the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,[fn-15-P1586_447058:145-nf] came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. And his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said.\"[fn-15-P1587_447611:146-nf] Now this phrase \"in the end\" will be thought by some to signify, according to the common use[fn-15-P1588_447730:147-nf] of the word, the evening: of the Sabbath; while others, with a better perception of the fact, will say that it does not indicate that, but a late hour in the night,[fn-15-P1589_447914:148-nf] as the phrase \"in the end\"[fn-15-P1590_447965:149-nf] denotes slowness and length of time. Also because he speaks of night, and not of evening, he has added the words, \"as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week.\" And the parties here did not come yet, as the others say, \"bearing spices,\" but \"to see the sepulchre; \"and they discovered the occurrence of the earthquake, and the angel sitting upon the stone, and heard from him the declaration, \"He is not here, He is risen.\" And to the same effect is the testimony of John. \"The first day of the week,\" says he, \"came Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.\"[fn-15-P1591_448627:150-nf] Only, according to this \"when it was yet dark,\" she had come in advance.[fn-15-P1592_448719:151-nf] And Luke says: \"They rested the Sabbath-day, according to the commandment. Now, upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared; and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.\"[fn-15-P1593_449025:152-nf] This phrase \"very early in the morning\"[fn-15-P1594_449100:153-nf] probably indicates the early dawn[fn-15-P1595_449157:154-nf] of the first day of the week; and thus, when the Sabbath itself was wholly past, and also the whole night succeeding it, and when another day had begun, they came, bringing spices and myrrh, and then it became apparent that He had already risen long before. And Mark follows this, and says: \"They had bought sweet spices, in order that they might come and anoint Him. And very early (in the morning), the first day of the week, they come unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.\"[fn-15-P1596_449698:155-nf] For this evangelist also has used the term \"very early,\" which is just the same as the \"very early in the morning\" employed by the former; and he has added, \"at the rising of the sun.\" Thus they set out, and took their way first when it was \"very early in the morning,\" or (as Mark says) when it was \"very early; \"but on the road, and by their stay at the sepulchre, they spent the time till it was sunrise. And then the young man clad in white said to them, \"He is risen, He is not here.\" As the case stands thus, we make the following statement and explanation to those who seek an exact account of the specific hour, or half-hour, or quarter of an hour, at which it is proper to begin their rejoicing over our Lord's rising from the dead. Those who are too hasty, and give up even before midnight,[fn-15-P1597_450522:156-nf] we reprehend as remiss and intemperate, and as almost breaking off from their course in their precipitation,[fn-15-P1598_450685:157-nf] for it is a wise man's word, \"That is not little in life which is within a little.\" And those who hold out and continue for a very long time, and persevere even on to the fourth watch, which is also the time at which our Saviour manifested Himself walking upon the sea to those who were then on the deep, we receive as noble and laborious disciples. On those, again, who pause and refresh themselves in the course as they are moved or as they are able, let us not press very hard:[fn-15-P1599_451219:158-nf] for all do not carry out the six days of fasting[fn-16-P1600_451444:159-nf] either equally or alike; but some pass even all the days as a fast, remaining without food through the whole; while others take but two, and others three, and others four, and others not even one. And to those who have laboured painfully through these protracted fasts. and have thereafter become exhausted and well-nigh undone, pardon ought to be extended if they are somewhat precipitate in taking food. But if there are any who not only decline such protracted fasting, but refuse at the first to fast at all, and rather indulge themselves luxuriously during the first four days, and then when they reach the last two days-viz., the preparation and the Sabbath-fast with due rigour during these, and these alone, and think that they do something grand and brilliant if they hold out till the morning, I cannot think that they have gone through the time on equal terms with those who have been practising the same during several days before. This is the counsel which, in accordance with my apprehension of the question, I have offered you in writing on these matters.[fn-16-P1601_452602:160-nf] ","title":"Part I.-Containing Various Sections of the Works.","author":"Dionysius"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_67_xvii_the_second_conference_of_abbot_joseph_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Joseph: As we premised, the intent of the mind brings a man either reward or condemnation, according to this passage: \"Their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men;\" and this too: \"But I am coming to gather together their works and thoughts together with all nations and tongues.\"[fn-58-P5894_2082677:7-nf] Wherefore it was, as I see, from a desire for perfection that you bound yourselves with the chain of these oaths, as you then thought that by this plan it could be gained, while now that a riper judgment has supervened, you see that you cannot by this means scale its heights. And so any departure from that arrangement, which may seem to have happened, will be no hindrance, if only no change in that first purpose follows. For a change of instrument does not imply a desertion of the work, nor does the choice of a shorter and more direct road argue laziness on the path of the traveller. And so in this matter an improvement in a short-sighted arrangement is not to be reckoned a breach of a spiritual promise. For whatever is done out of the love of God and desire for goodness, which has \"promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come,\"[fn-58-P5895_2083568:8-nf] even though it may appear to commence with a hard and adverse beginning, is most worthy, not only of no blame, but actually of praise. And therefore the breaking of a careless promise will be no hindrance, if in every case the end, i.e., the proposed aim at goodness, be maintained. For we do all for this reason, that we may be able to show to God a clean heart, and if the attainment of this is considered to be easier in this country the alteration of the agreement extracted from you will be no hindrance to you, if only the perfection of that purity for the sake of which your promise was originally made, be the sooner secured according to the Lord's will.","title":"XVII.

But we must most resolutely make up our minds to observe those fundamental commands, and not even, if need arise, to avoid death in their cause, with regard to which we must immovably assert: \"I have sworn and am purposed.\" And this should be done for the preservation of love, for which all things else should be disregarded lest the beauty and perfection of its calm should suffer a stain. In the same way we must swear for the purity of our chastity, and we ought to do the same for faith, and sobriety and justice, to all of which we must cling with unchangeable persistence, and to forsake which even for a little is worthy of blame.

Know, then, that I have made Saturus a reader, and Optatus, the confessor, a sub-deacon; whom already, by the general advice, we had made next to the clergy, in having entrusted to Saturus on Easter-day, once and again, the reading; and when with the teacher-presbyters[fn-51-P5130_1557579:2-nf] we were carefully trying readers-in appointing Optatus from among the readers to be a teacher of the hearers;-examining, first of all, whether all things were found fitting in them, which ought to be found in such as were in preparation for the clerical office. Nothing new, therefore, has been done by me in your absence; but what, on the general advice of all of us had been begun, has, upon urgent necessity, been accomplished. I bid you, beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell; and remember me.Fare ye well.","title":"Epistle XXIII.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_72_letter_i_for_329_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"5. Behold, my brethren, how much a fast can do, and in what manner the law commands us to fast. It is required that not only with the body should we fast, but with the soul. Now the soul is humbled when it does not follow wicked opinions, but feeds on becoming virtues. For virtues and vices are the food of the soul, and it can eat either of these two meats, and incline to either of the two, according to its own will. If it is bent toward virtue, it will be nourished by virtues, by righteousness, by temperance, by meekness, by fortitude, as Paul saith; `Being nourished by the word of truth[fn-88-P8825_3243003:29-nf] .' Such was the case with our Lord, who said, `My meat is to do the will of My Father which is in heaven[fn-88-P8826_3243127:30-nf] .' But if it is not thus with the soul, and it inclines downwards, it is then nourished by nothing but sin. For thus the Holy Ghost, describing sinners and their food, referred to the devil when He said, `I have given him to be meat to the people of Aethiopia[fn-88-P8827_3243405:31-nf] .' For this is the food of sinners. And as our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, being heavenly bread, is the food of the saints, according to this; `Except ye eat My flesh, and drink My blood[fn-88-P8828_3243620:32-nf] ;' so is the devil the food of the impure, and of those who do nothing which is of the light, but work the deeds of darkness. Therefore, in order to withdraw and turn them from vices, He commands them to be nourished with the food of virtue; namely, humbleness of mind, lowliness to endure humiliations, the acknowledgment of God. For not only does such a fast as this obtain pardon for souls, but being kept holy, it prepares the saints, and raises them above the earth.","title":"Letter I.

It will also be well if a man is not offended at the testimony of the Shepherd, saying in the beginning of his book, `Before all things believe that there is one God, Who created and established all these things, and from non-existence called them into beings[fn-93-P9319_3381114:20-nf] .' And, further, the blessed Evangelists-who recorded the words of the Lord-in the beginning of the Gospels, wrote the things concerning our Saviour; so that, having first made known the Lord, the Creator, they might be believed when narrating the events that took place. For how could they have been believed, when writing respecting him who [was blind] from his mother's womb, and those other blind men who recovered their sight, and those who rose from the dead, and the changing of water into wine, and those lepers who were cleansed; if they bad not taught of Him as the Creator, writing, `In the beginning was the Word[fn-93-P9320_3381759:21-nf] ?' Or, according to Matthew, that He Who was born of the seed of David, was Emmanuel, and the Son of the living God? He from Whom the Jews, with the Arians, turn away their faces, but Whom we acknowledge and worship. The Apostle therefore, as was meet, sent to different people, but his own son he especially reminded, `that he should not despise the things in which he had been instructed by him,' and enjoined on him, `Remember Jesus Christ, who rose from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Gospel[fn-93-P9321_3382288:22-nf] .' And speaking of these things being delivered to him, to be always had in remembrance, he immediately writes to him. saying, `Meditate on these things: be engaged in them[fn-93-P9322_3382496:23-nf] ' For constant meditation, and the remembrance of divine words, strengthens piety towards God, and produces a love to Him inseparable and not merely formal[fn-93-P9323_3382672:24-nf] ; as he, being of this mind, speaks about himself and others like-minded, saying boldly, `Who shall separate us from the love of God[fn-93-P9324_3383110:25-nf] ?' For[fn-93-P9325_3383137:26-nf] such men, being confirmed in the Lord, and possessing an unshaken disposition towards Him, and being one in spirit (for[fn-93-P9326_3383432:27-nf] `he who is joined to the Spirit is one spirit'), are sure `as the mount Sion;' and although ten thousand trials may rage against them, they are founded upon a rock, which is Christ[fn-93-P9327_3383630:28-nf] . In Him the careless take no delight; and having no continuous purpose of good, they are sullied by temporal attacks, and esteem nothing more highly than present things, being unstable and deserving reproof as regards the faith. For `either the care of this world, or the deceitfulness of riches, chokes them[fn-93-P9328_3383986:29-nf] ;' or, as Jesus said in that parable which had reference to them, since they have not established the faith that has been preached to them, but continue only for a time, immediately, in time of persecution, or when affliction ariseth through the word, they are offended. Now those who meditate evil we say, [think] not truth, but falsehood and not righteousness, but iniquity, for their tongue learns to speak lies. They have done evil, and have not ceased that they might repent. For, persevering with delight in wicked actions, they hasten thereto without turning back, even treading under foot the commandment with regard to neighbours, and, instead of loving them, devise evil against them, as the saint testifies, saying, `And those who seek me evil have spoken vanity, and imagined deceit all the day[fn-93-P9329_3384814:30-nf] .' But that the cause of such meditation is none other than the want of instruction, the divine proverb has already declared; `The son that forsaketh the commandment of his father meditateth evil words[fn-93-P9330_3385038:31-nf] .' But such meditation, because it is evil, the Holy Spirit blames in these words, and reproves too in other terms, saying, `Your hands are polluted with blood, your fingers with sins; your lips have spoken lawlessness, and your tongue imagineth iniquity: no man speaketh right things, nor is there true judgment[fn-93-P9331_3385376:32-nf] .' But what the end is of such perverse imagining, He immediately declares, saying, `They trust in vanities and speak falsehood; for they conceive mischief, and bring forth lawlessness. They have hatched the eggs of an asp, and woven a spider's web; and he who is prepared to eat of their eggs, when he breaks them finds gall, and a basilisk therein[fn-93-P9332_3385755:33-nf] .' Again, what the hope of such is, He has already announced. `Because righteousness does not overtake them, when they waited for light, they had darkness; when they waited for brightness, they walked in a thick cloud. They shall grope for the wall like the blind, and as those who have no eyes shall they grope; they shall fall at noon-day as at midnight; when dead, they shall groan. They shall roar together as a bear, or as a dove[fn-93-P9333_3386210:34-nf] .'","title":"Letter XI.

And whereas, not only in action, but also in the thoughts of the mind, men are moved to deeds of virtue, he afterwards adds, saying, `Mine eyes prevent the dawn, that I might meditate on Thy words[fn-93-P9358_3391779:55-nf] .' For it is meet that the spiritual meditations of those who are whole should precede their bodily actions. And does not our Saviour, when intending to teach this very thing begin with the thoughts of the mind? saying, `Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery:' and, `Whosoever shall be angry with his brother, is guilty of murder[fn-93-P9359_3392171:56-nf] .' For where there is no wrath, murder is prevented; and where lust is first removed, there can be no accusation of adultery. Hence meditation on the law is necessary, my beloved, and uninterrupted converse with virtue, `that the saint may lack nothing, but be perfect to every good work[fn-93-P9360_3392490:57-nf] .' For by these things is the promise of eternal life, as Paul wrote to Timothy, calling constant meditation exercise, and saying, `Exercise thyself unto godliness; for bodily exercise profiteth little; but godliness is profitable for all things, since it has the promise of the present life, and of that which is eternal[fn-93-P9361_3392833:58-nf] .'","title":"Letter XI.

For faith and godliness are allied to each other, and sisters; and he who believes in Him is godly, and he also who is godly, believes the more[fn-93-P9367_3394569:62-nf] . He therefore who is in a state of wickedness, undoubtedly also wanders from the faith; and he who fails from godliness, falls from the true faith. Paul, for instance, bearing testimony to the same point, advises his disciple, saying, `Avoid profane conversations; for they increase unto more ungodliness, and their word takes hold as doth a canker, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus[fn-93-P9368_3394978:63-nf] .' In what their wickedness consisted he declares, saying, `Who have erred from the faith, saying that the resurrection is already past[fn-93-P9369_3395147:64-nf] .' But again, desirous of shewing that faith is yoked with godliness, the Apostle says, `And all those who will live godly in Jesus Christ shall suffer persecution[fn-93-P9370_3395328:65-nf] .' Afterwards, that no man should renounce godliness through persecution, he counsels them to preserve the faith, adding, `Thou, therefore, continue in the things thou hast learned, and hast been assured of[fn-93-P9371_3395553:66-nf] .' And as when brother is helped by brother, they become as a wall to each other; so faith and godliness, being of like growth, hang together, and he who is practised in the one, of necessity is strengthened by the other. Therefore, wishing the disciple to be exercised in godliness unto the end, and to contend for the faith, he counsels them, saying, `Fight the good fight of faith, and lay hold on eternal life[fn-93-P9372_3395985:67-nf] .'

But as then against the adherents of Philetus and Hymenaeus, so now the Apostle forewarns all men against ungodliness like theirs, saying, `The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His; and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity[fn-93-P9376_3397185:70-nf] .'

For God, Who is over all, willed that they should go far away from the servants of Pharaoh, and from the furnace of iron; so that being set free from wickedness, and having carefully put away from them all strange notions, they might receive the knowledge of God and of virtuous actions. For He saith, `Go far from them: depart from the midst of them, and touch not the unclean things[fn-93-P9378_3397974:72-nf] .'

The Lord, by His promise, gave those whose hopes were resting on Himself a special ground of confidence, when He said, \"For I go to the Father; and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, I will do it.\" His proceeding, therefore, to the Father, was not with any view of abandoning the needy, but of hearing and answering their petitions. But what is to be made of the words, \"Whatsoever ye shall ask,\" when we behold His faithful ones so often asking and not receiving? Is it, shall we say, for no other reason but that they ask amiss? For the Apostle James made this a ground of reproach when he said, \"Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.\"[fn-27-P2731_1595484:1-nf] What one, therefore, wishes to receive, in order to turn to an improper use, God in His mercy rather refuses to bestow. Nay, more, if a man asks what would, if answered, only tend to his injury, there is surely greater cause to fear, lest what God could not withhold with kindness, He should give in His anger. Do we not see how the Israelites got to their own hurt what their guilty lusting craved? For while it was raining manna on them from heaven, they desired to have flesh to eat.[fn-27-P2732_1595986:2-nf] They disdained what they had, and shamelessly sought what they had not: as if it were not better for them to have asked not to have their unbecoming desires gratified with the food that was wanting, but to have their own dislike removed, and be made themselves to receive aright the food that was provided. For when evil becomes our delight, and what is good the reverse, we ought to be entreating God rather to win us back to the love of the good, than to grant us the evil. Not that it is wrong to eat flesh, for the apostle, speakingof this very thing, says, \"Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused which is received with thanksgiving;[fn-27-P2733_1596660:3-nf] but because, as he also says, \"It is evil for thatman who eateth with offense;\"[fn-27-P2734_1596757:4-nf] and if so,with offense to man, how much more so if to God, to whom it was no light offense, on the part of the Israelites, to reject what wisdom was supplying, and ask for that which lust was craving: although they would not actually make the request, but murmured because itwas wanting. But to let us know that the wrong lies not with any creature of God, but with obstinate disobedience and inordinate desire, it was not in swine's flesh that the first man found death, but in an apple;[fn-27-P2735_1597263:5-nf] and it was not for a fowl, but for a dish of pottage, that Esau lost his birthright.[fn-27-P2736_1597364:6-nf] ","title":"Tractate LXXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-06","text":"35. These things, moreover. he has said with the view of showing us that all others who may come alter him will be false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed, like an angel of light. What great thing therefore is it, if his ministers also be transformed into the ministers of righteousness?-whose end shall be according to their works.[fn-36-P3621_1005288:348-nf] He indicates, further, what manner of men these were, and points out by whom they were being circumvented. And when the Galatians are minded to turn away from the Gospel, he says to them: \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you unto another gospel: which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would turn you away[fn-36-P3622_1005837:349-nf] from the Gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which has been delivered to you, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3623_1006023:350-nf] And again he says: \"To me, who am the least of all the apostles,[fn-36-P3624_1006108:351-nf] is this grace given; \"[fn-36-P3625_1006165:352-nf] and,\" I fill up that which was behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-36-P3626_1006266:353-nf] And once more, in another place, he declares of himself that he was a minister of Christ more than all others,[fn-36-P3627_1006396:354-nf] as though after him none other was to be looked for at all; for he enjoins that not even an angel from heaven is thus to be received. And how, then, shall we credit the professions of this Manes, who comes from Persis,[fn-36-P3628_1006637:355-nf] and declares himself to be the Paraclete? By this very thing, indeed, I rather recognise in him one of those men who transform themselves, and of whom the Apostle Paul, that elect vessel, has given us very clear indication when he says: \"Now in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; for-bidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received[fn-36-P3629_1007318:356-nf] with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.\"[fn-36-P3630_1007567:357-nf] The Spirit in the evangelist Matthew is also careful to give note of these words of our Lord Jesus Christ: \"Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. But if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false apostles,[fn-36-P3631_1007948:358-nf] and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. If they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: if they shall say, Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.\"[fn-36-P3632_1008388:359-nf] And yet, after all these directions, this man, who has neither sign nor portent of any kind to show, who has no affinity to exhibit, who never even had a place among the number of the disciples, who never was a follower of our departed Lord, in whose inheritance we rejoice,-this man, I say, although he never stood by our Lord in His weakness, and although he never came forward as a witness of His testament, yea rather, although he never came even within the acquaintance of those who ministered to Him in His sickness, and, in fine, although he obtains the testimony of no person whatsoever, desires us to believe this profession which he makes of being the Paraclete; whereas, even were you to do signs and wonders, we would still have to reckon you a false Christ, and a false prophet, according to the Scriptures. And therefore it is well for us to act with the greater caution, in accordance with the warning which the sainted apostle gives us, when, in the epistle which he wrote to the Colossians, he speaks in the following terms: \"Continue in the faith grounded and rooted,[fn-36-P3633_1009506:360-nf] and not to be moved away[fn-36-P3634_1009548:361-nf] from the hope of the Gospel, which we have heard,[fn-36-P3635_1009616:362-nf] and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven.\"[fn-36-P3636_1009699:363-nf] And again: \"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him; rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any one spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead.\"[fn-36-P3637_1010095:364-nf] And after all these matters have been thus carefully set forth, the blessed apostle, like a father speaking to his children, adds the following words, which serve as a sort of seal to his testament: \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,[fn-36-P3638_1010371:365-nf] I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.\"[fn-36-P3639_1010695:366-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":4,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_205_sermon_lxvii_on_the_passion_xvi_delivered_on_the_sunday_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Therefore, dearly-beloved, by this unspeakable restoration of our health no place is left us for pride or for idleness: because we have nothing which we did not receive[fn-37-P3794_957582:13-nf] , and we are expressly warned not to treat the gifts of God's grace with negligence[fn-37-P3795_957708:14-nf] .

But deacons ought to remember that the Lord chose apostles, that is, bishops and overseers; while apostles appointed for themselves deacons[fn-60-P6063_1911629:11-nf] after the ascent of the Lord into heaven, as ministers of their episcopacy and of the Church. But if we may dare anything against God who makes bishops, deacons may also dare against us by whom they are made; and therefore it behoves the deacon of whom you write to repent of his audacity, and to acknowledge the honour of the priest, and to satisfy the bishop set over him with full humility. For these things are the beginnings of heretics, and the origins and endeavours of evil-minded schismatics;-to please themselves, and with swelling haughtiness to despise him who is set over them. Thus they depart from the Church-thus a profane altar is set up outside-thus they rebel against the peace of Christ, and the appointment and the unity of God.
