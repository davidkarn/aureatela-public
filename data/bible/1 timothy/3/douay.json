{"verses":["A faithful saying:  If a man desire the office of a bishop, he\ndesireth good work.","It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless, the husband of one\nwife, sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste, given to hospitality,\na teacher,","Not given to wine, no striker, but modest, not quarrelsome, not\ncovetous, but","One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in\nsubjection with all chastity.","But if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take\ncare of the church of God?","Not a neophyte:  lest, being puffed up with pride, he fall into the\njudgment of the devil.","Moreover, he must have a good testimony of them who are without:\nlest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.","Deacons in like manner:  chaste, not double tongued, not given to\nmuch wine, not greedy of filthy lucre:","Holding the mystery of faith in a pure conscience.","And let these also first be proved:  and so let them minister,\nhaving no crime.","The women in like manner:  chaste, not slanderers, but sober,\nfaithful in all things.","Let deacons be the husbands of one wife:  who rule well their\nchildren and their own houses.","For they that have ministered well shall purchase to themselves a\ngood degree and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.","These things I write to thee, hoping that I shall come to thee\nshortly.","But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to\nbehave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living\nGod, the pillar and ground of the truth.","And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which was\nmanifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, appeared unto\nangels, hath been preached unto the Gentiles, is believed in the world,\nis taken up in glory."]}
