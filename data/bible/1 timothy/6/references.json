But, covetousness apart, what is the motive for acquiring? When the motive for acquiring ceases, there will be no necessity for trading. Grant now that there be some righteousness in business, secure from the duty of watchfulness against covetousness and mendacity; I take it that that trade which pertains to the very soul and spirit of idols, which pampers every demon, falls under the charge of idolatry. Rather, is not that the principal idolatry? If the selfsame merchandises-frankincense, I mean, and all other foreign productions-used as sacrifice to idols, are of use likewise to men for medicinal ointments, to us Christians also, over and above, for solaces of sepulture, let them see to it. At all events, while the pomps, while the priesthoods, while the sacrifices of idols, are furnished by dangers, by losses, by inconveniences, by cogitations, by runnings to and fro, or trades, what else are you demonstrated to be but an idols' agent? Let none contend that, in this way, exception may be taken to all trades. All graver faults extend the sphere for diligence in watchfulness proportionably to the magnitude of the danger; in order that we may withdraw not only from the faults, but from the means through which they have being. For although the fault be done by others, it makes no difference if it be by my means. In no case ought I to be necessary to another, while he is doing what to me is unlawful. Hence I ought to understand that care must be taken by me, lest what I am forbidden to do be done by my means. In short, in another cause of no lighter guilt I observe that fore-judgment. In that I am interdicted from fornication, I furnish nothing of help or connivance to others for that purpose; in that I have separated my own flesh itself from stews, I acknowledge that I cannot exercise the trade of pandering, or keep that kind of places for my neighbour's behoof. So, too, the interdiction of murder shows me that a trainer of gladiators also is excluded from the Church; nor will any one fail to be the means of doing what he subministers to another to do. Behold, here is a more kindred fore-judgment: if a purveyor of the public victims come over to the faith, will you permit him to remain permanently in that trade? or if one who is already a believer shall have undertaken that business, will you think that he is to be retained in the Church? No, I take it; unless any one will dissemble in the case of a frankincense-seller too. In sooth, the agency of blood pertains to some, that of odours to others. If, before idols were in the world, idolatry, hitherto shapeless, used to be transacted by these wares; if, even now, the work of idolatry is perpetrated, for the most part, without the idol, by burnings of odours; the frankincense-seller is a something even more serviceable even toward demons, for idolatry is more easily carried on without the idol, than without the ware of the frankincense-seller.[fn-7-P713_302192:72-nf] Let us interrogate thoroughly the conscience of the faith itself. With what mouth will a Christian frankincense-seller, if he shall pass through temples, with what mouth will he spit down upon and blow out the smoking altars, for which himself has made provision? With what consistency will he exorcise his own foster-children,[fn-7-P714_302640:73-nf] to whom he affords his own house as store-room? Indeed, if he shall have ejected a demon,[fn-7-P715_302790:74-nf] let him not congratulate himself on his faith, for he has not ejected an enemy; he ought to have had his prayer easily granted by one whom he is daily feeding.[fn-7-P716_302981:75-nf] No art, then, no profession, no trade, which administers either to equipping or forming idols, can be free from the title of idolatry; unless we interpret idolatry to be altogether something else than the service of idol-tendence.","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_08_a_metaphrase_of_the_book_of_ecclesiastes_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Moreover, it is a good thing to use the tongue sparingly, and to keep a calm and rightly balanced[fn-3-P328_53807:30-nf] heart in the exercise of speech.[fn-3-P329_53859:31-nf] For it is not right to give utterance in words to things that are foolish and absurd, or to all that occur to the mind; but we ought to know and reflect, that though we are far separated from heaven, we speak in the hearing of God, and that it is good for us to speak without offence.

It is now time to return to the four virtues, and to draw out and prescribe a way of life in conformity with them, taking each separately. First, then, let us consider temperance, which promises us a kind of integrity and incorruption in the love by which we are united to God. The office of temperance is in restraining and quieting the passions which make us pant for those things which turn us away from the laws of God and from the enjoyment of His goodness, that is, in a word, from the happy life. For there is the abode of truth; and in enjoying its contemplation, and in cleaving closely to it, we are assuredly happy; but departing from this, men become entangled in great errors and sorrows. For, as the apostle says, \"The root of all evils is covetousness; which some having followed, have made shipwreck of the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\"[fn-4-P428_192254:51-nf] And this sin of the soul is quite plainly, to those rightly understanding, set forth in the Old Testament in the transgression of Adam in Paradise. Thus, as the apostle says, \"In Adam we all die, and in Christ we shah all rise again.\"[fn-4-P429_192509:52-nf] Oh, the depth of these mysteries!

But as to those feebler spirits who, though they cannot be said to prefer earthly possessions to Christ, do yet cleave to them with a somewhat immoderate attachment, they have discovered by the pain of losing these things how much they were sinning in loving them. For their grief is of their own making; in the words of the apostle quoted above, \"they have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\" For it was well that they who had so long despised these verbal admonitions should receive the teaching of experience. For when the apostle says, \"They that will be rich fall into temptation,\" and so on, what he blames in riches is not the possession of them, but the desire of them. For elsewhere he says, \"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\"[fn-2-P261_68462:30-nf] They who were making such a use of their property have been consoled for light losses by great gains, and have had more pleasure in those possessions which they have securely laid past, by freely giving them away, than grief in those which they entirely lost by an anxious and selfish hoarding of them. For nothing could perish on earth save what they would be ashamed to carry away from earth. Our Lord's injunction runs, \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\"[fn-2-P262_69234:31-nf] And they who have listened to this injunction have proved in the time of tribulation how well they were advised in not despising this most trustworthy teacher, and most faithful and mighty guardian of their treasure. For if many were glad that their treasure was stored in places which the enemy chanced not to light upon, how much better founded was the joy of those who, by the counsel of their God, had fled with their treasure to a citadel which no enemy can possibly reach! Thus our Paulinus, bishop of Nola,[fn-2-P263_69771:32-nf] who voluntarily abandoned vast wealth and became quite poor, though abundantly rich in holiness, when the barbarians sacked Nola, and took him prisoner, used silently to pray, as he afterwards told me, \"O Lord, let me not be troubled for gold and silver, for where all my treasure is Thou knowest.\" For all his treasure was where he had been taught to hide and store it by Him who had also foretold that these calamities would happen in the world. Consequently those persons who obeyed their Lord when He warned them where and how to lay up treasure, did not lose even their, earthly possessions in the invasion of the barbarians; while those who are now repenting that they did not obey Him have learnt the right use of earthly goods, if not by the wisdom which would have prevented their loss, at least by the experience which follows it.","title":"Book I","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"2. In order, therefore, that the human mind might be purged from falsities of this kind, Holy Scripture, which suits itself to babes has not avoided words drawn from any class of things really existing, through which, as by nourishment, our understanding might rise gradually to things divine and transcendent. For, in speaking of God, it has both used words taken from things corporeal, as when it says, \"Hide me under the shadow of Thy wings;\"[fn-1-P175_53734:2-nf] and it has borrowed many things from the spiritual creature, whereby to signify that which indeed is not so, but must needs so be said: as, for instance, \"I the Lord thy God am a jealous God;\"[fn-1-P176_53943:3-nf] and, \"It repenteth me that I have made man.\"[fn-1-P177_54002:4-nf] But it has drawn no words whatever, whereby to frame either figures of speech or enigmatic sayings, from things which do not exist at all. And hence it is that they who are shut out from the truth by that third kind of error are more mischievously and emptily vain than their fellows; in that they surmise respecting God, what can neither be found in Himself nora in ny creature. For divine Scripture is wont to frame, as it were, allurements for children from the things which are found in the creature; whereby, according to their measure, and as it were by steps, the affections of the weak may be moved to seek those things that are above, and to leave those things that are below. But the same Scripture rarely employs those things which are spoken properly of God, and are not found in any creature; as, for instance, that which was said to Moses, \"I am that I am;\" and, \"I Am hath sent me to you.\"[fn-1-P178_54922:5-nf] For since both body and soul also are said in some sense to be, Holy Scripture certainly would not so express itself unless it meant to be understood in some special sense of the term. So, too, that which the Apostle says, \"Who only hath immortality.\"[fn-1-P179_55190:6-nf] Since the soul also both is said to be, and is, in a certain manner immortal, Scripture would not say \"only hath,\" unless because true immortality is unchangeableness; which no creature can possess, since it belongs to the creator alone.[fn-1-P180_55447:7-nf] So also James says, \"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.\"[fn-1-P181_55833:8-nf] So also David, \"Thou, shall change them, and they shall be changed; but Thou art the same.\"[fn-1-P182_55940:9-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"10. Hence also it follows by consequence, that the Apostle Paul did not say, \"Who alone has immortality,\" of the Father merely; but of the One and only God, which is the Trinity itself. For that which is itself eternal life is not mortal according to any changeableness; and hence the Son of God, because \"He is Eternal Life,\" is also Himself understood with the Father, where it is said, \"Who only hath immortality.\" For we, too, are made partakers of this eternal life, and become, in our own measure, immortal. But the eternal life itself, of which we are made partakers, is one thing; we ourselves, who, by partaking of it, shall live eternally, are another. For if He had said, \"Whom in His own time the Father will show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality;\" not even so would it be necessarily understood that the Son is excluded. For neither has the Son separated the Father from Himself, because He Himself, speaking elsewhere with the voice of wisdom (for He Himself is the Wisdom of God),[fn-2-P221_76048:30-nf] says, \"I alone compassed the circuit of heaven.\"[fn-2-P222_76116:31-nf] And therefore so much the more is it not necessary that the words, \"Who hath immortality,\" should be understood of the Father alone, omitting the Son; when they are said thus: \"That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: whom in His own time He will show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting.

For these, with more audacity than religion, bring a very dull heart to the inquiry into divine things. For whereas the soul is a spiritual substance, and whereas itself also was made, vet could not be made by any other than by Him by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing is made,[fn-5-P519_187651:54-nf] it, although changeable, is yet not visible; and this they have believed to be the case with the Word Himself and with the Wisdom of God itself, by which the soul was made; whereas this Wisdom is not only invisible, as the soul also is, but likewise unchangeable, which the soul is not.

But the chief good is contained in that spiritual life which we acquire by ourselves, because it cannot contain evil, or have an end; to which subject nature and the system of the body afford an argument. For other animals incline towards the ground, because they are earthly, and are incapable of immortality, which is from heaven; but man is upright and looks towards heaven,[fn-25-P2514_1048331:44-nf] because immortality is proposed to him; which, however, does not come, unless it is given to man by God. For otherwise there would be no difference between the just and the unjust, since every man who is born would become immortal. Immortality, then, is not the consequence[fn-25-P2515_1049159:45-nf] of nature, but the reward and recompense of virtue. Lastly, man does not immediately upon his birth walk upright, but at first on all fours,[fn-25-P2516_1049314:46-nf] because the nature of his body and of this present life is common to us with the dumb animals; afterwards, when his strength is confirmed, he raises himself, and his tongue is loosened so that he speaks plainly, and he ceases to be a dumb animal. And this argument teaches that man is born mortal; but that he afterwards becomes immortal, when he begins to live in conformity with the will[fn-25-P2517_1049720:47-nf] of God, that is, to follow righteousness,[fn-25-P2518_1049775:48-nf] which is comprised in the worship of God, since God raised man to a view of the heaven and of Himself. And this takes place when man, purified in the heavenly laver, lays aside[fn-25-P2519_1050248:49-nf] his infancy together with all the pollution of his past life, and having received an increase of divine vigour, becomes a perfect and complete man.","title":"Book VII.

We have learned what we ought to be: let us now learn what priests ought not to be Indulgence in wine is the fault of diners out and revellers.

That a priest must avoid covetousness even Samuel teaches when he proves before all the people that he has taken nothing from any man.[fn-29-P2948_778000:2117-nf] And the same lesson is taught by the poverty of the apostles who used to receive sustenance and refreshment from their brethren and to boast that they neither had nor wished to have anything besides food and raiment.[fn-29-P2949_778243:2118-nf] What the epistle to Timothy calls covetousness, that to Titus openly censures as the desire for filthy lucre.[fn-29-P2950_778380:2119-nf] \"One that ruleth well his own house.\" Not by increasing riches, not by providing regal banquets, not by having a pile of finely-wrought plates, not by slowly steaming pheasants so that the heat may reach the bones without melting the flesh upon them; no, but by first requiring of his own household the conduct which he has to inculcate in others. \"Having his children in subjection with all gravity.\" They must not, that is, follow the example of the sons of Eli who lay with the women in the vestibule of the Temple and, supposing religion to consist in plunder, diverted to the gratification of their own appetites all the best parts of the victims.[fn-29-P2951_779053:2120-nf] \"Not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.\" I cannot sufficiently express my amazement at the great blindness which makes men discuss such questions as that of marriage before baptism and causes them to charge people with a transaction which is dead in baptism, nay even quickened into a new life with Christ, while no one regards a commandment so clear and unmistakable as this about bishops not being novices. One who was yesterday a catechumen is to-day a bishop[fn-29-P2952_779608:2121-nf] ; one who was yesterday in the amphitheatre is to-day in the church; one who spent the evening in the circus stands in the morning at the altar: one who a little while ago was a patron of actors is now a dedicator of virgins. Was the apostle ignorant of our shifts and subterfuges? did he know nothing of our foolish arguments? He not only says that a bishop must be the husband of one wife, but he has given commandment that he must be blameless, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach, moderate,[fn-29-P2953_780168:2122-nf] not given to wine, no striker, not a brawler, not covetous, not a novice. Yet to all these requirements we shut our eyes and notice nothing but the wives of the aspirants. Who cannot give instances to shew the need of the warning: \"lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil?\" A priest[fn-29-P2954_780512:2123-nf] who is made such in a moment knows nothing of the lowliness and meekness which mark the meanest of the faithful, he knows nothing of Christian courtesy, he is not wise enough to think little of himself. He passes from one dignity to another, yet he has not fasted, he has not wept, he has not taken himself to task for his life, he has not striven by constant meditation to amend it, he has not given his substance to the poor. Yet he is moved from one see[fn-29-P2955_781016:2124-nf] to another, he passes, that is, from pride to pride. There can be no doubt that arrogance is what the Apostle means when he speaks of the condemnation and downfall of the devil. And all men fall into this who are in a moment made masters, actually before they are disciples. \"Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without.\" The last requirement is like the first. One who is really \"blameless\" obtains the unanimous approval not only of his own household but of outsiders as well. By aliens and persons outside the church we are to understand Jews, heretics and Gentiles. A Christian bishop then must be such that they who cavil at his religion may not venture to cavil at his life. At present however we see but too many bishops who are willing, like the charioteers in the horse races, to bid money for the popular applause; while there are some so universally hated that they can wring no money from their people, a feat which clowns accomplish by means of a few gestures.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"909","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3.

But that what is impossible with men is possible with God[fn-33-P3316_872003:2404-nf] we are taught by the counsel of the apostle who thus writes to Timothy:-\"charge them that are rich in this world that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy, that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute. willing to communicate, laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on the true life.\"[fn-33-P3317_872477:2405-nf] We have learned how a camel can pass through a needle's eye, how an animal with a hump on its back,[fn-33-P3318_872646:2406-nf] when it has laid down its packs, can take to itself the wings of a dove[fn-33-P3319_872781:2407-nf] and rest in the branches of the tree which has grown from a grain of mustard seed.[fn-33-P3320_872884:2408-nf] In Isaiah we read of camels, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah and Sheba, which carry gold and incense to the city of the Lord.[fn-33-P3321_873055:2409-nf] On like typical camels the Ishmaelitish merchantmen[fn-33-P3322_873128:2410-nf] bring down to the Egyptians perfume and incense and balm (of the kind that grows in Gilead good for the healing of wounds[fn-33-P3323_873276:2411-nf] ); and so fortunate are they that in the purchase and sale of Joseph they have for their merchandise the Saviour of the world.[fn-33-P3324_873427:2412-nf] And Aesop's fable tells us of a mouse which after eating its fill can no longer creep out as before it crept in.[fn-33-P3325_873642:2413-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"910","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"4.

I shall now describe the order of her monastery and the method by which she turned the continence of saintly souls to her own profit. She sowed carnal things that she might reap spiritual things;[fn-40-P4091_1097643:2946-nf] she gave earthly things that she might receive heavenly things; she forewent things temporal that she might in their stead obtain things eternal. Besides establishing a monastery for men, the charge of which she left to men, she divided into three companies and monasteries the numerous virgins whom she had gathered out of different provinces, some of whom are of noble birth while others belonged to the middle or lower classes. But, although they worked and had their meals separately from each other, these three companies met together for psalm-singing and prayer. After the chanting of the Alleluia-the signal by which they were summoned to the Collect[fn-40-P4092_1098462:2947-nf] -no one was permitted to remain behind. But either first or among the first Paula used to await the arrival of the rest, urging them to diligence rather by her own modest example than by motives of fear. At dawn, at the third, sixth, and ninth hours, at evening, and at midnight they recited the psalter each in turn.[fn-40-P4093_1098839:2948-nf] No sister was allowed to be ignorant of the psalms, and all had every day to learn a certain portion of the holy scriptures. On the Lord's day only they proceeded to the church beside which they lived, each company following its own mother-superior. Returning home in the same order, they then devoted themselves to their allotted tasks, and made garments either for themselves or else for others. If a virgin was of noble birth, she was not allowed to have an attendant belonging to her own household lest her maid having her mind full of the doings of old days and of the license of childhood might by constant converse open old wounds and renew former errors. All the sisters were clothed alike. Linen was not used except for drying the hands. So strictly did Paula separate them from men that she would not allow even eunuchs to approach them; lest she should give occasion to slanderous tongues (always ready to cavil at the religious) to console themselves for their own misdoing. When a sister was backward in coming to the recitation of the psalms or shewed herself remiss in her work, Paula used to approach her in different ways. Was she quick-tempered? Paula coaxed her. Was she phlegmatic? Paula chid her, copying the example of the apostle who said: \"What will ye? Shall I come to you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness?\"[fn-40-P4094_1100215:2949-nf] Apart from food and raiment she allowed no one to have anything she could call her own, for Paul had said, \"Having food and raiment let us be therewith content.\"[fn-40-P4095_1100400:2950-nf] She was afraid lest the custom of having more should breed covetousness in them; an appetite which no wealth can satisfy, for the more it has the more it requires, and neither opulence nor indigence is able to diminish it.[fn-40-P4096_1100652:2951-nf] When the sisters quarrelled one with another she reconciled them with soothing words. If the younger ones were troubled with fleshly desires, she broke their force by imposing redoubled fasts; for she wished her virgins to be ill in body rather than to suffer in soul. If she chanced to notice any sister too attentive to her dress, she reproved her for her error with knitted brows and severe looks, saying; \"a clean body and a clean dress mean an unclean soul. A virgin's lips should never utter an improper or an impure word, for such indicate a lascivious mind and by the outward man the faults of the inward are made manifest.\" When she saw a sister verbose and talkative or forward and taking pleasure in quarrels, and when she found after frequent admonitions that the offender shewed no signs of improvement; she placed her among the lowest of the sisters and outside their society, ordering her to pray at the door of the refectory instead of with the rest, and commanding her to take her food by herself, in the hope that where rebuke had failed shame might bring about a reformation. The sin of theft she loathed as if it were sacrilege; and that which among men of the world is counted little or nothing she declared to be in a monastery a crime of the deepest dye. How shall I describe her kindness and attention towards the sick or the wonderful care and devotion with which she nursed them? Yet, although when others were sick she freely gave them every indulgence, and even allowed them to eat meat; when she fell ill herself, she made no concessions to her own weakness, and seemed unfairly to change in her own case to harshness the kindness which she was always ready to shew to others.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1323","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"All this means that I take you by the hand and do my best to impress certain facts upon your mind; that, like a skilled sailor who has been through many shipwrecks, I am anxious to caution an inexperienced passenger of the risks before him.

With servants about them in swarms they claim for themselves the name of hermits.

For this reason therefore by the miracles [wrought by the Apostles] He renders the evidence of His Resurrection unequivocal, so that not only the men of those times-this is what would come of the ocular proof-but also all men thereafter, should be certain of the fact, that He was risen.

Augustin said: I say it is not sin, if it be not committed by one's own will; hence also there is reward, because of our own will we do right. Or if he who sins unwillingly deserves punishment, he who unwillingly does well ought to deserve reward. But who doubts that reward is only bestowed upon him who does something of good will? From which we know that punishment also is inflicted upon him who does something of ill will. But since you recall me to primordial natures and substances, my faith is that God Almighty-which must especially be attended to and fixed in the mind-that God Almighty has made good things. But the things made by Him cannot be such as is He who made them. For it is unjust and foolish to believe that works are equal to the workman, things made to the maker. Wherefore if it is reverential to believe that God made all good things, than which nevertheless He is by far more excellent and by far more pre-eminent; the origin and head of evil is sin, as the apostle said: \"Covetousness is the root of all evils; which some following after have made shipwreck of the faith, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\"[fn-8-P895_465868:2-nf] For if you seek the root of all evils, you have the apostle saying that covetousness is the root of all evils. But the root of a root I cannot seek. Or if there is another evil, whose root covetousness is not, covetousness will not be the root of all evils. But if it is true that covetousness is the root of all evils, in vain do we seek some other kind of evil. But as regards that contrary nature of yours which you introduce, since I have responded to your objections, I ask that you deign to tell me whether it is wholly evil, whether there can be no sin apart from it, whether by this alone punishment is deserved, not by the soul by which no sin has been committed. But if you say that this contrary nature alone deserves punishment, and not the soul, I ask to which is repentance, which is commanded, vouchsafed. If the soul is commanded to repent, sin is from the soul, and the soul has sinned voluntarily. For if the soul is compelled to do evil, that which it does is not evil. Is it not foolish and most absurd to say that the race of darkness has sinned and that I repent of the sins. Is it not most absurd to say that the race of darkness has sinned and that forgiveness of sins is vouchsafed to me, who according to your faith may well say: What have I done? What have I committed? I was with Thee, I was in a state of integrity, I was contaminated with no pollution. Thou didst send me hither, Thou didst suffer necessity, Thou didst protect Thy domains when great pollution and desolation threatened them. Since therefore Thou knowest the necessity by which I have been here oppressed, by reason of which I could not breathe, which I could not resist; why dost Thou accuse me as if sinning? or why dost Thou promise forgiveness of sins?

Moreover by any one who carefully uses his reason it will be found that even at the moment of the expected appearance of the Lord from heaven the Holy Spirit will not, as some suppose, have no functions to discharge: on the contrary, even in the day of His revelation, in which the blessed and only potentate[fn-15-P1593_394396:359-nf] will judge the world in righteousness,[fn-15-P1594_394458:360-nf] the Holy Spirit will be present with Him. For who is so ignorant of the good things prepared by God for them that are worthy. as not to know that the crown of the righteous is the grace of the Spirit, bestowed in more abundant and perfect measure in that day, when spiritual glory shall be distributed to each in proportion as he shall have nobly played the man? For among the glories of the saints are \"many mansions\" in the Father's house,[fn-15-P1595_394927:361-nf] that is differences of dignities: for as \"star differeth from star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-15-P1596_395068:362-nf] They, then, that were sealed by the Spirit unto the day of redemption,[fn-15-P1597_395161:363-nf] and preserve pure anti undiminished the first fruits which they received of the Spirit, are they that shall hear the words\"well done thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.\"[fn-15-P1598_395540:364-nf] In like manner they which have grieved the Holy Spirit by the wickedness of their ways, or have not wrought for Him that gave to them, shall be deprived of what they have received, their grace being transferred to others; or, according to one of the evangelists, they shall even be wholly cut asunder,[fn-15-P1599_395868:365-nf] -the cutting asunder meaning complete separation from the Spirit. The body is not divided, part being delivered to chastisement, and part let off; for when a whole has sinned it were like the old fables, and unworthy of a righteous judge, for only the half to suffer chastisement. Nor is the soul cut in two,-that soul the whole of which possesses the sinful affection throughout, and works the wickedness in co-operation with the body. The cutting asunder, as I have observed, is the separation for aye of the soul from the Spirit. For now, although the Spirit does not suffer admixture with the unworthy, He nevertheless does seem in a manner to be present with them that have once been sealed, awaiting the salvation which follows on their conversion; but then He will be wholly cut off from the soul that has defiled His grace. For this reason \"In Hell there is none that maketh confession; in death none that remembereth God,\"[fn-16-P1600_396824:366-nf] because the succour of the Spirit is no longer present. How then is it possible to conceive that the judgment is accomplished without the Holy Spirit, wherein the word points out that He is Himself the prize[fn-16-P1601_397054:367-nf] of the righteous, when instead of the earnest[fn-16-P1602_397124:368-nf] is given that which is perfect, and the first condemnation of sinners, when they are deprived of that which they seem to have? But the greatest proof of the conjunction of the Spirit with the Father and the Son is that He is said to have the same relation to God which the spirit in us has to each of us. \"For what man\" it is said, \"knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.\"[fn-16-P1603_397764:369-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":6,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"161","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"56.

For itwas in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians after the Lord's ascension, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles:[fn-32-P3224_1802999:7-nf] and certain houses were afterwards called by the new names of hospices[fn-32-P3225_1803086:8-nf] and monasteries; but the things themselves existed prior to their names, and are confirmed by religious truth, which also forms their defense against the wicked. In opposition also to the impiety of Arian heretics, they coined the new term, Patris Homousios;[fn-32-P3226_1803399:9-nf] but there was nothing new signified by such a name; for what is called Homousios is just this: \"I and my Father are one,\"[fn-32-P3227_1803601:10-nf] to wit, of one and the same substance. For if every novelty were profane, as little should we have it said by the Lord, \"A new commandment I give unto. you;\"[fn-32-P3228_1803778:11-nf] nor would the Testament be called New, nor the new song be sung throughout the whole earth. But there is profanity in the novelties of words, when it is said by \"the foolish and audacious woman, Come and enjoy the tasting of hidden bread, and the sweetness of stolen waters.\" From such enticing words of false science the apostle also gives his prohibitory warning, in the passage where he says, \"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane novelties of expression, and oppositions of science falsely so called; which some professing, have erred concerning the faith.\"[fn-32-P3229_1804395:12-nf] For there is nothing that these men so love as to profess science, and to deride as utter silliness faith in those verities which the young are enjoined to believe.","title":"Tractate XCVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_18_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_trallians","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Now I write these things unto you, not that I know there are any such persons among you; nay, indeed I hope that God will never permit any such report to reach my ears, He \"who spared not His Son for the sake of His holy Church.\"[fn-17-P1714_292457:51-nf] But foreseeing the snares of the wicked one, I arm you beforehand by my admonitions, as my beloved and faithful children in Christ, furnishing you with the means of protection[fn-17-P1715_292653:52-nf] against the deadly disease of unruly men, by which do ye flee from the disease[fn-17-P1716_292802:53-nf] [referred to] by the good-will of Christ our Lord.

But all that I have said, and whatever else seems to be worthily said of God after the like fashion of human speech, applies to the whole Trinity, which is one God, and to the several Persons in that Trinity. For who would dare to say either of the one God, which is the Trinity itself, or of the Father, or Son, or Holy Spirit, either that He is not living, or is without sense or intelligence; or that, in that nature in which they are affirmed to be mutually equal, any one of them is mortal, or corruptible, or changeable, or corporeal? Or is there any one who would deny that any one in the Trinity is most powerful, most righteous, most beautiful, most good, most blessed? If, then, these things, and all others of the kind, can be predicated both of the Trinity itself, and of each several one in that Trinity, where or how shall the Trinity manifest itself? Let us therefore first reduce these numerous predicates to some limited number. For that which is called life in God, is itself His essence and nature. God, therefore, does not live, unless by the life which He is to Himself. And this life is not such as that which is in a tree, wherein is neither understanding nor sense; nor such as is in a beast, for the life of a beast possesses the fivefold sense, but has no understanding. But the life which is God perceives and understands all things, and perceives by mind, not by body, because \"God is a spirit.\"[fn-19-P1930_963708:15-nf] And God does not perceive through a body, as animals do, which have bodies, for He does not consist of soul and body. And hence that single nature perceives as it understands, and understands as it perceives, and its sense and understanding are one and the same. Nor yet so, that at any time He should either cease or begin to be; for He is immortal. And it is not said of Him in vain, that \"He only hath immortality.\"[fn-19-P1931_964145:16-nf] For immortality is true immortality in His case whose nature admits no change. That is also true eternity by which God is unchangeable, without beginning, without end; consequently also incorruptible. It is one and the same thing, therefore, to call God eternal, or immortal, or incorruptible, or unchangeable; and it is likewise one and the same thing to say that He is living, and that He is intelligent, that is, in truth, wise. For He did not receive wisdom whereby to be wise, but He is Himself wisdom. And this is life, and again is power or might, and yet again beauty, whereby He is called powerful and beautiful. For what is more powerful and more beautiful than wisdom, \"which reaches from end to end mightily, and sweetly disposes all things\"?[fn-19-P1932_964920:17-nf] Or do goodness, again, and righteousness, differ from each other in the nature of God, as they differ in His works, as though they were two diverse qualities of God-goodness one, and righteousness another? Certainly not; but that which is righteousness is also itself goodness; and that which is goodness is also itself blessedness. And God is therefore called incorporeal, that He may be believed and understood to be a spirit, not a body.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_24_the_prescription_against_heretics_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"ANF-03","text":"I might be thought to have laid down this position to remedy distrust in my case,[fn-33-P3355_1174087:178-nf] or from a desire of entering on the contest[fn-33-P3356_1174163:179-nf] in some other way, were there not reasons on my side, especially this, that our faith owes deference[fn-33-P3357_1174342:180-nf] to the apostle, who forbids us to enter on \"questions,\" or to lend our ears to new-fangled statements,[fn-33-P3358_1174463:181-nf] or to consort with a heretic \"after the first and second admonition,\"[fn-33-P3359_1174556:182-nf] not, (be it observed, ) after discussion.

For where sin abounded, grace did much more abound[fn-15-P1501_409479:65-nf] . It behoved the Lord to suffer for us; but if the Devil had known Him, he would not have dared to approach Him.

Let us listen to his arrogant utterance:-\"Surely it would have been idle for the Lord to call Himself `the door,' if there were none to pass through to the understanding and contemplation of the Father, and it would have been idle for Him to call Himself `the way,' if He gave no facility to those who wish to come to the Father. And how could He be a light, without lightening men, without illuminating the eye of their soul to understand both Himself and the transcendent Light?\" Well, if he were here enumerating some arguments from his own head, that evade the understanding of the hearers by their subtlety, there would perhaps be a possibility of being deceived by the ingenuity of the argument, as his underlying thought frequently escapes the reader's notice. But since he alleges the Divine words, of course no one blames those who believe that their inspired teaching is the common property of all. \"Since then,\" he says, \"the Lord was named `a door,' it follows from hence that the essence of God may be comprehended by man.\" But the Gospel does not admit of this meaning. Let us hear the Divine utterance itself. \"I am the door,\" Christ says; \"by Me if any man enter in he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and find pasture[fn-19-P1942_1166647:1-nf] \" Which then of these is the knowledge of the essence? For as several things are here said, and each of them has its own special meaning, it is impossible to refer them all to the idea of the essence, lest the Deity should be thought to be compounded of different elements; and yet it is not easy to find which of the phrases just quoted can most properly be applied to that subject. The Lord is \"the door,\" \"By Me,\" He says, \"if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and shall find pasture.\" Are we to say[fn-19-P1943_1167193:2-nf] \"entrance\" of which he speaks in place of the essence of God, or \"salvation\" of those that enter in, or \"going out,\" or \"pasture,\" or \"finding\"?-for each of these is peculiar in its significance, and does not agree in meaning with the rest. For to get within appears obviously contrary to \"going out,\" and so with the other phrases. For \"pasture,\" in its proper meaning, is one thing, and \"finding\" another thing distinct from it. Which, then, of these is the essence of the Father supposed to be? For assuredly one cannot, by uttering all these phrases that disagree one with another in signification, intend to indicate by incompatible terms that Essence which is simple and uncompounded. And how can the word hold good, \"No man hath seen God at any time[fn-19-P1944_1168015:3-nf] \" and, \"Whom no man hath seen nor can see[fn-19-P1945_1168075:4-nf] \" and, \"There shall no man see the face of the Lord and live[fn-19-P1946_1168154:5-nf] \" if to be inside the door, or outside, or the finding pasture, denote the essence of the Father? For truly He is at the same time a \"door of encompassing[fn-19-P1947_1168334:6-nf] \" and a \"house of defence[fn-19-P1948_1168383:7-nf] \" as David calls Him, and through Himself He receives them that enter, and in Himself He saves those who have come within, and again by Himself He leads them forth to the pasture of virtues, and becomes all things to them that are in the way of salvation, that so He may make Himself that which the needs of each demand,-both way, and guide, and \"door of encompassing,\" and \"house of defence,\" and \"water of comfort[fn-19-P1949_1168815:8-nf] \" and \"green pasture[fn-19-P1950_1168853:9-nf] \" which in the Gospel He calls \"pasture\": but our new divine says that the Lord has been called \"the door\" because of the knowledge of the essence of the Father. Why then does he not force into the same significance the titles, \"Rock,\" and \"Stone,\" and \"Fountain,\" and \"Tree,\" and the rest, that so he might obtain evidence for his own theory by the multitude of strange testimonies, as he is well able to apply to each of these the same account which he has given of the Way, the Door, and the Light? But, as I am so taught by the inspired Scripture, I boldly affirm that He Who is above every name has for us many names, receiving them in accordance with the variety of His gracious dealings with us[fn-19-P1951_1169573:10-nf] \"tower of strength[fn-19-P1952_1169826:11-nf] \" and a \"city of encompassing[fn-19-P1953_1169873:12-nf] ,\" and a fountain, and a rock, and a vine, and a physician, and resurrection, and all the like, with reference to us, imparting Himself under various aspects by virtue of His benefits to us-ward. But those who are keen-sighted beyond human power, who see the incomprehensible, but overlook what may be comprehended, when they use such titles to expound the essences, are positive that they not only see, but measure Him Whom no man hath seen nor can see, but do not with the eye of their soul discern the Faith, which is the only thing within the compass of our observation, valuing before this the knowledge which they obtain from ratiocination. Just so I have heard the sacred record laying blame upon the sons of Benjamin who did not regard the law, but could shoot within a hair's breadth[fn-19-P1954_1170691:13-nf] , wherein, methinks, the word exhibited their eager pursuit of an idle object, that they were far darting and dexterous aimers at things that were useless and unsubstantial, but ignorant and regardless of what was manifestly for their benefit. For after what I have quoted, the history goes on to relate what befel them, how, when they had run madly after the iniquity of Sodom, and the people of Israel had taken up arms against them in full force, they were utterly destroyed. And it seems to me to be a kindly thought to warn young archers not to wish to shoot within a hair's-breadth, while they have no eyes for the door of the faith, but rather to drop their idle labour about the incomprehensible, and not to lose the gain that is ready to their hand, which is found by faith alone.

For those who would degrade the majesty of the glory of the Only-begotten to slavish and grovelling conceptions think that they find the strongest proof of their assertions in the words of the Lord to Mary, which He uttered after His resurrection, and before His ascension into heaven, saying, \"Touch Me not, for I am not yet ascended to My Father: but go to My brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God[fn-20-P2086_1263308:1-nf] .\" The orthodox interpretation of these words, the sense in which we have been accustomed to believe that they were spoken to Mary, is I think manifest to all who have received the faith in truth. Still the discussion of this point shall be given by us in its proper place; but meantime it is worth while to inquire from those who allege against us such phrases as \"ascending,\" \"being seen,\" \"being recognized by touch,\" and moreover \"being associated with men by brotherhood,\" whether they consider them to be proper to the Divine or to the Human Nature. For if they see in the Godhead the capacity of being seen and touched, of being supported by meat and drink, kinship and brotherhood with men, and all the attributes of corporeal nature, then let them predicate of the Only-begotten God both these and whatsoever else they will, as motive energy and local change, which are peculiar to things circumscribed by a body.

For those who would degrade the majesty of the glory of the Only-begotten to slavish and grovelling conceptions think that they find the strongest proof of their assertions in the words of the Lord to Mary, which He uttered after His resurrection, and before His ascension into heaven, saying, \"Touch Me not, for I am not yet ascended to My Father: but go to My brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God[fn-20-P2086_1263308:1-nf] .\" The orthodox interpretation of these words, the sense in which we have been accustomed to believe that they were spoken to Mary, is I think manifest to all who have received the faith in truth. Still the discussion of this point shall be given by us in its proper place; but meantime it is worth while to inquire from those who allege against us such phrases as \"ascending,\" \"being seen,\" \"being recognized by touch,\" and moreover \"being associated with men by brotherhood,\" whether they consider them to be proper to the Divine or to the Human Nature. For if they see in the Godhead the capacity of being seen and touched, of being supported by meat and drink, kinship and brotherhood with men, and all the attributes of corporeal nature, then let them predicate of the Only-begotten God both these and whatsoever else they will, as motive energy and local change, which are peculiar to things circumscribed by a body.

For I suppose that no one is so senseless as not to perceive the juggling with equivocal terms by which Eunomius deludes both himself and his admirers. The disciples, he says, were termed light, and that which was produced in the course of creation is also called light. But who does not know that in these only the name is common, and the thing meant in each case is quite different? For the light of the sun gives discernment to the sight, but the word of the disciples implants in men's souls the illumination of the truth. If, then, he is aware of this difference even in the case of that light, so that he thinks the light of the body is one thing, and the light of the soul another, we need no longer discuss the point with him, since his defence itself condemns him if we hold our peace. But if in that light he cannot discover such a difference as regards the mode of operation, (for it is not, he may say, the light of the eyes that illumines the flesh, and the spiritual light which illumines the soul, but the operation and the potency of the one light and of the other is the same, operating in the same sphere and on the same objects,) then how is it that from the difference between the light of the beams of the sun and that of the words of the Apostles, he infers a like difference between the Only-begotten Light and the Light of the Father? \"But the Son,\" he says, \"is called the `true' Light, the Father `Light unapproachable.'\" Well, these additional distinctions import a difference in degree only, and not in kind, between the light of the Son and the light of the Father. He thinks that the \"true\" is one thing, and the \"unapproachable\" another. I suppose there is no one so idiotic as not to see the real identity of meaning in the two terms. For the \"true\" and the \"unapproachable\" are each of them removed in an equally absolute degree from their contraries. For as the \"true\" does not admit any intermixture of the false, even so the \"unapproachable\" does not admit the access of its contrary. For the \"unapproachable\" is surely unapproachable by evil. But the light of the Son is not evil; for how can any one see in evil that which is true? Since, then, the truth is not evil, no one can say that the light which is in the Father is unapproachable by the truth. For if it were to reject the truth it would of course be associated with falsehood. For the nature of contradictories is such that the absence of the better involves the presence of its opposite. If, then, any one were to say that the Light of the Father was contemplated as remote from the presentation of its opposite, he would interpret the term \"unapproachable\" in a manner agreeable to the intention of the Apostle. But if he were to say that \"unapproachable\" signified alienation from good, he would suppose nothing else than that God was alien from, and at enmity with, Himself, being at the same time good and opposed to good. But this is impossible: for the good is akin to good. Accordingly the one Light is not divergent from the other. For the Son is the true Light, and the Father is Light unapproachable.

But let us not pass over this point either without notice, that it is only after garbling the Apostle's words to suit his own fancy that he cites the phrase as if it came from him. For Paul says, \"dwelling in light unapproachable[fn-21-P2116_1282492:27-nf] .\" But there is a great difference between being oneself something and being in something. For he who said, \"dwelling in light unapproachable,\" did not, by the word \"dwelling,\" indicate God Himself, but that which surrounds Him, which in our view is equivalent to the Gospel phrase which tells us that the Father is in the Son.

As for all the passages from the inspired writings which he drags in, though quite unconnected with his object, formulating thereby a difference of immortality[fn-24-P2411_1650312:143-nf] in angels and in men, I do not know what he has in his eye, or what he hopes to prove by them, and I pass them by. The immortal, as long as it is immortal, admits of no degrees of more and less arising from comparison. For if the one member of the comparison is, by the force of contrast, to suffer a diminution or privation as regards its immortality, it must needs be that such a member is not to be called immortal at all; for how can that be called absolutely immortal in which mortality is detected by this juxtaposition and comparison? And to think of that fine hair-splitting of his, in not allowing the idea of privation to be unvarying and general, but in asserting, on the contrary, that while separation from good things is privation, the absence of bad things is not to be marked by that term!

What this newly-imported dictum of his has to do with his preceding argument, neither we nor any one else amongst reflecting people are able to understand. Yet because we have not the mental strength to take in these scientific subtleties, he calls us \"unscientific both in our judgment as to objects, and in our use of terms\"; those are his very words. But all this, as having no power to shake the truth, I pass over without further notice; and also how he misrepresents the view we have expounded of the imperishable, and of the unembodied, namely, that of these terms the latter signifies the undimensional, where the threefold extension belonging to all bodies is not to be found, and the former signifies that which is not receptive of destruction: and also how he says, that \"we do not think it right to let the shape of these words be lost by extending them to ideas inapplicable to them, or to imagine that each of them is indicative of something not present or not accruing; but rather we think they are indicative of the actual essence\"; all this I deem worthy only of silence and deep oblivion, and leave to the reader to detect for himself their mingled folly and blasphemy.

The intention, namely, for which a thing is done, He calls the eye: of which a little above He was speaking with purpose to come down to this, and saying, \"The light of thy body is thine eye: if thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light; but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness;\" that is, such will be thy deeds as shall be thine intention for which thou doest them.

By the righteousness of God, he means that judgment which we shall have to undergo as the recompense of our deeds.

If, however, He is the same who was invisible before the incarnation, how comes it that He was actually seen in ancient times before (coming in) the flesh? And by parity of reasoning, if He is the same who was visible after (coming in) the flesh, how happens it that He is now declared to be invisible by the apostles? How, I repeat, can all this be, unless it be that He is one, who anciently was visible only in mystery and enigma, and became more clearly visible by His incarnation, even the Word who was also made flesh; whilst He is another whom no man has seen at any time, being none else than the Father, even Him to whom the Word belongs?

For when He speaks of all power and all judgment, and says that all things were made by Him, and all things have been delivered into His hand, He allows no exception (in respect) of time, because they would not be all things unless they were the things of all time. It is the Son, therefore, who has been from the beginning administering judgment, throwing down the haughty tower, and dividing the tongues, punishing the whole world by the violence of waters, raining upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone, as the Lord from the Lord.

Thus was He ever learning even as God to converse with men upon earth, being no other than the Word which was to be made flesh. But He was thus learning (or rehearsing), in order to level for us the way of faith, that we might the more readily believe that the Son of God had come down into the world, if we knew that in times past also something similar had been done.[fn-106-P10624_2984308:199-nf] For as it was on our account and for our learning that these events are described in the Scriptures, so for our sakes also were they done-(even ours, I say), \"upon whom the ends of the world are come.\"[fn-106-P10625_2984562:200-nf] In this way it was that even then He knew full well what human feelings and affections were, intending as He always did to take upon Him man's actual component substances, body and soul, making inquiry of Adam (as if He were ignorant),[fn-106-P10626_2984825:201-nf] \"Where art thou, Adam? \"[fn-106-P10627_2984907:202-nf] -repenting that He had made man, as if He had lacked foresight;[fn-106-P10628_2984991:203-nf] tempting Abraham, as if ignorant of what was in man; offended with persons, and then reconciled to them; and whatever other (weaknesses and imperfections) the heretics lay hold of (in their assumptions) as unworthy of God, in order to discredit the Creator, not considering that these circumstances are suitable enough for the Son, who was one day to experience even human sufferings-hunger and thirst, and tears, and actual birth and real death, and in respect of such a dispensation \"made by the Father a little less than the angels.\"[fn-106-P10629_2985547:204-nf] But the heretics, you may be sure, will not allow that those things are suitable even to the Son of God, which you are imputing to the very Father Himself, when you pretend[fn-106-P10630_2985740:205-nf] that He made Himself less (than the angels) on our account; whereas the Scripture informs us that He who was made less was so affected by another, and not Himself by Himself.

Surely even these things could not have been believed even of the Son of God, unless they had been given us in the Scriptures; possibly also they could not have been believed of the Father, even if they had been given in the Scriptures, since these men bring Him down into Mary's womb, and set Him before Pilate's judgment-seat, and bury Him in the sepulchre of Joseph. Hence, therefore, their error becomes manifest; for, being ignorant that the entire order of the divine administration has from the very first had its course through the agency of the Son, they believe that the Father Himself was actually seen, and held converse with men. and worked, and was athirst, and suffered hunger (in spite of the prophet who says: \"The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, shall never thirst at all, nor be hungry; \"[fn-106-P10637_2988074:212-nf] much more, shall neither die at any time, nor be buried!), and therefore that it was uniformly one God, even the Father, who at all times did Himself the things which were really done by Him through the agency of the Son.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_38_homily_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"7.

But if any one wishes to put us[fn-79-P7927_1684979:84-nf] to shame in regard to these things because of the great majority of those of the church who are thought to believe, it must be said to him not only \"Many are called, but few chosen; \"[fn-79-P7928_1685178:85-nf] but also that which was said by the Saviour to those who come to Him, as it is recorded in Luke in these words, \"Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in through the narrow door and shall not be able; \"[fn-79-P7929_1685449:86-nf] and also that which is written in the Gospel of Matthew thus, \"For narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth unto life, and few be they that find it.\"[fn-79-P7930_1685633:87-nf] Now, if you attend to the saying, \"Many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in and shall not be able,\"[fn-79-P7931_1685757:88-nf] you will understand that this refers to those who boast that they are of the church, but live weakly and contrary to the word. Of those, then, who seek to enter in, those who are not able to enter will not be able to do so, because the gates of Hades prevail against them; but in the case of those against whom the gates of Hades will not prevail, those seeking to enter in will be strong, being able to do all things, in Christ Jesus, who strengtheneth them.[fn-79-P7932_1686237:89-nf] And in like manner each one of those who are the authors of any evil opinion has become the architect of a certain gate of Hades; but those who co-operate with the teaching of the architect of such things are servants and stewards, who are the bond-servants of the evil doctrine which goes to build up impiety.

And this also we must know that as the gates of cities have each their own names, in the same way the gates of Hades might be named after the species of sins; so that one gate of Hades is called \"fornication,\" through which fornicators go, and another \"denial,\" through which the deniers of God go down into Hades. And likewise already each of the heterodox and of those who have begotten any \"knowledge which is falsely so called,\"[fn-79-P7934_1687467:91-nf] has built a gate of Hades-Marcion one gate, and Basilides another, and Valentinus another.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":6,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"ANF-10","text":"In this place, then, the gates of Hades are spoken of; but in the Psalms the prophet gives thanks saying, \"He who lifteth me up from the gates of death that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion.\"[fn-79-P7938_1687863:92-nf] And from this we learn that it is never possible for any one to be fit to declare the praises of God, unless he has been lifted up from the gates of death, and has come to the gates of Zion. Now the gates of Zion may be conceived as opposed to the gates of death, so that there is one gate of death, dissoluteness, but a gate of Zion, self-control; and so a gate of death, unrighteousness, but a gate of Zion, righteousness, which the prophet shows forth saying, \"This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter into it.\"[fn-79-P7939_1688414:93-nf] And again there is cowardice, a gate of death, but manly courage, a gate of Zion; and want of prudence, a gate of death, but its opposite, prudence, a gate of Zion.

Let, then, the principalities and powers with which our wrestling is, be called gates of Hades, but the \"ministering spirits\"[fn-79-P7943_1689195:97-nf] gates of righteousness. But as in the case of the better things many gates are first spoken of, and after the gates, one, in the passage, \"Open to me the gates of righteousness, I will enter into them, and will make full confession to the Lord,\" and \"this is the gate of the Lord, by it the righteous shall enter; \"[fn-79-P7944_1689528:98-nf] so also in the case of those gates which are opposed, many are the gates of Hades and death, each a power; but over all these the wicked one himself.

Lastly, let them be so far removed from this world's fashions as to remain altogether common property for the use of the servants of God. For whatever is claimed by one or a few among the servants of God and is not the common property of the whole body. of the brethren alike is either superfluous or vain, and for that reason to be considered harmful, and affording an appearance of vanity rather than virtue. And, therefore, whatever models we see were not taught either by the saints of old who laid the foundations of the monastic life, or by the fathers of our own time who in their turn keep up at the present day their customs, these we also should reject as superfluous and useless: wherefore they utterly disapproved of a robe of sackcloth as being visible to all and conspicuous, and what from this very fact will not only confer no benefit on the soul but rather minister to vanity and pride, and as being inconvenient and unsuitable for the performance of necessary work for which a monk ought always to go ready and unimpeded. But even if we hear of some respectable persons who have been dressed inthis garb, a rule for the monasteries is not, therefore, to be passed by us, nor should the ancient decrees of the holy fathers be upset because we do not think that a few men, presuming on the possession of other virtues, are to be blamed even in regard of those things which they have practised not in accordance with the Catholic rule. For the opinion of a few ought not to be preferred to or to interfere with the general rule for all. For we ought to give unhesitating allegiance and unquestioning obedience, not to those customs and rules which the will of a few have introduced, but to those which a long standing antiquity and numbers of the holy fathers have passed on by an unanimous decision to those that come after. Nor, indeed, ought this to influence us as a precedent for our daily life, that Joram, the wicked king of Israel, when surrounded by bands of his foes, rent his clothes, and is said to have had sackcloth inside them;[fn-19-P1923_859843:6-nf] or that the Ninevites, in order to mitigate the sentence of God, which had been pronounced against them by the prophet, were clothed in rough sackcloth.[fn-19-P1924_860471:7-nf] The former is shown to have been clothed with it secretly underneath, so that unless the upper garment had been rent it could not possibly have been known by any one, and the latter tolerated a covering of sackcloth at a time when, since all were mourning over the approaching destruction of the city and were clothed with the same garments, none could be accused of ostentation.

For he complains that what is provided in the monastery is not sufficient, and can scarcely be endured by a sound and sturdy body. What is he to do if ill health comes on, and he has no special store of his own to support him in his weakness? He says that the allowance of the monastery is but meagre, and that there is the greatest carelessness about the sick: and if he has not something of his own so that he can look after the wants of his body, he will perish miserably. The dress which is allowed him is insufficient, unless he has provided something with which to procure another. Lastly, he says that he cannot possibly remainfor long in the same place and monastery, and that unless he has secured the money for his journey, and the cost of his removal over the sea, he cannot move when he wants to, and, detained by the compulsion of want, will henceforth drag out a wretched and wearisome existence without making the slightest advance: that he cannot without indignity be supported by another's substance, as a pauper and one in want. And so when he has bamboozled himself with such thoughts as these, he racks his brains to think how he can acquire at least one penny. Then he anxiously searches for some special work which he can do without the Abbot knowing anything about it. And selling it secretly, and so securing the coveted coin, he torments himself worse and worse in thinking how he can double it: puzzled as to where to deposit it, or to whom to intrust it. Then he is oppressed with a still weightier care as to what to buy with it, or by what transaction he can double it. And when this has turned out as he wished, a still more greedy craving for gold springs up, and is more and more keenly excited, as his store of money grows larger and larger. For with the increase of wealth the mania of covetousness increases. Then next he has forebodings of a long life, and an enfeebled old age, and infirmities of all sorts, and long drawn out, which will be insupportable in old age, unless a large store of money has been laid by in youth. And so the wretched soul is agitated, and held fast, as it were, in a serpent's toils, while it endeavours to add to that heap which it has unlawfully secured, by still more unlawful care, and itself gives birth to plagues which inflame it more sorely, and being entirely absorbed in the quest of gain, pays attention to nothing but how to get money with which to fly[fn-27-P2702_1106418:3-nf] as quickly as possible from the discipline of the monastery, never keeping faith where there is a gleam of hope of money to be got. For this it shrinks not from the crime of lying, perjury, and theft, of breaking a promise, of giving way to injurious bursts of passion. If the man has dropped away at all from the hope of gain, he has no scruples about transgressing the bounds of humility, and through it all gold and the love of gain become to him his god, as the belly does to others. Wherefore the blessed Apostle, looking out on the deadly poison of this pest, not only says that it is a root of all kinds of evil, but also calls it the worship of idols, saying \"And covetousness (which in Greek is called filarguri/a) which is the worship of idols.\"[fn-27-P2703_1107192:4-nf] You see then to what a downfall this madness step by step leads, so that by the voice of the Apostle it is actually declared to be the worship of idols and false gods, because passing over the image and likeness of God (which one who serves God with devotion ought to preserve undefiled in himself), it chooses to love and carefor images stamped on gold instead of God.","title":"Book VII.of the Spirit of Covetousness.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_41_book_vii_of_the_spirit_of_covetousness_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"I know of one, who thinks himself a monk, and what is worse flatters himself on his perfection, who had been received into a monastery, and when charged by his Abbot not to turn his thoughts back to those things which he had given up and renounced, but to free himself from covetousness, the root of all kinds of evil, and from earthly snares; and when told that if he wished to be cleansed from his former passions, by which he saw that he was from time to time grievously oppressed, he should cease from caring about those things which even formerly were not his own, entangled in the chains of which he certainly could not make progress towards purifying himself of his faults: with an angry expression he did not hesitate to answer, \"If you have that with which you can support others, why do you forbid me to have it as well?\"[fn-27-P2725_1113140:6-nf] ","title":"Book VII.of the Spirit of Covetousness.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_41_book_vii_of_the_spirit_of_covetousness_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"121","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Keeping then in mind the judgment of Ananias and Sapphira let us dread keeping back any of those things which we gave up and vowed utterly to forsake.

For they could be presented more diffusely and continued in a more expanded disputation, since the whole of the Old and New Testaments might be adduced in testimony that thus the true faith stands. But because heretics, ever struggling against the truth, are accustomed to prolong the controversy of pure tradition and Catholic faith, being offended against Christ; because He is, moreover, asserted to be God by the Scriptures also, and this is believed to be so by us; we must rightly-that every heretical calumny may be removed from our faith-contend, concerning the fact that Christ is God also, in such a way as that it may not militate against the truth of Scripture; nor yet against our faith, how there is declared to be one God by the Scriptures, and how it is held and believed by us. For as well they who say that Jesus Christ Himself is God the Father, as moreover they who would have Him to be only man, have gathered thence[fn-104-P10447_3290705:266-nf] the sources and reasons of their error and perversity; because when they perceived that it was written[fn-104-P10448_3290837:267-nf] that \"God is one,\" they thought that they could not otherwise hold such an opinion than by supposing that it must be believed either that Christ was man only, or really God the Father. And they were accustomed in such a way to connect their sophistries as to endeavour to justify their own error. And thus they who say that Jesus Christ is the Father argue as follows:-If God is one, and Christ is God, Christ is the Father, since God is one. If Christ be not the Father, because Christ is God the Son, there appear to be two Gods introduced, contrary to the Scriptures. And they who contend that Christ is man only, conclude on the other hand thus:-If the Father is one, and the Son another, but the Father is God and Christ is God, then there is not one God, but two Gods are at once introduced, the Father and the Son; and if God is one, by consequence Christ must be a man, so that rightly the Father may be one God. Thus indeed the Lord is, as it were, crucified between two thieves,[fn-104-P10449_3291864:268-nf] even as He was formerly placed; and thus from either side He receives the sacrilegious reproaches of such heretics as these. But neither the Holy Scriptures nor we suggest to them the reasons of their perdition and blindness, if they either will not, or cannot, see what is evidently written in the midst of the divine documents. For we both know, and read, and believe, and maintain that God is one, who made the heaven as well as the earth, since we neither know any other, nor shall we at any time know such, seeing that there is none. \"I,\" says He, \"am God, and there is none beside me, righteous and a Saviour.\"[fn-104-P10450_3292598:269-nf] And in another place: \"I am the first and the last, and beside me there is no God who is as I.\"[fn-104-P10451_3292718:270-nf] And, \"Who hath meted out heaven with a Span, and the earth with a handful? Who has suspended the mountains in a balance, and the woods on scales? \"[fn-104-P10452_3292890:271-nf] And Hezekiah: \"That all may know that Thou art God alone.\"[fn-104-P10453_3292970:272-nf] Moreover, the Lord Himself: \"Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? God alone is good.\"[fn-104-P10454_3293094:273-nf] Moreover, the Apostle Paul says: \"Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light that no man can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can see.\"[fn-104-P10455_3293272:274-nf] And in another place: \"But a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.\"[fn-104-P10456_3293376:275-nf] But even as we hold, and read, and believe this, thus we ought to pass over no portion of the heavenly Scriptures, since indeed also we ought by no means to reject those marks of Christ's divinity which are laid down in the Scriptures, that we may not, by corrupting the authority of the Scriptures, be held to have corrupted the integrity of our holy faith. And let us therefore believe this, since it is most faithful that Jesus Christ the Son of God is our Lord and God; because \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God.\"[fn-104-P10457_3294002:276-nf] And, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us.\"[fn-104-P10458_3294072:277-nf] And, \"My Lord and my God.\"[fn-104-P10459_3294119:278-nf] And, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom according to the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for evermore.\"[fn-104-P10460_3294261:279-nf] What, then, shall we say? Does Scripture set before us two Gods? How, then, does it say that \"God is one? \"Or is not Christ God also? How, then, is it said to Christ,\" My Lord and my God? \"Unless, therefore, we hold all this with fitting veneration and lawful argument, we shall reasonably be thought to have furnished a scandal to the heretics, not assuredly by the fault of the heavenly Scriptures, which never deceive; but by the presumption of human error, whereby they have chosen to be heretics. And in the first place, we must turn the attack against them who undertake to make against us the charge of saying that there are two Gods. It is written, and they cannot deny it, that \"there is one Lord.\"[fn-104-P10461_3294989:280-nf] What, then, do they think of Christ?-that He is Lord, or that He is not Lord at all? But they do not doubt absolutely that He is Lord; therefore, if their reasoning be true, here are already two Lords. How, then, is it true according to the Scriptures, there is one Lord? And Christ is called the \"one Master.\"[fn-104-P10462_3295322:281-nf] Nevertheless we read that the Apostle Paul also is a master.[fn-104-P10463_3295410:282-nf] Then, according to this, our Master is not one, for from these things we conclude that there are two masters. How, then, according to the Scriptures, is \"one our Master, even Christ? \"In the Scriptures there is one \"called good, even God; \"but in the same Scriptures Christ is also asserted to be good. There is not, then, if they rightly conclude, one good, but even two good. How, then, according to the scriptural faith, is there said to be only one good? But if they do not think that it can by any means interfere with the truth that there is one Lord, that Christ also is Lord, nor with the truth that one is our. Master, that Paul also is our master, or with the truth that one is good, that Christ also is called good; on the same reasoning, let them understand that, from the fact that God is one, no obstruction arises to the truth that Christ also is declared to be God.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_54_book_iii_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"268","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"Let those who have faithful masters not despise them, because they ate brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful.\"[fn-46-P4669_1429491:207-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":6,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_140_on_the_jewish_meats_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And thus there was a certain ancient time, wherein those shadows or figures were to be used, that meats should be abstained from which had indeed been commended by their creation, but had been prohibited by the law. But now Christ, the end of the law, has come, disclosing all the obscurities of the law-all those things which antiquity had covered with the clouds of sacraments. For the illustrious Master, and the heavenly Teacher, and the ordainer of the perfected truth, has come, under whom at length it is rightly said: \"To the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled.\"[fn-105-P10519_3324091:21-nf] Moreover, in another place: \"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused which is received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer.\"[fn-105-P10520_3324289:22-nf] Again, in another place: \"The Spirit expressly says that in the last days some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, doctrines of demons, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by them which believe and those who know God.\"[fn-105-P10521_3324710:23-nf] Moreover, in another passage: \"Everything that is sold in the market-place eat, asking nothing.\"[fn-105-P10522_3324832:24-nf] From these things it is plain that all those things are returned to their original blessedness now that the law is finished, and that we must not revert to the special observances of meats, which observances were ordained for a certain reason, but which evangelical liberty has now taken away, their discharge being given. The apostle cries out: \"The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace. and joy.\"[fn-105-P10523_3325281:25-nf] Also elsewhere: \"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.\"[fn-105-P10524_3325487:26-nf] God is not worshipped by the belly nor by meats, which the Lord says will perish, and are \"purged\" by natural law in the draught.[fn-105-P10525_3325638:27-nf] For he who worships the Lord by meats, is merely as one who has his belly for his Lord. The meat, I say, true, and holy, and pure, is a true faith, an unspotted conscience, and an innocent soul. Whosoever is thus fed, feeds also with Christ. Such a banqueter is God's guest: these are the feasts that feed the angels, these are the tables which the martyrs make. Hence is that word of the law: \"Man cloth not live by bread alone, but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\"[fn-105-P10526_3326272:28-nf] Hence, too, that saying of Christ: \"My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work.\"[fn-105-P10527_3326401:29-nf] Hence, \"Ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of my loaves and were filled. But labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for the meat which endureth to life eternal, which the Son of man will give you; for Him hath the Father sealed.\"[fn-105-P10528_3326689:30-nf] By righteousness, I say, and by continency, and by the rest of the virtues, God is worshipped. For Zecharias also tells us, saying: \"If ye eat or drink, is it not ye that eat or drink? \"[fn-105-P10529_3326898:31-nf] -declaring thereby that meat or drink attain not unto God, but unto man: for neither is God fleshly, so as to be pleased with flesh; nor is He careful[fn-105-P10530_3327074:32-nf] for these pleasures, so as to rejoice in our food.[fn-105-P10531_3327186:33-nf] God rejoices in our faith alone, in our innocency alone, in our truth alone, in our virtues alone. And these dwell not in our belly, but in our soul; and these are acquired for us by divine awe and heavenly fear, and not by earthly food. And such the apostle fitly rebuked, as \"obeying the superstitions of angels, puffed up by their fleshly mind; not holding Christ the head, from whom all the body, joined together by links, and inwoven and grown together by mutual members in the bond of charity, increaseth to God; \"[fn-105-P10532_3327843:34-nf] but observing those things: \"Touch not, taste not, handle not; which indeed seem to have a form of religion, in that the body is not spared.\"[fn-105-P10533_3328007:35-nf] Yet there is no advantage at all of righteousness, while we are recalled by a voluntary slavery to those elements to which by baptism we have died.","title":"On the Jewish Meats.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_140_on_the_jewish_meats_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"ANF-05","text":"But from the fact that liberty of meats is granted to us, it does not of necessity follow that luxury is allowed us; nor because the Gospel has dealt with us very liberally, has it taken away continency.

Nor yet are there wanting, among such things, those who, although they have claimed to themselves the sound of the Christian name, afford instances and teachings of intemperance; whose vices have come even to that pitch, that while fasting they drink in the early morning, not thinking it Christian to drink after meat, unless the wine poured into their empty and unoccupied veins should have gone down directly after sleep: for they seem to have less relish of what they drink if food be mingled with the wine. Thus you may see such in a new kind, still fasting and already drunk, not running to the tavern, but carrying the tavern about with them; and if any one of them offers a salute, he gives not a kiss, but drinks a health. What can they do after meat, whom meat finds intoxicated? Or in what kind of state does the sun at his setting leave them, whom at his rising he looks upon as already stupid with wine? But things which are detestable are not to be taken as our examples. For those things only are to be taken by which our soul may be made better; and although in the Gospel the use of meats is universally given to us, yet it is understood to be given to us only with the law of frugality and continence. For these things are even greatly becoming to the faithful,-to wit, those who are about to pray to God and to give Him thanks, not only by day, but by night also; which cannot be if the mind, stupefied by meat and wine, should not prevail to shake off heavy sleep and the load heaped upon the breast.

Nor yet are there wanting, among such things, those who, although they have claimed to themselves the sound of the Christian name, afford instances and teachings of intemperance; whose vices have come even to that pitch, that while fasting they drink in the early morning, not thinking it Christian to drink after meat, unless the wine poured into their empty and unoccupied veins should have gone down directly after sleep: for they seem to have less relish of what they drink if food be mingled with the wine. Thus you may see such in a new kind, still fasting and already drunk, not running to the tavern, but carrying the tavern about with them; and if any one of them offers a salute, he gives not a kiss, but drinks a health. What can they do after meat, whom meat finds intoxicated? Or in what kind of state does the sun at his setting leave them, whom at his rising he looks upon as already stupid with wine? But things which are detestable are not to be taken as our examples. For those things only are to be taken by which our soul may be made better; and although in the Gospel the use of meats is universally given to us, yet it is understood to be given to us only with the law of frugality and continence. For these things are even greatly becoming to the faithful,-to wit, those who are about to pray to God and to give Him thanks, not only by day, but by night also; which cannot be if the mind, stupefied by meat and wine, should not prevail to shake off heavy sleep and the load heaped upon the breast.

If our spirit is aroused by the loss of property, it is commonished by the Lord's Scriptures, in almost every place, to a contemning of the world;[fn-122-P12284_3435965:71-nf] nor is there any more powerful exhortation to contempt of money submitted[fn-122-P12285_3436053:72-nf] (to us), than (the fact) the Lord Himself is found amid no riches. He always justifies the poor, fore-condemns the rich. So He fore-ministered to patience \"loss,\" and to opulence \"contempt\" (as portion);[fn-122-P12286_3436272:73-nf] demonstrating, by means of (His own) repudiation of riches, that hurts done to them also are not to be much regarded. Of that, therefore, which we have not the smallest need to seek after, because the Lord did not seek after it either, we ought to endure without heart-sickness the cutting down or taking away. \"Covetousness,\" the Spirit of the Lord has through the apostle pronounced \"a root of all evils.\"[fn-122-P12287_3436829:74-nf] Let us not interpret that covetousness as consisting merely in the concupiscence of what is another's: for even what seems ours is another's; for nothing is ours, since all things are God's, whose are we also ourselves. And so, if, when suffering from a loss, we feel impatiently, grieving for what is lost from what is not our own, we shall be detected as bordering on covetousness: we seek what is another's when we ill brook losing what is another's. He who is greatly stirred with impatience of a loss, does, by giving things earthly the precedence over things heavenly, sin directly[fn-122-P12288_3437463:75-nf] against God; for the Spirit, which he has received from the Lord, he greatly shocks for the sake of a worldly matter. Willingly, therefore, let us lose things earthly, let us keep things heavenly. Perish the whole world,[fn-122-P12289_3437775:76-nf] so I may make patience my gain! In truth, I know not whether he who has not made up his mind to endure with constancy the loss of somewhat of his, either by theft, or else by force, or else even by carelessness, would himself readily or heartily lay hand on his own property in the cause of almsgiving: for who that endures not at all to be cut by another, himself draws the sword on his own body? Patience in losses is an exercise in bestowing and communicating. Who fears not to lose, finds it not irksome to give. Else how will one, when he has two coats, give the one of them to the naked,[fn-122-P12290_3438384:77-nf] unless he be a man likewise to offer to one who takes away his coat his cloak as well?[fn-122-P12291_3438490:78-nf] How shall we fashion to us friends from mammon,[fn-122-P12292_3438569:79-nf] if we love it so much as not to put up with its loss? We shall perish together with the lost mammon. Why do we find here, where it is our business to lose?[fn-122-P12293_3438743:80-nf] To exhibit impatience at all losses is the Gentiles' business, who give money the precedence perhaps over their soul; for so they do, when, in their cupidities of lucre, they encounter the gainful perils of commerce on the sea; when, for money's sake, even in the forum, there is nothing which damnation (itself) would fear which they hesitate to essay; when they hire themselves for sport and the camp; when, after the manner of wild beasts, they play the bandit along the highway. But us, according to the diversity by which we are distinguished from them, it becomes to lay down not our soul for money, but money for our soul, whether spontaneously in bestowing or patiently in losing.","title":"Of Patience.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":6,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_46_book_xii_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"112","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"The mind then that is hardened by such feelings, and which begins with this miserable coldness is sure to go daily from bad to worse and to conclude its life with a more hideous end: and while it takes delight in its former desires, and is overcome, as the apostle says, by impious avarice (as he says of it \"and covetousness, which is idolatry, or the worship of idols,\" and again \"the love of money,\" says he, \"is the root of all evils\"[fn-34-P3433_1278506:62-nf] ) can never admit into the heart the true and unfeigned humility of Christ, while the man boasts himself of his high birth, or is puffed up by his position in the world (which he has forsaken in body but not in mind) or is proud of his wealth which he retains to his own destruction; and because of this he is no longer content to endure the yoke of the monastery, or to be instructed by the teaching of any of the elders, and not only objects to observe any rule of subjection or obedience, but will not even listen to teaching about perfection; and such dislike of spiritual talk grows up in his heart that if such a conversation should happen to arise, he cannot keep his eyes fixed on one spot, but his gaze wanders blankly about here and there, and his eyes shift hither and thither, as the custom is.

Now certainly, \"the root of all evils is avarice.\" We find that in pride there is also avarice, (or grasping;) for man has passed bounds: and what is it to be avaricious to go beyond that which sufficeth. Adam fell by pride: \"the beginning of all sin is pride,\" saith it: did he fall by grasping? What more grasping, than he whom God could not suffice? In fact, my brethren, we read how man was made after the image and likeness of God: and what said God of him? \"And let him have power over the fishes of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over all cattle which move upon the earth.\"[fn-45-P4513_2434235:20-nf] Said He, Have power over men? \"Have power,\" saith He: He hath given him natural power: \"have power\" over what? \"over the fishes of the sea, the fowl of the heaven, and allmoving things which move upon the earth.\" Why is this power over these things anatural power? Because man hath the power from this; that he was made after the image of God. And in what was he made after God's image? In the intellect, in the mind, in the inner man; in that he understands truth, distinguishes between right and wrong, knows by whom he was made, is able to understand his Creator, to praise his Creator: he hath this intelligence, who hath prudence. Therefore when many by evil lusts wore out in themselves the image of God, and by perversity of their manners extinguished the very flame, so to say, of intelligence, the Scripture cried aloud to them, \"Become not ye as the horse and mule which have no understanding.\"[fn-45-P4514_2435158:21-nf] That is to say, I have set thee above the horse and mule; thee, I made after mine image, I have given thee power over these.

Because they have not the rational mind: but thou by the rational mind art capable of truth, understandest what is above thee: be subject to Him that is above thee, and beneath thee shall those things be over which thou was set.

For it was gluttony through which he took the fruit of the forbidden tree, vainglory through which it was said \"Your eyes shall be opened,\" and pride through which it was said \"Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\"[fn-41-P4120_1518060:11-nf] With these three sins then we read that the Lord our Saviour was also tempted; with gluttony when the devil said to Him: \"Command these stones that they be made bread:\" with vainglory: \"If Thou art the Son of God cast Thyself down:\"with pride, when he showed him all the kingdoms of the worldand the glory of them and said: \"All this will I give to Thee if Thou wilt fall down and worship me:\"[fn-41-P4121_1518472:12-nf] in order that He might by His example teach us how we ought to vanquish the tempter when we are attacked on the same lines of temptation as He was. And so both the former and the latter are spoken of as Adam; the one being the first for destruction and death, and the other the first for resurrection and life. Through the one the whole race of mankind is brought into condemnation, through the other the whole race of mankind is set free. The one was fashioned out of raw and unformed earth, the other was born of the Virgin Mary. In His case then though it was fitting that He should undergo temptation, yet it was not necessary that He should fail under it. Nor could He who had vanquished gluttony be tempted byfornication, which springs from superfluityand gluttony as its root, with which even the first Adam would not have been destroyed unless before its birth he had been deceived by the wiles of the devil and fallen a victim to passion. And therefore the Son of God is not said absolutely to have come \"in the flesh of sin,\" but \"in the likeness ofthe flesh of sin,\" because though His was true flesh and He ate and drank and slept, and truly received the prints of the nails, there was in Him no true sin inherited from the fall, but only what was something like it. For He had no experience of the fiery darts of carnal lust, which in our case arise even against our will, from the constitution of our natures, but He took upon Him something like this, by sharing in our nature. For as He truly fulfilled every function which belongs to us, and bore all human infirmities, He has consequently been considered to have been subject to this feeling also, that He might appear through these infirmities to bear in His own flesh the state even of this fault and sin. Lastly the devil only tempted Him to those sins, by which he had deceived the first Adam, inferring that He as manwould similarly be deceived in other matters if he found that He was overcome by those temptations by which he had overthrown His predecessor. But as he was overthrown in the first encounter he was not able to bring upon Him the second infirmity which had shot up as from the root of the first fault. For he saw that He had not even admitted anything from which this infirmity might take its rise, and it was idle to hope for the fruit of sin from Him, as he saw that He in no sort of way received into Himself seeds or roots of it. Yet according to Luke, who places last that temptation in which he uses the words \"If Thou art the Son of God, cast Thyself down,\"[fn-41-P4122_1521043:13-nf] we can understand this of the feeling of pride, so that that earlier one, which Matthew places third, in which, as Luke the evangelist says, the devil showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and promised them to Him, may be taken of the feeling of covetousness, because after His victory over gluttony, he did not venture to tempt Him to fornication, but passed on to covetousness, which he knew to be the root of all evils,[fn-41-P4123_1521509:14-nf] and when again vanquished inthis, he did not dare attack Him with any of those sins which follow, which, as he knew full well, spring from this as a root and source; and so he passed on to the last passion; viz., pride, by which he knew that those who are perfect and have overcome all other sins, can be affected, and owing to which he remembered that he himself in his character of Lucifer, and many others too, had fallen from their heavenly estate, without temptation from any of the preceding passions. In this order then which we have mentioned, which is the one given by the evangelist Luke, there is an exact agreement between the allurements and forms of the temptations by which that most crafty foe attacked both the first and the second Adam. For to the one he said \"Your eyes shall be opened;\" to theother \"he showed all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them.\" In the one case he said \"Ye shall be as gods;\" in the other, \"If Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-41-P4124_1522505:15-nf] ","title":"V.

For the liking for delicacies and dainties will live on as something natural and innate in us, even though we take pains to cut off all superfluous appetites and desires, which, as they cannot be altogether destroyed, ought to be shunned and avoided. For of these we read \"Take no care for the flesh with its desires.\"[fn-41-P4199_1554504:41-nf] While then we still retain the feeling for this care, which we are bidden not altogether to cut off, but to keep without its desires, it is clear that we do not destroy the Egyptian nation but separate ourselves in a sort of way from it, not thinking anything about luxuries and delicate feasts, but, as the Apostle says, being \"content with our daily food and clothing.\"[fn-42-P4200_1554896:42-nf] And this is commanded in a figure in the law, in this way: \"Thou shalt not abhor the Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land.\"[fn-42-P4201_1555057:43-nf] For necessary food is not refused to the body without danger to it and sinfulness in the soul. But of those seven troublesome faults we must in every possible way root out the affections from the inmost recesses of our souls. For of them we read: \"Let all bitterness and anger and indignation and clamour and blasphemy be put away from you with all malice:\" and again:\"But fornication and all uncleanness and covetousness let it not so much as be named among you, or obscenity orfoolish talking or scurrility.\"[fn-42-P4202_1555589:44-nf] We can then cut out the roots of these faults which aregrafted into our nature from without whilewe cannot possibly cut off occasions of gluttony. For however far we have advanced, we cannot help being what we were born. And that this is so we can show not only from the lives of little people like ourselves but from the lives and customs of all who have attained perfection, who even when they have got rid of incentives to all other passions, and are retiring to the desert with perfect fervour of spirit and bodily abnegation, yet still cannot do without thought for their daily meal and the preparation of their food from year to year.","title":"V.

And so we ought to know what is properly good, and what is bad, and what is indifferent, that our faith may be supported by true knowledge and stand firm in all temptations. We must then believe that in things which are merely human there is no real good except virtue of soul alone, which leads us with unfeigned faith to things divine, and makes us constantly adhere to that unchanging good. And on the other hand we ought not to call anything bad, except sin alone, which separates us from the good God, and unites us to the evil devil. But those things are indifferent which can be appropriated to either side according to the fancy or wish of their owner, as for instance riches, power, honour, bodily strength, good health, beauty, life itself, and death, poverty, bodily infirmities, injuries, and other things of the same sort, which can contribute either to good or to evil as the character and fancy of their owner directs. For riches are often serviceable for our good, as the Apostle says, who charges \"the rich of this world to be ready to give, to distribute to the needy, to lay up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that\" by this means \"they may lay hold on the true life.\"[fn-42-P4268_1575814:10-nf] And according to the gospel they are a good thing for those who \"make to themselves friends of the unrighteous mammon.\"[fn-42-P4269_1575957:11-nf] And again, they can be drawn in the direction of what is bad when they are amassed only for the sake of hoarding them or for a life of luxury, and are not employed to meet the wants of the poor. And that power also and honour and bodily strength and good health are indifferent and available for either (good or bad) can easily be shown from the fact that many of the Old Testament saints enjoyed all these things and were in positions of great wealth and the highest honour, and blessed with bodily strength, and yet are known to have been most acceptable to God. And on the contrary those who have wrongfully abused these things and perverted them for their own purposes are not without good reason punished or destroyed, as the Book of Kings shows us has often happened. And that even life and death are in themselves indifferent the birth of S. John and of Judas proves. For in the case of the one his life was so profitable to himself that we are told that his birth brought joy to others also, as we read \"And many shall rejoice at his birth;\"[fn-42-P4270_1577028:12-nf] but of the life of the other it is said: \"It were good for that man if he had never been born.\"[fn-42-P4271_1577144:13-nf] Further it is said of the death of John and of all saints \"Right dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints:\"[fn-42-P4272_1577292:14-nf] but of that of Judas and men like him \"The death of the wicked is very evil.\"[fn-42-P4273_1577398:15-nf] And how useful bodily sickness sometimes may be the blessing on Lazarus, the beggar who was full of sores, shows us. For Scripture makes mention of no other good qualities or deserts of his, but it was for this fact alone; viz., that he endured want and bodily sickness with the utmostpatience, that he was deemed worthy of the blessed lot of a place in Abraham's bosom.[fn-42-P4274_1577799:16-nf] And with regard to want and persecution and injuries which everybody thinks to be bad, how useful and necessary they are is clearly proved by this fact; viz., that the saints not only never tried to avoid them, but actually either sought them with all their powers or bravely endured them, and thus became the friends of God, and obtained the reward of eternal life, as the blessed Apostle chants: \"For which cause I delight myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong, for power is made perfect in infirmity.\"[fn-42-P4275_1578429:17-nf] And therefore those who are exalted with the greatest riches and honours and powers of this world, should not be deemed to have secured their chief good out of them (for this is shown to consist only in virtue) but only something indifferent, because just as to good men who use them well and properly they will be found to be useful and convenient (for they afford them opportunities for good works and fruits which shall endure to eternal life), so to those who wrongfully abuse their wealth, they are useless and out of place, and furnish occasions of sin and death.","title":"VI.

For we said to begin with that men of this sort only possess skill in disputation and ornaments of speech; but cannot penetrate to the very heart of Scripture and the mysteries of its spiritual meanings. For true knowledge is only acquired by true worshippers of God; and certainly this people does not possess it to whom it is said: \"Hear, O, foolish people,thou who bast no heart: ye who having eyessee not, and having ears, hear not.\" And again: \"Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I also will reject thee from acting as My priest.\"[fn-55-P5549_1987795:47-nf] For as it is said that in Christ \"all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid,\"[fn-55-P5550_1987910:48-nf] how can we hold that he who has scorned to find Christ, or, when He is found blasphemes Him with impious lips, or at least defiles the Catholic faith by his impure deeds, has acquired spiritual knowledge? \"For the Spirit of God will avoid deception, and dwelleth not in a body that is subject to sin.\"[fn-55-P5551_1988229:49-nf] There is then no way of arriving at spiritual knowledge but this which one of the prophets has finely described: \"Sow to yourselves for righteousness: reap the hope of life. Enlighten yourselves with the light of knowledge.\"[fn-55-P5552_1988474:50-nf] First then we must sow for righteousness, i.e., by works of righteousness we must extend practical perfection; next we must reap the hope of life, i.e., by the expulsion of carnal sins must gather the fruits of spiritual virtues: and so we shall succeed in enlightening ourselves with the light of knowledge. And the Psalmist also sees that this system ought to be followed, when he says: \"Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way: who walk in the law of the Lord. Blessed are they that seek His testimonies.\"[fn-55-P5553_1989007:51-nf] For he does not say in the first place: \"Blessed are they that seek His testimonies, and afterwards add: Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way;\" but he begins by saying: \"Blessed are they that are undefiled in the way;\" and by this clearly shows that no one can properly come to seek God's testimonies unless he first walks undefiled in the way of Christ by his practical life. Those therefore whom you mentioned do not possess that knowledge which the impure cannot attain, but yeudw/numon , i.e., what is falsely so called, of which the blessed Apostle speaks: \"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thee, avoiding profane novelties of words, and oppositions of the knowledge that is falsely so called;\"[fn-55-P5554_1989758:52-nf] which is in the Greek ta/j a0ntiqe/seij yeudwnu/mou gnw/sewj. Of those then who seem to acquire some show of knowledge or of those who while they devote themselves diligently to reading the sacred volume and to committing the Scriptures to memory, yet forsake not carnal sins, it is well said in Proverbs: \"Like as a golden ring in a swine's snout so is the beauty of an evil-disposed woman.\"[fn-55-P5555_1990171:53-nf] For what does it profit a man to gain the ornaments of heavenly eloquence and the most precious beauty of the Scriptures if by clinging to filthy deeds and thoughts he destroys it by burying it in the foulest ground, or defiles it by the dirty wallowing of his own lusts? For the result will be that which is an ornament to those who rightly use it, is not only unable to adorn them, but actually becomes dirty by the increased filth and mud. For \"from the mouth of a sinner praise is not comely;\"[fn-55-P5556_1990688:54-nf] as to him it is said by the prophet: \"Wherefore dost thou declare My righteous acts, and takest My covenant in thy lips?\"[fn-55-P5557_1990830:55-nf] of souls like this, who never possess in any lasting fashion the fear of the Lord of which it is said: \"the fear of the Lord is instruction and wisdom,\"[fn-55-P5558_1991007:56-nf] and yet try to get at the meaning of Scripture by continual meditation on them, it is appropriately asked in Proverbs: \"What use are riches to a fool? For a senseless man cannot possess wisdom.\"[fn-55-P5559_1991221:57-nf] But so far is this true and spiritual knowledge removed from that worldly erudition, which is defiled by the stains of carnal sins, that we know that it has sometimes flourished most grandly in some who were without eloquence and almost illiterate. And this is very clearly shown by the case of the Apostles and many holy men, who did not spread themselves out with an empty show of leaves, but were bowed down by the weight of the true fruits of spiritual knowledge: of whom it is written in the Acts of the Apostles: \"But when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceivedthat they were ignorant and unlearned men, they were astonished.\"[fn-55-P5560_1991892:58-nf] And therefore if you are anxious to attain to that never-failing fragrance, you must first strive with all your might to obtain from the Lord the purity of chastity. For no one, in whom the love of carnal passions and especially of fornication still holds sway, can acquire spiritual knowledge. For \"in a good heart wisdom will rest;\" and: \"He that feareth the Lord shall find knowledge with righteousness.\"[fn-55-P5561_1992318:59-nf] But that we must attain to spiritual knowledge in the order of which we have already spoken, we are taught also by the blessed Apostle. For when he wanted not merely to draw up a list of all his own virtues, but rather to describe their order, that he might explain which follows what, and which gives birth to what, after some others he proceeds as follows: \"In watchings, in fastings, in chastity, in knowledge, in long suffering, in gentleness, in the Holy Ghost, in love unfeigned.\"[fn-55-P5562_1992844:60-nf] And by this enumeration of virtues he evidently meant to teach us that we must come from watchings and fastings to chastity, from chastity to knowledge, from knowledge to long sufering, from long suffering to gentleness, from gentleness to the Holy Ghost, from the Holy Ghost to the rewards of love unfeigned. When then by this system and in this order you too have come to spiritual knowledge, you will certainly have, as we said, not barren or idle learning but what is vigorous and fruitful; and the seed of the word of salvation which has been committed by you to the hearts of your hearers, will be watered by the plentiful showers of the Holy Ghost that will follow; and, according to this that the prophet promised, \"the rain will be given to your seed, wherever you shall sow in the land, and the bread of the corn of the land shall be most plentiful and fat.\"[fn-55-P5563_1993735:61-nf] ","title":"XIV.

They then afresh, as if forgetting the proofs which have been already urged against them, `pierce themselves through[fn-60-P6077_2420250:226-nf] ' with these bonds of irreligion, and thus argue. But the word of truth[fn-60-P6078_2420349:227-nf] confutes them as follows:-if they were disputing concerning any man, then let them exercise reason in this human way, both concerning His Word and His Son; but if of God who created man, no longer let them entertain human thoughts, but others which are above human nature. For such as he that besets, such of necessity is the offspring; and such as is the Word's Father, such must be also His Word. Now man, begotten in time, in time[fn-60-P6079_2421053:228-nf] also himself besets the child; and whereas from nothing he came to be, therefore his word[fn-60-P6080_2421163:229-nf] also is over and continues not. But God is not as man, as Scripture has said; but is existing[fn-60-P6081_2421601:230-nf] and is ever; therefore also His Word is existings and is everlastingly with the Father, as radiance of light. And man's word is composed of syllables, and neither lives nor operates anything, but is only significant of the speaker's intention, and does but go forth and go by, no more to appear, since it was not at all before it was spoken; wherefore the word of man neither lives nor operates anything, nor in short is man. And this happens to it, as I said before, because man who besets it, has his nature out of nothing. But God's Word is not merely pronounced, as one may say, nor a sound of accents, nor by His Son is meant His command[fn-60-P6082_2422272:231-nf] ; but as radiance of light, so is He perfect offspring from perfect[fn-60-P6083_2422358:232-nf] . Hence He is God also, as being God's Image; for `the Word was God[fn-60-P6084_2422466:233-nf] ' says Scripture. And man's words avail not for operation; hence man works not by means of words but of hands, for they have being, and man's word subsists not. But the `Word of God,' as the Apostle says, `is living and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight; but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to do[fn-60-P6085_2423046:234-nf] ' He is then Framer of all, `and without Him was made not one thing[fn-60-P6086_2423147:235-nf] ,'nor can anything be made without Him.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":6,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_25_the_first_epistle_of_the_blessed_clement","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"ANF-08","text":"For, if a man be only in name called holy, he is not holy; but he must be holy in everything: in his body and in his spirit.

We in accordance with the true doctrine speak of the Son as neither like,[fn-26-P2661_896588:9-nf] nor unlike[fn-26-P2662_896638:10-nf] the Father. Each of these terms is equally impossible, for like and unlike are predicated in relation to quality, and the divine is free from quality. We, on the contrary, confess identity of nature and accepting the consubstantiality, and rejecting the composition of the Father, God in substance, Who begat the Son, God in substance. From this the consubstantiality[fn-26-P2663_897082:11-nf] is proved. For God in essence or substance is co-essential or con-substantial with God in essence or substance. But when even man is called \"god\" as in the words, \"I have said ye are gods,\"[fn-26-P2664_897294:12-nf] and \"daemon\" as in the words, \"The gods of the nations are daemons,\"[fn-26-P2665_897383:13-nf] in the former case the name is given by favour, in the latter untruly. God alone is substantially and essentially God. When I say \"alone\" I set forth the holy and uncreated essence and substance of God. For the word \"alone\" is used in the case of any individual and generally of human nature. In the case of an individual, as for instance of Paul, that he alone was caught into the third heaven and \"heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,\"[fn-26-P2666_897874:14-nf] and of human nature, as when David says, \"as for man his days are as grass,\"[fn-26-P2667_897971:15-nf] not meaning any particular man, but human nature generally; for every man is short-lived and mortal. So we understand these words to be said of the nature, \"who alone hath immortality\"[fn-26-P2668_898174:16-nf] and \"to God only wise,\"[fn-26-P2669_898218:17-nf] and \"none is good save one, that is God,\"[fn-26-P2670_898279:18-nf] for here \"one\" means the same as alone. So also, \"which alone spreadest out the heavens,\"[fn-26-P2671_898390:19-nf] and again \"Thou shall worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-26-P2672_898486:20-nf] \"There is no God beside me.\"[fn-26-P2673_898690:21-nf] In Scripture \"one\" and \"only\" are not predicated of God to mark distinction from the Son and the Holy Ghost, but to except the unreal gods falsely so called.As for instance, \"The Lord alone did lead them and there was no strange god with them,\"[fn-26-P2674_898962:22-nf] and \"then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and didserve the Lord only.\"[fn-26-P2675_899086:23-nf] And so St. Paul, \"For as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there is but out god, the Father, of whom are all things; and one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things.\"[fn-26-P2676_899285:24-nf] Here we enquire why when he had said \"one God\" he was not content, for we have said that \"one\" and \"only\" when applied to God, indicate nature. Why did he add the word Father and make mention of Christ? Paul, a chosen vessel, did not, I imagine, think it sufficient only to preach that the Son is God and the Holy Ghost God, which he had expressed by the phrase \"one God.\" without, by the further addition of \"the Father,\" expressing Him of Whom are all things; and, by mentioning the Lord, signifyings the Word by Whom are all things; and yet further, by adding the words Jesus Christ, announcing the incarnation, setting forth the passion and publishing the resurrection. For the word Jesus Christ suggests all these ideas to us. For this reason too before His passion our Lord deprecates the designation of \"Jesus Christ,\" and charges His disciples to \"tell no man that He was Jesus, the Christ.\"[fn-26-P2677_900209:25-nf] For His purpose was, after the completion of the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2678_900288:26-nf] after His resurrection froth the dead, and His assumption into heaven, to commit to them the preaching of Him as Jesus, the Christ. Such is the force of the words \"That they may know Thee the only true God and JesUs Christ whom thou hast sent,\"[fn-26-P2679_900611:27-nf] and again \"Ye believe in God, believe also in me.\"[fn-26-P2680_900681:28-nf] Everywhere the Holy Ghost secures our conception of Him to save us from falling in else direction while we advance in the other, heeding the theology but neglecting the oeconomy,[fn-26-P2681_900878:29-nf] and so by omission falling into impiety.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":6,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_40_letter_xxii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"3.

The sun ought not to go down upon a brother's wrath,[fn-29-P2950_966854:55-nf] lest haply night come between brother and brother, and make the charge stand in the day of judgment. A Christian ought not to wait for an opportunity for his own amendment,[fn-29-P2951_967045:56-nf] because there is no certainty about the morrow; for many after many devices bare not reached the morrow. He ought not to be beguiled by over eating, whence come dreams in the night. He ought not to be distracted by immoderate toil, nor overstep the bounds of sufficiency, as the apostle says, \"Having food and raiment let us be therewith content;\"[fn-29-P2952_967432:57-nf] unnecessary abundance gives appearance of covetousness, and covetousness is condemned as idolatry.[fn-29-P2953_967550:58-nf] A Christian ought not to be a lover of money,[fn-29-P2954_967614:59-nf] nor lay up treasure for unprofitable ends.

How often have you received gifts from the Bridegroom? Why enumerate the honours given you for His sake by them that are His? Why tell of your fellowship with virgins, your progress with them, your being greeted by them with praises on account of virginity, eulogies of virgins, letters written as to a virgin?
