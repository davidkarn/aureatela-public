And let a third part be at the gate of Sur; and\nlet a third part be at the gate behind the dwelling of the\nshieldbearers; and you shall keep the watch of the house of Messa.","But let two parts of you all that go forth on the sabbath, keep\nthe watch of the house of the Lord about the king.","And you shall compass him round about, having weapons in your\nhands:  and if any man shall enter the precinct of the temple, let him\nbe slain:  and you shall be with the king, coming in and going out.","And the centurions did according to all things that Joiada the\npriest, had commanded them:  and taking every one their men, that went\nin on the sabbath, with them that went out in the sabbath, came to\nJoiada, the priest.","And he gave them the spears, and the arms of king David, which\nwere in the house of the Lord.","And they stood, having every one their weapons in their hands,\nfrom the right side of the temple, unto the left side of the altar, and\nof the temple, about the king.","And he brought forth the king's son, and put the diadem upon\nhim, and the testimony:  and they made him king, and anointed him:  and\nclapping their hands, they said:  God save the king.","And Athalia heard the noise of the people running:  and going in\nto the people into the temple of the Lord,","She saw the king standing upon a tribunal, as the manner was,\nand the singers, and the trumpets near him, and all the people of the\nland rejoicing, and sounding the trumpets:  and she rent her garments,\nand cried:  A conspiracy, a conspiracy.","But Joiada commanded the centurions that were over the army, and\nsaid to them:  Have her forth without the precinct of the temple, and\nwhosoever shall follow her, let him be slain with the sword.
