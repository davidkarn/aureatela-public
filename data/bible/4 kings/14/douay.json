{"verses":["In the second year of Joas son of Joachaz, king of Israel,\nreigned Amasias son of Joas, king of Juda.","He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign; and nine\nand twenty years he reigned in Jerusalem; the name of his mother was\nJoadan, of Jerusalem.","And he did that which was right before the Lord, but yet not like\nDavid his father.  He did according to all things that Joas his father,\ndid:","But this only, that he took not away the high places; for yet the\npeople sacrificed, and burnt incense in the high places:","And when he had possession of the kingdom, he put his servants to\ndeath that had slain the king, his father.","But the children of the murderers he did not put to death,\naccording to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses,\nwherein the Lord commanded, saying:  The fathers shall not be put to\ndeath for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for\nthe fathers:  but every man shall die for his own sin.","He slew of Edom in the valley of the Saltpits, ten thousand men,\nand took the rock by war, and called the name thereof Jectehel, unto\nthis day.","Then Amasias sent messengers to Joas, son of Joachaz, son of\nJehu, king of Israel, saying:  Come, let us see one another.","And Joas, king of Israel, sent again to Amasias, king of Juda,\nsaying:  A thistle of Libanus sent to a cedar tree, which is in Libanus,\nsaying:  Give thy daughter to my son to wife.  And the beasts of the\nforest, that are in Libanus, passed, and trod down the thistle.","Thou hast beaten and prevailed over Edom, and thy heart hath\nlifted thee up; be content with this glory, and sit at home; why\nprovokest thou evil, that thou shouldst fall, and Juda with thee?","But Amasias did not rest satisfied.  So Joas, king of Israel,\nwent up; and he and Amasias, king of Juda, saw one another in\nBethsames, a town in Juda.","And Juda was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every\nman to their dwellings.","But Joas, king of Israel, took Amasias, king of Juda, the son of\n\nJoas, the son of Ochozias, in Bethsames, and brought him into\n\nJerusalem; and he broke down the wall of Jerusalem, from the gate of\n\nEphraim to the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.\n","And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that\nwere found in the house of the Lord, and in the king's treasures, and\nhostages, and returned to Samaria.","But the rest of the acts of Joas, which he did, and his valour,\nwherewith he fought against Amasias, king of Juda, are they not written\nin the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?","And Joas slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria, with\nthe kings of Israel:  and Jeroboam, his son, reigned in his stead.","And Amasias, the son of Joas, king of Juda, lived after the\ndeath of Joas, son of Joachaz, king of Israel, fifteen years.","And the rest of the acts of Amasias, are they not written in the\nbook of the words of the days of the kings of Juda?","Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem:  and he fled\nto Lachis.

He departed not\nfrom all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who made Israel to\nsin.","He restored the borders of Israel from the entrance of Emath,\nunto the sea of the wilderness, according to the word of the Lord, the\nGod of Israel, which he spoke by his servant, Jonas, the son of Amathi,\nthe prophet, who was of Geth, which is in Opher.","For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel, that it was\nexceedingly bitter, and that they were consumed even to them that were\nshut up in prison, and the lowest persons, and that there was no one to\nhelp Israel.","And the Lord did not say that he would blot out the name of\nIsrael from under heaven; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam,\nthe son of Joas.","But the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and\nhis valour, wherewith he fought, and how he restored Damascus and Emath\nto Juda, in Israel, are they not written in the book of the words of\nthe days of the kings of Israel?","And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel; and\nZacharias, his son, reigned in his stead."]}
