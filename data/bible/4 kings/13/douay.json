{"verses":["In the three and twentieth year of Joas son of Ochozias, king of\nJuda, Joachaz, the son of Jehu, reigned over Israel, in Samaria,\nseventeen years.","And he did evil before the Lord, and followed the sins of\nJeroboam, the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin; and he departed not\nfrom them.","And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he\ndelivered them into the hand of Hazael, the king of Syria, and into the\nhand of Benadad, the son of Hazael, all days.","But Joachaz besought the face of the Lord, and the Lord heard\nhim:  for he saw the distress of Israel, because the king of Syria had\noppressed them:","And the Lord gave Israel a saviour, and they were delivered out\nof the hand of the king of Syria:  and the children of Israel dwelt in\ntheir pavilions as yesterday and the day before.","But yet they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam,\nwho made Israel to sin, but walked in them:  and there still remained a\ngrove also in Samaria.","And Joachaz had no more left of the people than fifty horsemen,\nand ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen:  for the king of Syria had\nslain them, and had brought them low as dust by threshing in the\nbarnfloor.","But the rest of the acts of Joachaz, and all that he did, and his\nvalour, are they not written in the book of the words of the days of\nthe kings of Israel?","And Joachaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in\nSamaria:  and Joas, his son, reigned in his stead.","In the seven and thirtieth year of Joas, king of Juda, Joas the\nson of Joachaz reigned over Israel, in Samaria, sixteen years.","And he did that which is evil in the sight of the Lord:  he\ndeparted not from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who made\nIsrael to sin; but he walked in them.","But the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, and his\nvalour wherewith he fought against Amasias, king of Juda, are they not\nwritten in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?","And Joas slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his\nthrone.  But Joas was buried in Samaria, with the kings of Israel.","Now Eliseus was sick of the illness whereof he died:  and Joas,\nking of Israel, went down to him, and wept before him, and said:  O my\nfather, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the guider thereof.","And Eliseus said to him:  Bring a bow and arrows.  And when he had\nbrought him a bow and arrows,","He said to the king of Israel:  Put thy hand upon the bow.  And\nwhen he had put his hand, Eliseus put his hands over the king's hands,","And said:  Open the window to the east.  And when he had opened\nit, Eliseus said:  Shoot an arrow.  And he shot.  And Eliseus said:  The\narrow of the Lord's deliverance, and the arrow of the deliverance from\nSyria:  and thou shalt strike the Syrians in Aphec, till thou consume\nthem.","And he said:  Take the arrows.  And when he had taken them, he\nsaid to him:  Strike with an arrow upon the ground.  And he struck three\ntimes, and stood still.","And the man of God was angry with him, and said:  If thou hadst\nsmitten five or six or seven times, thou hadst smitten Syria even to\nutter destruction:  but now three times shalt thou smite it.","And Eliseus died, and they buried him.  And the rovers from Moab\ncame into the land the same year.","And some that were burying a man, saw the rovers, and cast the\nbody into the sepulchre of Eliseus.  And when it had touched the bones\nof Eliseus, the man came to life and stood upon his feet.","Now Hazael, king of Syria, afflicted Israel all the days of\nJoachaz.","And the Lord had mercy on them, and returned to them, because of\nhis covenant, which he had made with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob:  and\nhe would not destroy them, nor utterly cast them away, unto this\npresent time.","And Hazael, king of Syria, died; and Benadad, his son, reigned\nin his stead.","Now Joas the son of Joachaz, took the cities out of the hand of\nBenadad, the son of Hazael, which he had taken out of the hand of\nJoachaz, his father, by war; three times did Joas beat him, and he\nrestored the cities to Israel."]}
