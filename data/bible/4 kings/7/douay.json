{"verses":["And Eliseus said:  Hear ye the word of the Lord:  Thus saith the\nLord:  Tomorrow, about this time, a bushel of fine flour shall be sold\nfor a stater, and two bushels of barley for a stater, in the gate of\nSamaria.","Then one of the lords, upon whose hand the king leaned, answering\nthe man of God, said:  If the Lord should make flood-gates in heaven,\ncan that possibly be which thou sayest?  And he said:  Thou shalt see it\nwith thy eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.","Now there were four lepers, at the entering in of the gate:  and\nthey said one to another:  What mean we to stay here till we die?","If we will enter into the city, we shall die with the famine:  and\nif we will remain here, we must also die:  come therefore, and let us\nrun over to the camp of the Syrians.  If they spare us, we shall live:\nbut if they kill us, we shall but die.","So they arose in the evening, to go to the Syrian camp.  And when\nthey were come to the first part of the camp of the Syrians, they found\nno man there.","For the Lord had made them hear, in the camp of Syria, the noise\nof chariots, and of horses, and of a very great army:  and they said one\nto another:  Behold, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings\nof the Hethites, and of the Egyptians; and they are come upon us.","Wherefore they arose, and fled away in the dark, and left their\ntents, and their horses and asses in the camp, and fled, desiring to\nsave their lives.","So when these lepers were come to the beginning of the camp, they\nwent into one tent, and ate and drank:  and they took from thence\nsilver, and gold, and raiment, and went, and hid it:  and they came\nagain, and went into another tent, and carried from thence in like\nmanner, and hid it.","Then they said one to another:  We do not well:  for this is a day\nof good tidings.  If we hold our peace, and do not tell it till the\nmorning, we shall be charged with a crime:  come, let us go, and tell it\nin the king's court.","So they came to the gate of the city, and told them, saying:  We\nwent to the camp of the Syrians, and we found no man there, but horses,\nand asses tied, and the tents standing.","Then the guards of the gate went, and told it within in the\nking's palace.","And he arose in the night, and said to his servants:  I tell you\nwhat the Syrians have done to us:  They know that we suffer great\nfamine, and therefore they are gone out of the camp, and lie hid in the\nfields, saying:  When they come out of the city, we shall take them\nalive, and then we may get into the city.","And one of his servants answered:  Let us take the five horses\nthat are remaining in the city (because there are no more in the whole\nmultitude of Israel, for the rest are consumed), and let us send and\nsee.","They brought therefore two horses, and the king sent into the\ncamp of the Syrians, saying:  Go, and see.","And they went after them, as far as the Jordan:  and behold, all\nthe way was full of garments, and vessels, which the Syrians had cast\naway, in their fright, and the messengers returned, and told the king.","And the people going out, pillaged the camp of the Syrians:  and a\nbushel of fine flour was sold for a stater, and two bushels of barley\nfor a stater, according to the word of the Lord.","And the king appointed that lord on whose hand he leaned, to\nstand at the gate:  and the people trod upon him in the entrance of the\ngate; and he died, as the man of God had said, when the king came down\nto him.","And it came to pass, according to the word of the man of God,\nwhich he spoke to the king, when he said:  Two bushels of barley shall\nbe for a stater, and a bushel of fine flour for a stater, at this very\ntime tomorrow, in the gate of Samaria.","When that lord answered the man of God, and said:  Although the\nLord should make flood-gates in heaven, could this come to pass which\nthou sayest?  And he said to him:  Thou shalt see it with thy eyes, and\nshalt not eat thereof.","And so it fell out to him, as it was foretold, and the people\ntrod upon him in the gate, and he died."]}
