{"verses":["Josias was eight years old when he began to reign:  he reigned one\nand thirty years in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was Idida, the\ndaughter of Hadaia, of Besecath.","And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and\nwalked in all the ways of David, his father:  he turned not aside to the\nright hand, or to the left.","And in the eighteenth year of king Josias, the king sent Saphan,\nthe son of Assia, the son of Messulam, the scribe of the temple of the\nLord, saying to him:","Go to Helcias, the high priest, that the money may be put\ntogether which is brought into the temple of the Lord, which the\ndoorkeepers of the temple have gathered of the people.","And let it be given to the workmen by the overseers of the house\nof the Lord:  and let them distribute it to those that work in the\ntemple of the Lord, to repair the temple:","That is, to carpenters and masons, and to such as mend breaches:\nand that timber may be bought, and stones out of the quarries, to\nrepair the temple of the Lord.","But let there be no reckoning made with them of the money which\nthey receive, but let them have it in their power, and in their trust.","And Helcias, the high priest, said to Saphan, the scribe:  I have\nfound the book of the law in the house of the Lord:  and Helcias gave\nthe book to Saphan, and he read it.","And Saphan, the scribe, came to the king, and brought him word\nagain concerning that which he had commanded, and said:  Thy servants\nhave gathered together the money that was found in the house of the\nLord:  and they have given it to be distributed to the workmen, by the\noverseers of the works of the temple of the Lord.","And Saphan, the scribe, told the king, saying:  Helcias, the\npriest, hath delivered to me a book.  And when Saphan had read it before\nthe king,","And the king had heard the words of the law of the Lord, he rent\nhis garments.","And he commanded Helcias, the priest, and Ahicam, the son of\nSaphan, and Achobor, the son of Micha, and Saphan, the scribe, and\nAsaia, the king's servant, saying:","Go and consult the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all\nJuda, concerning the words of this book which is found:  for the great\nwrath of the Lord is kindled against us, because our fathers have not\nhearkened to the words of this book, to do all that is written for us.","So Helcias, the priest, and Ahicam, and Achobor, and Sapham, and\n\nAsaia, went to Holda, the prophetess, the wife of Sellum, the son of\n\nThecua, the son of Araas, keeper of the wardrobe, who dwelt in\n\nJerusalem, in the Second:  and they spoke to her.\n","And she said to them:  Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel:\nTell the man that sent you to me:","Thus saith the Lord:  Behold, I will bring evils upon this place,\nand upon the inhabitants thereof, all the words of the law which the\nking of Juda hath read:","Because they have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange\ngods, provoking me by all the works of their hands:  therefore my\nindignation shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be\nquenched.","But to the king of Juda, who sent you to consult the Lord, thus\nshall you say:  Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel:  for as much as\nthou hast heard the words of the book,","And thy heart hath been moved to fear, and thou hast humbled\nthyself before the Lord, hearing the words against this place, and the\ninhabitants thereof, to wit, that they should become a wonder and a\ncurse:  and thou hast rent thy garments, and wept before me; I also have\nheard thee; saith the Lord.","Therefore I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be\ngathered to thy sepulchre in peace; that thy eyes may not see all the\nevils which I will bring upon this place."]}
