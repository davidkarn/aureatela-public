{"verses":["In the third year of Osee, the son of Ela, king of Israel,\nreigned Ezechias, the son of Achaz, king of Juda.","He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign:  and he\nreigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was\nAbi, the daughter of Zacharias.","And he did that which was good before the Lord, according to all\nthat David, his father, had done","He destroyed the high places, and broke the statues in pieces,\nand cut down the groves, and broke the brazen serpent, which Moses had\nmade:  for till that time the children of Israel burnt incense to it:\nand he called its name Nohestan.","He trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel:  so that after him\nthere was none like him among all the kings of Juda, nor any of them\nthat were before him:","And he stuck to the Lord, and departed not from his steps, but\nkept his commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses.","Wherefore the Lord also was with him, and in all things, to which\nhe went forth, he behaved himself wisely.  And he rebelled against the\nking of the Assyrians, and served him not.","He smote the Philistines as far as Gaza, and all their borders,\nfrom the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.","In the fourth year of king Ezechias, which was the seventh year\nof Osee, the son of Ela, king of Israel, Salmanasar, king of the\nAssyrians, came up to Samaria, and besieged it,","And took it.  For after three years, in the sixth year of\nEzechias, that is, in the ninth year of Osee, king of Israel, Samaria\nwas taken:","And the king of the Assyrians carried away Israel into Assyria,\nand placed them in Hala, and in Habor, by the rivers of Gozan, in the\ncities of the Medes.","Because they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord, their God,\nbut transgressed his covenant:  all that Moses, the servant of the Lord,\ncommanded, they would not hear, nor do.","In the fourteenth year of king Ezechias, Sennacherib, king of\nthe Assyrians, came up against the fenced cities of Juda, and took\nthem.","Then Ezechias, king of Juda, sent messengers to the king of the\nAssyrians, to Lachis, saying:  I have offended, depart from me:  and all\nthat thou shalt put upon me, I will bear.  And the king of the Assyrians\nput a tax upon Ezechias, king of Juda, of three hundred talents of\nsilver, and thirty talents of gold.","And Ezechias gave all the silver that was found in the house of\nthe Lord, and in the king's treasures.","At that time Ezechias broke the doors of the temple of the Lord,\nand the plates of gold which he had fastened on them, and gave them to\nthe king of the Assyrians.","And the king of the Assyrians sent Tharthan, and Rabsaris, and\nRabsaces, from Lachis, to king Ezechias, with a strong army, to\nJerusalem:  and they went up and came to Jerusalem, and they stood by\nthe conduit of the upper pool, which is in the way of the fuller's\nfield.","And they called for the king:  and there went out to them\nEliacim, the son of Helcias, who was over the house, and Sobna, the\nscribe, and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder.","And Rabsaces said to them:  Speak to Ezechias:  Thus saith the\ngreat king, the king of the Assyrians:  What is this confidence, wherein\nthou trustest?","Perhaps thou hast taken counsel, to prepare thyself for battle.\nOn whom dost thou trust, that thou darest to rebel?","Dost thou trust in Egypt a staff of a broken reed, upon which if\na man lean, it will break and go into his hand, and pierce it?  so is\nPharao, king of Egypt, to all that trust in him.","But if you say to me:  We trust in the Lord, our God:  is it not\nhe, whose high places and altars Ezechias hath taken away:  and hath\ncommanded Juda and Jerusalem:  You shall worship before this altar in\nJerusalem?","Now therefore come over to my master, the king of the Assyrians,\nand I will give you two thousand horses, and see whether you be able to\nhave riders for them.","And how can you stand against one lord of the least of my\nmaster's servants?  Dost thou trust in Egypt for chariots and for\nhorsemen?","Is it without the will of the Lord that I am come up to this\nplace to destroy it?  The Lord said to me:  Go up to this land, and\ndestroy it.","Then Eliacim, the son of Helcias, and Sobna, and Joahe, said to\nRabsaces:  We pray thee, speak to us, thy servants, in Syriac:  for we\nunderstand that tongue:  and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in\nthe hearing of the people that are upon the wall.","And Rabsaces answered them, saying:  Hath my master sent me to\nthy master, and to thee, to speak these words, and not rather to the\nmen that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink\ntheir urine with you?","Then Rabsaces stood, and cried out with a loud voice in the\nJews' language, and said:  Hear the word of the great king, the king of\nthe Assyrians.","Thus saith the king:  Let not Ezechias deceive you:  for he shall\nnot be able to deliver you out of my hand.","Neither let him make you trust in the Lord, saying:  The Lord\nwill surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hand\nof the king of the Assyrians.","Do not hearken to Ezechias.  For thus saith the king of the\nAssyrians:  Do with me that which is for your advantage, and come out to\nme:  and every man of you shall eat of his own vineyard, and of his own\nfig tree:  and you shall drink water of your own cisterns,","Till I come, and take you away, to a land, like to your own\nland, a fruitful land, and plentiful in wine, a land of bread and\nvineyards, a land of olives, and oil, and honey, and you shall live,\nand not die.  Hearken not to Ezechias, who deceiveth you, saying:  The\nLord will deliver us.","Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land from\nthe hand of the king of Assyria?","Where is the god of Emath, and of Arphad?  where is the god of\nSepharvaim, of Ana, and of Ava?  have they delivered Samaria out of my\nhand?","Who are they among all the gods of the nations that have\ndelivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord may deliver\nJerusalem out of my hand?","But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word:\nfor they had received commandment from the king that they should not\nanswer him.","And Eliacim, the son of Helcias, who was over the house, and\nSobna, the scribe, and Joahe, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to\nEzechias, with their garments rent, and told him the words of Rabsaces."]}
