For it is hard to say that the saints shall then have such bodies that they shall not be able to shut and open their eyes as they please; while it is harder still to say that every one who shuts his eyes shall lose the vision of God. For if the prophet Elisha, though at a distance, saw his servant Gehazi, who thought that his wickedness would escape his master's observation and accepted gifts from Naaman the Syrian, whom the prophet had cleansed from his foul leprosy, how much more shall the saints in the spiritual body see all things, not only though their eyes be shut, but though they themselves be at a great distance? For then shall be \"that which is perfect,\" of which the apostle says,\" We know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\" Then, that he may illustrate as well as possible, by a simile, how superior the future life is to the life now lived, not only by ordinary men, but even by the foremost of the saints, he says, \"When I was a child, I understood as a child, I spake as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.\"[fn-45-P4534_2511576:73-nf] If, then, even in this life, in which the prophetic power of remarkable men is no more worthy to be compared to the vision of the future life than childhood is to manhood, Elisha, though distant from his servant, saw him accepting gifts, shall we say that when that which is perfect is come, and the corruptible body no longer oppresses the soul, but is incorruptible and offers no impediment to it, the saints shall need bodily eyes to see, though Elisha had no need of them to see his servant? For, following the Septuagint version, these are the prophet's words: \"Did not my heart go with thee, when the man came out of his chariot to meet thee, and thou tookedst his gifts?\"[fn-45-P4535_2512281:74-nf] Or, as the presbyter Jerome rendered it from the Hebrew, \"Was not my heart present when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee?\" The prophet said that he saw this with his heart, miraculously aided by God, as no one can doubt. But how much more abundantly shall the saints enjoy this gift when God shall be all in all? Nevertheless the bodily eyes also shall have their office and their place, and shall be used by the spirit through the spiritual body. For the prophet did not forego the use of his eyes for seeing what was before them, though he did not need them to see his absent servant, and though he could have seen these present objects in spirit, and with his eyes shut, as he saw things far distant in a place where he himself was not. Far be it, then, from us to say that in the life to come the saints shall not see God when their eyes are shut, since they shall always see Him with the spirit.","title":"Book XXII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Out of so many kinds of occupations, why indeed had He such respect for that of fishermen, as to select from it for apostles Simon and the sons of Zebedee (for it cannot seem to be the mere fact itself for which the narrative was meant to be drawn out[fn-54-P5492_1690334:231-nf] ), saying to Peter, when he trembled at the very large draught of the fishes, \"Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men? \"[fn-54-P5493_1690499:232-nf] By saying this, He suggested to them the meaning of the fulfilled prophecy, that it was even He who by Jeremiah had foretold, \"Behold, I will send many fishers; and they shall fish them,\"[fn-54-P5494_1690712:233-nf] that is, men. Then at last they left their boats, and followed Him, understanding that it was He who had begun to accomplish what He had declared. It is quite another case, when he affected to choose from the college of shipmasters, intending one day to appoint the shipmaster Marcion his apostle. We have indeed already laid it down, in opposition to his Antitheses, that the position of Marcion derives no advantage from the diversity which he supposes to exist between the Law and the Gospel, inasmuch as even this was ordained by the Creator, and indeed predicted in the promise of the new Law, and the new Word, and the new Testament. Since, however, he quotes with especial care,[fn-54-P5495_1691419:234-nf] as a proof in his domain,[fn-54-P5496_1691476:235-nf] a certain companion in misery (suntalai/pwron), and associate in hatred (summisou/menon), with himself, for the cure of leprosy,[fn-54-P5497_1691643:236-nf] I shall not be sorry to meet him, and before anything else to point out to him the force of the law figuratively interpreted, which, in this example of a leper (who was not to be touched, but was rather to be removed from all intercourse with others), prohibited any communication with a person who was defiled with sins, with whom the apostle also forbids us even to eat food,[fn-54-P5498_1692043:237-nf] forasmuch as the taint of sins would be communicated as if contagious: wherever a man should mix himself with the sinner. The Lord, therefore, wishing that the law should be more profoundly understood as signifying spiritual truths by carnal facts[fn-54-P5499_1692312:238-nf] -and thus[fn-55-P5500_1692363:239-nf] not destroying, but rather building up, that law which He wanted to have more earnestly acknowledged-touched the leper, by whom (even although as man He might have been defiled) He could not be defiled as God, being of course incorruptible. The prescription, therefore, could not be meant for Him, that He was bound to observe the law and not touch the unclean person, seeing that contact with the unclean would not cause defilement to Him. I thus teach that this (immunity) is consistent in my Christ, the rather when I show that it is not consistent in yours. Now, if it was as an enemy[fn-55-P5501_1692972:240-nf] of the law that He touched the leper-disregarding the precept of the law by a contempt of the defilement-how could he be defiled, when he possessed not a body[fn-55-P5502_1693147:241-nf] which could be defiled? For a phantom is not susceptible of defilement. He therefore, who could not be defiled, as being a phantom, will not have an immunity from pollution by any divine power, but owing to his fantastic vacuity; nor can he be regarded as having despised pollution, who had not in fact any material capacity[fn-55-P5503_1693527:242-nf] for it; nor, in like manner, as having destroyed the law, who had escaped defilement from the occasion of his phantom nature, not from any display of virtue. If, however, the Creator's prophet Elisha cleansed Naaman the Syrian alone,[fn-55-P5504_1693778:243-nf] to the exclusion of[fn-55-P5505_1693813:244-nf] so many lepers in Israel,[fn-55-P5506_1693890:245-nf] this fact contributes nothing to the distinction of Christ, as if he were in this way the better one for cleansing this Israelite leper, although a stranger to him, whom his own Lord had been unable to cleanse. The cleansing of the Syrian rather[fn-55-P5507_1694185:246-nf] was significant throughout the nations of the world[fn-55-P5508_1694280:247-nf] of their own cleansing in Christ their light,[fn-55-P5509_1694611:248-nf] steeped as they were in the stains of the seven deadly sins:[fn-55-P5510_1694770:249-nf] idolatry, blasphemy, murder, adultery, fornication, false-witness, and fraud.[fn-55-P5511_1694876:250-nf] Seven times, therefore, as if once for each,[fn-55-P5512_1696020:251-nf] did he wash in Jordan; both in order that he might celebrate the expiation of a perfect hebdomad;[fn-55-P5513_1696153:252-nf] and because the virtue and fulness of the one baptism was thus solemnly imputed[fn-55-P5514_1696293:253-nf] to Christ, alone, who was one day to establish on earth not only a revelation, but also a baptism, endued with compendious efficacy.[fn-55-P5515_1696444:254-nf] Even Marcion finds here an antithesis:[fn-55-P5516_1696636:255-nf] how that Elisha indeed required a material resource, applied water, and that seven times; whereas Christ, by the employment of a word only, and that but once for all, instantly effected[fn-55-P5517_1696845:256-nf] the cure. And surely I might venture[fn-55-P5518_1696905:257-nf] to claim[fn-55-P5519_1696939:258-nf] the Very Word also as of the Creator's substance. There is nothing of which He who was the primitive Author is not also the more powerful one. Forsooth,[fn-55-P5520_1697113:259-nf] it is incredible that that power of the Creator should have, by a word, produced a remedy for a single malady, which once by a word brought into being so vast a fabric as the world! From what can the Christ of the Creator be better discerned, than from the power of His word? But Christ is on this account another (Christ), because He acted differently from Elisha-because, in fact, the master is more powerful than his servant! Why, Marcion, do you lay down the rule, that things are done by servants just as they are by their very masters? Are you not afraid that it will turn to your discredit, if you deny that Christ belongs to the Creator, on the ground that He was once more powerful than a servant of the Creator-since, in comparison with the weakness of Elisha, He is acknowledged to be the greater, if indeed greater![fn-55-P5521_1697999:260-nf] For the cure is the same, although there is a difference in the working of it. What has your Christ performed more than my Elisha? Nay, what great thing has the word of your Christ performed, when it has simply done that which a river of the Creator effected? On the same principle occurs all the rest. So far as renouncing all human glory went, He forbade the man to publish abroad the cure; but so far as the honour of the law was concerned, He requested that the usual course should be followed: \"Go, show thyself to the priest, and present the offering which Moses commanded.\"[fn-55-P5522_1698604:261-nf] For the figurative signs of the law in its types He still would have observed, because of their prophetic import.[fn-55-P5523_1698737:262-nf] These types signified that a man, once a sinner, but afterwards purified[fn-55-P5524_1698836:263-nf] from the stains thereof by the word of God, was bound to offer unto God in the temple a gift, even prayer and thanksgiving in the church through Christ Jesus, who is the Catholic Priest of the Father.[fn-55-P5525_1699056:264-nf] Accordingly He added: \"that it may be for a testimony unto you\"-one, no doubt, whereby He would testify that He was not destroying the law, but fulfilling it; whereby, too, He would testify that it was He Himself who was foretold as about to undertake[fn-55-P5526_1699421:265-nf] their sicknesses and infirmities. This very consistent and becoming explanation of \"the testimony,\" that adulator of his own Christ, Marcion seeks to exclude under the cover of mercy and gentleness. For, being both good (such are his words), and knowing, besides, that every man who had been freed from leprosy would be sure to perform the solemnities of the law, therefore He gave this precept. Well, what then? Has He continued in his goodness (that is to say, in his permission of the law) or not? For if he has persevered in his goodness, he will never become a destroyer of the law; nor will he ever be accounted as belonging to another god, because there would not exist that destruction of the law which would constitute his claim to belong to the other god. If, however, he has not continued good, by a subsequent destruction of the law, it is a false testimony which he has since imposed upon them in his cure of the leper; because he has forsaken his goodness, in destroying the law. If, therefore, he was good whilst upholding the law,[fn-55-P5527_1700511:266-nf] he has now become evil as a destroyer of the law. However, by the support which he gave to the law, he affirmed that the law was good. For no one permits himself in the support of an evil thing. Therefore he is not only bad if he has permitted obedience to a bad law; but even worse still, if he has appeared[fn-55-P5528_1700843:267-nf] as the destroyer of a good law. So that if he commanded the offering of the gift because he knew that every cured leper would be sure to bring one; he possibly abstained from commanding what he knew would be spontaneously done. In vain, therefore, was his coming down, as if with the intention of destroying the law, when he makes concessions to the keepers of the law. And yet,[fn-55-P5529_1701238:268-nf] because he knew their disposition,[fn-55-P5530_1701288:269-nf] he ought the more earnestly to have prevented their neglect of the law,[fn-55-P5531_1701375:270-nf] since he had come for this purpose. Why then did he not keep silent, that man might of his own simple will obey the law? For then might he have seemed to some extent[fn-55-P5532_1701566:271-nf] to have persisted in his patience. But he adds also his own authority increased by the weight of this \"testimony.\" Of what testimony, I ask,[fn-55-P5533_1701727:272-nf] if not that of the assertion of the law? Surely it matters not in what way he asserted the law-whether as good, or as supererogatory,[fn-55-P5534_1701873:273-nf] or as patient, or as inconstant-provided, Marcion, I drive you from your position.[fn-55-P5535_1701976:274-nf] Observe,[fn-55-P5536_1701999:275-nf] he commanded that the law should be fulfilled. In whatever way he commanded it, in the same way might he also have first uttered that sentiment:[fn-55-P5537_1702157:276-nf] \"I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-55-P5538_1702227:277-nf] What business, therefore, had you to erase out of the Gospel that which was quite consistent in it?[fn-55-P5539_1702347:278-nf] For you have confessed that, in his goodness, he did in act what you deny that he did in word.[fn-55-P5540_1702466:279-nf] We have therefore good proof that He uttered the word, in the fact that He did the deed; and that you have rather expunged the Lord's word, than that our (evangelists)[fn-55-P5541_1702823:280-nf] have inserted it.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"95","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Should any one object to the expression \"He smote the water,\" on account of the conclusion we arrived at above with respect to the Jordan, that it is a type of the Word who descended for us our descending, we rejoin that with the Apostle the rock is plainly said to be Christ, and that it is smitten twice with the rod, so that the people may drink of the spiritual rock which follows them. The \"smiting\" in this new difficulty is that of those who are fond of suggesting something that contradicts the conclusion even before they have learned what the question is which is in hand. From such God sets us free, since, on the one hand, He gives us to drink when we are thirsty, and on the other He prepares for us, in the immense and trackless deep, a road to pass over, namely, by the dividing of His Word, since it is by the reason which distinguishes (divides) that most things are made plain to us. But that we may receive the right interpretation about this Jordan, so good to drink, so full of grace, it may be of use to compare the cleansing of Naaman the Syrian from his leprosy, and what is said of the rivers of religion of the enemies of Israel. It is recorded of Naaman[fn-69-P6911_1297479:137-nf] that he came with horse and chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, \"Go, wash seven times in the Jordan, and thy flesh shall come again unto thee, and thou shalt be cleansed.\" Then Naaman is angry; he does not see that our Jordan is the cleanser of those who are impure from leprosy, from that impurity, and their restorer to health; it is the Jordan that does this, and not the prophet; the office of the prophet is to direct to the healing agency. Naaman then says, not understanding the great mystery of the Jordan, \"Behold, I said that he will certainly come out to me, and will call upon the name of the Lord his God, and lay his hand upon the place, and restore the leper.\" For to put his hand on the leprosy[fn-69-P6912_1298278:138-nf] and cleanse it is a work belonging to our Lord Jesus only; for when the leper appealed to Him with faith, saying, \"If Thou wilt Thou canst make me clean,\" He not only said, \"I will, be thou clean,\" but in addition to the word He touched him, and he was cleansed from his leprosy. Naaman, then, is still in error, and does not see how far inferior other rivers are to the Jordan for the cure of the suffering; he extols the rivers of Damascus, Arbana, and Pharpha, saying, \"Are not Arbana and Pharpha, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Shall I not wash in them and be clean? \"For as none is good[fn-69-P6913_1298922:139-nf] but one, God the Father, so among rivers none is good but the Jordan, nor able to cleanse from his leprosy him who with faith washes his soul in Jesus. And this, I suppose, is the reason why the Israelites are recorded to have wept when they sat by the rivers of Babylon and remembered Zion; those who are carried captive, on account of their wickedness, when they taste other waters after sacred Jordan, are led to remember with longing their own river of salvation. Therefore it is said of the rivers of Babylon, \"There we sat down,\" clearly because they were unable to stand, \"and wept.\" And Jeremiah rebukes those who wish to drink the waters of Egypt, and desert the water which comes down from heaven, and is named from its so coming down-namely, the Jordan. He says,[fn-69-P6914_1299746:140-nf] \"What hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the water of Geon, and to drink the water of the river,\" or, as it is in the Hebrew, \"to drink the water of Sion.\"Of which water we have now to speak.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_64_fragments_from_the_lost_writings_of_irenaeus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"126","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"And[fn-95-P9599_2800294:58-nf] dipped himself,\" says [the Scripture], \"seven times in Jordan.\"[fn-96-P9600_2800543:59-nf] It was not for nothing that Naaman of old, when suffering from leprosy, was purified upon his being baptized, but [it served] as an indication to us.

In imitation then of the Jews so far, he writes as follows; `It is very plain that He has said, that He is in the Father and the Father again in Him, for this reason, that neither the word on which He was discoursing is, as He says, His own, but the Father's, nor the works belong to Him, but to the Father who gave Him the power.'
