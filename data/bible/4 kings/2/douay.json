{"verses":["And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elias, into\nheaven, by a whirlwind, that Elias and Eliseus were going from Galgal.","And Elias said to Eliseus:  Stay thou here, because the Lord hath\nsent me as far as Bethel.  And Eliseus said to him:  As the Lord liveth,\nand as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  And when they were come\ndown to Bethel,","The sons of the prophets, that were at Bethel, came forth to\nEliseus, and said to him:  Dost thou know that, this day, the Lord will\ntake away thy master from thee?  And he answered:  I also know it:  hold\nyour peace.","And Elias said to Eliseus:  Stay here, because the Lord hath sent\nme to Jericho.  And he said:  As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth,\nI will not leave thee.  And when they were come to Jericho,","The sons of the prophets, that were at Jericho, came to Eliseus,\nand said to him:  Dost thou know that, this day, the Lord will take away\nthy master from thee?  And he said:  I also know it:  hold your peace.","And Elias said to him:  Stay here, because the Lord hath sent me as\nfar as the Jordan.  And he said:  as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul\nliveth, I will not leave thee.  And they two went on together.","And fifty men, of the sons of the prophets, followed them, and\nstood in sight, at a distance:  but they two stood by the Jordan.","And Elias took his mantle, and folded it together, and struck the\nwaters, and they were divided hither and thither, and they both passed\nover on dry ground.","And when they were gone over, Elias said to Eliseus:  Ask what thou\nwilt have me to do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.  And\nEliseus said:  I beseech thee, that in me may be thy double spirit.","And he answered:  Thou hast asked a hard thing; nevertheless, if\nthou see me when I am taken from thee, thou shalt have what thou hast\nasked:  but if thou see me not, thou shalt not have it.","And as they went on, walking and talking together, behold, a\nfiery chariot and fiery horses parted them both asunder:  and Elias went\nup by a whirlwind into heaven.","And Eliseus saw him, and cried:  My father, my father, the chariot\nof Israel, and the driver thereof.  And he saw him no more:  and he took\nhold of his own garments, and rent them in two pieces.","And he took up the mantle of Elias, that fell from him:  and going\nback, he stood on the bank of the Jordan;","And he struck the waters with the mantle of Elias, that had\nfallen from him, and they were not divided.  And he said:  Where is now\nthe God of Elias?  And he struck the waters, and they were divided\nhither and thither, and Eliseus passed over.","And the sons of the prophets, at Jericho, who were over against\nhim, seeing it, said:  The spirit of Elias hath rested upon Eliseus.  And\ncoming to meet him, they worshipped him, falling to the ground.","And they said to him:  Behold, there are with thy servants, fifty\nstrong men, that can go, and seek thy master, lest, perhaps, the spirit\nof the Lord, hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain, or into\nsome valley.  And he said:  Do not send.","But they pressed him, till he consented, and said:  Send.  And they\nsent fifty men:  and they sought three days, but found him not.","And they came back to him:  for he abode at Jericho, and he said\nto them:  Did I not say to you?  Do not send.","And the men of the city, said to Eliseus .  Behold the situation\nof this city is very good, as thou, my lord, seest:  but the waters are\nvery bad, and the ground barren.","And he said:  Bring me a new vessel, and put salt into it.  And\nwhen they had brought it,","He went out to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt into\nit, and said:  Thus saith the Lord:  I have healed these waters, and\nthere shall be no more in them death or barrenness.","And the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word\nof Eliseus, which he spoke.","And he went up from thence to Bethel:  and as he was going up by\nthe way, little boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying:  Go\nup, thou bald head, go up, thou bald head.","And looking back, he saw them, and cursed them in the name of the\nLord:  and there came forth two bears out of the forest, and tore of\nthem, two and forty boys.","And from thence he went to mount Carmel, and from thence he\nreturned to Samaria."]}
