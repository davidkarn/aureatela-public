The law prohibits the gods of the nations from being named,[fn-8-P832_333603:162-nf] not of course that we are not to pronounce their names, the speaking of which common intercourse extorts from us: for this must very frequently be said, \"You find him in the temple of Â¦sculapius; \"and, \"I live in Isis Street; \"and, \"He has been made priest of Jupiter; \"and much else after this manner, since even on men names of this kind are bestowed. I do not honour Saturnus if I call a man so, by his own name. I honour him no more than I do Marcus, if I call a man Marcus. But it says, \"Make not mention of the name of other gods, neither be it heard from thy mouth.\"[fn-8-P833_334295:163-nf] The precept it gives is this, that we do not call them gods. For in the first part of the law, too, \"Thou shalt not,\" saith He, \"use the name of the Lord thy God in a vain thing,\"[fn-8-P834_334498:164-nf] that is, in an idol.[fn-8-P835_334537:165-nf] Whoever, therefore, honours an idol with the name of God, has fallen into idolatry. But if i speak of them as gods, something must be added to make it appear that I do not call them gods. For even the Scripture names \"gods,\" but adds \"their,\" viz. \"of the nations: \"just as David does when he had named \"gods,\" where he says, \"But the gods of the nations are demons.\"[fn-8-P836_335042:166-nf] But this has been laid by me rather as a foundation for ensuing observations. However, it is a defect of custom to say, \"By Hercules, So help me the god of faith; \"[fn-8-P837_335337:167-nf] while to the custom is added the ignorance of some, who are ignorant that it is an oath by Hercules. Further, what will an oath be, in the name of gods whom you have forsworn, but a collusion of faith with idolatry? For who does not honour them in whose name he swears?","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":17,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_100_epistle_lxxv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-05","text":"6. Besides even the Lord's sacrifices themselves declare that Christian unanimity is linked together with itself by a firm and inseparable charity, For when the Lord calls bread, which is combined by the union of many grains, His body, He indicates our people whom He bore as being united; and when He calls the wine, which is pressed from many grapes and clusters and collected together, His blood, He also signifies our flock linked together by the mingling of a united multitude.[fn-64-P6496_2092505:16-nf] If Novatian is united to this bread of the Lord, if he also is mingled with this cup of Christ, he may also seem to be able to have the grace of the one baptism of the Church, if it be manifest that he holds the unity of the Church. In fine, how inseparable is the sacrament of unity, and how hopeless are they, and what excessive ruin they earn for themselves from the indignation of God, who make a schism, and, forsaking their bishop,[fn-64-P6497_2093010:17-nf] appoint another false bishop for themselves without,-Holy Scripture declares in the books of Kings; where ten tribes were divided from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, and, forsaking their king, appointed for themselves another one without. It says, \"And the Lord was very angry with all the seed of Israel, and removed them away, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them out of His sight; for Israel was scattered from the house of David, and they made themselves a king, Jeroboam the son of Nebat.\"[fn-64-P6498_2093797:18-nf] It says that the Lord was very angry, and gave them up to perdition, because they were scattered from unity, and had made another king for themselves. And so great was the indignation of the Lord against those who had made the schism, that even when the man of God was sent to Jeroboam, to charge upon him his sins, and predict the future vengeance, he was forbidden to eat bread or to drink water with them. And when he did not observe this, and took meat against the command of God, he was immediately smitten by the majesty of the divine judgment, so that returning thence he was slain on the way by the jaws of a lion which attacked him. And dares any one to say that the saving water of baptism and heavenly grace can be in common with schismatics, with whom neither earthly food nor worldly drink ought to be in common? Moreover, the Lord satisfies us in His Gospel, and shows forth a still greater light of intelligence, that the same persons who had then divided themselves from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, and forsaking Jerusalem had seceded to Samaria, should be reckon among profane persons and Gentiles. For when first He sent His disciples on the ministry of salvation, He bade them, saying, \"Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not.\"[fn-64-P6499_2095123:19-nf] Sending first to the Jews, He commands the Gentiles as yet to be passed over; but by adding that even the city of the Samaritans was to be omitted, where there were schismatics, He shows that schismatics were to be put on the same level as Gentiles.","title":"Epistle LXXV.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":17,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For the occasion, indeed, of claiming Divine grace even for the Gentiles derived a pre-eminent fitness from this fact, that the man who set up to vindicate CoWs Law as his own was of the Gentiles, and not a Jew \"of the stock of the Israelites.\"[fn-20-P2029_693529:2-nf] For this fact-that Gentiles are admissible to God's Law-is enough to prevent Israel from priding himself on the notion that \"the Gentiles are accounted as a little drop of a bucket,\" or else as \"dust out of a threshing-floor: \"[fn-20-P2030_693780:3-nf] although we have God Himself as an adequate engager and faithful promiser, in that He promised to Abraham that \"in his seed should be blest all nations of the earth; \"[fn-20-P2031_694109:4-nf] and that[fn-20-P2032_694198:5-nf] out of the womb of Rebecca \"two peoples and two nations were about to proceed,\"[fn-20-P2033_694469:6-nf] -of course those of the Jews, that is, of Israel; and of the Gentiles, that is ours.
