{"verses":["The word of the Lord that came to Sophonias the son of Chusi, the\nson of Godolias, the son of Amarias, the son of Ezechias, in the days\nof Josias, the son of Amon king of Juda.","Gathering, I will gather together all things from off the face of\nthe land, saith the Lord:","I will gather man, and beast, I will gather the birds of the air,\nand the fishes of the sea:  and the ungodly shall meet with ruin:  and I\nwill destroy men from off the face of the land, saith the Lord.","And I will stretch out my hand upon Juda, and upon all the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem:  and I will destroy out of this place the\nremnant of Baal, and the names of the wardens of the temples with the\npriests:","And them that worship the host of heaven upon the tops of houses,\nand them that adore, and swear by the Lord, and swear by Melchom.","And them that turn away from following after the Lord, and that\nhave not sought the Lord, nor searched after him.","Be silent before the face of the Lord God:  for the day of the Lord\nis near, for the Lord hath prepared a victim, he hath sanctified his\nguests.","And it shall come to pass in the day of the victim of the Lord,\nthat I will visit upon the princes, and upon the king's sons, and upon\nall such as are clothed with strange apparel:","And I will visit in that day upon every one that entereth\narrogantly over the threshold:  them that fill the house of the Lord\ntheir God with iniquity and deceit.","And there shall be in that day, saith the Lord, the noise of a\ncry from the fish gate, and a howling from the Second, and a great\ndestruction from the hills.","Howl, ye inhabitants of the Morter.  All the people of Chanaan is\nhush, all are cut off that were wrapped up in silver.","And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search\nJerusalem with lamps, and will visit upon the men that are settled on\ntheir lees:  that say in their hearts:  The Lord will not do good, nor\nwill he do evil.","And their strength shall become a booty, and their houses as a\ndesert:  and they shall build houses, and shall not dwell in them:  and\nthey shall plant vineyards, and shall not drink the wine of them.","The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and exceeding\nswift:  the voice of the day of the Lord is bitter, the mighty man shall\nthere meet with tribulation.","That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and distress, a\nday of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and obscurity, a day of\nclouds and whirlwinds,","A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and\nagainst the high bulwarks.","And I will distress men, and they shall walk like blind men,\nbecause they have sinned against the Lord:  and their blood shall be\npoured out as earth, and their bodies as dung.","Neither shall their silver and their gold be able to deliver them\nin the day of the wrath of the Lord:  all the land shall be devoured by\nthe fire of his jealousy:  for he shall make even a speedy destruction\nof all them that dwell in the land."]}
