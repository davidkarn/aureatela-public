For there are different kinds of deadness; and one there is of the body, according to which Abraham was dead, and still was not dead. For \"God,\" He says, \"is not a God of the dead, but of the living.\" (Matt. xxii. 32.) Another is of the soul which Christ alludes to when He says, \"Let the dead bury their dead.\" (ib. viii. 22. Another, which is even the subject of praise, which is brought about by religion (filosofiaj), of which Paul saith, \"Mortify your members which are upon the earth.\" (Col. iii. 5.) Another, which is the cause even of this, the one which takes place in baptism. \"For our old man,\" he says, \"has been crucified\" (ver. 6), that is, has been deadened. Since then we know this, let us flee from the deadness by which, even though alive, we die. And let us not be afraid of that with which common death comes on. But the other two, whereof one is blissful, having been given by God, the other praiseworthy (cf. Ar. Eth. i. 12), which is accomplished by ourselves together with God, let us both choose and be emulous of. And of those two, one doth David pronounce blessed, when he says, \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven\" (Ps. xxxii. 1); and the other, Paul holds in admiration, saying, and writing to the Galatians, \"They that be Christ's have crucified the flesh.\" (Gal. v. 24.) But of the other couple, one Christ declares to be easy to hold in contempt, when He says, \"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul:\" and the other fearful, for, \"Fear\" (He says) \"Him that is able to destroy both body and soul in hell.\" (Matt. x. 28.) And therefore let us flee from this, and choose[fn-24-P2475_2368738:13-nf] that deadness which is held blessed and admirable; that of the other two, we may escape the one and not fear the other: for it is not the least good to us to see the sun, and to eat and drink, unless the life of good words be with us. For what would be the advantage, pray, of a king dressed in a purple robe and possessed of arms, but without a single subject, and exposed to all that had a mind to attack and insult him? In like manner it will be no advantage to a Christian to have faith, and the gift of baptism, and yet be open to all the passions. In that way the disgrace will be greater, and the shame more. For as such an one having the diadem and purple is so far from gaining by this dress any honor to himself, that he even does disgrace to that by his own shame: so the believer also, who leadeth a corrupt life, is so far from becoming, as such, an object of respect, that he is only the more one of scorn. \"For as many,\" it says, \"as sinned without law, shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.\" (Rom. ii. 12). And in the Epistle to the Hebrews, he says, \"He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who had trodden under foot the Son of God?\" (Heb. x. 28, 29.) And with reason. For I placed (He might say) all the passions in subjection to thee by baptism. How then comes it that thou hast disgraced so great a gift, and hast become one thing instead of another? I have killed and buried thy former transgressions, like worms-how is it that thou hast bred others?-for sins are worse than worms, since these do harm to the body, those to the soul; and those make the more offensive stench. Yet we perceive it not, and so we are at no pains to purge them out. Thus the drunkard knows not how disgustful the stale wine is, but he that is not drunken has a distinct perception of it. So with sins also, he that lives soberly knows thoroughly that other mire, and the stain. But he that gives himself up to wickedness, like a man made drowsy with drunkenness, does not even know the very fact that he is ill. And this is the most grievous part of vice, that it does not allow those who fall into it even to see the greatness of their own bane, but as they lie in the mire, they think they are enjoying perfumes. And so they have not even the power of getting free, but when full of worms, like men that pride themselves in precious stones. so do they exult in these. And for this reason they have not so much as the will to kill them, but they even nourish these up, and multiply them in themselves, until they send them on to the worms of the world to come. For these are providers for those, and are not only providers, but even the fathers of those that never die; as it says, \"their worm shall not die.\" (Mark ix. 44.) These kindle the hell which never extinguishes. To prevent this from happening then, let us do away with this fountain of evil, and extinguish the furnace, and let us draw up the root of wickedness from beneath, since you will do no good by cutting the tree off from above, if the root remains below, and sends up fresh shoots of the same kind again. What then is the root of the evils? Learn from the good husbandman (i.e. St. Paul 1 Cor. iii. 6-9), who has an accurate knowledge of such things, and tends the spiritual vine and cultivates the whole world. Now what does he say is the cause of all the evils? The love of money. For the \"love of money is the root of all evils.\" (1 Tim. vi. 10). Hence come fightings, and enmities and wars; hence emulations, and railings, and suspicions, and insults; hence murders, and thefts, and violations of sepulchres.","title":"Homily XI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"}]
