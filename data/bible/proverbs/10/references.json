Some time after, I saw her bathe in the river Tiber; and I gave her my hand, and drew her out of the river. The sight of her beauty made me think with myself, \"I should be a happy man if I could but get a wife as handsome and good as she is.\" This was the only thought that passed through me: this and nothing more. A short time after this, as I was walking on my road to the villages,[fn-2-P213_24827:2-nf] and magnifying the creatures of God, and thinking how magnificent, and beautiful, and powerful they are,[fn-2-P214_25409:3-nf] I fell asleep. And the Spirit carried me away, and took me through a pathless place,[fn-2-P215_25549:4-nf] through which a man could not travel, for it was situated in the midst of rocks; it was rugged and impassible on account of water. Having passed over this river, I came to a plain. I then bent down on my knees, and began to pray to the Lord[fn-2-P216_25888:5-nf] and to confess my sins. And as I prayed, the heavens were opened, and I see the woman whom I had desired saluting me from the sky, and saying, \"Hail, Hermas!\" And looking up to her, I said, \"Lady, what doest thou here? \"And she answered me, \"I have been taken up here to accuse you of your sins before the Lord.\" \"Lady,\" said I, \"are you to be the subject of my accusation? \"[fn-2-P217_26290:6-nf] \"No,\" said she; \"but hear the words which I am going to speak to you. God, who dwells in the heavens, and made out of nothing the things that exist, and multiplied and increased them on account of His holy Church,[fn-2-P218_26592:7-nf] is angry with you for having sinned against me.\" I answered her, \"Lady, have I sinned against you? How?[fn-2-P219_26718:8-nf] or when spoke I an unseemly word to you? Did I not always think of you as a lady? Did I not always respect you as a sister?

Is it not your opinion that a righteous man commits sin when an evil desire arises in his heart? There is sin in such a case, and the sin is great,\" said she; \"for the thoughts of a righteous man should be righteous. For by thinking righteously his character is established in the heavens,[fn-2-P221_27400:10-nf] and he has the Lord merciful to him in every business. But such as entertain wicked thoughts in their minds are bringing upon themselves death and captivity; and especially is this the case with those who set their affections on this world,[fn-2-P222_28033:11-nf] and glory in their riches, and look not forward to the blessings of the life to come.

He is at once a monk, a prelate, and an uncle who has before now instructed you in all holy things. This also I say that the bishops should know themselves to be priests not lords. Let them render to the clergy the honour which is their due that the clergy may offer to them the respect which belongs to bishops. There is a witty saying of the orator Domitius which is here to the point: \"Why am I to recognize you as leader of the Senate when you will not recognize my rights as a private member?\"[fn-19-P1937_478511:1355-nf] We should realize that a bishop and his presbyters are like Aaron and his sons. As there is but one Lord and one Temple; so also should there be but one ministry. Let us ever bear in mind the charge which the apostle Peter gives to priests: \"feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly as God would have you;[fn-19-P1938_478913:1356-nf] not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage but being ensamples to the flock,\" and that gladly; that \"when the chief-shepherd shall appear ye may receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.\"[fn-19-P1939_479173:1357-nf] It is a bad custom which prevails in certain churches for presbyters to be silent when bishops are present on the ground that they would be jealous or impatient hearers. \"If anything,\" writes the apostle Paul, \"be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.

But you will perhaps reply: \"my mother is not well-behaved, she desires the things of the world, she loves riches, she disregards fasting, she stains her eyes with antimony, she likes to walk abroad in gay attire, she hinders me from the monastic vow, and so I cannot live with her.\" But first of all, even though she is as you say, you will have the greater reward for refusing to forsake her with all her faults. She has carried you in her womb, she has reared you; with gentle affection she has borne with the troublesome ways of your childhood. She has washed your linen, she has tended you when sick, and the sickness of maternity was not only borne for you but caused by you. She has brought you up to womanhood, she has taught you to love Christ. You ought not to be displeased with the behaviour of a mother who has consecrated you as a virgin to the service of your spouse. Still if you cannot put up with her dainty ways and feel obliged to shun them, and if your mother really is, as people so often say, a woman of the world, you have others, virgins like yourself, the holy company of chastity. Why, when you forsake your mother, do you choose for companion a man who perhaps has left behind him a sister and mother of his own? You tell me that she is hard to get on with and that he is easy; that she is quarrelsome and that he is amiable. I will ask you one question: Did you go straight from your home to the man, or did you fall in with him afterwards? If you went straight to him, the reason why you left your mother is plain. If you fell in with him afterwards, you shew by your choice what you missed under your mother's roof.[fn-42-P4287_1157407:3059-nf] The pain that I inflict is severe and I feel the knife as much as you. \"He that walketh uprightly walketh surely.\"[fn-42-P4288_1157551:3060-nf] Only that my conscience would smite me, I should keep silence and be slow to blame others where I am not guiltless myself. Having a beam in my own eye I should be reluctant to see the mote in my neighbour's. But as it is I live far away among Christian brothers; my life with them is honourable as eyewitnesses of it can testify; I rarely see, or am seen by, others. It is most shameless, therefore, in you to refuse to copy me in respect of self-restraint, when you profess to take me as your model. If you say: \"my conscience is enough for me too. God is my judge who is witness of my life.

When men blame a maid of God not for self-indulgence but only for insensibility to affection, what they condemn as callous disregard of a parent is really a lively devotion towards God. For you prefer to your mother Him whom you are bidden to prefer to your own soul.[fn-42-P4290_1158810:3062-nf] And if the day ever comes that she also shall so prefer Him, she will find in you not a daughter only but a sister as well.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":10,"verse":25,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_16_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_ephesians","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"ANF-01","text":"But some most worthless persons are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practise things unworthy of God, and hold opinions contrary to the doctrine of Christ, to their own destruction, and that of those who give credit to them, whom you must avoid as ye would wild beasts.

Once upon a time the people of Israel halted[fn-70-P7008_2267974:6-nf] between two opinions. But, said Elias, which is by interpretation the strong one of the Lord,[fn-70-P7009_2268163:7-nf] \"How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, go after him; but if Baal, follow him.\" And the Lord himself says concerning the Jews,[fn-70-P7010_2268332:8-nf] \"the strange children lied unto me; the strange children became feeble, and limped out of their by-paths.\" If there really is no ground for suspecting him of heresy (as I wish and believe), why does he not speak out my opinion in my own words? He calls it simplicity; I interpret it as artfulness. He wishes to convince me that his belief is sound; let his speech, then, also be sound. And, indeed, if the ambiguity attached to a single word, or a single statement, or two or three, I could be indulgent on the score of ignorance; nor would I judge what is obscure or doubtful by the standard of what is certain and clear. But, as things are, this \"simplicity\" is nothing but a platform trick, like walking on tiptoe over eggs or standing corn; there isdoubt and suspicion everywhere. You might suppose he was not writing an exposition of the faith, but was writing a disputation on some imaginary theme. What he is now so keen upon, we learnt long ago in the schools. He puts on our own armour to fight against us. Even if his faith be correct, and he speaks with circumspection and reserve, his extreme care rouses my suspicions.[fn-70-P7011_2269482:9-nf] \"He that walketh uprightly, walketh boldly.\" It is folly to bear a bad name for nothing. A charge is brought against him of which he is not conscious. Let him confidently deny the charge which hangs upon a single word, and freely turn the tables against his adversary. Let the one exhibit the same boldness in repelling the charge which the other shows in advancing it. And when he has said all that he wishes and purposes to say, and such things as are above suspicion, if his opponent persists in slander, let him try conclusions in open court. I wish no one to sit still under an imputation of heresy, lest, if he say nothing, his want of openness be interpreted, amongst those who are not aware of his innocence, as the consciousness of guilt, although there is no need to demand the presence of a man and to reduce him to silence when you have his letters in your possession.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":10,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_22_book_xvi","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"The things which then were hidden are now sufficiently revealed by the actual events which have followed. For who can carefully and intelligently consider these things without recognizing them accomplished in Christ? Shem, of whom Christ was born in the flesh, means \"named.\" And what is of greater name than Christ, the fragrance of whose name is now everywhere perceived, so that even prophecy sings of it beforehand, comparing it in the Song of Songs,[fn-27-P2743_1534180:4-nf] to ointment poured forth? Is it not also in the houses of Christ, that is, in the churches, that the \"enlargement\" of the nations dwells? For Japheth means \"enlargement.\" And Ham (i.e., hot), who was the middle son of Noah, and, as it were, separated himself from both, and remained between them, neither belonging to the first-fruits of Israel nor to the fullness of the Gentiles, what does he signify but the tribe of heretics, hot with the spirit, not of patience, but of impatience, with which the breasts of heretics are wont to blaze, and with which they disturb the peace of the saints? But even the heretics yield an advantage to those that make proficiency, according to the apostle's saying, \"There must also be heresies, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.\"[fn-27-P2744_1535000:5-nf] Whence, too, it is elsewhere said, \"The son that receives instruction will be wise, and he uses the foolish as his servant.\"[fn-27-P2745_1535144:6-nf] For while the hot restlessness of heretics stirs questions about many articles of the catholic faith, the necessity of defending them forces us both to investigate them more accurately, to understand them more clearly, and to proclaim them more earnestly; and the question mooted by an adversary becomes the occasion of instruction. However, not only those who are openly separated from the church, but also all who glory in the Christian name, and at the same time lead abandoned lives, may without absurdity seem to be figured by Noah's middle son: for the passion of Christ, which was signified by that man's nakedness, is at once proclaimed by their profession, and dishonored by their wicked conduct. Of such, therefore, it has been said, \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\"[fn-27-P2746_1535948:7-nf] And therefore was Ham cursed in his son, he being, as it were, his fruit. So, too, this son of his, Canaan, is fitly interpreted \"their movement,\" which is nothing else than their work. But Shem and Japheth, that is to say, the circumcision and uncircumcision, or, as the apostle otherwise calls them, the Jews and Greeks, but called and justified, having somehow discovered the nakedness of their father (which signifies the Saviour's passion), took a garment and laid it upon their backs, and entered backwards and covered their father's nakedness, without their seeing what their reverence hid. For we both honor the passion of Christ as accomplished for us, and we hate the crime of the Jews who crucified Him. The garment signifies the sacrament, their backs the memory of things past: for the church celebrates the passion of Christ as already accomplished, and no longer to be looked forward to, now that Japheth already dwells in the habitations of Shem, and their wicked brother between them.","title":"Book XVI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_17_book_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"2","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1.

And let the men, fixing their eyes on the couch, and leaning without moving on their elbows, be present with their ears alone; and if they sit, let them not have their feet crossed, nor place one thigh on another, nor apply the hand to the chin. For it is vulgar not to bear one's self without support, and consequently a fault in a young man. And perpetually moving and changing one's position is a sign of frivolousness. It is the part of a temperate man also, in eating and drinking, to take a small portion, and deliberately, not eagerly, both at the beginning and during the courses and to leave off betimes, and so show his indifference. \"Eat,\" it is said, \"like a man what is set before you.

We must also check excessive laughter and immoderate tears. For often people under the influence of wine, after laughing immoderately, then are, I know not how, by some impulse of intoxication moved to tears; for both effiminacy and violence are discordant with the word. And elderly people, looking on the young as children, may, though but very rarely, be playful with them, joking with them to train them in good behaviour. For example, before a bashful and silent youth, one might by way of pleasantry speak thus: \"This son of mine (I mean one who is silent) is perpetually talking.\" For a joke such as this enhances the youth's modesty, by showing the good qualities that belong to him playfully, by censure of the bad quantities, which do not. For this device is instructive, confirming as it does what is present by what is not present. Such, certainly, is the intention of him who says that a water-drinker and a sober man gets intoxicated and drunk. But if there are those who like to jest at people, we must be silent, and dispense with superfluous words like full cups.

Such is the meaning of the phrase,[fn-39-P3947_1206097:147-nf] \"Peace to thee.\" Answer not a word before you hear. An enervated voice is the sign of effeminacy. But modulation in the voice is characteristic of a wise man, who keeps his utterance from loudness, from drawling, from rapidity, from prolixity.

For these are vices in reality, and the workings that proceed from them are dreadful and terrible. \"For not unjustly,\" say the divine oracles, \"are the nets spread for birds; for they who are accomplices in blood treasure up evils to themselves.\"[fn-57-P5742_1742017:75-nf] How, then, is the law still said to be not good by certain heresies that clamorously appeal to the apostle, who says, \"For by the law is the knowledge of sin? \"[fn-57-P5743_1742300:76-nf] To whom we say, The law did not cause, but showed sin. For, enjoining what is to be done, it reprehended what ought not to be done. And it is the part of the good to teach what is salutary, and to point out what is deleterious; and to counsel the practice of the one, and to command to shun the other. Now the apostle, whom they do not comprehend, said that by the law the knowledge of sin was manifested, not that from it it derived its existence. And how can the law be not good, which trains, which is given as the instructor (paidagwgo/j) to Christ,[fn-57-P5744_1742873:77-nf] that being corrected by fear, in the way of discipline, in order to the attainment of the perfection which is by Christ? \"I will not,\" it is said, \"the death of the sinner, as his repentance.\"[fn-57-P5745_1743085:78-nf] Now the commandment works repentance; in as much as it deters[fn-57-P5746_1743185:79-nf] from what ought not to be done, and enjoins good deeds. By ignorance he means, in my opinion, death. \"And he that is near the Lord is full of stripes.\"[fn-57-P5747_1743540:80-nf] Plainly, he, that draws near to knowledge, has the benefit of perils, fears, troubles, afflictions, by reason of his desire for the truth. \"For the son who is instructed turns out wise, and an intelligent son is saved from burning. And an intelligent son will receive the commandments.\"[fn-57-P5748_1743849:81-nf] And Barnabas the apostle having said, \"Woe to those who are wise in their own conceits, clever in their own eyes,\"[fn-57-P5749_1743987:82-nf] added, \"Let us become spiritual, a perfect temple to God; let us, as far as in us lies, practise the fear of God, and strive to keep His commands, that we may rejoice in His judgments.\"[fn-57-P5750_1744190:83-nf] Whence \"the fear of God\" is divinely said to be the beginning of wisdom.[fn-57-P5751_1744293:84-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":10,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_59_book_ii_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Convicted by this utterance, the heretics reject the Epistles to Timothy.[fn-58-P5810_1766274:120-nf] Well, then, if the Lord is the truth, and wisdom, and power of God, as in truth He is, it is shown that the real Gnostic is he that knows Him, and His Father by Him.

Since, then, they define manliness to be knowledge[fn-59-P5927_1796372:190-nf] of things formidable, and not formidable, and what is intermediate; and temperance to be a state of mind which by choosing and avoiding preserves the judgments of wisdom; and conjoined with manliness is patience, which is called endurance, the knowledge of what is bearable and what is unbearable; and magnanimity is the knowledge which rises superior to circumstances. With temperance also is conjoined caution, which is avoidance in accordance with reason. And observance of the commandments, which is the innoxious keeping of them, is the attainment of a secure life. And there is no endurance without manliness, nor the exercise of self-restraint without temperance. And these virtues follow one another; and with whom are the sequences of the virtues, with him is also salvation, which is the keeping of the state of well-being. Rightly, therefore, in treating of these virtues, we shall inquire into them all; for he that has one virtue gnostically, by reason of their accompanying each other, has them all. Self-restraint is that quality which does not overstep what appears in accordance with right reason. He exercises self-restraint, who curbs the impulses that are contrary to right reason, or curbs himself so as not to indulge in desires contrary to right reason. Temperance, too, is not without manliness; since from the commandments spring both wisdom, which follows God who enjoins, and that which imitates the divine character, namely righteousness; in virtue of which, in the exercise of self-restraint, we address ourselves in purity to piety and the course of conduct thence resulting, in conformity with God; being assimilated to the Lord as far as is possible for us beings mortal in nature. And this is being just and holy with wisdom; for the Divinity needs nothing and suffers nothing; whence it is not, strictly speaking, capable of self-restraint, for it is never subjected to perturbation, over which to exercise control; while our nature, being capable of perturbation, needs self-constraint, by which disciplining itself to the need of little, it endeavours to approximate in character to the divine nature. For the good man, standing as the boundary between an immortal and a mortal nature, has few needs; having wants in consequence of his body, and his birth itself, but taught by rational self-control to want few things.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":10,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_59_book_ii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"ANF-02","text":"What reason is there in the law's prohibiting a man from \"wearing woman's clothing \"?[fn-59-P5929_1798911:191-nf] Is it not that it would have us to be manly, and not to be effeminate neither in person and actions, nor in thought and word? For it would have the man, that devotes himself to the truth, to be masculine both in acts of endurance and patience, in life, conduct, word, and discipline by night and by day; even if the necessity were to occur, of witnessing by the shedding of his blood. Again, it is said, \"If any one who has newly built a house, and has not previously inhabited it; or cultivated a newly-planted vine, and not yet partaken of the fruit; or betrothed a virgin, and not yet married her; \"[fn-59-P5930_1799536:192-nf] -such the humane law orders to be relieved from military service: from military reasons in the first place, lest, bent on their desires, they turn out sluggish in war; for it is those who are untrammelled by passion that boldly encounter perils; and from motives of humanity, since, in view of the uncertainties of war, the law reckoned it not right that one should not enjoy his own labours, and another should without bestowing pains, receive what belonged to those who had laboured. The law seems also to point out manliness of soul, by enacting that he who had planted should reap the fruit, and he that built should inhabit, and he that had betrothed should marry: for it is not vain hopes which it provides for those who labour; according to the gnostic word: \"For the hope of a good man dead or living does not perish,\"[fn-59-P5931_1800466:193-nf] says Wisdom; \"I love them that love me; and they who seek me shall find peace,\"[fn-59-P5932_1800572:194-nf] and so forth. What then? Did not the women of the Midianites, by their beauty, seduce from wisdom into impiety, through licentiousness, the Hebrews when making war against them? For, having seduced them from a grave mode of life, and by their beauty ensnared them in wanton delights, they made them insane upon idol sacrifices and strange women; and overcome by women and by pleasure at once, they revolted from God, and revolted from the law. And the whole people was within a little of falling under the power of the enemy through female stratagem, until, when they were in peril, fear by its admonitions pulled them back. Then the survivors, valiantly undertaking the struggle for piety, got the upper hand of their foes. \"The beginning, then, of wisdom is piety, and the knowledge of holy things is understanding; and to know the law is the characteristic of a good understanding.\"[fn-59-P5933_1801481:195-nf] Those, then, who suppose the law to be productive of agitating fear, are neither good at understanding the law, nor have they in reality comprehended it; for \"the fear of the Lord causes life, but he who errs shall be afflicted with pangs which knowledge views not.\"[fn-59-P5934_1801769:196-nf] Accordingly, Barnabas says mystically, \"May God who rules the universe vouchsafe also to you wisdom, and understanding, and science, and knowledge of His statutes, and patience.

But of these things I have no care; for I know and am persuaded that they who endure shall receive a reward from our Saviour; and that ye also, if ye endure as the Fathers did, and shew yourselves examples to the people, and overthrow these strange and alien devices of impious men, shall be able to glory, and say, We have `kept the Faith[fn-40-P4087_1711372:130-nf] ;' and ye shall receive the `crown of life,' which God `hath promised to them that love Him[fn-40-P4088_1711485:131-nf] .' And God grant that I also together with you may inherit the promises, which, were given, not to Paul only, but also to all them that `have loved the appearing[fn-40-P4089_1711667:132-nf] ' of our Lord, and Saviour, and God, and universal King, Jesus Christ; through whom to the Father be glory and dominion in the Holy Spirit, both now and for ever, world without end[fn-40-P4090_1711869:133-nf] .

But being made man, He shews by speaking in this manner that there is a time allotted to every man; and that not by chance, as some of the Gentiles imagine in their fables, but a time which He, the Creator, has appointed to every one according to the will of the Father. This is written in the Scriptures, and is manifest to all men. For although it be hidden and unknown to all, what period of time is allotted to each, and how it is allotted; yet every one knows this, that as there is a time for spring and for summer, and for autumn and for winter, so, as it is written[fn-44-P4435_1830418:61-nf] , there is a time to die, and a time to live. And so the time of the generation which lived in the days of Noah was cut short, and their years were contracted, because the time of all things was at hand. But to Hezekiah were added fifteen years. And as God promises to them that serve Him truly, `I will fulfil the number of thy days[fn-44-P4436_1830773:62-nf] ,' Abraham dies `full of days,' and David besought God, saying, `Take me not away in the midst of my days[fn-44-P4437_1830912:63-nf] .'

But do ye, says He, learn this of Me, \"for I am meek and lowly of heart.\"[fn-56-P5638_2012112:18-nf] For this it is which it is possible for all men generally to learn and practise, but the working of miracles and signs is not always necessary, nor goodfor all, nor granted to all. Humility therefore is the mistress of all virtues, it is the surest foundation of the heavenly building, it is the special and splendid gift of the Saviour. For he can perform all the miracles which Christ wrought, without danger of being puffed up, who follows the gentle Lord not in the grandeur of His miracles, but in the virtues of patience and humility. But he who aims at commanding unclean spirits, or bestowing gifts of healing, or showing some wonderful miracle to the people, even though when he is showing off he invokes the name of Christ, yet he is far from Christ, because in his pride of heart he does not follow his humble Teacher. For when He was returning to the Father, He prepared, so to speak, His will and left this to His disciples: \"A new commandment,\" said He, \"give I unto you that ye love one another; as I have loved you, so do ye also love one another:\" and at once He subjoined: \"By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love to one another.\"[fn-56-P5639_2013316:19-nf] He says not: \"if ye do signs and miracles in the same way,\" but \"if ye have to one another;\" and thisit is certain that none but the meek andhumble can keep. Wherefore our predecessors never reckoned those as good monks orfree from the fault of vainglory, who professed themselves exorcists among men, andproclaimed with boastful ostentation amongadmiring crowds the grace which they hadeither obtained or which they claimed. Butin vain, for \"he who trusteth in lies feedeththe winds: and the same runneth after birdsthat fly away.\"[fn-56-P5640_2013876:20-nf] For without doubt that willhappen to them which we find in Proverbs:\"As the winds and clouds and rain are veryclear so are these who boast of a fictitiousgift.\"[fn-56-P5641_2014054:21-nf] And so if any one does any of thesethings in our presence, he ought to meet withcommendation from us not from admirationof his miracles, but from the beauty of his life,nor should we ask whether the devils are subject to him, but whether he possesses thosefeatures of love which the Apostle describes.","title":"XV.

I have been specially moved to desire union with you by the report of the zeal of your reverences in the cause of orthodoxy. The constancy of your hearts has been stirred neither by multiplicity of books nor by variety of ingenious arguments. You have on the contrary, recognised those who endeavoured to introduce innovations in opposition to the apostolic doctrines, and you have refused to keep silence concerning the mischief which they are causing. I have in truth found great distress among all who cleave to the peace of the Lord at the divers innovations of Apollinarius of Laodicea. He has all the more distressed me from the fact that he seemed at the beginning on our side. A sufferer can in a certain sense endure what comes to him from an open enemy, even though it be exceedingly painful, as it is written, \"For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could bare borne it.\"[fn-59-P5953_1875408:2-nf] But it is intolerable, and beyond the power of comfort, to be wronged by a close and sympathetic friend. Now that very man whom I have expected to have at my right hand in defence of the truth, I have found in many ways hindering those who are being saved, by seducing their minds and drawing them away from direct doctrine. What rash and hasty deed has he not done? What ill considered and dangerous argument has he not risked? Is not all the Church divided against herself, specially since the day when men have been sent by him to the Churches governed by orthodox bishops, to rend them asunder and to set up some peculiar and illegal service? Is not ridicule brought upon the great mystery of true religion when bishops go about without people and clergy, having nothing but the mere name and title, and effecting nothing for the advancement of the Gospel of peace and salvation? Are not his discourses about God full of impious doctrines, the old impiety of the insane Sabellius being now renewed by him in his writings? For if the works which are current among the Sebastenes are not the forgery of foes, and are really his composition, he has reached a height of impiety which cannot be surpassed, in saying that Father, Son, and Spirit are the same, and other dark pieces of irreverence which I have declined even to hear, praying that I may have nothing to do with those who have uttered them. Does he not confuse the doctrine of the incarnation? Has not the oeconomy of salvation been made doubtful to the many on account of his dark and cloudy speculations about it? To collect them all, and refute them, requires long time and much discussion. But where have the promises of the Gospel been blunted and destroyed as by his figments? So meanly and poorly has he dared to explain the blessed hope laid up for all who live according to the Gospel of Christ, as to reduce it to mere old wives' fables and doctrines of Jews. He proclaims the renewal of the Temple, the observance of the worship of the Law, a typical high priest over again after the real High Priest, and a sacrifice for sins after the Lamb of God Who taketh away the sin of the world.[fn-59-P5954_1877583:3-nf] He preaches partial baptisms after the one baptism, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the Church which, through its faith in Christ, has not spot or wrinkle, or any such thing;[fn-59-P5955_1877778:4-nf] cleansing of leprosy after the painless state of the resurrection; an offering of jealousy[fn-59-P5956_1877884:5-nf] when they neither marry nor are given in marriage; shew-bread after the Bread from heaven; burning lamps after the true Light. In a word, if the law of the Commandments has been done away with by dogmas, it is plain that under these circumstances the dogmas of Christ will be nullified by the injunctions of the law.[fn-59-P5957_1878220:6-nf] At these things shame and disgrace have covered my face,[fn-59-P5958_1878395:7-nf] and heavy grief hath filled my heart. Wherefore, I beseech you, as skilful physicians, and instructed how to discipline antagonists with gentleness, to try and bring him back to the right order of the Church, and to persuade him to despise the wordiness of his own works; for he has proved the truth of the proverb \"in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin\"[fn-59-P5959_1878780:8-nf] Put boldly before him the doctrines of orthodoxy, in order that his amendment may be published abroad, and his repentance made known to his brethren.","title":"Letter CCLXV.","author":"St. Basil"}]
