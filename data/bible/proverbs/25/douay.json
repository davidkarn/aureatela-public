{"verses":["These are also parables of Solomon, which the men of Ezechias,\nking of Juda, copied out.","It is the glory of God to conceal the word, and the glory of\nkings to search out the speech.","The heaven above and the earth beneath, and the heart of kings is\nunsearchable.","Take away the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most\npure vessel:","Take away wickedness from the face of the king, and his throne\nshall be established with justice.","Appear not glorious before the king, and stand not in the place\nof great men.","For it is better that it should be said to thee:  Come up hither;\nthan that thou shouldst be humbled before the prince.","The things which thy eyes have seen, utter not hastily in a\nquarrel:  lest afterward thou mayst not be able to make amends, when\nthou hast dishonoured thy friend.","Treat thy cause with thy friend, and discover not the secret to a\nstranger:","Lest he insult over thee, when he hath heard it, and cease not\nto upbraid thee.  Grace and friendship deliver a man:  keep these for\nthyself, lest thou fall under reproach.","To speak a word in due time, is like apples of gold on beds of\nsilver.","As an earring of gold and a bright pearl, so is he that\nreproveth the wise, and the obedient ear.","As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful\nmessenger to him that sent him, for he refresheth his soul.","As clouds, and wind, when no rain followeth, so is the man that\nboasteth, and doth not fulfil his promises.","By patience a prince shall be appeased, and a soft tongue shall\nbreak hardness.","Thou hast found honey, eat what is sufficient for thee, lest\nbeing glutted therewith thou vomit it up.","Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour, lest having\nhis fill he hate thee.","A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour, is like\na dart and a sword and a sharp arrow.","To trust in an unfaithful man in the time of trouble, is like a\nrotten tooth, and weary foot,","And one that looseth his garment in cold weather.  As vinegar\nupon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a very evil heart.  As a moth\ndoth by a garment, and a worm by the wood:  so the sadness of a man\nconsumeth the heart.","If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat:  if he thirst, give him\nwater to drink:","For thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head, and the Lord will\nreward thee.","The north wind driveth away rain, as doth a sad countenance a\nbackbiting tongue.","It is better to sit in a corner of the housetop:  than with a\nbrawling woman, and in a common house.","As cold water to a thirsty soul, so are good tidings from a far\ncountry.","A just man falling down before the wicked, is as a fountain\ntroubled with the foot and a corrupted spring.","As it is not good for a man to eat much honey, so he that is a\nsearcher of majesty shall be overwhelmed by glory.","As a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls, so is\na man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking."]}
