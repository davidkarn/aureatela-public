Moreover, a good name is more pleasant to the mind[fn-3-P346_60290:42-nf] than oil to the body; and the end of life is better than the birth, and to mourn is more desirable than to revel, and to be with the sorrowing is better than to be with the drunken. For this is the fact, that he who comes to the end of life has no further care about alight around him. And discreet anger is to be preferred to laughter; for by the severe disposition of countenance the soul is kept upright[fn-3-P347_60717:43-nf] The souls of the wise, indeed, are sad and downcast, but those of fools are elated, and given loose to merriment. And yet it is far more desirable to receive blame from one wise man, than to become a hearer of a whole chorus of worthless and miserable men in their songs. For the laughter of fools is like the crackling of many thorns burning in a fierce fire. This, too, is misery, yea the greatest of evils, namely oppression;[fn-3-P348_61165:44-nf] for it intrigues against the souls of the wise, and attempts to ruin the noble way of life[fn-3-P349_61283:45-nf] which the good pursue. Moreover, it is right to commend not the man who begins, but the man who finishes a speech;[fn-3-P350_61414:46-nf] and what s moderate ought to approve itself to the mind, and not what is swollen and inflated. Again, one ought certainly to keep wrath in check, and not suffer himself to be carried rashly into anger, the slaves of which are fools. More over, they are in error who assert that a better manner of life was given to those before us, and they fail to see that wisdom is widely different from mere abundance of possessions, and that it is as much more lustrous[fn-3-P351_62006:47-nf] than these, as silver shines more brightly than its shadow. For the life of man hath its excellence[fn-3-P352_62157:48-nf] not in the acquisition of perishable riches, but in wisdom. And who shall be able, tell me, to declare the providence of God, which is so great and so beneficent? or who shall be able to recall the things which seem to have been passed by of God? And in the former days of my vanity I considered all things, and saw a righteous man continuing in his righteousness, and ceasing not from it until death, but even suffering injury by reason thereof, and a wicked man perishing with his wickedness. Moreover, it is proper that the righteous man should not seem to be so overmuch, nor exceedingly and above measure wise, that he may not, as in making some slip, seem to sin many times over. And be not thou audacious and precipitate, lest an untimely death surprise thee. It is the greatest of all good to take hold of God, and by abiding in Him to sin in nothing. For to touch things undefiled with an impure hand is abomination. But he who in the fear of God submits himself,[fn-3-P353_63150:49-nf] escapes all that is contrary. Wisdom availeth more in the way of help than a band of the most powerful men in a city, and it often also pardons righteously those who fail in duty. For there is not one that stumbleth not.[fn-3-P354_63387:50-nf] Also it becomes thee in no way to attend upon the words of the impious, that thou mayest not become an ear-witness[fn-3-P355_63568:51-nf] of words spoken against thyself, such as the foolish talk of a wicked servant, and being thus stung in heart, have recourse afterwards thyself to cursing in turn in many actions. And all these things have I known, having received wisdom from God, which afterwards I lost, and was no longer able to be the same.[fn-3-P356_63895:52-nf] For wisdom fled from me to an infinite distance, and into a measureless deep, so that I could no longer get hold of it. Wherefore afterwards I abstained altogether from seeking it; and I no longer thought of considering the follies and the vain counsels of the impious, and their weary, distracted life. And being thus disposed, I was borne on to the things themselves; and being seized with a fatal passion, I knew woman-that she is like a snare or some such other object.[fn-3-P357_64383:53-nf] For her heart ensnares those who pass her; and if she but join hand to hand, she holds one as securely as though she dragged him on bound with chains.[fn-3-P358_64696:54-nf] And from her you can secure your deliverance only by finding a propitious and watchful superintendent in God;[fn-3-P359_65071:55-nf] for he who is enslaved by sin cannot (otherwise) escape its grasp. Moreover, among all women I sought for the chastity[fn-3-P360_65206:56-nf] proper to them, and I found it in none. And verily a person may find one man chaste among a thousand, but a woman never.[fn-3-P361_65345:57-nf] And this above all things I observed, that men being made by God simple[fn-3-P362_65771:58-nf] in mind, contract[fn-3-P363_65812:59-nf] for themselves manifold reasonings and infinite questionings, and while professing to seek wisdom, waste their life in vain words.","title":"A Metaphrase of the Book of Ecclesiastes.","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":29,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_16_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_ephesians","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-01","text":"The more, therefore, you see the bishop silent, the more do you reverence him.

I longed for honours, gains, wedlock; and Thou mockedst me. In these desires I underwent most bitter hardships, Thou being the more gracious the less Thou didst suffer anything which was not Thou to grow sweet to me. Behold my heart, O Lord, who wouldest that I should recall all this, and confess unto Thee. Now let my soul cleave to Thee, which Thou hast freed from that fast-holding bird-lime of death. How wretched was it! And Thou didst irritate the feeling of its wound, that, forsaking all else, it might be converted unto Thee,-who art above all, and without whom all things would be naught,-be converted and be healed. How wretched was I at that time, and how didst Thou deal with me, to make me sensible of my wretchedness on that day wherein I was preparing to recite a panegyric on the Emperor,[fn-8-P885_336343:22-nf] wherein I was to deliver many a lie, and lying was to be applauded by those who knew I lied; and my heart panted with these cares, and boiled over with the feverishness of consuming thoughts. For, while walking along one of the streets of Milan, I observed a poor mendicant,-then, I imagine, with a full belly,-joking and joyous; and I sighed, and spake to the friends around me of the many sorrows resulting from our madness, for that by all such exertions of ours,-as those wherein I then laboured, dragging along, under the spur of desires, the burden of my own, unhappiness, and by dragging increasing it,we yet aimed only to attain that very joyousness which that mendicant had reached before us, who, perchance, never would attain it! For what he had obtained through a few begged pence, the same was I scheming for by many a wretched and tortuous turning,-the joy of a temporary felicity. For he verily possessed not true joy, but yet I, with these my ambitions, was seeking one much more untrue. And in truth he was joyous, I anxious; he free from care, I full of alarms. But should any one inquire of me whether I would rather be merry or fearful, I would reply, Merry. Again, were I asked whether I would rather be such as he was, or as I myself then was, I should elect to be myself, though beset with cares and alarms, but out of perversity; for was it so in truth? For I ought not to prefer myself to him because I happened to be more learned than he, seeing that I took no delight therein, but sought rather to please men by it; and that not to instruct, but only to please.

Whence also the Lord speaks to thiseffect: \"Pass not the ancient landmarks which thy fathers have set: \"[fn-89-P8994_2917524:4-nf] Moreover, let no primate or metropolitan invade the church or parish of a diocesan (dioecesani), or presume to excommunicate or judge any one belonging to his parish, or do anything without his counsel or judgment; but let him observe this law, which has been laid down by the apostles[fn-89-P8995_2917829:5-nf] and fathers, and our predecessors, and has been ratified by us: to wit, that if any metropolitan bishop, except in that which pertains to his own proper parish alone, shall attempt to do anything without the counsel and good-will of all the comprovincial bishops, he will do it at the risk of his position, and what he does in this manner shall be held null and void; but whatever it may be necessary to do or to arrange with regard to the cases of the body of provincial bishops, and the necessities of their churches and clergy and laity, this should be done by consent of all the pontiffs of the same province, and that too without any pride of lordship, but with the most humble and harmonious action, even as the Lord says: \"I came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.\"[fn-89-P8996_2918652:6-nf] And in another passage He says: \"And whosoever of you is the greater, shall be your servant,\"[fn-89-P8997_2918763:7-nf] and so forth. And in like manner the bishops of the same province themselves should do all things in counsel with him, except so much as pertains to their own proper parishes, in accordance with the statutes of the holy fathers (who, although they have preceded us by a certain interval of time, have yet drawn the light of truth and faith from one and the same fountain of purity, and have sought the prosperity of the Church of God and the common advantage of all Christians by the same enlightening and guiding Spirit), that with one mind, and one mouth, and one accord, the Holy Trinity may be glorified for ever. No primate, no metropolitan, nor any of the other bishops, is at liberty to enter the seat of another, or to occupy a possession which does not pertain to him, and which forms part of the parish of another bishop, at the direction of any one, unless he is invited by him to whose jurisdiction it is acknowledged to belong; nor can he set about any arrangement or ordinance, or judgment there, if he wishes to keep the honour of his station. But if he presume to do otherwise, he shall be condemned; and not only he, but those who co-operate and agree with him: for just as the power of making appointments (ordinatio) is interdicted in such circumstances, so also is the power of judging or of disposing of other matters. For if a man has no power to appoint, how shall he judge? Without doubt, he shall in no wise judge or have power to judge: for just as another man's wife cannot intermarry with anyone (adulterari), nor be judged or disposed of by any one but by her own husband so long as he liveth; so neither can it in anywise be allowed that the wife of a bishop, by whom undoubtedly is meant his church or parish, should be judged or disposed of by another without his (the bishop's) judgment and good-will so long as he liveth, or enjoy another's embrace, that is, his ordaining. Wherefore the apostle says: \"The wife is bound by the law so long as her husband liveth; but if he be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.\"[fn-89-P8998_2920839:8-nf] In like manner also, the spouse of a bishop (for the church is called his spouse and wife) is bound to him while he liveth; but when he is dead she is loosed, and may be wedded to whomsoever she will, only in the Lord, that is, according to order. For if, while he is alive, she marry another, she shall be judged to be an adulteress. And in the same manner, he too, if he marry another of his own will, shall be held to be an adulterer, and shall be deprived of the privilege of communion. If, however, he is persecuted in his own church, he must flee to another, and attach himself to it, as the Lord says: \"If they persecute you in one city, flee ye into another.\"[fn-89-P8999_2921523:9-nf] If, however, the change be made for the sake of the good of the church, he may not do this of himself, but only on the invitation of the brethren, and with the sanction of this holy seat, and not for ambition's sake, but for the public good.","title":"The Second Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":22,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_27_introduction_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"[I.] I, Peregrinus,[fn-14-P1453_636696:2-nf] who am the least of all the servants of God, remembering the admonition of Scripture, \"Ask thy fathers and they will tell thee, thine elders and they will declare unto thee,\"[fn-14-P1454_637336:3-nf] and again, \"Bow down thine ear to the words of the wise,\"[fn-14-P1455_637413:4-nf] and once more, \"My son, forget not these instructions, but let thy heart keep my words:\"[fn-14-P1456_637521:5-nf] remembering these admonitions, I say, I, Peregrinus, am persuaded, that, the Lord helping me, it will be of no little use and certainly as regards my own feeble powers, it is most necessary, that I should put down in writing the things which I have truthfully received from the holy Fathers, since I shall then have ready at hand wherewith by constant reading to make amends for the weakness of my memory.","title":"Introduction.","author":"Vincent of Lerins"},{"chapter":22,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_27_introduction_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"170","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"[51.] Such being the case, when I think over these things, and revolve them in my mind again and again, I cannot sufficiently wonder at the madness of certain men, at the impiety of their blinded understanding, at their lust of error, such that, not content with the rule of faith delivered once for all, and received from the times of old, they are every day seeking one novelty after another, and are constantly longing to add, change, take away, in religion, as though the doctrine, \"Let what has once for all been revealed suffice,\" were not a heavenly but an earthly rule,-a rule which could not be complied with except by continual emendation, nay, rather by continual fault-finding; whereas the divine Oracles cry aloud, \"Remove not the landmarks, which thy fathers have set,\"[fn-16-P1653_725078:74-nf] and \"Go not to law with a Judge,''[fn-16-P1654_725134:75-nf] and \"Whoso breaketh through a fence a serpent shall bite him,\"[fn-16-P1655_725219:76-nf] and that saying of the Apostle where- with, as with a spiritual sword, all the wicked novelties of all heresies often have been, and will always have to be, decapitated, \"O Timothy, keep the deposit, shunning profane novelties of words and oppositions of the knowledge falsely so called, which some professing have erred concerning the faith.\"[fn-16-P1656_725583:77-nf] ","title":"Introduction.","author":"Vincent of Lerins"},{"chapter":22,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"100","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"96.

Whence also Solomon when he had summed up the manifold grace of the Church, added: \"for all who are with her are clothed with double garments.\"[fn-54-P5478_1960098:8-nf] But of spiritual knowledge there are three kinds, tropological, allegorical, anagogical,[fn-54-P5479_1960213:9-nf] of which we read as follows in Proverbs: \"But do you describe these things to yourself in three ways according to the largeness of your heart.\"[fn-54-P5480_1961149:10-nf] And so the history embraces the knowledge of things past and visible, as it is repeated in this way by the Apostle: \"For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondwoman, the other by a free: but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh, but he who was of the free was by promise.\" But to the allegory belongs what follows, for what actually happened is said to have prefigured the form of some mystery \"For these,\" says he, \"are the two covenants the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth into bondage, which is Agar. For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia, which is compared to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.\" But the anagogical sense rises from spiritual mysteries even to still more sublime and sacred secrets of heaven, and is subjoined by the Apostle in these words: \"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not, break forth and cry, thou that travailest not, for many are the children of the desolate more than of her that hath an husband.\"[fn-54-P5481_1962255:11-nf] The tropological sense is the moral explanation which has to do with improvement of life and practical teaching, as if we were to understand by these two covenants practical and theoretical instruction, or at any rate as if we were to want to take Jerusalem or Sion as the soul of man, according to this: \"Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.\"[fn-54-P5482_1962637:12-nf] And so these four previously mentioned figures coalesce, if we desire, in one subject, so that one and the same Jerusalem can be taken in four senses: historically as the city of the Jews; allegorically as Church of Christ, anagogically as the heavenly city of God \"which is the mother of us all,\" tropologically, as the soul of man, which is frequently subject to praise or blame from the Lord under this title. Of these four kinds of interpretation the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: \"But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophecy or by doctrine?\"[fn-54-P5483_1963322:13-nf] For \"revelation\" belongs to allegory whereby what is concealed under the historical narrative is revealed in its spiritual sense and interpretation, as for instance if we tried to expound how \"all our fathers were under the cloud and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea,\" and how they \"all ate the same spiritual meat and drank the same spiritual drink from the rock that followed them. But the rock was Christ.\"[fn-54-P5484_1963776:14-nf] And this explanation where there is a comparison of the figure of the body and blood of Christ which we receive daily, contains the allegorical sense.

For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not, break forth and cry, thou that travailest not, for many are the children of the desolate more than of her that hath an husband.\"[fn-54-P5481_1962255:11-nf] The tropological sense is the moral explanation which has to do with improvement of life and practical teaching, as if we were to understand by these two covenants practical and theoretical instruction, or at any rate as if we were to want to take Jerusalem or Sion as the soul of man, according to this: \"Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem: praise thy God, O Sion.\"[fn-54-P5482_1962637:12-nf] And so these four previously mentioned figures coalesce, if we desire, in one subject, so that one and the same Jerusalem can be taken in four senses: historically as the city of the Jews; allegorically as Church of Christ, anagogically as the heavenly city of God \"which is the mother of us all,\" tropologically, as the soul of man, which is frequently subject to praise or blame from the Lord under this title.

And as the devil holds our soul fast in the toils of these, what remains but that, when he wants to sever us from spiritual delights, he should vex us by diminishing these and depriving us of them, contriving by his crafty wiles that when the sweetness of His yoke and lightness of His burden have become grievous to us through the evil of a corrupt desire, and when we are caught in the chains of that very property and substance, which we kept for our comfort and solace, he may always torment us with the scourges of worldly cares, extorting from us ourselves that wherewith we are tortured?For \"Each one is bound by the cords of his own sins,\" and hears from the prophet: \"Behold all you that kindle a fire, encompassed with flames, walk in the light of your fire, and in the flames which you have kindled.\" Since, as Solomon is witness, \"Each man shall thereby be punished, whereby he has sinned.\"[fn-68-P6810_2437306:43-nf] For the very pleasures which we enjoy become a torment to us, and the delights and enjoyments of this flesh, turn like executioners upon their originator, because one who is supported by his former wealth and property is sure not to admit perfect humility of heart, not entire mortification of dangerous pleasures. But where all these implements of goodness give their aid, there all the trials of this present life, and whatever losses the enemy can contrive, are endured not only with the utmost patience, but with real pleasure, and again when they are wanting so dangerous a pride springs up that we are actually wounded by the deadly strokes of impatience at the slightest reproach, and it may be said to us by the prophet Jeremiah: \"And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the troubled water?And what hast thou to do with the way of the Assyrians, to drink the water of the river? Thy own wickedness shall reprove thee, and thy apostasy shall rebuke thee. Know thou and see that it is an evil and a bitter thing for thee to have left the Lord thy God, and that My fear is not with thee, saith the Lord.\"[fn-68-P6811_2438459:44-nf] How then is it that the wondrous sweetness of the Lord's yoke is felt to be bitter, but because the bitterness of our dislike injures it? How is it that the exceeding lightness of the Divine burden becomes heavy, but because in our obstinate presumption we despise Him by whom it was borne, especially as Scripture itself plainly testifies to this very thing saying: \"For if they would walk in right paths, theywould certainly have found the paths of righteousness smooth\"?[fn-68-P6812_2438977:45-nf] It is plain, I say, that itis we, who make rough with the nasty and hardstones of our desires the right and smooth paths of the Lord; who most foolishly forsake the royal road made stony with the flints of apostles and prophets, and trodden down by the footsteps of all the saints and of the Lord Himself, and seek trackless and thorny places, and, blinded by the allurements of present delights, tear our way with torn legs and our wedding garment rent, through dark paths, overrun withthe briars of sins, so as not only to be pierced by the sharp thorns of the brambles but actually laid low by the bites of deadly serpents and scorpions lurking there. For \"there are thorns and thistles in wrong ways, but he that feareth the Lord shall keep himself from them.\"[fn-68-P6813_2439764:46-nf] Of such also the Lord says elsewhere by the prophet: \"My people have forgotten, sacrificing in vain, and stumbling in their ways, in ancient paths, to walk in them in a way not trodden.\"[fn-68-P6814_2439970:47-nf] For according to Solomon's saying: \"The ways of those who do not work are strewn with thorns, but the ways of the lusty are trodden down.\"[fn-68-P6815_2440129:48-nf] And thus wandering from the king's highway, they can never arrive at that metropolis, whither our course should ever be directed without swerving.

And so the prophet Isaiah says: \"Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is interpreted God with us.\"[fn-69-P6932_2495653:12-nf] What room is there here for doubt, you incredulous person?[fn-69-P6933_2495763:13-nf] The prophet said that a virgin should conceive: a virgin has conceived: that a Son should be born: a Son has been born: that He Should be called God: He is called God. For He is called by that name as being of that nature. Therefore when the Spirit of God said that He should be called God, He proved that He is without the Spirit of God who makes himself a stranger to all fellowship with the Divine title. \"Behold then,\" he says, \"a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is interpreted God with us.\" But here is a point on which it is possible that your shuffling incredulity may fasten; viz., by saying that this which the prophet declared He should be called referred not to the glory of His Divinity, but to the name by which He should be addressed. But what are we to do because Christ is never spoken of by this name in the gospels, though the Spirit of God cannot be said to have spoken falsely through the prophet? How is it then? Surely that we should understand that that prophecy then foretold the name of His Divine nature and not of His humanity. For since in His manhood united to the Godhead[fn-69-P6934_2497436:14-nf] He received another name in the gospel, it is certainly clear that this name belonged to His humanity, that to His Divinity. But let us proceed further and summon other true witnesses to establish the truth: For where we are speaking about the Godhead, the Divinity cannot be better established than by His own witnesses. So then the same prophet says elsewhere: \"For unto us a Son is born: unto us a child is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called the angel of great counsel, God the mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of peace.\"[fn-69-P6935_2498968:15-nf] Just as above the prophet had expressly said that He should be called Emmanuel, so here he says that He should be called \"the angel of great counsel, and God the mighty, and the Father of the world to come and the prince of peace\" (although we certainly never read that He was called by these names in the gospel): of course that we may understand that these are not terms belonging to His human, but to His Divine nature; and that the name used in the gospel belonged to the manhood which He took upon Him,[fn-69-P6936_2499625:16-nf] and this one to His innate power. And because God was to be born in human form, these names were so distributed in the sacred economy, that to the manhood a human name was given and to the Divinity a Divine one. Therefore he says: \"He shall be cat led the angel of great counsel, God the mighty, the Father of the world to come, the prince of peace.\" Not, O heretic, whoever you may be, not that here the prophet, full as he was of the Holy Spirit, followed your example and compared Him who was born to a molten image and a figure fashioned without sense.[fn-69-P6937_2500275:17-nf] For \"a Son,\" he says, \"is born to us, a Child is given to us; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and His name shall be called the angel of great counsel, God the mighty.\"And that you may not imagine Him whom He announced as God[fn-69-P6938_2500552:18-nf] to be other than Him who was born in the flesh, he adds a term referring to His birth, saying: \"A child is born to us: a son is given to us.\" Do you see how many titles the prophet used to make clear the reality of His birth in the body? for he called Him both Son and child on purpose that the manner of the child which was born might be more clearly shown by a name referring to His infancy; and the Holy Spirit foreseeing without doubt this perversity of blasphemous heretics, showed to the whole world that it was God who was born, by the very terms and words used; that even if a heretic was determined to utter blashemy, he might not find any loophole for his blasphemy. Therefore he says: \"A Son is born to us; a child is given to us; and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called the angel of great counsel, God the mighty, the Father of the world to come, the prince of peace.\" He teaches that this child which was born is both prince of peace and Father of the world to come and God the mighty. What room is there then for shuffling? This child which is born cannot be severed from God who is born in Him, for he called Him, whom he spoke of as born, Father of the world to come; Him whom he called a child, he foretold as God the mighty. What is it, O heretic? Whither will you betake yourself? Every place is hedged and shut in: there is no possibility of getting out of it. There is nothing for it but that you should at length be obliged to confess the mistake which you would not understand. But not content with these passages which are indeed enough let us inquire what the Holy Ghost said through another prophet. \"Shall a man,\" says he, \"pierce his God, for you are piercing me?\"[fn-69-P6939_2502753:19-nf] In order that the subject of the prophecy might be still clearer the prophet foretells what he proclaimed of the Lord's passion as if from the mouth of Him of whom he was speaking. \"Shall a man pierce his God, for you are piercing me?\" Does not our Lord God, I ask, seem to have said this when He was led to the Cross? Why indeed do you not acknowledge Me as your Redeemer? Why are ye ignorant of God clothed in flesh for you? Are you preparing death for your Saviour? Are yon leading forth to death the Author of life? I am your God whom ye are lifting up: your God whom ye are crucifying. What mistake, I ask, is here or what madness is it? \"Shall a man pierce his God, for you are piercing me?\" Do you see how exactly the words describe what was actually done? Could you ask for anything more express or clearer? Do you see how sacred testimonies follow our Incarnate Lord Jesus Christ from the very cradle to the Cross which He bore, as here you can see that He whom elsewhere you read of as God when born in the flesh was God when pierced on the cross? And so there, where His birth was treated of, He is spoken of by the prophet as God: and here where His crucifixion is concerned, He is most clearly named God; that the taking upon Him of manhood might not in any point prejudice dignity of His Divinity, nor the humiliation of His body and the shame of the passion affect the glory of His majesty; for His condescension to so lowly a birth and His generous goodness in enduring his passion ought to increase our love and devotion to Him; since it is certainly a great and monstrous sin if, the more He lavishes love upon us, the less He is honoured by us.","title":"Book II.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":22,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_69_to_the_bishops_of_africa","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"The letters are sufficient which were written by our beloved fellow-minister Damasus, bishop of the Great Rome, and the large number of bishops who assembled along with him; and equally so are those of the other synods which were held, both in Gaul and in Italy, concerning the sound Faith which Christ gave us, the Apostles preached, and the Fathers, who met at Nicaea from all this world of ours, have handed down. For so great a stir was made at that time about the Arian heresy, in order that they who had fallen into it might be reclaimed, while its inventors might be made manifest. To that council, accordingly, the whole world has long ago agreed, and now, many synods having been held, all men have been put in mind, both in Dalmatia and Dardania, Macedonia, Epirus and Greece, Crete, and the other islands, Sicily, Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycia, and Isauria, all Egypt and the Libyas, and most of the Arabians have come to know it, and marvelled at those who signed it, inasmuch as even if there were left among them any bitterness springing up from the root of the Arians; we mean Auxentius, Ursacius, Valens and their fellows, by these letters they have been cut off and isolated. The confession arrived at at Nicaea was, we say once more, sufficient and enough by itself, for the subversion of all irreligious heresy, and for the security and furtherance of the doctrine of the Church. But since we have heard that certain wishing to oppose it are attempting to cite a synod supposed to have been held at Ariminum, and are eagerly striving that it should prevail rather than the other, we think it right to write and put you in mind, not to endure anything of the sort: for this is nothing else but a second growth of the Arian heresy. For what else do they wish for who reject the synod held against it, namely the Nicene, if not that the cause of Arius should prevail? What then do such men deserve, but to be called Arians, and to share the punishment of the Arians? For they were not afraid of God, who says, `Remove not the eternal boundaries which thy fathers placed[fn-78-P7828_3139255:1-nf] ,' and `He that speaketh against father or mother, let him die the death[fn-78-P7829_3139347:2-nf] :' they were not in awe of their fathers, who enjoined that they who hold the opposite of their confession should be anathema.","title":"To the Bishops of Africa","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":22,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-06","text":"40. I wish you to know, most pious father, that in these days there has arrived in our parts a certain person named Manes, who gives out that he is to complete the doctrine of the New Testament. And in the statements which he has made there have been some things, indeed, which may harmonize with our faith; but there have been also certain affirmations of his which seem very far removed from what has come down to us by the tradition of our fathers. For he has interpreted some doctrines in a strange fashion, imposing on them certain notions of his own, which have appeared to me to be altogether foreign and opposed to the faith. On the ground of these facts I have now been induced to write this letter to you, knowing the completeness and fulness of your intelligence in doctrine, and being assured that none of these things can escape your cognizance. Accordingly, I have also indulged the confident hope that you cannot be kept back by any grudge[fn-36-P3692_1033765:413-nf] from explaining these matters to us. As to myself, indeed, it is not possible that I shall be drawn away into any novel doctrine; nevertheless, in behalf of all the less instructed, I have been led to ask a word with your authority. For, in truth, the man shows himself to be a person of extraordinary force of character, both in speech and in action; and indeed his very aspect and attire also bear that out. But I shall here write down for your information some few points which I have been able to retain in my memory out of all the topics which have been expounded by him: for I know that even by these few you will have an idea of the rest. You well understand, no doubt, that those who seek to set up any new dogma have the habit of very readily perverting into a conformity with their own notions any proofs they desire to take from the Scriptures.[fn-36-P3693_1034637:414-nf] In anticipation, however, of this, the apostolic word marks out the case thus: \"If any one preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3694_1034870:415-nf] And consequently, in addition to what has been once committed to us by the apostles, a disciple of Christ ought to receive nothing new as doctrine.[fn-36-P3695_1035037:416-nf] But not to make what I have got to say too long, I return to the subject directly in view. This man then maintained that the law of Moses, to speak shortly, does not proceed from the good God, but from the prince of evil; and that it has no kinship with the new law of Christ, but is contrary and hostile to it, the one being the direct antagonist of the other. When I heard such a sentiment propounded, I repeated to the people that sentence of the Gospel in which our Lord Jesus Christ said of Himself: \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.\"[fn-36-P3696_1035912:417-nf] The man, however, averred that He did not utter this saying at all; for he held that when we find that He did abrogate[fn-36-P3697_1036051:418-nf] that same law, we are bound to give heed, above all other considerations, to the thing which He actually did. Then he began to cite a great variety of passages from the law, and also many from the Gospel and from the Apostle Paul, which have the appearance of contradicting each other. All this he gave forth at the same time with perfect confidence, and without any hesitation or fear; so that I verily believe he has that serpent as his helper, who is ever our adversary. Well, he declared that there in the law God said, \"I make the rich man and the poor man; \"[fn-36-P3698_1036635:419-nf] while here in the Gospel Jesus called the poor blessed,[fn-36-P3699_1036713:420-nf] and added, that no man could be His disciple unless he gave up all that he had.[fn-37-P3700_1036812:421-nf] Again, he maintained that there Moses took silver and gold from the Egyptians when the people[fn-37-P3701_1036927:422-nf] fled out of Egypt;[fn-37-P3702_1037005:423-nf] whereas Jesus delivered the precept that we should lust after nothing belonging to our neighbour. Then he affirmed that Moses had provided in the law, that an eye should be given in penalty for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;[fn-37-P3703_1037252:424-nf] but that our Lord bade us offer the other cheek also to him who smote the one.[fn-37-P3704_1037351:425-nf] He told us, too, that there Moses commanded the man to be punished and stoned who did any work on the Sabbath, and who failed to continue in all things that were written in the law,[fn-37-P3705_1037553:426-nf] as in fact was done to that person who, yet being ignorant, had gathered a bundle of sticks on the Sabbath-day; whereas Jesus cured a cripple on the Sabbath, and ordered him then also to take up his bed.[fn-37-P3706_1037777:427-nf] And further, He did not restrain His disciples from plucking the ears of corn and rubbing them with their hands on the Sabbath-day,[fn-37-P3707_1037929:428-nf] which yet was a thing which it was unlawful to do on the Sabbaths. And why should I mention other instances? For with many different assertions of a similar nature these dogmas of his were propounded with the utmost energy and the most fervid zeal. Thus, too, on the authority of an apostle, he endeavoured to establish the position that the law of Moses is the law of death, and that the law of Jesus, on the contrary, is the law of life. For he based that assertion on the passage which runs thus: \"In which also may God make us[fn-37-P3708_1038479:429-nf] able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life. But if the ministration of death, engraven in letters on the stones,[fn-37-P3709_1038695:430-nf] was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which shall be done away is glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.\"[fn-37-P3710_1039283:431-nf] And this passage, as you are also well aware, occurs in the second Epistle to the Corinthians. Besides, he added to this another passage out of the first epistle, on which he based his affirmation that the disciples of the Old Testament were earthly and natural; and in accordance with this, that flesh and blood could not possess the kingdom of God.[fn-37-P3711_1039659:432-nf] He also maintained that Paul himself spoke in his own proper person when he said: \"If I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.\"[fn-37-P3712_1039845:433-nf] Further, he averred that the same apostle made this statement most obviously on the subject of the resurrection of the flesh. when he also said that \"he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh,\"[fn-37-P3713_1040114:434-nf] and that according to the letter the law has in it no advantage.[fn-37-P3714_1040199:435-nf] And again he adduced the statement, that \"Abraham has glory, but not before God; \"[fn-37-P3715_1040301:436-nf] and that \"by the law there comes only the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-37-P3716_1040381:437-nf] And many other things did he introduce, with the view of detracting from the honour of the law, on the ground that the law itself is sin; by which statements the simpler people were somewhat influenced, as he continued to bring them forward; and in accordance with all this, he also made use of the affirmation, that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-37-P3717_1040764:438-nf] He declared, however, that John preached the true kingdom of heaven; for verily he held, that by the cutting off of his head it was signified that all who went before him, and who had precedence over him, were to be cut off, and that what was to come after him was alone to be maintained. With reference to all these things, therefore, O most pious Archelaus, send us back a short reply in writing: for I have heard that you have studied such matters in no ordinary degree; and that capacity which you possess is God's gift, inasmuch as God bestows these gifts upon those who are worthy of them, and who are His friends, and who show themselves allied to Him in community of purpose and life. For it is our part to prepare ourselves, and to approach the gracious and liberal mind,[fn-37-P3718_1041566:439-nf] and forthwith we receive from it the most bountiful gifts. Accordingly, since the learning which I possess for the discussion of themes like these does not meet the requirements of my desire and purpose, for I confess myself to he an unlearned man, I have sent to you, as I have already said more than once, in the hope of obtaining from your hand the amplest solution to this question. May it be well with you, incomparable and honourable father!","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":22,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"ANF-06","text":"42. But I shall also offer, to the best of my ability, some expositions of the other words referred to; that is to say, I shall show that Jesus neither said nor did aught that was contrary to Moses. And first, as to the word, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-37-P3743_1051433:461-nf] -that is the expression of justice. And as to His injunction, that a man, when struck on the one cheek, should offer the other also, that is the expression of goodness. Well, then, are justice and goodness opposed to each other? Far from it! There has only been an advance from simple justice to positive goodness. And again, we have the saying, \"The workman is worthy of his hire.\"[fn-37-P3744_1051836:462-nf] But if a person seeks to practise any fraud therein, it is surely most just[fn-37-P3745_1051932:463-nf] that what he has got possession of by fraud should be required of him, most especially when the hire is large. Now this I say, that when the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel by the taskmasters who were set over them in the process of making bricks, Moses required and exacted the whole at once, with penalties, within one moment of time. But is this, then, to be called iniquity? Far from it! Surely it is the abstinence [fn-37-P3746_1052606:464-nf] of goodness, indeed, when one makes but a moderate use of what is really necessary, and gives up all that goes beyond that. Let us look, again, at the fact that in the Old Testament we find the words, \"I make the rich man and the poor man,\"[fn-37-P3747_1052946:465-nf] whereas Jesus calls the poor blessed.[fn-37-P3748_1053006:466-nf] Well, in that saying Jesus did; not refer to those who are poor simply in worldly substance, but to those who are poor in spirit, that is to say, who are not inflamed[fn-37-P3749_1053192:467-nf] with pride, but have the gentle and lowly dispositions of humility, not thinking of themselves more than they ought to think.[fn-37-P3750_1053388:468-nf] This question, however, is one which our adversary has not propounded correctly. For here I perceive that Jesus also looks on willingly at the gifts of the rich men, when they are put into the treasury.[fn-37-P3751_1053611:469-nf] All too little, at the same time, is it[fn-37-P3752_1053672:470-nf] if gifts are cast into[fn-37-P3753_1053895:471-nf] the treasury by the rich alone; and so there are the two mites of the poor widow which are also received with gladness; and in that offering verily something is exhibited that goes beyond what Moses prescribed on the subject of the receipt of moneys. For he received gifts from those who had; but Jesus receives them even from those who have not. But this man says, further, that it is written, that \"except a man shall forsake all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.\"[fn-37-P3754_1054456:472-nf] Wall, I observe again, that the centurion, a man exceedingly wealthy and well dowered with worldly influence, possessed a faith surpassing that of all Israel;[fn-37-P3755_1054636:473-nf] so that, even if there was any one who had forsaken all, that man was surpassed in faith by this centurion. But some one may now reason with us thus: It is not a good thing, consequently, to give up riches. Well, I reply that it is a good thing for those who are capable of it; but, at the, same time, to employ[fn-37-P3756_1054971:474-nf] riches for the work of righteousness and mercy, is a thing as acceptable as though one were to give up the whole at once. Again, as to the assertion that the Sabbath has been abolished, we deny that He has abolished it plainly;[fn-37-P3757_1055410:475-nf] for He was Himself also Lord of the Sabbath.[fn-37-P3758_1055469:476-nf] And this, the law's relation to the Sabbath, was like the servant who has charge of the bridegroom's chamber, and who prepares the same with all carefulness, and does not suffer it to be disturbed or touched by any stranger, but keeps it intact against the time of the bridegroom's arrival; so that when he is come, the same may be used as it pleases himself, or as it is granted to those to use it whom he has bidden enter along with him. And the Lord Jesus Christ Himself gave His testimony to what we affirm, when He said with His heavenly voice, \"Can ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast so long as the bridegroom is with them? \"[fn-37-P3759_1056134:477-nf] And again, He did not actually reject circumcision; but we should rather say that He received in Himself and in our stead the cause of circumcision,[fn-37-P3760_1056364:478-nf] relieving us by what He Himself endured, and not permitting us to have to suffer any pain to no purpose.[fn-37-P3761_1056521:479-nf] For what, indeed, can it profit a man to circumcise himself, if nevertheless he cherishes the worst of thoughts against his neighbour? He desired, accordingly, rather to open up to us the ways of the fullest life by a brief path,[fn-37-P3762_1056873:480-nf] lest perchance, after we had traversed lengthened courses of our own, we should find our day prematurely closing upon us in night, and lest, while outwardly indeed we might appear splendid to men's view, we should inwardly he comparable only to ravening wolves,[fn-37-P3763_1057292:481-nf] or be likened to whited sepulchres.[fn-37-P3764_1057350:482-nf] For far above any person of that type of character is to be placed the man who, although clad only in squalid and threadbare attire, keeps no evil hidden in his heart against his neighbour. For it is only the circumcision of the heart that brings salvation; and that merely carnal circumcision can be of no advantage to men, unless they happen also to he fortified with the spiritual circumcision. Listen also to what Scripture has to say on this subject: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God? \"[fn-37-P3765_1057888:483-nf] What need, therefore, is there for me to labour and suffer, seeing that I have been made acquainted with the compendious way of life,[fn-37-P3766_1058041:484-nf] and know that it shall he mine if only I can be pure in heart? And that is quite in accordance with the truth which we have learned now, to wit, that if one prevails in the keeping of the two commandments, he fulfils the whole law and the prophets.[fn-37-P3767_1058313:485-nf] Moreover Paul, the chief of the apostles, after all these sayings, gives us yet clearer instruction on the subject, when be says, \"Or seek yea proof of that Christ who speaketh in me? \"[fn-37-P3768_1058522:486-nf] What have I then to do with circumcision, seeing that I may be justified in uncircumcision? For it is written: \"Is any man circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Or is any in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. For neither of these is anything, but only the keeping of the commandments of God.\"[fn-37-P3769_1058856:487-nf] Consequently, as circumcision is incompetent to save any, it is not greatly to be required, especially when we see that if a man has been called in uncircumcision, and wishes then to be circumcised, he is made forthwith a transgressor[fn-37-P3770_1059118:488-nf] of the law. For if I am circumcised, I also fulfil the commandments of the law with the view of being in a position to be saved; but if I am uncircumcised, and remain in uncircumcision, much more in keeping the commandments shall I have life. For I have received the circumcision of the heart, in the spirit, and not that of the letter in the mere ink,[fn-37-P3771_1059591:489-nf] in which former there is praise, not of men, but of God.[fn-37-P3772_1059667:490-nf] Wherefore let no charge of this kind be brought against me. For just as the man of wealth, who possesses great treasures of gold and silver, so that he gets everything which is necessary for the uses of his house made of these precious metals, has no need to display any vessel of earthen-ware in anything belonging to his family and yet it does follow from this circumstance that the productions of the potter, or the art of making vessels of pottery,[fn-37-P3773_1060140:491-nf] are to be held in abhor-fence by him; so also I, who have been made rich by the grace of God, and who have obtained the circumcision of the heart, cannot by any means[fn-37-P3774_1060481:492-nf] stand in need of that most profitless fleshly circumcision, and yet, for all that, it does not follow that I should call it evil. Far be it from me to do so! If, however, any one desires to receive still more exact instruction on these matters, he will find them discussed with the greatest fulness in the apostle's first epistle.[fn-37-P3775_1060860:493-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"}]
