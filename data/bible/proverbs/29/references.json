Likewise, touching that which is written, \"A son which receiveth the word shall be far from destruction: but receiving, he receiveth it for himself, and no falsehood proceedeth out of his mouth:\"[fn-43-P4353_2098377:64-nf] some one may say, that what is here set down, \"A son which receiveth the word,\" is to be taken for no other than the word of God, which is truth. Therefore, \"A son receiving the truth shall be far from destruction,\" refers to that which is written, \"Thou wilt destroy all that speak leasing.\" But when it follows, \"Receiving he receiveth for himself,\" what other doth this insinuate than what the Apostle saith, \"But let every man prove his own work, and then he shah have glorying in himself and not in another?\"[fn-43-P4354_2099153:65-nf] For he that receiveth the word, that is, truth, not for himself, but for men-pleasing, keepeth it not when he sees they can be pleased by a lie. But whoso receiveth it for himself, no falsehood proceedeth out of his mouth: because even when the way to please men is to lie, that man lieth not, who receiving the truth not thereby to please them but to please God, hath received it for himself. Therefore there is no reason why it should be said here He will destroy all who speak leasing, but not all leasing: because all lies, universally, are cut off in this saying, \"And no falsehood proceedeth out of his mouth.\" But another saith, it is to be so taken as the Apostle Paul took our Lord's saying, \"But I say unto you, Swear not at all.\"[fn-43-P4355_2099911:66-nf] For here also all swearing is cut off; but from the mouth of the heart, that it should never be done with approbation of the will, but through necessity of the weakness of another; that is, \"from the evil\" of another, when it shows that he cannot otherwise be got to believe what is said, unless faith be wrought by an oath; or, from that \"evil\" of our own, that while as yet involved in the skins of this mortality we are not able to show our heart: which thing were we able to do, of swearing there were no need. Though moreover in this whole sentence, if the saying, \"A son receiving the word shall be far from destruction,\" be said of none other than that Truth,[fn-43-P4356_2100596:67-nf] by Whom all things were made, which remaineth ever incommutable; then, because the doctrine of Religion strives to bring men to the contemplation of this Truth, it may seem that the saying, \"And no falsehood proceedeth out of his mouth,\" is said to this purpose, that he speaketh no falsehood thai pertaineth to doctrine. Which sort of lie is upon no compensation whatever to be gone into, and is utterly and before all to be eschewed. Or if the saying, \"No falsehood,\" is absurdly taken if it be not referred to every lie, the saying, \"From his mouth,\" should, as was argued above, be taken to mean the mouth of the heart, in the opinion of him who accounts that sometimes one may tell a lie.","title":"On Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":29,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_36_against_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"33. It remains then that we understand as concerning those women, whether in Egypt or in Jericho, that for their humanity and mercy they received a reward, in any wise temporal, which indeed itself, while they wist not of it, should by prophetical signification prefigure somewhat eternal. But whether it be ever right, even for the saving of a man's life, to tell a lie, as it is a question in resolving which even the most learned do weary themselves, it did vastly surpass the capacity of those poor women, set in the midst of those nations, and accustomed to those manners. Therefore their ignorance in this as well as in those other things of which they were alike unknowing, but which are to be known by the children not of this world but of that which is to come, the patience of God did bear withal: Who yet, for their human kindness which they had shown to His servants, rendered unto them rewards of an earthly sort, albeit signifying somewhat of an heavenly. And Rahab, indeed, delivered out of Jericho, made transition into the people of God, where, being proficient, she might attain to eternal and immortal prizes which are not to be sought by any lie. Yet at that time when she did for the Israelite spies that good, and, for her condition of life, laudable work, she was not as yet such that it should be required of her, \"In your mouth let Yea be yea, Nay nay.\"[fn-44-P4482_2194768:66-nf] But as for those midwives, albeit Hebrewesses, if they savored only after the flesh, what or how great is the good they got of their temporal reward in that they made them houses, unless by making proficiency they attained unto that house of which is sung unto God, \"Blessed are they that dwell in thine house; for ever and ever they will praise thee?\"[fn-44-P4483_2195139:67-nf] It must be confessed, however, that it approacheth much unto righteousness, and though not yet in reality, even now in respect of hopefulness and disposition that mind is to be praised, which never lies except with intention and will to do good to some man, but to hurt no man. But as for us, when we ask whether it be the part of a good man sometimes to lie, we ask not concerning a person pertaining to Egypt, or to Jericho, or to Babylon, or still to Jerusalem itself, the earthly, which is in bondage with her children;[fn-44-P4484_2195683:68-nf] but concerning a citizen of that city which is above and free, our mother, eternal in the heavens. And to our asking it is answered, \"No lie is of the truth.\"[fn-44-P4485_2195864:69-nf] The sons of that city, are sons of the Truth. That city's sons are they of whom it is written,\"In their mouth was found no lie:\"[fn-44-P4486_2196013:70-nf] son of that city is he of whom is also written, \"A son receiving the word shall be far from destruction: but receiving, he hath received that for himself, and nothing false proceedeth out of his mouth.\"[fn-44-P4487_2196234:71-nf] These sons of Jerusalem on high, and of the holy city eternal, if ever, as they be men, a lie of what kind soever doth worm itself into them, they ask humbly for pardon, not therefrom seek moreover glory.","title":"Against Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":29,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_36_against_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"40. But sometimes a peril to eternal salvation itself is put forth against us;[fn-45-P4507_2211241:84-nf] which peril, they cry out, we by telling a lie, if otherwise if cannot be, must ward off. As, for instance, if a person who is to be baptized be in the power of impious and infidel men, and cannot be got at that he may be washed with the layer of regeneration, but by deceiving his keepers with a lie. From this most invidious cry, by which we are compelled, not for a man's wealth or honors in this world which are fleeting by, not for the life itself of this present time, but for the eternal salvation of a human being, to tell a lie, whither shall I betake me for refuge but unto thee, O truth? And by thee is put forth before me,[fn-45-P4508_2211893:85-nf] Chastity. For why, if those keepers may be enticed to admit us to baptize the man, by our committing lewdness, do we refuse to do things contrary to chastity, and yet, if by a lie they may be deceived, consent to do things contrary to truth? when without doubt no man would faithfully think chastity amiable, but because it is enjoined of truth? So then, to get at a man to baptize him, let the keepers be deceived by lying, if truth bid it. But how can truth bid in order that a man may be baptized, that we should tell a lie, if chastity biddeth not, in order that a man be baptized, that we should commit whoredom? Now why doth chastity not bid this, but because this truth teacheth not? If then, save what truth teacheth, we ought not to do, when truth teacheth not even for the sake of baptizing a man to do what is contrary to chastity, how shall she teach us to do for the sake of baptizing a man what is contrary to herself, the truth? But like as eyes not strong enough to look upon the sun yet do gladly look upon the objects which are by the sun enlightened, so, souls which have already strength to delight in the beauty of chastity are yet not straightway able to consider in her very self that truth whence charity hath her light, insomuch that when it cometh to the doing of somewhat that is adverse to truth, they should so start back in horror as they do start back in horror if aught be proposed to be done that is adverse to chastity. But that son, who, receiving the word shall be far from perdition, and nothing false cometh forth of his mouth,[fn-45-P4509_2213478:86-nf] accounts it as much debarred from him if, to the succoring of his fellow man he be urged to pass through a lie, as if it were through the deed of lewdness. And the Father heareth and granteth his prayer that he may avail without a lie to succor whom the Father Himself, Whose judgments are un-searchable, willeth to be succored. Such a son therefore so keeps watch against a lie, as he doth against sin. For indeed sometimes the name of lie is put for the name of sin: whence is that saying, \"All men are liars.\"[fn-45-P4510_2214018:87-nf] For it is so said, as if it were said, \"All men are sinners.\" And that: \"But if the truth of God hath abounded through my lie.\"[fn-45-P4511_2214177:88-nf] And therefore, when he lies as a man he sins as a man, and will be held by that sentence in which it is said, \"All men are liars;\" and, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-45-P4512_2214414:89-nf] But when nothing false cometh forth of his mouth, according to that grace will it so be, of which is said: \"He that is born of God, sinneth not.\"[fn-45-P4513_2214578:90-nf] For were this nativity by itself alone in us, no man would sin: and when it shall be alone, no man will sin. But now, we as yet drag on that which we were born corruptible: although, according to that which we are new-born, if we walk aright, from day to day we are renewed inwardly.[fn-45-P4514_2214882:91-nf] But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, life will swallow it up wholly, and not a sting of death will remain.[fn-45-P4515_2215030:92-nf] Now this sting of death is sin.","title":"Against Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":29,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"73.

But neither will those be without punishment who know not the law of God. \"For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[fn-59-P5935_2319280:38-nf] Now the apostle does not appear to me to have said this as if he meant that they would have to suffer something worse who in their sins are ignorant of the law than they who know it. [III.] It is seemingly worse, no doubt, \"to perish\" than \"to be judged;\" but inasmuch as he was speaking of the Gentiles and of the Jews when he used these words, because the former were without the law, but the latter had received the law, who can venture to say that the Jews who sin in the law will not perish, since they refused to believe in Christ, when it was of them that the apostle said, \"They shall be judged by the law\"? For without faith in Christ no man can be delivered; and therefore they will be so judged that they perish. If, indeed, the condition of those who are ignorant of the law of God is worse than the condition of those who know it, how can that be true which the Lord says in the gospel: \"The servant who knows not his lord's will, and commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes; whereas the servant who knows his lord's will, and commits things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with many stripes \"?[fn-59-P5936_2320437:39-nf] Observe how clearly He here shows that it is a graver matter for a man to sin with knowledge than in ignorance. And yet we must not on this account betake ourselves for refuge to the shades of ignorance, with the view of finding our excuse therein. It is one thing to be ignorant, and another thing to be unwilling to know. For the will is at fault in the case of the man of whom it is said, \"He is not inclined to understand, so as to do good.\"[fn-59-P5937_2320906:40-nf] But even the ignorance, which is not theirs who refuse to know, but theirs who are, as it were, simply ignorant, does not so far excuse any one as to exempt him from the punishment of eternal fire, though his failure to believe has been the result of his not having at all heard what he should believe; but probably only so far as to mitigate his punishment. For it was not said without reason: \"Pour out Thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known Thee;\"[fn-59-P5938_2321384:41-nf] nor again according to what the apostle says: \"When He shall come from heaven in a flame of fire to take vengeance on them that know not God.\"[fn-59-P5939_2321545:42-nf] But yet in order that we may have that knowledge that will prevent our saying, each one of us, \"I did not know,\" \"I did not hear,\" \"I did not understand;\" the human will is summoned, in such words as these: \"Wish not to be as the horse or as the mule, which have no understanding;\"[fn-59-P5940_2321850:43-nf] although it may show itself even worse, of which it is written, \"A stubborn servant will not be reproved by words; for even if he understand, yet he will not obey.\"[fn-59-P5941_2322034:44-nf] But when a man says, \"I cannot do what I am commanded, because I am mastered by my concupiscence,\" he has no longer any excuse to plead from ignorance, nor reason to blame God in his heart, but he recognises and laments his own evil in himself; and still to such an one the apostle says: \"Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good;\"[fn-59-P5942_2322399:45-nf] and of course the very fact that the injunction, \"Consent not to be overcome,\" is addressed to him, undoubtedly summons the determination of his will.

For without this that theoretical purity of which we have spoken cannot be obtained, which those only,-who are perfected not by the words of others who teach them, but by the excellence of their own actions, can after much expenditure of effort and toil attain as a reward for it. For as they gain their knowledge not from meditation on the law but from the fruit of their labour, they sing with the Psalmist: \"From Thy commandments I have understanding;\" and having overcome all their passions, they say with confidence: \"I will sing, and I will understand in the undefiled way.\"[fn-54-P5496_1967282:22-nf] For he who is striving in an undefiled way in the course of a pure heart, as he sings the Psalm, understands the words which are chanted. And therefore if you would prepare in your heart a holy tabernacle of spiritual knowledge, purge yourselves from the stain of all sins, and rid yourselves of the cares of this world. For it is an impossibility for the soul which is taken up even to a small extent with worldly troubles, to gain the gift of knowledge or to become an author of spiritual interpretation, and diligent in reading holy things. Be careful therefore in the first place, and especially you, John, as your more youthful age requires you the rather to be careful about what I am going to say-that you may enjoin absolute silence on your lips, in order that your zeal for reading and the efforts of your purpose may not be destroyed by vain pride. For this is the first practical step towards learning, to receive the regulations and opinions of all the Elders with an earnest heart, and with lips that are dumb; and diligently to lay them up in your heart, and endeavour rather to perform than to teach them. For from teaching, the dangerous arrogance of vainglory, but from performing, the fruit of spiritual knowledge will flourish. And so you should never venture to say anything in the conference of the Elders unless some ignorance that might be injurious, or a matter which it is important to know leads you to ask a question; as some who are puffed up with vainglory, pretend that they ask, in order really to show off the knowledge which they perfectly possess. For it is an impossibility for one, who takes to the pursuit of reading with the purpose of gaining the praise of men, to be rewarded with the gift of true knowledge. For one who is bound by the chain of this passion, is sure to be also in bondage to other faults, and especially to that of pride: and so if he is baffled by his enCounter with practical and ethical knowledge, he will certainly not attain that spiritual knowledge which springs from it. Be then in all things \"swift to hear, but slow to speak,\"[fn-54-P5497_1969421:23-nf] lest there come upon you that which is noted by Solomon: \"If thou seest a man who is quick to speak, know that there is more hope of a fool than of him;[fn-54-P5498_1969595:24-nf] and do not presume to teach any one in words what you have not already performed in deed. For our Lord taught us by His own example that we ought to keep to this order, as of Him it is said: \"what Jesus began to do and to teach.\"[fn-54-P5499_1969853:25-nf] Take care then that you do not rush into teaching before doing, and so be reckoned among the number of those of whom the Lord speaks inthe gospel to the disciples: \"What they sayunto you, that observe and do, but not aftertheir words: for they say and do not. But they bind heavy burdens and grievous to beborne, and lay them on men's shoulders; butthey themselves will not move them with oneof their fingers.\"[fn-55-P5500_1970280:26-nf] For if he who shall \"breakone of these commands, and shall teach menso, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven,\"[fn-55-P5501_1970428:27-nf] it follows that one who has dared to despise many and greater commands and to teach men so, shall certainly be considered not least in the kingdom of heaven, but greatest in the punishment of hell. And therefore you must be careful not to be led on to teach by the example of those who have attained some skill in discussion and readiness in speech and because they can discourse on what they please elegantly and fully, are imagined to possess spiritual knowledge, by those who do not know how to distinguish its real force and character. For it is one thing to have a ready tongue and elegant language, and quite another to penetrate into the very heart and marrow of heavenly utterances and to gaze with pure eye of the soul on profound and hidden mysteries; for this can be gained by no learning of man's, nor condition of this world, only by purity of soul, by means of the illumination of the Holy Ghost.","title":"XIV.

As if in the sight of God mere words, and not mainly the will was called in fault,and as if only the actual deed of sin, and not also the wish and purpose, was reckoned as wrong; or as if it would be asked in the judgment only what each one had done and not what he also purposed to do. For it is not only the character of the anger roused, but also the purpose of the man who provokes it which is bad, and therefore the true scrutiny of our judge will ask, not how the quarrel was stirred up but by whose fault it arose: for the purpose of the sin, and not the way in which the fault is committed must be taken into account. For what does it matter whether a man kills a brother with a sword by himself, or drives him to death by some fraud, when it is clear that he is killed by his wiles and crime? As if it were enough not to have pushed a blind man down with one's own hand, though he is equally guilty who scorned to save him, when it was in his power, when fallen and on the point of tumbling into the ditch: or as if he alone were guilty who had caught a man with the hand, and not also the one who had prepared and set the trap for him, or who would not set him free when he might have done so.

Something of the same kind too is this which is said by the Apostle: \"Not avenging yourselves, dearly beloved: but give place to wrath,\"[fn-58-P5815_2062200:44-nf] i.e., do not under the compulsion of wrath proceed to vengeance, but give place to wrath, i.e., do not let your hearts be confined in the straits of impatience and cowardice so that, when a fierce storm of passion rises, you cannot endure it; but be ye enlarged in your hearts, receiving the adverse waves of anger in the wide gulf of that love which \"suffereth all things, beareth all things;\"[fn-58-P5816_2062614:45-nf] and so your mind will be enlarged with wide long-suffering and patience, and will have within it safe recesses of counsel, in which the foul smoke of anger will be received and be diffused and forthwith vanish away; or else the passage may be taken in this way: we give place to wrath, as often as we yield with humble and tranquil mind to the passion of another, and bow to the impatience of the passionate, as if we admitted that we deserved any kind of wrong. But those who twist the meaning of the perfection of which the Apostle speaks so as to make out that those give place to anger, who go away from a man in a rage, seem to me not to cut off but rather to foment the incitement to quarrelling, for unless a neighbour's wrath is overcome at once by amends being humbly made, a man provokes rather than avoids it by his flight. And there is something like this that Solomon says: \"Be not hasty in thy spirit to be wroth, for anger reposes in the bosom of fools;\" and: \"Be not quick to rush into a quarrel, lest thou repent thereof at the last\"[fn-58-P5817_2063686:46-nf] For he does not blame a hasty exhibition of quarrelling and anger in such a way as to praise a tardy one. In the same way too must this be taken: \"A fool declares his anger in the very same hour, but a prudent man hides his shame.\"[fn-58-P5818_2063951:47-nf] For hedoes not lay it down that a shamefuloutburst of anger ought to be hidden by wise men in such a way that while he blames a speedy outburst of anger he fails to forbid a tardy one, as certainly, if owing to human weakness it does burst forth, he means that it should be hidden for this reason, that while for the moment it is wisely covered up, it may be destroyed forever. For the nature of anger is such that when it is given room it languishes and perishes, but if openly exhibited, it burns more and more. The hearts then should be enlarged and openedwide, lest they be confined in the narrow straits of cowardice, and be filled with the swelling surge of wrath, and so we become unable to receive what the prophet calls the \"exceeding broad\" commandment of God in our narrow heart, or to say with the prophet: \"I have run the way of thy commandments for thou hast enlarged my heart.\"[fn-58-P5819_2064864:48-nf] For that long-suffering is wisdom we are taught by very clear passages of Scripture: for \"a man who is long-suffering is great in prudence; but a coward is very foolish.\"[fn-58-P5820_2065064:49-nf] And therefore Scripture says of him who to his credit asked the gift of wisdom from the Lord: \"God gave Solomon wisdom and prudence exceeding much, and largeness of heart as the sand of the sea for multitude.\"[fn-58-P5821_2065295:50-nf] ","title":"XVI.

The Saviour, then, saying of us, `As Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they too may be one in Us,' does not signify that we were to have identity with Him; for this was shewn from the instance of Jonah; but it is a request to the Father, as John has written, that the Spirit should be vouchsafed through Him to those who believe, through whom we are found to be in God, and in this respect to be conjoined in Him. For since the Word is in the Father, and the Spirit is given from[fn-67-P6713_2663582:188-nf] the Word, He wills that we should receive the Spirit, that, when we receive It, thus having the Spirit of the Word which is in the Father, we too may be found on account of the Spirit to become One in the Word, and through Him in the Father. And if He say, `as we,' this again is only a request that such grace of the Spirit as is given to the disciples may be without failure or revocation[fn-67-P6714_2663984:189-nf] . For what the Word has by nature[fn-67-P6715_2664043:190-nf] , as I said, in the Father, that He wishes to be given to us through the Spirit irrevocably; which the Apostle knowing, said, `Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?' for `the gifts of God' and `grace of His calling are without repentance[fn-67-P6716_2664334:191-nf] .'

God's enemies hearing this ought to be henceforth abashed, and no longer to feign themselves equal to God.

Consider with what want of judgment you dare to blame those who strive for the truth against falsehood. For who ought more justly to be indignant against the other?-whether he who supports God's enemies, or he who, in opposition to him who supports God's enemies, unites with us on behalf of the truth of the Church?-except that it is plain that the ignorant are also excited and angry, because by the want of counsel and discourse they are easily turned to wrath; so that of none more than of you does divine Scripture say, \"A wrathful man stirreth up strifes, and a furious man heapeth up sins.\"[fn-64-P6456_2078505:42-nf] For what strifes and dissensions have you stirred up throughout the churches of the whole world! Moreover, how great sin have you heaped up for yourself, when you cut yourself off from so many flocks! For it is yourself that you have cut off. Do not deceive yourself, since he is really the schismatic who has made himself an apostate from the communion of ecclesiastical unity.[fn-64-P6457_2078905:43-nf] For while you think that all may be excommunicated by you, you have excommunicated yourself alone from all; and not even the precepts of an apostle have been able to mould you to the rule of truth and peace, although he warned, and said, \"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.\"[fn-64-P6458_2079688:44-nf] ","title":"Epistle LXXIV.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":29,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_40_letter_xxii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"3. The Christian ought not to grudge another's reputation, nor rejoice over any man's faults;[fn-29-P2937_964754:42-nf] he ought in Christ's love to grieve and be afflicted at his brother's faults, and rejoice over his brother's good deeds.[fn-29-P2938_964896:43-nf] He ought not to be indifferent or silent before sinners.[fn-29-P2939_964974:44-nf] He who shows another to be wrong ought to do so with all tenderness,[fn-29-P2940_965062:45-nf] in the fear of God, and with the object of converting the sinner.[fn-29-P2941_965146:46-nf] He who is proved wrong or rebuked ought to take it willingly, recognizing his own gain in being set right. When any one is being accused, it is not right for another, before him or any one else, to contradict the accuser; but if at any time the charge seems groundless to any one, he ought privately to enter into discussion with the accuser, and either produce, or acquire, conviction. Every one ought, as far as he is able, to conciliate one who has ground of complaint against him. No one ought to cherish a grudge against the sinner who repents, but heartily to forgive him.[fn-29-P2942_965744:47-nf] He who says that he has repented of a sin ought not only to be pricked with compunction for his sin, but also to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.[fn-29-P2943_965917:48-nf] He who has been corrected in first faults, and received pardon, if he sins again prepares for himself a judgment of wrath worse than the former.[fn-29-P2944_966079:49-nf] He, who after the first and second admonition[fn-29-P2945_966146:50-nf] abides in his fault, ought to be brought before the person in authority,[fn-29-P2946_966238:51-nf] if haply after being rebuked by more he may be ashamed.[fn-29-P2947_966420:52-nf] If even thus he fail to be set right he is to be cut off from the rest as one that maketh to offend, and regarded as a heathen and a publican,[fn-29-P2948_966584:53-nf] for the security of them that are obedient, according to the saving, When the impious fall the righteous tremble.[fn-29-P2949_966720:54-nf] He should be grieved over as a limb cut from the body. The sun ought not to go down upon a brother's wrath,[fn-29-P2950_966854:55-nf] lest haply night come between brother and brother, and make the charge stand in the day of judgment. A Christian ought not to wait for an opportunity for his own amendment,[fn-29-P2951_967045:56-nf] because there is no certainty about the morrow; for many after many devices bare not reached the morrow. He ought not to be beguiled by over eating, whence come dreams in the night. He ought not to be distracted by immoderate toil, nor overstep the bounds of sufficiency, as the apostle says, \"Having food and raiment let us be therewith content;\"[fn-29-P2952_967432:57-nf] unnecessary abundance gives appearance of covetousness, and covetousness is condemned as idolatry.[fn-29-P2953_967550:58-nf] A Christian ought not to be a lover of money,[fn-29-P2954_967614:59-nf] nor lay up treasure for unprofitable ends. He who comes to God ought to embrace poverty in all things, and to be riveted in the fear of God, according to the words, \"Rivet my flesh in thy fear, for I am afraid of thy judgments.\"[fn-29-P2955_967884:60-nf] The Lord grant that you may receive what I have said with full conviction and shew forth fruits worthy of the Spirit to the glory of God, by God's good pleasure, and the cooperation of our Lord Jesus Christ.","title":"Letter XXII","author":"St. Basil"}]
