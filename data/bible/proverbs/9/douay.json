{"verses":["Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewn her out seven\npillars.","She hath slain her victims, mingled her wine, and set forth her\ntable.","She hath sent her maids to invite to the tower, and to the walls\nof the city:","Whosoever is a little one, let him come to me.  And to the unwise\nshe said:","Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mingled for\nyou.","Forsake childishness, and live, and walk by the ways of prudence.","He that teacheth a scorner, doth an injury to himself; and he that\nrebuketh a wicked man, getteth himself a blot.","Rebuke not a scorner, lest he hate thee.  Rebuke a wise man, and he\nwill love thee.","Give an occasion to a wise man, and wisdom shall be added to him.\nTeach a just man, and he shall make haste to receive it.","The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom:  and the\nknowledge of the holy is prudence.","For by me shall thy days be multiplied, and years of life shall\nbe added to thee.","If thou be wise, thou shalt be so to thyself:  and if a scorner,\nthou alone shalt bear the evil.","A foolish woman and clamorous, and full of allurements, and\nknowing nothing at all,","Sat at the door of her house, upon a seat, in a high place of the\ncity,","To call them that pass by the way, and go on their journey:","He that is a little one, let him turn to me.  And to the fool she\nsaid:","Stolen waters are sweeter, and hidden bread is more pleasant.","And he did not know that giants are there, and that her guests\nare in the depths of hell."]}
