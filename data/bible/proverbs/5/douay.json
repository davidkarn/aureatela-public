{"verses":["My son, attend to my wisdom, and incline thy ear to my prudence,","That thou mayst keep thoughts, and thy lips may preserve\ninstruction.  Mind not the deceit of a woman.","For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping, and her\nthroat is smoother than oil.","But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.","Her feet go down into death, and her steps go in as far as hell.","They walk not by the path of life, her steps are wandering, and\nunaccountable.","Now, therefore, my son, hear me, and depart not from the words of\nmy mouth.","Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her\nhouse.","Give not thy honour to strangers, and thy years to the cruel.","Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in\nanother man's house,","And thou mourn at the last, when thou shalt have spent thy flesh\nand thy body, and say;","Why have I hated instruction, and my heart consented not to\nreproof,","And have not heard the voice of them that taught me, and have not\ninclined my ear to masters?","I have almost been in all evil, in the midst of the church and of\nthe congregation.","Drink water out of thy own cistern, and the streams of thy own\nwell:","Let thy fountains be conveyed abroad, and in the streets divide\nthy waters.","Keep them to thyself alone, neither let strangers be partakers\nwith thee.","Let thy vein be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth:","Let her be thy dearest hind, and most agreeable fawn:  let her\nbreasts inebriate thee at all times:  be thou delighted continually with\nher love.","Why art thou seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and art\ncherished in the bosom of another?","The Lord beholdeth the ways of man, and considereth all his\nsteps.","His own iniquities catch the wicked, and he is fast bound with\nthe ropes of his own sins.","He shall die, because he hath not received instruction, and in\nthe multitude of his folly he shall be deceived."]}
