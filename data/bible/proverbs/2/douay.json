{"verses":["My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my\ncommandments with thee,","That thy ear may hearken to wisdom:  incline thy heart to know\nprudence.","For if thou shalt call for wisdom, and incline thy heart to\nprudence:","If thou shalt seek her as money, and shalt dig for her as for a\ntreasure:","Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and shalt find\nthe knowledge of God:","Because the Lord giveth wisdom:  and out of his mouth cometh\nprudence and knowledge.","He wilt keep the salvation of the righteous, and protect them that\nwalk in simplicity,","Keeping the paths of justice, and guarding the ways of saints.","Then shalt thou understand justice, and judgment, and equity, and\nevery good path.","If wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge please thy\nsoul:","Counsel shall keep thee, and prudence shall preserve thee,","That thou mayst be delivered from the evil way, and from the man\nthat speaketh perverse things:","Who leave the right way, and walk by dark ways:","Who are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in the most\nwicked things:","Whose ways are perverse, and their steps infamous.","That thou mayst be delivered from the strange woman, and from the\nstranger, who softeneth her words;","And forsaketh the guide of her youth,","And hath forgotten the covenant of her God:  for her house\ninclineth unto death, and her paths to hell.","None that go in unto her, shall return again, neither shall they\ntake hold of the paths of life.","That thou mayst walk in a good way:  and mayst keep the paths of\nthe just.","For they that are upright, shall dwell in the earth; and the\nsimple shall continue in it.","But the wicked shall be destroyed from the earth:  and they that\ndo unjustly, shall be taken away from it."]}
