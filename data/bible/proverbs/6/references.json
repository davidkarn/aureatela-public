He would tell us whether he would be proud to see his own mother so highly esteemed by the state as to have divine honors adjudged to her; as the Greeks and Romans and other nations have decreed divine honors to men who had been of material service to them, and have believed that their mortal benefactors were thus made immortal, and enrolled among the gods.[fn-4-P414_153566:8-nf] Surely he would desire that his mother should enjoy such felicity were it possible. But if we proceeded to ask him whether, among the honors paid to her, he would wish such shameful rites as these to be celebrated, would he not at once exclaim that he would rather his mother lay stone-dead, than survive as a goddess to lend her ear to these obscenities? Is it possible that he who was of so severe a morality, that he used his influence as a Roman senator to prevent the building of a theatre in that city dedicated to the manly virtues, would wish his mother to be propitiated as a goddess with words which would have brought the blush to her cheek when a Roman matron? Could he possibly believe that the modesty of an estimable woman would be so transformed by her promotion to divinity, that she would suffer herself to be invoked and celebrated in terms so gross and immodest, that if she had heard the like while alive upon earth, and had listened without stopping her ears and hurrying from the spot, her relatives, her husband, and her children would have blushed for her? Therefore, the mother of the gods being such a character as the most profligate man would be ashamed to have for his mother, and meaning to enthral the minds of the Romans, demanded for her service their best citizen, not to ripen him still more in virtue by her helpful counsel, but to entangle him by her deceit, like her of whom it is written, \"The adulteress will hunt for the precious soul.\"[fn-4-P415_155083:9-nf] Her intent was to puff up this highsouled man by an apparently divine testimony to his excellence, in order that he might rely upon his own eminence in virtue, and make no further efforts after true piety and religion, without which natural genius, however brilliant, vapors into pride and comes to nothing. For what but a guileful purpose could that goddess demand the best man seeing that in her own sacred festivals she requires such obscenities as the best men would be covered with shame to hear at their own tables?","title":"Book II","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":6,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"324","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"14.

Oh! the madness and folly of those who have forsaken the teaching of the book of Proverbs, \"My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother,\"[fn-18-P1835_447291:1281-nf] and have turned to error, and say to the fool that he shall be their leader, and do not despise the foolish things which are said by the foolish man, even as the scripture bears witness, \"The foolish man speaketh foolishly, and his heart understandeth vanity.\"[fn-18-P1836_447575:1282-nf] I beseech you, dearly beloved, and by the love which I feel towards you, I implore you-as though it were my own members on which I would have pity[fn-18-P1837_447752:1283-nf] -by word and letter to fulfil that which is written, \"Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?\"[fn-18-P1838_447935:1284-nf] Origen's words are the words of an enemy, hateful and repugnant to God and to His saints; and not only those which I have quoted, but countless others. For it is not now my intention to argue against all his opinions. Origen has not lived in my day, nor has he robbed me. I have not conceived a dislike to him nor quarrelled with him because of an inheritance or of any worldly matter; but-to speak plainly-I grieve, and grieve bitterly, to see numbers of my brothers, and of those in particular who show the most promise, and have reached the highest rank in the sacred ministry,[fn-18-P1839_448541:1285-nf] deceived by his persuasive arguments, and made by his most perverse teaching the food of the devil, whereby the saying is fulfilled: \"He derides every stronghold, and his fare is choice, and he hath gathered captives as the sand.\"[fn-18-P1840_448794:1286-nf] But may God free you, my brother, and the holy people of Christ which is intrusted to you, and all the brothers who are with you, and especially the presbyter Rufinus, from the heresy of Origen, and other heresies, and from the perdition to which they lead. For, if for one word or for two opposed to the faith many heresies have been rejected by the Church, how much more shall he be held a heretic who has contrived such perverse interpretations and such mischievous doctrines to destroy the faith, and has in fact declared himself the enemy of the Church! For, among other wicked things, he has presumed to say this, too, that Adam lost the image of God, although Scripture nowhere declares that he did. Were it so, never would all the creatures in the world be subject to Adam's seed-that is, to the entire human race; yet, in the words of the apostle, everything \"is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind.\"[fn-18-P1841_449738:1287-nf] For never would all things be subjected to men if men had not-together with their authority over all-the image of God. But the divine Scripture conjoins and associates with this the grace of the blessing which was conferred upon Adam and upon the generations which descended from him. No one can by twisting the meaning of words presume to say that this grace of God was given to one only, and that he alone was made in the image of God (he and his wife, that is, for while he was formed of clay she was made of one of his ribs), but that those who were subsequently conceived in the womb and not born as was Adam did not possess God's image, for the Scripture immediately subjoins the following statement: \"And Adam lived two hundred and thirty years,[fn-18-P1842_450513:1288-nf] and knew Eve his wife, and she bare him a son in his image and after his likeness, and called his name Seth.\"[fn-18-P1843_450707:1289-nf] And again, in the tenth generation, two thousand two hundred and forty-two years afterwards,[fn-18-P1844_450845:1290-nf] God, to vindicate His own image and to show that the grace which He had given to men still continued in them, gives the following commandment: \"Flesh ...with the blood thereof shall ye not eat. And surely your blood will I require at the hand of every man that sheddeth it; for in the image of God have I made man.\"[fn-18-P1845_451264:1291-nf] From Noah to Abraham ten generations passed away,[fn-18-P1846_451362:1292-nf] and from Abraham's time to David's, fourteen more,[fn-18-P1847_451438:1293-nf] and these twenty-four generations make up, taken together, two thousand one hundred and seventeen years.[fn-18-P1848_451565:1294-nf] Yet the Holy Spirit in the thirty-ninth[fn-18-P1849_451663:1295-nf] psalm, while lamenting that all men walk in a vain show, and that they are subject to sins, speaks thus: \"For all that every man walk eth in the image.\"[fn-18-P1850_451891:1296-nf] Also after David's time, in the reign of Solomon his son, we read a somewhat similar reference to the divine likeness. For in the book of Wisdom, which is inscribed with his name, Solomon says: \"God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of His own eternity.\"[fn-18-P1851_452211:1297-nf] And again, about eleven hundred and eleven years afterwards, we read in the New Testament that men have not lost the image of God. For James, an apostle and brother of the Lord, whom I have mentioned above-that we may not be entangled in the snares of Origen-teaches us that man does possess God's image and likeness. For, after a somewhat discursive account of the human tongue, he has gone on to say of it: \"It is an unruly evil ...therewith bless we God, even the Father and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.\"[fn-18-P1852_452779:1298-nf] Paul, too, the \"chosen vessel,\"[fn-18-P1853_452836:1299-nf] who in his preaching has fully maintained the doctrine of the gospel, instructs us that man is made in the image and after the likeness of God. \"A man,\" he says, \"ought not to wear long hair, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God.\"[fn-18-P1854_453099:1300-nf] He speaks of \"the image\" simply, but explains the nature of the likeness by the word \"glory.\"","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1341","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Graft unfruitful stocks with buds and slips that you may shortly be rewarded for your toil by plucking sweet apples from them.

The planting was good, the fruit coming from the will is evil; and therefore the planter is blameless, but the vine shall be burnt with fire since it was planted for good, and bore fruit unto evil of its own will.

Sin then is, as we have said, a fearful evil, but not incurable; fearful for him who clings to it, but easy of cure for him who by repentance puts it from him. For suppose that a man is holding fire in his hand; as long as he holds fast the live coal he is sure to be burned, but should he put away the coal, he would have cast away the flame also with it.

But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.\" Let us turn back to the chief point of the evidence: \"It is good,\" he says, \"for a man not to touch a woman.\" If it is good not to touch a woman, it is bad to touch one: for there is no opposite to goodness but badness. But if it be bad and the evil is pardoned, the reason for the concession is to prevent worse evil. But surely a thing which is only allowed because there may be something worse has only a slight degree of goodness. He would never have added \"let each man have his own wife,\" unless he had previously used the words \"but, because of fornications.\" Do away with fornication, and he will not say \"let each man have his own wife.\" Just as though one were to lay it down: \"It is good to feed on wheaten bread, and to eat the finest wheat flour,\" and yet to prevent a person pressed by hunger from devouring cow-dung, I may allow, him to eat barley. Does it follow that the wheat will not have its peculiar purity, because such an one prefers barley to excrement? That is naturally good which does not admit of comparison with what is bad, and is not eclipsed because something else is preferred. At the same time we must notice the Apostle's prudence. He did not say, it is good not to have a wife: but, it is good not to touch a woman: as though there were danger even in the touch: as though he who touched her, would not escape from her who \"hunteth for the precious life,\" who causeth the young man's understanding to fly away.[fn-61-P6178_1858076:38-nf] \"Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?\" As then he who touches fire is instantly burned, so by the mere touch the peculiar nature of man and woman is perceived, and the difference of sex is understood, Heathen fables relate how[fn-61-P6179_1858426:39-nf] Mithras and[fn-61-P6180_1858584:40-nf] Ericthonius were begotten of the soil, in stone or earth, by raging lust. Hence it was that our Joseph, because the Egyptian woman wished to touch him, fled from her hands, and, as if he had been bitten by a mad dog and feared the spreading poison, threw away the cloak which she had touched. \"But, because of fornications let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.\" He did not say, because of fornication let each man marry a wife: otherwise by this excuse he would have thrown the reins to lust, and whenever a man's wife died, he would have to marry another to prevent fornication, but \"have his own wife.\" Let him he says have and use his own wife, whom he had before he became a believer, and whom it would have been good not to touch, and, when once he became a follower of Christ, to know only as a sister, not as a wife unless fornication should make it excusable to touch her. \"The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.\" The whole question here concerns those who are married men. Is it lawful for them to do what our Lord forbade in the Gospel, and to put away their wives? Whence it is that the Apostle says, \"It is good for a man not to touch a woman.\" But inasmuch as he who is once married has no power to abstain except by mutual consent, and may not reject an unoffending partner, let the husband render unto the wife her due. He bound himself voluntarily that he might be under compulsion to render it. \"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer.\" What, I pray you, is the quality of that good thing which hinders prayer? which does not allow the body of Christ to be received? So long as I do the husband's part, I fail in continency. The same Apostle in another place commands us to pray always. If we are to pray always, it follows that we must never be in the bondage of wedlock, for as often as I render my wife her due, I cannot pray. The Apostle Peter had experience of the bonds of marriage. See how he fashions the Church, and what lesson he teaches Christians:[fn-61-P6181_1860965:41-nf] \"Ye husbands in like manner dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honour unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.\" Observe that, as S. Paul before, because in both cases the spirit is the same, so S. Peter now, says that prayers are hindered by the performance of marriage duty. When he says \"likewise,\" he challenges the husbands to imitate their wives, because he has already given them commandment:[fn-61-P6182_1861498:42-nf] \"beholding your chaste conversation coupled with fear. Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel: but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\" You see what kind of wedlock he enjoins. Husbands and wives are to dwell together according to knowledge, so that they may know what God wishes and desires, and give honour to the weak vessel, woman. If we abstain from intercourse, we give honour to our wives: if we do not abstain, it is clear that insult is the opposite of honour. He also tells the wives to let their husbands \"see their chaste behaviour, and the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit.\" Words truly worthy of an apostle, and of Christ's rock! He lays down the law for husbands and wives, condemns outward ornament, while he praises continence, which is the ornament of the inner man, as seen in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit. In effect he says this: Since your outer man is corrupt, and you have ceased to possess the blessing of incorruption characteristic of virgins, at least imitate the incorruption of the spirit by subsequent abstinence, and what you cannot show in the body exhibit in the mind.

He lays down the law for husbands and wives, condemns outward ornament, while he praises continence, which is the ornament of the inner man, as seen in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit. In effect he says this: Since your outer man is corrupt, and you have ceased to possess the blessing of incorruption characteristic of virgins, at least imitate the incorruption of the spirit by subsequent abstinence, and what you cannot show in the body exhibit in the mind. For these are the riches, and these the ornaments of your union, which Christ seeks.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"28. Above, in passing, when our opponent adduced Solomon, who, although he had many wives, nevertheless built the temple, I briefly replied that it was my intention to run over the remaining points. Now that he may not cry out that both Solomon and others under the law, prophets and holy men, have been dishonoured by us, let us show what this very man with his many wives and concubines thought of marriage. For no one can know better than he who suffered through them, what a wife or woman is. Well then, he says in the Proverbs:[fn-63-P6343_1948530:182-nf] \"The foolish and bold woman comes to want bread.\" What bread? Surely that bread which cometh down from heaven: and he immediately adds[fn-63-P6344_1948686:183-nf] \"The earth-born perish in her house, rush into the depths of hell.\" Who are the earth-born that perish in her house? They of course who follow the first Adam, who is of the earth, and not the second, who is from heaven. And again in another place: \"Like a worm in wood, so a wicked woman destroyeth her husband.\" But if you assert that this was spoken of bad wives, I shall briefly answer: What necessity rests upon me to run the risk of the wife I marry proving good or bad?[fn-63-P6345_1949198:184-nf] \"It is better,\" he says, \"to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious and passionate woman in a wide house.\" How seldom we find a wife without these faults, he knows who is married. Hence that sublime orator, Varius Geminus[fn-63-P6346_1949451:185-nf] says well \"The man who does not quarrel is a bachelor.\"[fn-63-P6347_1949652:186-nf] \"It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman in a house in common.\" If a house common to husband and wife makes a wife proud and breeds contempt for the husband: how much more if the wife be the richer of the two, and the husband but a lodger in her house! She begins to be not a wife, but mistress of the house; and if she offend her husband, they must part.[fn-63-P6348_1950087:187-nf] \"A continual dropping on a wintry day\" turns a man out of doors, and so will a contentious woman drive a man from his own house. She floods his house with her constant nagging and daily chatter, and ousts him from his own home, that is the Church. Hence the same Solomon previously commands:[fn-63-P6349_1950403:188-nf] \"My son flows forth beyond.\" And the Apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says \"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things spoken, lest haply we flow forth beyond.\" But who can hide from himself what is thus enigmatically expressed?[fn-63-P6350_1950900:189-nf] \"The horseleech had three I daughters, dearly loved, but they satisfied her not, and a fourth is not satisfied when you say Enough; the grave, and woman's love, and the earth that is not satisfied with water, and the fire that saith not, Enough.\" The horse-leech is the devil, the daughters of the devil are dearly loved, and they cannot be satisfied with the blood of the slain: the grave, and woman's love, and the earth dry and scorched with heat. It is not the harlot, or the adulteress who is spoken of; but woman's love in general is accused of ever being insatiable; put it out, it bursts into flame; give it plenty, it is again in need; it enervates a man's mind, and engrosses all thought except for the passion which it feeds. What we read in the parable which follows is to the same effect: \"For three things the earth doth tremble, and for four which it cannot bear: for a servant when he is king: and a fool when he is filled with meat: for an odious woman when she is married to a good husband: and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.\" See how a wife is classed with the greatest evils. But if you reply that it is an odious wife, I will give you the same answer as before-the mere possibility of such danger is in itself no light matter. For he who marries a wife is uncertain whether he is marrying an odious woman or one worthy of his love. If she be odious, she is intolerable. If worthy of love, her love is compared to the grave, to the parched earth, and to fire.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":6,"verse":32,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"ANF-04","text":"For even in the Proverbs, which we call Paroemiae, Solomon specially (treats) of the adulterer (as being) nowhere admissible to expiation. \"But the adulterer,\" he says, \"through indigence of senses acquireth perdition to his own soul; sustaineth dolors and disgraces.

But now I write to you, if any is named a brother among you, (being) a fornicator, or an idolater\" (for what so intimately joined?), \"or a defrauder\" (for what so near akin?), and so on, \"with such to take no food even,\"[fn-15-P1571_459637:220-nf] not to say the Eucharist: because, to wit, withal \"a little leaven spoileth the flavour of the whole lump.\"[fn-15-P1572_459768:221-nf] Again to Timotheus: \"Lay hands on no one hastily, nor communicate with others' sins.\"[fn-15-P1573_459869:222-nf] Again to the Ephesians: \"Be not, then, partners with them: for ye were at one time darkness.\"[fn-15-P1574_459984:223-nf] And yet more earnestly: \"Communicate not with the unfruitful works of darkness; nay rather withal convict them.

If, moreover, even from a \"brother\" who \"walketh idly\"[fn-15-P1576_460326:225-nf] he warns the Thessalonians to withdraw themselves, how much more withal from a fornicator! For these are the deliberate judgments of Christ, \"loving the Church,\" who \"hath delivered Him self up for her, that He may sanctify her (purifying her utterly by the layer of water) in the word, that He may present the Church to Him self glorious, not having stain or wrinkle\"-of course after the laver-\"but (that) she may be holy and without reproach; \"[fn-15-P1577_460797:226-nf] thereafter, to wit, being \"without wrinkle\" as a virgin, \"without stain\" (of fornication) as a spouse, \"without disgrace\" (of vileness), as having been \"utterly purified.\"","title":"VII.

And the gnostic loves the truth. \"Go,\" it is said, \"to the ant, thou sluggard, and be the disciple of the bee; \"thus speaks Solomon.[fn-66-P6628_2017215:6-nf] For if there is one function belonging to the peculiar nature of each creature, alike of the ox, and horse, and dog, what shall we say is the peculiar function of man? He is like, it appears to me, the Centaur, a Thessalian figment, compounded of a rational and irrational part, of soul and body. Well, the body tills the ground, and hastes to it; but the soul is raised to God: trained in the true philosophy, it speeds to its kindred above, turning away from the lusts of the body, and besides these, from toil and fear, although we have shown that patience and fear belong to the good man. For if \"by the law is the knowledge of sin,\"[fn-66-P6629_2017872:7-nf] as those allege who disparage the law, and \"till the law sin was in the world; \"[fn-66-P6630_2017970:8-nf] yet \"without the law sin was dead,\"[fn-66-P6631_2018023:9-nf] we oppose them. For when you take away the cause of fear, sin, you have taken away fear; and much more, punishment, when you have taken away that which gives rise to lust. \"For the law is not made for the just man,\"[fn-66-P6632_2018257:10-nf] says the Scripture. Well, then, says Heraclitus, \"They would not have known the name of Justice if these things had not been.\" And Socrates says, \"that the law was not made for the sake of the good.\" But the cavillers did not know even this, as the apostle says, \"that he who loveth his brother worketh not evil; \"for this, \"Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not steal; and if there be any other commandment, it is comprehended in the word, Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-66-P6633_2018789:11-nf] So also is it said, \"Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-66-P6634_2018932:12-nf] And \"if he that loveth his neighbour worketh no evil,\" and if \"every commandment is comprehended in this, the loving our neighbour,\" the commandments, by menacing with fear, work love, not hatred. Wherefore the law is productive of the emotion of fear. \"So that the law is holy,\" and in truth \"spiritual,\"[fn-66-P6635_2019255:13-nf] according to the apostle. We must, then, as is fit, in investigating the nature of the body and the essence of the soul, apprehend the end of each, and not regard death as an evil. \"For when ye were the servants of sin,\" says the apostle, \"ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things in which ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now, being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.\"[fn-66-P6636_2019884:14-nf] The assertion, then, may be hazarded, that it has been shown that death is the fellowship of the soul in a state of sin with the body; and life the separation from sin. And many are the stakes and ditches of lust which impede us, and the pits of wrath and anger which must be overleaped, and all the machinations we must avoid of those who plot against us,-who would no longer see the knowledge of God \"through a glass.\"","title":"Book IV.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":6,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_16_homily_viii_the_creation_of_fowl_and_water_animals_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"4. What a variety, I have said, in the actions and lives of flying creatures. Some of these unreasoning creatures even have a government, if the feature of government is to make the activity of all the individuals centrein one common end. This may be observed in bees. They have a common dwelling place; they fly in the air together, they work at thesame work together; and what is still more extraordinary is that they give themselves to these labours under the guidance of a king and superintendent, and that they do not allow themselves to fly to the meadows without seeing if the king is flying at their head. As to this king, it is not election that gives him this authority; ignorance on the part of the people often puts the worst man in power; it is not fate; the blind decisions of fate often give authority to the most unworthy. It is not heredity that places him on the throne; it is only too common to see the children of kings, corrupted by luxury and flattery, living in ignorance of all virtue. It is nature which makes the king of the bees, for nature gives him superior size, beauty, and sweetness of character. He has a sting like the others, but he does not use it to revenge himself.[fn-24-P2432_800729:19-nf] It is a principle of natural and unwritten law, that those who are raised to high office, ought to be lenient in punishing. Even bees who do not follow the example of their king, repent without delay of their imprudence, since they lose their lives with their sting. Listen, Christians, you to whom it is forbidden to \"recompense evil for evil\" and commanded \"to overcome evil with good.\"[fn-24-P2433_801433:20-nf] Take the bee for your model, which constructs its cells without injuring any one and without interfering with the goods of others. It gathers openly wax from the flowers with its mouth, drawing in the honey scattered over them like dew, and injects it into the hollow of its cells. Thus at first honey is liquid; time thickens it and gives it its sweetness.[fn-24-P2434_801814:21-nf] The book of Proverbs has given the bee the most honourable and the best praise by calling her wise and industrious.[fn-24-P2435_802523:22-nf] How much activity she exerts in gathering this precious nourishment, by which both kings and men of low degree are brought to health! How great is the art and cunning she displays in the construction of the store houses which are destined to receive the honey! After having spread the wax like a thin membrane, she distributes it in contiguous compartments which, weak though they are, by their number and by their mass, sustain the whole edifice. Each cell in fact holds to the one next to it, and is separated by a thin partition; we thus see two or three galleries of cells built one upon the other. The bee takes care not to make one vast cavity, for fear it might break trader the weight of the liquid, and allow it to escape. See how the discoveries of geometry are mere by-works to the wise bee![fn-24-P2436_803396:23-nf] ","title":"Homily VIII.-The Creation of Fowl and Water Animals.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":6,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_26_the_second_epistle_of_the_same_clement_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Hast thou not heard concerning Samson the Nazarite, \"with whom was the Spirit of God,\"[fn-11-P1171_288157:42-nf] the man of great strength?

The kingdom of the heavens, then, must be contemplation. Now we behold their shadows as in a glass; hereafter, set free from this earthly body, clad in the incorruptible and the immortal, we shall behold their archetypes, we shall see them, that is, if we have steered our own life's course aright, and if we have heeded the right faith, for otherwise none shall see the Lord.

It seems to me perfectly absurd, while the senses are allowed free action in relation to their proper matter, to exclude mind alone from its peculiar operation. Precisely in the same manner in which sense touches sensible objects, so mind apprehends the objects of mental perception. This too must be said that God our Creator has not included natural faculties among things which can be taught. No one teaches sight to apprehend colour or form, nor hearing to apprehend sound and speech, nor smell, pleasant and unpleasant scents, nor taste, flavours and savours, nor touch, soft and hard, hot and cold. Nor would any one teach the mind to reach objects of mental perception; and just as the senses in the case of their being in any way diseased, or injured, require only proper treatment and then readily fulfil their own functions; just so the mind, imprisoned in flesh. and full of the thoughts that arise thence, requires faith anti right conversation which make \"its feet like hinds' feet. and set it on its high places.\"[fn-27-P2754_928847:90-nf] The same advice is given us by Solomon the wise, who in one passage offers us the example of the diligent worker the ant,[fn-27-P2755_928989:91-nf] and recommends her active life; and in another the work of the wise bee in forming its cells,[fn-27-P2756_929105:92-nf] and thereby suggests a natural contemplation wherein also the doctrine of the Holy Trinity is contained, if at least the Creator is considered in proportion to the beauty of the things created.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":6,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_60_letter_xlii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2. Vain then is the labour of the righteous man, and free from blame is the way of the sinner, if a change befall, and the former turn from the better to the worse, and the latter from the worse to the better. So we hear from Ezekiel teaching as it were in the name of the Lord, when he says, \"if the righteous turneth away and committeth iniquity, I will not remember the righteousness which he committed before; in his sin he shall die,\"[fn-31-P3177_1041989:4-nf] and so too about the sinner; if he turn away from his wickedness, and do that which is right, he shall live. Where were all the labours of God's servant Moses, when the gainsaying of one moment shut him out from entering into the promised land? What became of the companionship of Gehazi with Elissaeus, when he brought leprosy on himself by his covetousness? What availed all Solomon's vast wisdom, and his previous regard for God, when afterwards from his mad love of women he fell into idolatry? Not even the blessed David was blameless, when his thoughts went astray and he sinned against the wife of Uriah. One example were surely enough for keeping safe one who is living a godly life, the fall from the better to the worse of Judas, who, after being so long Christ's disciple, for a mean gain sold his Master and got a halter for himself. Learn then, brother, that it is not he who begins well who is perfect. It is he who ends well who is approved in God's sight. Give then no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids[fn-31-P3178_1043044:5-nf] that you may be delivered \"as a roe from the net and a bird from the snare.\"[fn-31-P3179_1043143:6-nf] For, behold, you are passing through the midst of snares; you are treading on the top of a high wall whence a fall is perilous to the fuller; wherefore do not straightway attempt extreme discipline; above all things beware of confidence in yourself, lest you fall from a height of discipline through want of training. It is better to advance a little at a time. Withdraw then by degrees from the pleasures of life, gradually destroying all your wonted habits, lest you bring on yourself a crowd of temptations by irritating all your passions at once. When you have mastered one passion, then begin to wage war against another, and in this manner you will in good time get the better of all. Indulgence, so far as the name goes, is one, but its practical workings are diverse. First then, brother, meet every temptation with patient endurance. And by what various temptations the faithful man is proved; by worldly loss, by accusations, by lies, by opposition, by calumny, by persecution! These and the like are the tests of the faithful. Further, be quiet, not rash in speech, not quarrelsome, not disputatious, not covetous of vain glory, not more anxious to get than to give knowledge,[fn-31-P3180_1044352:7-nf] not a man of many words, but always more ready to learn than to teach. Do not trouble yourself about worldly life; from it no good can come to you. It is said, \"That my mouth speak not the works of men.\"[fn-31-P3181_1044638:8-nf] The man who is fond of talking about sinners' doings, soon rouses the desire for self indulgence; much better busy yourself about the lives of good men for so you will get some profit for yourself. Do not be anxious to go travelling about[fn-31-P3182_1044897:9-nf] from village to village anti house to house; rather avoid them as traps for souls. If any one, for true pity's sake, invite you with many pleas to enter his house, let him be told to follow the faith of the centurion, who, when Jesus was hastening to him to perform an act of healing, besought him not to do so in the words, \"Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed,\"[fn-31-P3183_1045387:10-nf] and when Jesus had said to him \"Go thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee,\"[fn-31-P3184_1045500:11-nf] his servant was healed from that hour. Learn then, brother, that it was the faith of the suppliant, not the presence of Christ, which delivered the sick man. So too now, if you pray, in whatever place you be, and the sick man believes that he will be aided by your prayers, all will fall out as he desires.","title":"Letter XLII","author":"St. Basil"}]
