{"verses":["And the angel that spoke in me came again:  and he waked me, as a\nman that is wakened out of his sleep.","And he said to me:  What seest thou?  And I said:  I have looked,\nand behold a candlestick all of gold, and its lamp upon the top of it:\nand the seven lights thereof upon it:  and seven funnels for the lights\nthat were upon the top thereof.","And two olive trees over it:  one upon the right side of the lamp,\nand the other upon the left side thereof.","And I answered, and said to the angel that spoke in me, saying:\nWhat are these things, my lord?","And the angel that spoke in me answered, and said to me:  Knowest\nthou not what these things are?  And I said:  No, my lord.","And he answered, and spoke to me, saying:  This is the word of the\nLord to Zorobabel, saying:  Not with an army, nor by might, but by my\nspirit, saith the Lord of hosts.","Who art thou, O great mountain, before Zorobabel?  thou shalt\nbecome a plain:  and he shall bring out the chief stone, and shall give\nequal grace to the grace thereof.","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundations of this house,\nand his hands shall finish it:  and you shall know that the Lord of\nhosts hath sent me to you.","For who hath despised little days?  and they shall rejoice, and\nshall see the tin plummet in the hand of Zorobabel.  These are the seven\neyes of the Lord, that run to and fro through the whole earth.","And I answered, and said to him:  What are these two olive trees\nupon the right side of the candlestick, and upon the left side thereof\n?","And I answered again, and said to him:  What are the two olive\nbranches, that are by the two golden beaks, in which are the funnels of\ngold?","And he spoke to me, saying:  Knowest thou not what these are?  And\nI said:  No, my lord.","And he said:  These are two sons of oil who stand before the Lord\nof the whole earth."]}
