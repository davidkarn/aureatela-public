And he\nsaid to me:  These are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel,\nand Jerusalem.","And the Lord shewed me four smiths.","And I said:  What come these to do?  and he spoke, saying:  These\nare the horns which have scattered Juda every man apart, and none of\nthem lifted up his head:  and these are come to fray them, to cast down\nthe horns of the nations, that have lifted up the horn upon the land of\nJuda to scatter it."]}
