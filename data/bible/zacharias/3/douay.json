And he said to him:  Behold I have\ntaken away thy iniquity, and have clothed thee with change of garments.","And he said:  Put a clean mitre upon his head:  and they put a clean\nmitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and the angel of\nthe Lord stood.","And the angel of the Lord protested to Jesus, saying:","Thus saith the Lord of hosts:  If thou wilt walk in my ways, and\nkeep my charge, thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt keep my\ncourts, and I will give thee some of them that are now present here to\nwalk with thee.","Hear, O Jesus thou high priest, thou and thy friends that dwell\nbefore thee, for they are portending men:  for behold, I WILL BRING MY\nSERVANT THE ORIENT.","For behold the stone that I have laid before Jesus:  upon one stone\nthere are seven eyes:  behold I will grave the graving thereof, saith\nthe Lord of hosts:  and I will take away the iniquity of that land in\none day.","In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, every man shall call his\nfriend under the vine and under the fig tree."]}
