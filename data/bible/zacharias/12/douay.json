{"verses":["The burden of the word of the Lord upon Israel.  Thus saith the\nLord, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundations of\nthe earth, and formeth the spirit of man in him:","Behold I will make Jerusalem a lintel of surfeiting to all the\npeople round about:  and Juda also shall be in the siege against\nJerusalem.","And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make Jerusalem\na burdensome stone to all people:  all that shall lift it up shall be\nrent and torn, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall be gathered\ntogether against her.","In that day, saith the Lord, I will strike every horse with\nastonishment, and his rider with madness:  and I will open my eyes upon\nthe house of Juda, and will strike every horse of the nations with\nblindness.","And the governors of Juda shall say in their heart:  Let the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem be strengthened for me in the Lord of hosts,\ntheir God.","In that day I will make the governors of Juda like a furnace of\nfire amongst wood, and as a firebrand amongst hay:  and they shall\ndevour all the people round about, to the right hand, and to the left:\nand Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place in Jerusalem.","And the Lord shall save the tabernacles of Jada, as in the\nbeginning:  that the house of David, and the glory of the inhabitants of\nJerusalem, may not boast and magnify themselves against Juda.","In that day shall the Lord protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem,\nand he that hath offended among them in that day shall be as David:  and\nthe house of David, as that of God, as an angel of the Lord in their\nsight.","And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to\ndestroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.","And I will pour out upon the house of David, and upon the\ninhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace, and of prayers:  and they\nshall look upon me, whom they have pierced:  and they shall mourn for\nhim as one mourneth for an only son, and they shall grieve over him, as\nthe manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn.","In that day there shall be a great lamentation in Jerusalem like\nthe lamentation of Adadremmon in the plain of Mageddon.","And the land shall mourn:  families and families apart:  the\nfamilies of the house of David apart, and their women apart:","The families of the house of Nathan apart, and their women\napart:  the families of the house of Levi apart, and their women apart:\nthe families of Semei apart, and their women apart.","All the rest of the families, families and families apart, and\ntheir women apart."]}
