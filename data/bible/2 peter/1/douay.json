For doing these things, you shall\nnot sin at any time.","For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the\never-lasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.","For which cause, I will begin to put you always in remembrance of\nthese things:  though indeed you know them and are confirmed in the\npresent truth.","But I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir\nyou up by putting you in remembrance.","Being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at\nhand, according as our Lord Jesus Christ also hath signified to me.","And I will endeavour that you frequently have after my decease\nwhereby you may keep a memory of these things.","For we have not by following artificial fables made known to you\nthe power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ:  but we were\neyewitnesses of his greatness.","For he received from God the Father honour and glory, this voice\ncoming down to him from the excellent glory:  This is my beloved Son, in\nwhom I am well pleased.  Hear ye him.","And this voice, we heard brought from heaven, when we were with\nhim in the holy mount.","And we have the more firm prophetical word:  whereunto you do well\nto attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day\ndawn and the day star arise in your hearts.","Understanding this first:  That no prophecy of scripture is made\nby private interpretation.","For prophecy came not by the will of man at any time:  but the\nholy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost."]}
