{"verses":["Behold this second epistle I write to you, my dearly beloved, in\nwhich, I stir up by way of admonition your sincere mind:","That you may be mindful of those words which I told you before\nfrom the holy prophet and of your apostles, of the precepts of the Lord\nand Saviour.","Knowing this first:  That in the last days there shall come\ndeceitful scoffers, walking after their own lusts,","Saying:  Where is his promise or his coming?  For since the time\nthat the fathers slept, all things continue as they were from the\nbeginning of the creation.","For this they are wilfully ignorant of:  That the heavens were\nbefore, and the earth out of water and through water, consisting by the\nword of God:","Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,\nperished.","But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are\nkept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and\nperdition of the ungodly men.","But of this one thing be not ignorant, my beloved, that one day\nwith the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.","The Lord delayeth not his promise, as some imagine, but dealeth\npatiently for your sake, not willing that any should perish, but that\nall should return to penance,","But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief, in which the\nheavens shall pass away with great violence and the elements shall be\nmelted with heat and the earth and the works which are in it shall be\nburnt up.","Seeing then that all these things are to be dissolved, what\nmanner of people ought you to be in holy conversation and godliness?","Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of the Lord,\nby which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements\nshall melt with the burning heat?","But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to his\npromises, in which justice dwelleth.","Wherefore, dearly beloved, waiting for these things, be diligent\nthat you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in peace.","And account the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation:  as also our\nmost dear brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, hath written\nto you:","As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in\nwhich are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and\nunstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own\ndestruction.","You therefore, brethren, knowing these things before, take heed,\nlest being led aside by the error of the unwise, you fall from your own\nsteadfastness.","But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour\nJesus Christ.  To him be glory both now and unto the day of eternity,\nAmen."]}
