He did not, as one might have imagined, send to men any servant, or angel, or ruler, or any one of those who bear sway over earthly things, or one of those to whom the government of things in the heavens has been entrusted, but the very Creator and Fashioner of all things-by whom He made the heavens-by whom he enclosed the sea within its proper bounds-whose ordinances[fn-6-P690_126077:32-nf] all the stars[fn-6-P691_126120:33-nf] faithfully observe-from whom the sun[fn-6-P692_126185:34-nf] has received the measure of his daily course to be observed[fn-6-P693_126325:35-nf] -whom the moon obeys, being commanded to shine in the night, and whom the stars also obey, following the moon in her course; by whom all things have been arranged, and placed within their proper limits, and to whom all are subject-the heavens and the things that are therein, the earth and the things that are therein, the sea and the things that are therein-fire, air, and the abyss-the things which are in the heights, the things which are in the depths, and the things which lie between. This [messenger] He sent to them. Was it then, as one[fn-6-P694_126913:36-nf] might conceive, for the purpose of exercising tyranny, or of inspiring fear and terror? By no means, but under the influence of clemency and meekness. As a king sends his son, who is also a king, so sent He Him; as God[fn-6-P695_127162:37-nf] He sent Him; as to men He sent Him; as a Saviour He sent Him, and as seeking to persuade, not to compel us; for violence has no place in the character of God.

I refer to these passages, not to convict the evangelists of falsification-a charge worthy only of impious men like Celsus, Porphyry, and Julian-but to bring home to my critics their own want of knowledge, and to gain from them such consideration that they may concede to me in the case of a simple letter what, whether they like it or not, they will have to concede to the Apostles in the Holy Scriptures. Mark, the disciple of Peter, begins his gospel thus:-\"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: Behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.\"[fn-23-P2377_607038:1696-nf] This quotation is made up from two prophets, Malachi that is to say and Isaiah. For the first part: \"Behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee,\" occurs at the close of Malachi.[fn-23-P2378_607286:1697-nf] But the second part: \"The voice of one crying, etc.,\" we read in Isaiah.[fn-23-P2379_607381:1698-nf] On what grounds then has Mark in the very beginning of his book set the words: \"As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, Behold I send my messenger,\" when, as we have said, it is not written in Isaiah at all, but in Malachi the last of the twelve prophets? Let ignorant presumption solve this nice question if it can, and I will ask pardon for being in the wrong. The same Mark brings before us the Saviour thus addressing the Pharisees: \"Have ye never read what David did when he had need and was an hungred, he and they that were with him, how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the highpriest, and did eat the shew-bread which is not lawful to eat but for the priests?\"[fn-23-P2380_608094:1699-nf] Now let us turn to the books of Samuel, or, as they are commonly called, of Kings, and we shall find there that the highpriest's name was not Abiathar but Ahimelech,[fn-23-P2381_608295:1700-nf] the same that was afterwards put to death with the rest of the priests by Doeg at the command of Saul.[fn-23-P2382_608422:1701-nf] Let us pass on now to the apostle Paul who writes thus to the Corinthians: \"For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is written, Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.\"[fn-23-P2383_608759:1702-nf] Some writers on this passage betake themselves to the ravings of the apocryphal books and assert that the quotation comes from the Revelation of Elijah;[fn-23-P2384_608949:1703-nf] whereas the truth is that it is found in Isaiah according to the Hebrew text: \"Since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee what thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee.\"[fn-23-P2385_609298:1704-nf] The Septuagint has rendered the words quite differently: \"Since the beginning of the world we have not heard, neither have our eyes seen any God beside thee and thy true works, and thou wilt shew mercy to them that wait for thee.\" We see then from what place the quotation is taken and yet the apostle has not rendered his original word for word, but, using a paraphrase, he has given the sense in different terms. In his epistle to the Romans the same apostle quotes these words from Isaiah: \"Behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone and rock of offence,\"[fn-23-P2386_609945:1705-nf] a rendering which is at variance with the Greek version[fn-23-P2387_610023:1706-nf] yet agrees with the original Hebrew. The Septuagint gives an opposite meaning, \"that you fall not on a stumblingstone nor on a rock of offence.\" The apostle Peter agrees with Paul and the Hebrew, writing: \"but to them that do not believe, a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence.\"[fn-23-P2388_610347:1707-nf] From all these passages it is clear that the apostles and evangelists in translating the old testament scriptures have sought to give the meaning rather than the words, and that they have not greatly cared to preserve forms or constructions, so long as they could make clear the subject to the understanding.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1544","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2.

Training yourself to an emulation of (their) constancy by the examples of such women, you will by spiritual affection bury that fleshly concupiscence, in abolishing the temporal[fn-7-P760_185526:41-nf] and fleeting desires of beauty and youth by the compensating gain of immortal blessings.","title":"Book I.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_06_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Some one accordingly asked them whether the Word of God could be changed, as the devil has been? and they feared not to say, `Yes, he could; for being begotten, he is susceptible of change' We then, with the bishops of Egypt and Libya, being assembled together to the number of nearly a hundred, have anathematized Arius for his shameless avowal of these heresies, together with all such as have countenanced them. Yet the partisans of Eusebius have received them; endeavoring to blend falsehood with truth, and that which is impious with what is sacred. But they shall not prevail, for the truth must triumph; and `light has no fellowship with darkness, nor has Christ any concord with Belial.'[fn-2-P217_57819:16-nf] Who ever heard such blasphemies? or what man of any piety is there now hearing them that is not horror-struck, and stops his ears, lest the filth of these expressions should pollute his sense of hearing? Who that hears John saying, `In the beginning was the Word,'[fn-2-P218_58104:17-nf] does not condemn those that say, `There was a period when the Word was not'? or who, hearing in the Gospel of `the only-begotten Son,' and that `all things were made by him,' will not abhor those that pronounce the Son to be one of the things made? How can he be one of the things which were made by himself? Or how can he be the only-begotten, if he is reckoned among created things? And how could he have had his existence from nonentities, since the Father has said, `My heart has indited a good matter';[fn-2-P219_58643:18-nf] and `I begat thee out of my bosom before the dawn'?[fn-2-P220_58735:19-nf] Or how is he unlike the Father's essence, who is `his perfect image,'[fn-2-P221_58901:20-nf] and `the brightness of his glory'[fn-2-P222_58952:21-nf] and says: `He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father'? Again how if the Son is the Word and Wisdom of God, was there a period when he did not exist? for that is equivalent to their saying that God was once destitute both of Word and Wisdom. How can he be mutable and susceptible of change, who says of himself, `I am in the Father, and the Father in me';[fn-2-P223_59324:22-nf] and `I and the Father are one';[fn-2-P224_59375:23-nf] and again by the Prophet,[fn-2-P225_59418:24-nf] `Behold me because I am, and have not changed'? But if any one may also apply the expression to the Father himself, yet would it now be even more fifty said of the Word; because he was not changed by having become man, but as the Apostle says,[fn-2-P226_59680:25-nf] `Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and forever' But what could persuade them to say that he was made on our account, when Paul has expressly declared[fn-2-P227_59857:26-nf] that `all things are for him, and by him'? One need not wonder indeed at their blasphemous assertion that the Son does not perfectly know the Father; for having once determined to fight against Christ, they reject even the words of the Lord himself, when he says,[fn-2-P228_60139:27-nf] `As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father' If therefore the Father but partially knows the Son, it is manifest that the Son also knows the Father but in part. But if it would be improper to affirm this, and it be admitted that the Father perfectly knows the Son, it is evident that as the Father knows his own Word, so also does the Word know his own Father, whose Word he is. And we, by stating these things, and unfolding the divine Scriptures, have often confuted them: but again as chameleons they were changed, striving to apply to themselves that which is written, `When the ungodly has reached the depths of iniquity, he becomes contemptuous.'[fn-2-P229_60817:28-nf] Many heresies have arisen before these, which exceeding all bounds in daring, have lapsed into complete infatuation: but these persons, by attempting in all their discourses to subvert the Divinity of The Word, as hating made a nearer approach to Antichrist, have comparatively lessened the odium of former ones. Wherefore they have been publicly repudiated by the Church, and anathematized. We are indeed grieved on account of the perdition of these persons, and especially so because, after having been previously instructed in the doctrines of the Church, they have now apostatized from them. Nevertheless we are not greatly surprised at this, for Hymenaeus and Philetus[fn-2-P230_61534:29-nf] fell in like manner; and before them Judas, who had been a follower of the Saviour, but afterwards deserted him became his betrayer. Nor were we without forewarning respecting these very persons: for the Lord himself said: `Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ: and shall many deceive many';[fn-2-P231_61911:30-nf] and `the time is at hand; Go ye not therefore after them.'[fn-2-P232_61990:31-nf] And Paul, having learned these things from the Saviour, wrote, `That in the latter times some should apostatize from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits, and doctrines of devils,'[fn-2-P233_62196:32-nf] who pervert the truth. Seeing then that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has himself enjoined this, and has also by the apostle given us intimation respecting such men, we having ourselves heard their impiety have in consequence anathematized them, as we before said, and declared them to be alienated from the Catholic Church and faith. Moreover we have intimated this to your piety, beloved and most honored fellow-ministers, in order the ye might neither receive any of them, if they should presume to come to you, nor be induced to put confidence in Eusebius, or any other who may write to you about them. For it is incumbent on us who are Christians, to turn away from all those who speak or entertain a thought against Christ, as from those who are resisting God, and are destroyers of the souls of men: neither does it become us even `to saute such men,'[fn-2-P234_63088:33-nf] as the blessed John has prohibited, `lest we should at any time be made partakers of their sins.'

The majority it is true of those who are not very sensibly minded propose to be content with escaping hell; but I say that a far more severe punishment than hell is exclusion from the glory of the other world, and I think that one who has failed to reach it ought not to sorrow so much over the miseries of hell, as over his rejection from heaven, for this alone is more dreadful than all other things in respect of punishment. But frequently now when we see a king, attended by a large bodyguard, enter the palace, we count those happy who are near him, and have a share in his speech and mind, and partake of all the rest of his glory; and even if we have countless blessings, we have no perception of any of them, and deem ourselves miserable when we look at the glory of those who are round about him, although we know that such splendour is slippery and insecure, both on account of wars, and plots, and envy, and because apart from these things it is not in itself worthy of any consideration. But where the king of all is concerned, he who holds not a portion of the earth but the whole circuit of it, or rather who comprehends it all in the hollow of his hand, and measures the Heavens with a span, who upholdeth all things by the word of His power,[fn-6-P653_380206:36-nf] by whom all the nations are counted as nought, and as a drop of spittle;-in the case of such a king I say shall we no reckon it the most extreme punishment to miss being enrolled in that company which is round about him, but be content if we merely escape hell? and what could be more pitiable than this condition of soul? For this king does not come to judge the earth, drawn by a pair of white mules, nor tiding in a golden chariot, nor arrayed in a purple robe and diadem. How then does He come? Hear the prophets crying aloud and saying as much as it is possible to tell to men: for one saith \"God shall come openly, even our God and shall not keep silence: a fire shall be kindled before Him, and a mighty tempest shall be round about Him: He shall call the Heaven from above and the earth that He may judge His people.\"[fn-6-P654_381126:37-nf] But Esias depicts the actual punishment impending over us speaking thus: \"Behold the day of the Lord cometh, inexorable, with wrath and anger; to lay the whole world desolate, and to destroy sinners out of it. For the stars of Heaven, and Orion, and the whole system of the heaven shall not give their light, and the sun shall be darkened in its going down,[fn-6-P655_381501:38-nf] and the moon shall not give her light; and I will ordain evils against the whole world, and visit their sins upon the ungodly, and I will destroy the insolence of the lawless, and humble the insolence of the proud, and they who are left shall be more precious than unsmelted gold, and a man shall be more precious than the sapphire stone. For the heaven shall be disturbed[fn-6-P656_381920:39-nf] and the earth shall be shaken from its foundations by reason of the fury of the wrath of the Lord of Sabaoth, in the day when His wrath shall come upon us.\"[fn-6-P657_382133:40-nf] And again \"windows\" he saith \"hall be opened from the Heaven, and the foundations of the earth shall be shaken the earth shall be mightily confounded, the earth shall be bent low, it shall be perplexed with great perplexity, the earth shall stagger grievously like the drunkard and the reveller; the earth shall shake as a hut, it shall fall and not be able to rise up again: for iniquity has waxed mighty therein. And God shall set His hand upon the host of the Heaven in the height in that day, and upon the kingdoms of the earth, and He shall gather together the congregation thereof into a prison, and shall shut them up in a stronghold.\"[fn-6-P658_382800:41-nf] And Malachi speaking concordantly with these said \"Behold the Lord almighty cometh, and who shall abide the day of His coming or who shall stand when He appeareth for He cometh like a refiner's fire, and like fullers soap: and He shall sit refining and purifying as it were silver, and as it were gold.\"[fn-6-P659_383165:42-nf] And again, \"Behold,\" he saith, \"the day of the Lord cometh, burning like an oven, and it shall consume them, and all the aliens, and all who work iniquity shall be stubble, and the day which is coming shall set fire to them saith the Lord almighty; and there shall be left neither root nor branch.\"[fn-6-P660_383487:43-nf] And the man greatly beloved saith \"I beheld until thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days was seated, and his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head was pure as wool: His throne was a flame of fire, and the wheels thereof burning fire: a stream of fire wound its way in front of Him. Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The judgment was set and the books were opened.\"[fn-6-P661_383950:44-nf] Then after a little space \"I beheld,\" he says, \"in a vision of the night and behold\" with the clouds of Heaven, one came like the Son of Man, and reached unto the Ancient of Days, and was brought near before Him, and to Him was given rule, and honor, and the kingdom, and all the people, tribes and tongues serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed. As for me Daniel, my spirit shuddered within me, and the visions of my head troubled me.\"[fn-6-P662_384587:45-nf] Then all the gates of the heavenly vaults are opened, or rather the heaven itself is taken away out of the midst \"for the heaven,\" we read \"shall be rolled up like a scroll,\"[fn-6-P663_384832:46-nf] wrapped up in the middle like the skin and covering of some tent so as to be transformed into some better shape. Then all things are full of amazement and horror and trembling: then even the angels themselves are holden by much fear, and not angels only but also archangels and thrones, and dominions, and principalities and authorities. \"For the powers\" we read \"of the heavens shall be shaken,\" because their fellow-servants are required to give an account of their life in this world.[fn-6-P664_385342:47-nf] For if when a single city is bring judged before rulers in this world, all men shudder, even those who are outside the danger, when the whole world is arraigned before such a judge as this who needs no witnesses, or proofs, but independently of all these things brings forward deeds and words and thoughts, and exhibits them all as in some picture both to those who have committed the sins and to those who are ignorant of them, how is it not natural that every power should be confounded and shake? For if there were no river of fire winding by, nor any terrible angels standing by the side of the throne, but men were merely summoned some to be praised and admired, others to be dismissed with ignominy that they might not see the glory of God, (\"For let the ungodly\" we read \"be taken away that he may not see the glory of the Lord\"[fn-6-P665_386200:48-nf] ) and if this were the only punishment would not the loss of such blessings sting the souls of those who were deprived of them more bitterly than all hell itself? For how great an evil this is cannot possibly be represented now in words; but then we shall know it clearly in the actual reality. But now I pray add the punishment also to the scene, and imagine men not only covered with shame, and veiling their heads, and bending them low, but also being dragged along the road to the fire, and haled away to the instruments of torture and delivered over to the cruel powers, and suffering these things just at the time when all they who have practised what is good, and wrought deeds worthy of eternal life, are being crowned, and proclaimed conquerors, and presented before the royal throne.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_106_epistles_on_the_arian_heresy","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"ANF-06","text":"3.

This we first assert to have been a figure of the future. For, because Jesus Christ was to introduce the second people (which is composed of us nations, lingering deserted in the world[fn-22-P2287_757601:164-nf] aforetime) into the land of promise, \"flowing with milk and honey\"[fn-22-P2288_757983:165-nf] (that is, into the possession of eternal life, than which nought is sweeter); and this had to come about, not through Moses (that is, not through the Law's discipline), but through Joshua (that is, through the new law's grace), after our circumcision with \"a knife of rock\"[fn-22-P2289_758306:166-nf] (that is, with Christ's precepts, for Christ is in many ways and figures predicted as a rock[fn-22-P2290_758584:167-nf] ); therefore the man who was being prepared to act as images of this sacrament was inaugurated under the figure of the Lord's name, even so as to be named Jesus.[fn-22-P2291_758781:168-nf] For He who ever spake to Moses was the Son of God Himself; who, too, was always seen.[fn-22-P2292_758888:169-nf] For God the Father none ever saw, and lived.[fn-22-P2293_758961:170-nf] And accordingly it is agreed that the Son of God Himself spake to Moses, and said to the people, \"Behold, I send mine angel before thy\"-that is, the people's-\"face, to guard thee on the march, and to introduce thee into the land which I have prepared thee: attend to him, and be not disobedient to him; for he hath not escaped[fn-22-P2294_759360:171-nf] thy notice, since my name is upon him.\"[fn-22-P2295_759553:172-nf] For Joshua was to introduce the people into the land of promise, not Moses.

For just as He is called a servant on account of the form of a servant in which He came to men, so He is called an angel on account of the evangel which He proclaimed to men. For if we interpret these Greek words, evangel is \"good news,\" and angel is \"messenger.\" Again he says of Him, \"Behold I will send mine angel, and He will look out the way before my face: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come into His temple, even the Angel of the testament, whom ye desire. Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand at His appearing?\"[fn-34-P3490_1885985:74-nf] In this place he has foretold both the first and second advent of Christ: the first, to wit, of which he says, \"And He shall come suddenly into His temple;\" that is, into His flesh, of which He said in the Gospel, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\"[fn-34-P3491_1886287:75-nf] And of the second advent he says, \"Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand at His appearing?\" But what he says, \"The Lord whom ye seek, and the Angel of the testament whom ye desire,\" just means that even the Jews, according to the Scriptures which they read, shall seek and desire Christ. But many of them did not acknowledge that He whom they sought and desired had come, being blinded in their hearts, which were preoccupied with their own merits. Now what he here calls the testament, either above, where he says, \"My testament had been with Him,\" or here, where he has called Him the Angel of the testament, we ought, beyond a doubt, to take to be the new testament, in which the things promised are eternal, and not the old, in which they are only temporal. Yet many who are weak are troubled when they see the wicked abound in such temporal things, because they value them greatly, and serve the true God to be rewarded with them. On this account, to distinguish the eternal blessedness of the new testament, which shall be given only to the good, from the earthly felicity of the old, which for the most part is given to the bad as well, the same prophet says, \"Ye have made your words burdensome to me: yet ye have said, In what have we spoken ill of Thee? Ye have said, Foolish is every one who serves God; and what profit is it that we have kept His observances, and that we have walked as suppliants before the face of the Lord Almighty? And now we call the aliens blessed; yea, all that do wicked things are built up again; yea, they are opposed to God and are saved. They that feared the Lord uttered these reproaches every one to his neighbor: and the Lord hearkened and heard; and He wrote a book of remembrance before Him, for them that fear the Lord and that revere His name.\"[fn-34-P3492_1888166:76-nf] By that book is meant the New Testament. Finally, let us hear what follows: \"And they shall be an acquisition for me, saith the Lord Almighty, in the day which I make; and I will choose them as a man chooseth his son that serveth him. And ye shall return, and shall discern between the just and the unjust, and between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not. For, behold, the day cometh burning as an oven, and it shall burn them up; and all the aliens and all that do wickedly shall be stubble: and the day that shall come will set them on fire, saith the Lord Almighty, and shall leave neither root nor branch. And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, and health shall be in His wings; and ye shall go forth, and exult as calves let loose from bonds. And ye shall tread down the wicked, and they shall be ashes under your feet, in the day in which I shall do [this], saith the Lord Almighty.\"[fn-34-P3493_1889123:77-nf] This day is the day of judgment, of which, if God will, we shall speak more fully in its own place.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_24_book_xviii","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"174","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Malachi, foretelling the Church which we now behold propagated through Christ, says most openly to the Jews, in the person of God, \"I have no pleasure in you, and I will not accept a gift at your hand.

The Apostle then recognised that nothing can fall within our knowledge, except it be posterior in time to the faculty of sense. Accordingly when he had asserted the depth of the wisdom of God, the infinity of His inscrutable judgments, the secret of His un-searchable ways, the mystery of His unfathomable mind, the incomprehensibility of His uncommunicated counsel, he continued, For who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For of Him, and through Him, and in Him are all things. The eternal God is neither subject to limitation, nor did human reason and intelligence exercise their functions before He had His being. His whole being is therefore a depth, which we can neither examine nor penetrate. We say His whole being, not to define it as limited, but to understand it in its unlimited boundlessness: because of no one has He received His being, no antecedent giver can claim service from Him in return for a gift bestowed: for of Him and through Him and in Him are all things. He does not lack things that are of Him and through Him and in Him. The Source and Maker of all, Who contains all, Who is beyond all, does not need that which is within Him, the Creator His creatures, the Possessor His possessions. Nothing is prior to Him, nothing derived from any other than Him, nothing beyond Him. What element of fulness is still lacking in God, which time will supply to make Him all in all? Whence can He receive it, if outside Him is nothing, and while nothing is outside Him, He is eternally Himself? And if He is eternally Himself, and there is nothing outside Him, with what increase shall He be made full, by what addition shall He be made other than He is? Did He not say, I am and I change not[fn-22-P2288_1459370:80-nf] ? What possibility is there of change in Him? What scope for progress? What is prior to eternity? What more divine than God? The subjection of the Son will not therefore make God to be all in all, nor will any cause perfect Him, from Whom and through Whom and in Whom are all causes.

But when he says, \"And he shall purify the sons of Levi, and pour them out like gold and silver, and they shall offer to the Lord sacrifices in righteousness; and the sacrifices of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the Lord,\" he declares that those who shall be purified shall then please the Lord with sacrifices of righteousness, and consequently they themselves shall be purified from their own unrighteousness which made them displeasing to God. Now they themselves, when they have been purified, shall be sacrifices of complete and perfect righteousness; for what more acceptable offering can such persons make to God than themselves? But this question of purgatorial punishments we must defer to another time, to give it a more adequate treatment.

For as he proceeds, he says that the Son is the same distance below the Divine Nature as the nature of angels is subjected below His own, not indeed saying this in so many words, but endeavouring by what he does say to produce such an impression. The reader may judge for himself the meaning of his words: they run as follows,-\"Who, by being called `Angel,' clearly showed by Whom He published His words, and Who is the Existent, while by being addressed also as God, He showed His superiority over all things. For He Who is the God of all things that were made by Him, is the Angel of the God over all.\" Indignation rushes into my heart and interrupts my discourse, and under this emotion arguments are lost in a turmoil of anger roused by words like these. And perhaps I may be pardoned for feeling such emotion. For whose resentment would not be stirred within him at such profanity, when he remembers how the Apostle proclaims that every angelic nature is subject to the Lord, and in witness of his doctrine invokes the sublime utterances of the prophets:-\"When He bringeth the first-begotten into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him,\" and, \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever,\" and, \"Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail[fn-20-P2039_1232013:20-nf] \"? When the Apostle has gone through all this argument to demonstrate the unapproachable majesty of the Only-begotten God, what must I feel when I hear from the adversary of Christ that the Lord of Angels is Himself only an Angel,-and when he does not let such a statement fall by chance, but puts forth his strength to maintain this monstrous invention, so that it may be established that his Lord has no superiority over John and Moses? For the word says concerning them, \"This is he of whom it is written, `Behold I send my angel before thy face[fn-20-P2040_1232658:21-nf] .'\" John therefore is an angel. But the enemy of the Lord, even though he grants his Lord the name of God, yet makes Him out to be on a level with the deity of Moses, since he too was a servant of the God over all, and was constituted a god to the Egyptians[fn-20-P2041_1233084:22-nf] . And yet this phrase, \"over all,\" as has been previously observed, is common to the Son with the Father, the Apostle having expressly ascribed such a title to Him, when he says, \"Of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Who is God over all[fn-20-P2042_1233354:23-nf] .\" But this man degrades the Lord of angels to the rank of an angel, as though he had not heard that the angels are \"ministering spirits,\" and \"a flame of fire[fn-20-P2043_1233531:24-nf] .\" For by the use of these distinctive terms does the Apostle make the difference between the several subjects clear and unmistakable, defining the subordinate nature to be \"spirits\" and \"fire,\" and distinguishing the supreme power by the name of Godhead. And yet, though there are so many that proclaim the glory of the Only-begotten God, against them all Eunomius lifts up his single voice, calling the Christ \"an angel of the God over all,\" defining Him, by thus contrasting Him with the \"God over all,\" to be one of the \"all things,\" and, by giving Him the same name as the angels, trying to establish that He no wise differs from them in nature: for he has often previously said that all those things which share the same name cannot be different in nature. Does the argument, then, still lack its censors, as it concerns a man who proclaims in so many words that the \"Angel\" does not publish His own word, but that of the Existent? For it is by this means that he tries to show that the Word Who was in the beginning, the Word Who was God, is not Himself the Word, but is the Word of some other Word, being its minister and \"angel.\" And who knows not that the only opposite to the \"Existent\" is the nonexistent? so that he who contrasts the Son with the Existent, is clearly playing the Jew, robbing the Christian doctrine of the Person of the Only-begotten. For in saying that He is excluded from the title of the \"Existent,\" he is assuredly trying to establish also that He is outside the pale of existence: for surely if he grants Him existence, he will not quarrel about the sound of the word.","title":"Book XI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"412","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Even in the case of our own soul, when we say that it cannot die, we do not predicate weakness of it, but we proclaim its capacity of immortality. And similarly when we confess the immutability, impassibility, and immortality of God, we cannot attribute to the divine nature change, passion, or death. Suppose them to urge that God can do whatever He will, you must reply to them that He wishes to do nothing which it is not His nature to do; He is by nature good, therefore He does not wish anything evil; He is by nature just, therefore He does not wish anything unjust He is by nature true, therefore He abominates falsehood; He is by nature immutable, therefore He does not admit of change; and if He does not admit of change He is always in the same state and condition.

If He is naturally superior to change and mutation He has not become from immortal, mortal nor from impassible, passible, for had this been possible He would not have taken on Him our nature. But since He has an immortal nature, He took a body capable of suffering, and with the body a human soul. Both of these He kept unstained from the defilements of sin, and gave His soul for the sake of the souls that had sinned, and His body for the sake of the bodies that had died. And since the body that was assumed is described as body of the very only begotten Son of God, He refers the passion of the body to Himself. But the four evangelists testify that it was not the divine nature but the body which was nailed to the cross, all teaching with one voice that Joseph of Arimathea came to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus; that he took down the body of Jesus from the tree and wrapped in fine linen, and laid in his own new tomb the body of Jesus; that Mary the Magdalene came to the tomb seeking the body of Jesus and ran to His disciples, and reported these things when she could not find the body of Jesus.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":3,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Likewise, when extolling the centurion's faith, how incredible a thing it is, that He should confess that He had \"found so great a faith not even in Israel.\"[fn-59-P5944_1791927:655-nf] to whom Israel's faith was in no way interesting![fn-59-P5945_1792000:656-nf] But not from the fact (here stated by Christ)[fn-59-P5946_1792488:657-nf] could it have been of any interest to Him to approve and compare what was hitherto crude, nay, I might say, hitherto naught. Why, however, might He not have used the example of faith in another[fn-59-P5947_1792781:658-nf] god? Because, if He had done so, He would have said that no such faith had ever had existence in Israel; but as the case stands,[fn-59-P5948_1792933:659-nf] He intimates that He ought to have found so great a faith in Israel, inasmuch as He had indeed come for the purpose of finding it, being in truth the God and Christ of Israel, and had now stigmatized[fn-59-P5949_1793149:660-nf] it, only as one who would enforce and Uphold it. If, indeed, He had been its antagonist,[fn-59-P5950_1793258:661-nf] He would have preferred finding it to be such faith,[fn-59-P5951_1793327:662-nf] having come to weaken and destroy it rather than to approve of it. He raised also the widow's son from death.[fn-59-P5952_1793485:663-nf] This was not a strange miracle.[fn-59-P5953_1793541:664-nf] The Creator's prophets had wrought such; then why not His Son much rather? Now, so evidently had the Lord Christ introduced no other god for the working of so momentous a miracle as this, that all who were present gave glory to the Creator, saying: \"A great prophet is risen up among us, and God hath visited His people.\"[fn-59-P5954_1793882:665-nf] What God? He, of course, whose people they were, and from whom had come their prophets. But if they glorified the Creator, and Christ (on hearing them, and knowing their meaning) refrained from correcting them even in their very act of invoking[fn-59-P5955_1794148:666-nf] the Creator in that vast manifestation of His glory in this raising of the dead, undoubtedly He either announced no other God but Him, whom He thus permitted to be honoured in His own beneficent acts and miracles, or else how happens it that He quietly permitted these persons to remain so long in their error, especially as He came for the very purpose to cure them of their error? But John is offended[fn-59-P5956_1794584:667-nf] when he hears of the miracles of Christ, as of an alien god.[fn-59-P5957_1794761:668-nf] Well, I on my side[fn-59-P5958_1794869:669-nf] will first explain the reason of his offence, that I may the more easily explode the scandal[fn-59-P5959_1794974:670-nf] of our heretic. Now, that the very Lord Himself of all might, the Word and Spirit of the Father,[fn-59-P5960_1795171:671-nf] was operating and preaching on earth, it was necessary that the portion of the Holy Spirit which, in the form of the prophetic gift,[fn-59-P5961_1795780:672-nf] had been through John preparing the ways of the Lord, should now depart from John,[fn-59-P5962_1795898:673-nf] and return back again of course to the Lord, as to its all-embracing original.[fn-59-P5963_1796513:674-nf] Therefore John, being now an ordinary person, and only one of the many,[fn-59-P5964_1796620:675-nf] was offended indeed as a man, but not because he expected or thought of another Christ as teaching or doing nothing new, for he was not even expecting such a one.[fn-59-P5965_1796809:676-nf] Nobody will entertain doubts about any one whom (since he knows him not to exist) he has no expectation or thought of. Now John was quite sure that there was no other God but the Creator, even as a Jew, especially as a prophet.[fn-59-P5966_1797052:677-nf] Whatever doubt he felt was evidently rather[fn-59-P5967_1797120:678-nf] entertained about Him[fn-59-P5968_1797159:679-nf] whom he knew indeed to exist but knew not whether He were the very Christ. With this fear, therefore, even John asks the question, \"Art thou He that should come, or look we for another? \"[fn-59-P5969_1797361:680-nf] -simply inquiring whether He was come as He whom he was looking for. \"Art thou He that should come? \"i.e. Art thou the coming One? \"or look we for another? \"i.e. Is He whom we are expecting some other than Thou, if Thou art not He whom we expect to come? For he was supposing,[fn-59-P5970_1797659:681-nf] as all men then thought, from the similarity of the miraculous evidences,[fn-59-P5971_1797750:682-nf] that a prophet might possibly have been meanwhile sent, from whom the Lord Himself, whose coming was then expected, was different, and to whom He was superior.[fn-59-P5972_1797931:683-nf] And there lay John's difficulty.[fn-59-P5973_1797978:684-nf] He was in doubt whether He was actually come whom all men were looking for; whom, moreover, they ought to have recognised by His predicted works, even as the Lord sent word to John, that it was by means of these very works that He was to be recognised.[fn-59-P5974_1798249:685-nf] Now, inasmuch as these predictions evidently related to the Creator's Christ-as we have proved in the examination of each of them-it was perverse enough, if he gave himself out to be not the Christ of the Creator, and rested the proof of his statement on those very evidences whereby he was urging his claims to be received as the Creator's Christ. Far greater still is his perverseness when, not being the Christ of John,[fn-59-P5975_1798698:686-nf] he yet bestows on John his testimony, affirming him to be a prophet, nay more, his messenger,[fn-59-P5976_1798979:687-nf] applying to him the Scripture, \"Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.\"[fn-59-P5977_1799114:688-nf] He graciously[fn-59-P5978_1799172:689-nf] adduced the prophecy in the superior sense of the alternative mentioned by the perplexed John, in order that, by affirming that His own precursor was already come in the person of John, He might quench the doubt[fn-59-P5979_1799402:690-nf] which lurked in his question: \"Art thou He that, should come, or look we for another? \"Now that the forerunner had fulfilled his mission, and the way of the Lord was prepared, He ought now to be acknowledged as that (Christ) for whom the forerunner had made ready the way. That forerunner was indeed \"greater than all of women born; \"[fn-59-P5980_1799755:691-nf] but for all that, He who was least in the kingdom of God[fn-59-P5981_1799833:692-nf] was not subject to him;[fn-59-P5982_1799921:693-nf] as if the kingdom in which the least person was greater than John belonged to one God, while John, who was greater than all of women born, belonged himself to another God. For whether He speaks of any \"least person\" by reason of his humble position, or of Himself, as being thought to be less than John-since all were running into the wilderness after John rather than after Christ (\"What went ye out into the wilderness to see? \"[fn-59-P5983_1801460:694-nf] )-the Creator has equal right[fn-59-P5984_1801511:695-nf] to claim as His own both John, greater than any born of women, and Christ, or every \"least person in the kingdom of heaven,\" who was destined to be greater than John in that kingdom, although equally pertaining to the Creator, and who would be so much greater than the prophet,[fn-59-P5985_1801825:696-nf] because he would not have been offended at Christ, an infirmity which then lessened the greatness of John.We have already spoken of the forgiveness[fn-59-P5986_1802002:697-nf] of sins.

But this is not so, far be the thought. For he `takes hold of the seed of Abraham[fn-100-P10041_3593934:12-nf] ,' as the apostle said; whence it behoved Him to be made like His brethren in all things, and to take a Body like us. This is why Mary is truly presupposed, in order that He may take it from her, and offer it for us as His own. And this Isaiah pointed to in his prophecy, in the words: `Behold the Virgin[fn-100-P10042_3594257:13-nf] ,' while Gabriel is sent to her-not simply to a virgin, but `to a virgin betrothed to a man[fn-100-P10043_3594368:14-nf] ,' in order that by means of the betrothed man he might shew that Mary was really a human being. And for this reason Scripture also mentions her bringing forth, and tells of her wrapping Him in swaddling clothes; and therefore, too, the paps which He sucked were called blessed[fn-100-P10044_3594663:15-nf] . And He was offered as a sacrifice, in that He Who was born had opened the womb[fn-100-P10045_3594761:16-nf] . Now all these things are proofs that the Virgin brought forth. And Gabriel preached the Gospel to her without uncertainty, saying not merely `what is born in thee,' lest the body should be thought to be extraneously induced upon her, but `of thee,' that what was born might be believed to be naturally from her, inasmuch as Nature clearly shews that it is impossible for a virgin to produce milk unless she has brought forth, and impossible for a body to be nourished with milk and wrapped in swaddling clothes unless it has previously been naturally brought forth. This is the meaning of His being circumcised on the eighth day: of Symeon taking Him in his arms, of His becoming a young child, and growing when He was twelve years old, and of His coming to His thirtieth year. For it was not, as some suppose, the very Essence of the Word that was changed, and was circumcised, because it is incapable of alteration or change. For the Saviour Himself says, `Behold, behold, it is I, and I change not[fn-100-P10046_3595781:17-nf] ,' while Paul writes: `Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever[fn-100-P10047_3595881:18-nf] .'

There are also many other things which escape our notice, and are known to Him alone who is the physician of our souls. For if, on account of those bad effects which we bring upon ourselves by eating and drinking, we deem it necessary for the health of the body to make use of some unpleasant and painful drug, sometimes even, if the nature of the disease demand, requiring the severe process of the amputating knife; and if the virulence of the disease shall transcend even these remedies, the evil has at last to be burned out by fire; how much more is it to be understood that God our Physician, desiring to remove the defects of our souls, which they had contracted from their different sins and crimes, should employ penal measures of this sort, and should apply even, in addition, the punishment of fire to those who have lost their soundness of mind! Pictures of this method of procedure are found also in the holy Scriptures. In the book of Deuteronomy, the divine word threatens sinners with the punishments of fevers, and colds, and jaundice,[fn-67-P6722_1394128:179-nf] and with the pains of feebleness of vision, and alienation of mind and paralysis, and blindness, and weakness of the reins. If any one, then, at his leisure gather together out of the whole of Scripture all the enumerations of diseases which in the threatenings addressed to sinners are called by the names of bodily maladies, he will find that either the vices of souls, or their punishments, are figuratively indicated by them. To understand now, that in the same way in which physicians apply remedies to the sick, in order that by careful treatment they may recover their health, God so deals towards those who have lapsed and fallen into sin, is proved by this, that the cup of God's fury is ordered, through the agency of the prophet Jeremiah,[fn-67-P6723_1394921:180-nf] to be offered to all nations, that they may drink it, and be in a state of madness, and vomit it forth. In doing which, He threatens them, saying, That if any one refuse to drink, he shall not be cleansed.[fn-67-P6724_1395156:181-nf] By which certainly it is understood that the fury of God's vengeance is profitable for the purgation of souls. That the punishment, also, which is said to be applied by fire, is understood to be applied with the object of healing, is taught by Isaiah, who speaks thus of Israel: \"The Lord will wash away the filth of the sons or daughters of Zion, and shall purge away the blood from the midst of them by the spirit of judgment, and the spirit of burning.\"[fn-67-P6725_1395642:182-nf] Of the Chaldeans he thus speaks: \"Thou hast the coals of fire; sit upon them: they will be to thee a help.\"[fn-67-P6726_1395769:183-nf] And in other passages he says, \"The Lord will sanctify in a burning fire\"[fn-67-P6727_1395913:184-nf] and in the prophecies of Malachi he says, \"The Lord sitting will blow, and purify, and will pour forth the cleansed sons of Judah.\"[fn-67-P6728_1396078:185-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_18_deposition_of_arius","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"3.

Let us see, then, whether these two qualities are not to be observed in that which took place. That repayment, adequate to the debt, by which the deceiver was in his turn deceived, exhibits the justice of the dealing, while the object aimed at is a testimony to the goodness of Him who effected it. It is, indeed, the property of justice to assign to every one those particular results of which he has sunk already the foundations and the causes, just as the earth returns its harvests according to the kinds of seeds thrown into it; while it is the property of wisdom, in its very manner of giving equivalent returns, not to depart from the kinder course. Two persons may both mix poison with food, one with the design of taking life, the other with the design of saving that life; the one using it as a poison, the other only as an antidote to poison; and in no way does the manner of the cure adopted spoil the aim and purpose of the benefit intended; for although a mixture of poison with the food may be effected by both of these persons alike, yet looking at their intention we are indignant with the one and approve the other; so in this instance, by the reasonable rule of justice, he who practised deception receives in return that very treatment, the seeds of which he had himself sown of his own free will. He who first deceived man by the bait of sensual pleasure is himself deceived by the presentment of the human form. But as regards the aim and purpose of what took place, a change in the direction of the nobler is involved; for whereas he, the enemy, effected his deception for the ruin of our nature, He Who is at once the just, and good, and wise one, used His device, in which there was deception, for the salvation of him who had perished, and thus not only conferred benefit on the lost one, but on him, too, who had wrought our ruin. For from this approximation of death to life, of darkness to light, of corruption to incorruption, there is effected an obliteration of what is worse, and a passing away of it into nothing, while benefit is conferred on him who is freed from those evils. For it is as when some worthless material has been mixed with gold, and the gold-refiners[fn-39-P3982_2634820:70-nf] burn up the foreign and refuse part in the consuming fire, and so restore the more precious substance to its natural lustre: (not that the separation is effected without difficulty, for it takes time for the fire by its melting force to cause the baser matter to disappear; but for all that, this melting away of the actual thing that was embedded in it to the injury of its beauty is a kind of healing of the gold.) In the same way when death, and corruption, and darkness, and every other offshoot of evil had grown into the nature of the author of evil, the approach of the Divine power, acting like fire[fn-39-P3983_2635629:71-nf] , and making that unnatural accretion to disappear, thus by purgation[fn-39-P3984_2635730:72-nf] of the evil becomes a blessing to that nature, though the separation is agonizing. Therefore even the adversary himself will not be likely to dispute that what took place was both just and salutary, that is, if he shall have attained to a perception of the boon. For it is now as with those who for their cure are subjected to the knife and the cautery; they are angry with the doctors, and wince with the pain of the incision; but if recovery of health be the result of this treatment, and the pain of the cautery passes away, they will feel grateful to those who have wrought this cure upon them. In like manner, when, after long periods of time, the evil of our nature, which now is mixed up with it and has grown with its growth, has been expelled, and when there has been a restoration of those who are now lying in Sin to their primal state, a harmony of thanksgiving will arise from all creation[fn-39-P3985_2636951:73-nf] , as well from those who in the process of the purgation have suffered chastisement, as from those who needed not any purgation at all. These and the like benefits the great mystery of the Divine incarnation bestows. For in those points in which He was mingled with humanity, passing as He did through all the accidents proper to human nature, such as birth, rearing, growing up, and advancing even to the taste of death, He accomplished all the results before mentioned, freeing both man from evil, and healing even the introducer of evil himself. For the chastisement, however painful, of moral disease is a healing of its weakness.","title":"The Great Catechism","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_39_the_great_catechism","source_chapter":35,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Still, in his examination of the amount of justice and wisdom discoverable in this Dispensation a person is, perhaps, induced to entertain the thought that it was by means of a certain amount of deceit that God carried out this scheme on our behalf.

It is, indeed, the property of justice to assign to every one those particular results of which he has sunk already the foundations and the causes, just as the earth returns its harvests according to the kinds of seeds thrown into it; while it is the property of wisdom, in its very manner of giving equivalent returns, not to depart from the kinder course. Two persons may both mix poison with food, one with the design of taking life, the other with the design of saving that life; the one using it as a poison, the other only as an antidote to poison; and in no way does the manner of the cure adopted spoil the aim and purpose of the benefit intended; for although a mixture of poison with the food may be effected by both of these persons alike, yet looking at their intention we are indignant with the one and approve the other; so in this instance, by the reasonable rule of justice, he who practised deception receives in return that very treatment, the seeds of which he had himself sown of his own free will. He who first deceived man by the bait of sensual pleasure is himself deceived by the presentment of the human form. But as regards the aim and purpose of what took place, a change in the direction of the nobler is involved; for whereas he, the enemy, effected his deception for the ruin of our nature, He Who is at once the just, and good, and wise one, used His device, in which there was deception, for the salvation of him who had perished, and thus not only conferred benefit on the lost one, but on him, too, who had wrought our ruin. For from this approximation of death to life, of darkness to light, of corruption to incorruption, there is effected an obliteration of what is worse, and a passing away of it into nothing, while benefit is conferred on him who is freed from those evils. For it is as when some worthless material has been mixed with gold, and the gold-refiners[fn-39-P3982_2634820:70-nf] burn up the foreign and refuse part in the consuming fire, and so restore the more precious substance to its natural lustre: (not that the separation is effected without difficulty, for it takes time for the fire by its melting force to cause the baser matter to disappear; but for all that, this melting away of the actual thing that was embedded in it to the injury of its beauty is a kind of healing of the gold.) In the same way when death, and corruption, and darkness, and every other offshoot of evil had grown into the nature of the author of evil, the approach of the Divine power, acting like fire[fn-39-P3983_2635629:71-nf] , and making that unnatural accretion to disappear, thus by purgation[fn-39-P3984_2635730:72-nf] of the evil becomes a blessing to that nature, though the separation is agonizing. Therefore even the adversary himself will not be likely to dispute that what took place was both just and salutary, that is, if he shall have attained to a perception of the boon. For it is now as with those who for their cure are subjected to the knife and the cautery; they are angry with the doctors, and wince with the pain of the incision; but if recovery of health be the result of this treatment, and the pain of the cautery passes away, they will feel grateful to those who have wrought this cure upon them. In like manner, when, after long periods of time, the evil of our nature, which now is mixed up with it and has grown with its growth, has been expelled, and when there has been a restoration of those who are now lying in Sin to their primal state, a harmony of thanksgiving will arise from all creation[fn-39-P3985_2636951:73-nf] , as well from those who in the process of the purgation have suffered chastisement, as from those who needed not any purgation at all. These and the like benefits the great mystery of the Divine incarnation bestows. For in those points in which He was mingled with humanity, passing as He did through all the accidents proper to human nature, such as birth, rearing, growing up, and advancing even to the taste of death, He accomplished all the results before mentioned, freeing both man from evil, and healing even the introducer of evil himself. For the chastisement, however painful, of moral disease is a healing of its weakness.","title":"The Great Catechism","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_43_homily_xxxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"2.

For if \"everything was very good,\"[fn-101-P10122_3141495:21-nf] consequently, and reasonably, both those things which were ordained have proved that He that ordained them is good, and those things which are the work of a good Ordainer cannot be other than good; wherefore every evil is a departure from God. For it cannot happen that He should be the originator or architect of any evil work, who claims to Himself the name of \"the Perfect,\" both Parent and Judge, especially when He is the avenger and judge of every evil work; because, moreover, evil does not occur to man from any other cause than by his departure from the good God. Moreover, this very thing is specified in man, not because it was necessary, but because he himself so willed it. Whence it manifestly appeared also what was evil; and lest there should seem to be envy in God, it was evident whence evil had arisen. He, then, is always like to Himself; nor does He ever turn or change Himself into any forms, lest by change He should appear to be mortal. For the change implied in turning from one thing to another is comprehended as a portion of a certain death. Thus there is never in Him any accession or increase of any part or honour, lest anything should appear to have ever been wanting to His perfection, nor is any loss sustained in Him, lest a degree of mortality should appear to have been suffered by Him. But what He is, He always is; and who He is, He is always Himself; and what character He has, He always has.[fn-101-P10123_3142946:22-nf] For increasing argues beginning, as well as losses prove death and perishing. And therefore He says, \"I am God, I change not; \"[fn-101-P10124_3143165:23-nf] in that, what is not born cannot suffer change, holding His condition always. For whatever it be in Him which constitutes Divinity, must necessarily exist always, maintaining itself by its own powers, so that He should always be God. And thus He says, \"I am that I am.\"[fn-101-P10125_3143454:24-nf] For what He is has this name, because it always maintains the same quality of Himself. For change takes away the force of that name \"That I Am; \"for whatever, at any time, is changed, is shown to be mortal in that very particular which is changed. For it ceases to be that which it had been, and consequently begins to be what it was not; and therefore, reasonably, there remains always in God His position, in that without any loss arising from change, He is always like and equal to Himself. And what is not born cannot be changed: for only those things undergo change which are made, or which are begotten; in that those things which bad not been at one time, learn to be by coming into being, and therefore to suffer change by being born. Moreover, those things which neither have nativity nor maker, have excluded from themselves the capacity of change, not having a beginning wherein is cause of change. And thus He is declared to be one, having no equal. For whatever can be God, must as God be of necessity the Highest. But whatever is the Highest, must certainly be the Highest in such sense as to be without any equal. And thus that must needs be alone and one on which nothing can be conferred, having no peer; because there cannot be two infinites, as the very nature of things dictates. And that is infinite which neither has any sort of beginning nor end. For whatever has occupied the whole excludes the beginning of another. Because if He does not contain all which is, whatever it is-seeing that what is found in that whereby it is contained is found to be less than that whereby it is contained-He will cease to be God; being reduced into the power of another, in whose greatness He, being smaller, shall have been included. And therefore what contained Him would then rather claim to be God. Whence it results that God's own name also cannot be declared, because He cannot be conceived. For that is contained in a name which is, in any way, comprehended from the condition of His nature. For the name is the signification of that thing which could be comprehended from a name. But when that which is treated of is such that it cannot be worthily gathered into one form by the very understanding itself, how shall it be set forth fittingly in the one word of an appellation, seeing that as it is beyond the intellect, it must also of necessity be above the significancy of the appellation? As with reason when He applies and prefers from certain reasons and occasions His name of God, we know that it is not so much the legitimate propriety of the appellation that is set forth, as a certain significancy determined for it, to which, while men betake themselves, they seem to be able thereby to obtain God's mercy. He is therefore also both immortal and incorruptible, neither conscious of any kind of loss nor ending. For because He is incorruptible, He is therefore immortal; and because He is immortal, He is certainly also incorruptible,-each being involved by turns in the other, with itself and in itself, by a mutual connection, and prolonged by a vicarious concatenation to the condition of eternity; immortality arising from incorruption, as well as incorruption coming from immortality.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"ANF-05","text":"What if in another place also we read in like manner that God was described as an angel? For when, to his wives Leah and Rachel, Jacob complained of the injustice of their father, and when he told them that he desired now to go and return into his own land, he moreover inter posed the authority of his dream; and at this time he says that the angel of God had said to him in a dream, \"Jacob, Jacob. And I said,\" says he, \"What is it? Lift up thine eyes, said He, and see, the he-goats and the rams leaping upon the sheep, and the she-goats are black and white, and many-coloured, and grizzled, and speckled: for I have seen all that Laban hath done to thee. I am God, who appeared to thee in the place of God, where thou anointedst for me there the standing stone, and there vowedst a vow unto me: now therefore arise, and go forth from this land, and go unto the land of thy nativity, and I will be with thee.\"[fn-102-P10299_3225566:151-nf] If the Angel of God speaks thus to Jacob, and the Angel himself mentions and says, \"I am God, who appeared unto thee in the house of God,\" we see without any hesitation that this is declared to be not only an angel, but God also; because He speaks of the vow directed to Himself by Jacob in the place of God, and He does not say, in my place. It is then the place of God, and He also is God. Moreover, it is written simply in the place of God, for it is not said in the place of the angel and God, but only of God; and He who promises those things is manifested to be both God and Angel, so that reasonably there must be a distinction between Him who is called God only, and Him who is declared to be not God simply, but Angel also. Whence if so great an authority cannot here be regarded as belonging to any other angel, that He should also avow Himself to be God, and should bear witness that a vow was made to Him, except to Christ alone, to whom not as angel only, but as to God, a vow can be vowed; it is manifest that it is not to be received as the Father, but as the Son, God and Angel.[fn-103-P10300_3226687:152-nf] Moreover, if this is Christ, as it is, he is in terrible risk who says that Christ is either man or angel alone, withholding from Him the power of the divine name,-an authority which He has constantly received on the faith of the heavenly Scriptures, which continually say that He is both Angel and God. To all these things, moreover, is added this, that in like manner as the divine Scripture has frequently declared Him both Angel and God, so the same divine Scripture declares Him also both man and God, expressing thereby what He should be, and depicting even then in figure what He was to be in the truth of His substance. \"For,\" it says, \"Jacob remained alone; and there wrestled with him a man even till daybreak. And He saw that He did not prevail against him; and He touched the broad part of Jacob's thigh while He was wrestling with him and he with Him, and said to him, Let me go, for the morning has dawned. And he said, I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me. And He said, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And He said to him, Thy name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; because thou hast prevailed with God, and thou an powerful with men.\"[fn-103-P10301_3228013:153-nf] And it adds, moreover: \"And Jacob called the name of that place the Vision of God: for I have seen the Lord face to face, and my soul has been made safe. And the sun arose upon him. Afterwards he crossed over the Vision of God, but he halted upon his thigh.\"[fn-103-P10302_3228328:154-nf] A man, it says, wrestled with Jacob. If this was a mere man, who is he? Whence is he? Wherefore does he contend and wrestle with Jacob? What had intervened? What had happened? What was the cause of so great a dispute as that, and so great a struggle? Why, moreover, is Jacob, who is found to be strong enough to hold the man with whom he is wrestling, and asks for a blessing from Him whom he is holding, asserted to have asked therefore, except because this struggle was prefigured as that which should be between Christ and the sons of Jacob, which is said to be completed in the Gospel? For against this man Jacob's people struggled, in which struggle Jacob's people was found to be the more powerful, because against Christ it gained the victory of its iniquity: at which time, on account of the crime that it committed, hesitating and giving way, it began most sorely to halt in the walk of its own faith and salvation; and although it was found the stronger, in respect of the condemnation of Christ, it still needs His mercy, still needs His blessing. But, moreover, the man who wrestled with Jacob says, \"Moreover, thy name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; \"and if Israel is the man who sees God, the Lord was beautifully showing that it was not only a man who was then wrestling with Jacob, but God also. Certainly Jacob saw God, with whom he wrestled, although he was holding the man in his own struggle. And in order that there might still be no hesitation, He Himself laid down the interpretation by saying, \"Because thou hast prevailed with God, and art powerful with men.\" For which reason the same Jacob, perceiving already the force of the Mystery, and apprehending the authority of Him with whom he had wrestled, called the name of that place in which he had wrestled, the Vision of God. He, moreover, superadded the reason for his interpretation being offered of the Vision of God: \"For I have seen,\" said he, \"God face to face, and my soul has been saved.\" Moreover, he saw God, with whom he wrestled as with a man; but still indeed he held the man as a conqueror, though as an inferior he asked a blessing as from God. Thus he wrestled with God and with man; and thus truly was that struggle prefigured, and in the Gospel was fulfilled, between Christ and the people of Jacob, wherein, although the people had the mastery, yet it proved to be inferior by being shown to be guilty. Who will hesitate to acknowledge that Christ, in whom this type of a wrestling was fulfilled, was not man only, but God also, since even that very type of a wrestling seems to have proved Him man and God? And yet, even after this, the same divine Scripture justly does not cease to call the Angel God, and to pronounce God the Angel. For when this very Jacob was about to bless Manasseh and Ephraim, the sons of Joseph, with his hands placed across on the heads of the lads, he said, \"The God which fed me from my youth even unto this day, the Angel who delivered me from all evils, bless these lads.\"[fn-103-P10303_3231389:155-nf] Even to such a point does he affirm the same Being to be an Angel, whom he had called God, as in the end of his discourse, to express the person of whom he was speaking as one, when he said[fn-103-P10304_3231607:156-nf] \"bless these lads.\" For if he had meant the one to be understood as God, and the other as an angel, he would have comprised the two persons in the plural number; but now he defined the singular number of one person in the blessing, whence he meant it to be understood that the same person is God and Angel. But yet He cannot be received as God the Father; but as God and Angel, as Christ He can be received. And Him, as the author of this blessing, Jacob also signified by placing his hands crossed upon the lads, as if their father was Christ, and showing, from thus placing his hands, the figure and future form of the passion.[fn-103-P10305_3232256:157-nf] Let no one, therefore, who does not shrink from speaking of Christ as an Angel, thus shrink from pronouncing Him God also, when he perceives that He Himself was invoked in the blessing of these lads, by the sacrament of the passion, intimated in the type of the crossed hands, as both God and Angel.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_55_book_i_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"ANF-04","text":"The following is the view of Celsus and the Epicureans: \"Moses having,\" he says, \"learned the doctrine which is to be found existing among wise nations and eloquent men, obtained the reputation of divinity.\" Now, in answer to this we have to say, that it may be allowed him that. Moses did indeed hear a somewhat ancient doctrine, and transmitted the same to the Hebrews; that if the doctrine which he heard was false, and neither pious nor venerable, and if notwithstanding, he received it and handed it down to those under his authority, he is liable to censure; but if, as you assert, he gave his adherence to opinions that were wise and true, and educated his people by means of them, what, pray, has he done deserving of condemnation? Would, indeed, that not only Epicurus, but Aristotle, whose sentiments regarding providence are not so impious (as those of the former), and the Stoics, who assert that God is a body, had heard such a doctrine! Then the world would not have been filled with opinions which either disallow or enfeeble the action of providence, or introduce a corrupt corporeal principle, according to which the god of the Stoics is a body, with respect to whom they are not afraid to say that he is capable of change, and may be altered and transformed in all his parts, and, generally, that he is capable of corruption, if there be any one to corrupt him, but that he has the good fortune to escape corruption, because there is none to corrupt. Whereas the doctrine of the Jews and Christians, which preserves the immutability and unalterableness of the divine nature, is stigmatized as impious, because it does not partake of the profanity of those whose notions of God are marked by impiety, but because it says in the supplication addressed to the Divinity, \"Thou art the same,\"[fn-77-P7744_1821237:42-nf] it being, moreover, an article of faith that God has said, \"I change not.\"[fn-77-P7745_1821330:43-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_58_book_iv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"ANF-04","text":"But as it is in mockery that Celsus says we speak of \"God coming down like a torturer bearing fire,\" and thus compels us unseasonably to investigate words of deeper meaning, we shall make a few remarks, sufficient to enable our hearers to form an idea[fn-90-P9063_2329212:46-nf] of the defence which disposes of the ridicule of Celsus against us, and then we shall turn to what follows. The divine word says that our God is \"a consuming fire,\"[fn-90-P9064_2329391:47-nf] and that \"He draws rivers of fire before Him; \"[fn-90-P9065_2329469:48-nf] nay, that He even entereth in as \"a refiner's fire, and as a fuller's herb,\"[fn-90-P9066_2329569:49-nf] to purify His own people. But when He is said to be a \"consuming fire,\" we inquire what are the things which are appropriate to be consumed by God. And we assert that they are wickedness, and the works which result from it, and which, being figuratively called \"wood, hay, stubble,\"[fn-90-P9067_2329874:50-nf] God consumes as a fire. The wicked man, accordingly, is said to build up on the previously-laid foundation of reason, \"wood, and hay, and stubble.\" If, then, any one can show that these words were differently understood by the writer, and can prove that the wicked man literally[fn-90-P9068_2330178:51-nf] builds up \"wood, or hay, or stubble,\" it is evident that the fire must be understood to be material, and an object of sense. But if, on the contrary, the works of the wicked man are spoken of figuratively under the names of \"wood, or hay, or stubble,\" why does it not at once occur (to inquire) in what sense the word \"fire\" is to be taken, so that \"wood\" of such a kind should be consumed? for (the Scripture) says: \"The fire will try each man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide. which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work be burned, he shall suffer loss.\"[fn-90-P9069_2330802:52-nf] But what work can be spoken of in these words as being \"burned,\" save all that results from wickedness? Therefore our God is a \"consuming fire\" in the sense in which we have taken the word; and thus He enters in as a \"refiner's fire,\" to refine the rational nature, which has been filled with the lead of wickedness, and to free it from the other impure materials, which adulterate the natural gold or silver, so to speak, of the soul.[fn-90-P9070_2331266:53-nf] And, in like manner, \"rivers of fire\" are said to be before God, who will thoroughly cleanse away the evil which is intermingled throughout the whole soul.[fn-90-P9071_2331523:54-nf] But these remarks are sufficient in answer to the assertion, \"that thus they were made to give expression to the erroneous opinion that God will come down bearing fire like a torturer.\"","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_58_book_iv_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"126","folder":"ANF-04","text":"But let us look at what Celsus next with great ostentation announces in the following fashion: \"And again,\" he says, \"let us resume the subject from the beginning, with a larger array of proofs.

This impious diagram, then, said of this leviathan, which is so clearly depreciated by the Psalmist, that it was the soul which had travelled through all things! We observed, also, in the diagram, the being named \"Behemoth,\" placed as it were under the lowest circle. The inventor of this accursed diagram had inscribed this leviathan at its circumference and centre, thus placing its name in two separate places. Moreover, Celsus says that the diagram was \"divided by a thick black line, and this line he asserted was called Gehenna, which is Tartarus.\" Now as we found that Gehenna was mentioned in the Gospel as a place of punishment, we searched to see whether it is mentioned anywhere in the ancient Scriptures, and especially because the Jews too use the word. And we ascertained that where the valley of the son of Ennom was named in Scripture in the Hebrew, instead of \"valley,\" with fundamentally the same meaning, it was termed both the valley of Ennom and also Geenna. And continuing our researches, we find that what was termed \"Geenna,\" or \"the valley of Ennom,\" was included in the lot of the tribe of Benjamin, in which Jerusalem also was situated. And seeking to ascertain what might be the inference from the heavenly Jerusalem belonging to the lot of Benjamin and the valley of Ennom, we find a certain confirmation of what is said regarding the place of punishment, intended for the purification of such souls as are to be purified by torments, agreeably to the saying: \"The Lord cometh like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: and He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and of gold.\"[fn-103-P10395_2762338:138-nf] ","title":"Book VI.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_61_book_vi_","source_chapter":63,"source_paragraph":"216","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Celsus, again, having perhaps misunderstood the words, \"For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it,\"[fn-107-P10703_2852004:325-nf] or perhaps because some ignorant individuals had rashly ventured upon the explanation of such things, and not understanding, moreover, on what principles parts called after the names of the bodily members are assigned to the attributes[fn-107-P10704_2852263:326-nf] of God, asserts: \"He has neither mouth nor voice.\" Truly, indeed, God can have no voice, if the voice is a concussion of the air, or a stroke on the air, or a species of air, or any other definition which may be given to the voice by those who are skilled in such matters; but what is called the \"voice of God\" is said to be seen as \"God's voice\" by the people in the passage; \"And all the people saw the voice of God; \"[fn-107-P10705_2852713:327-nf] the word \"saw\" being taken, agreeably to the custom of Scripture, in a spiritual sense.

And therefore the mind cannot possibly remain in one and the same state. Just as when a man, by pulling hard, is trying to force a boat against the stream of a strong current he must either stem the rush of the torrent by the force of his arms, and so mount to what is higher up, or letting his hands slacken be whirled headlong down stream. Wherefore it will be a clear proof of our failure if we find that we have gained nothing more, nor should we doubt but that we have altogether gone back, whenever we find that we have not advanced upwards, because, as I said, the mind of man cannot possibly continue in the same condition, nor so long as he is in the flesh will any of the saints ever reach the height of all virtues, so that they continue unalterable. For something must either be added to them or taken away from them, and in no creature can there be such perfection, as not to be subject to the feeling of change; as we read in the book of Job: \"What is man that he should be without spot, and he that is born of a woman that he should appear just?

And so we ought always with incessant care and anxiety to give ourselves up to the acquirement of virtue, and constantly to occupy ourselves with the practice of it, lest, if we ceaseto go forward, the result should immediately be a going back. For, as we said, the mind cannot continue in one and the same condition, I mean without receiving addition to or diminution of its good qualities.

And therefore the sacrament of his baptism is still connected with the foretelling of Christ's coming, though as of something very soon to be fulfilled, seeing that up to his time there were still foretellings of the first coming of our Lord, of which coming we have now announcements, but no longer predictions. But the Lord, teaching the way of humility, condescended to make use of the sacraments which He found here in reference to the foretelling of His coming, not in order to assist the operation of His cleansing, but as an example for our piety, that so He mght show to us with what reverence we ought to receive those sacraments which bear witness that He is already come, when He did not disdain to make use of those which foreshadowed His coming in the future. And John, therefore, though the nearest to Christ in point of time, and within one year of the same age with Him, yet, while he was baptizing, went before the way of Christ who was still to come; for which reason it was said of him, \"Behold, I send my messenger before Thy face, which shall prepare Thy way before Thee.\"[fn-50-P5005_2457248:126-nf] And he himself preached, saying, \"There cometh one mightier than I after me.\"[fn-50-P5006_2457361:127-nf] In like manner, therefore, the circumcision on the eighth day, which was given to the patriarchs, foretold our justification, to the putting away of carnal lusts through the resurrection of our Lord, which took place after the seventh day, which is the Sabbath-day, on the eighth, that is, the Lord's day, which fell on the third day after His burial; yet the infant Christ received the same circumcision of the flesh, with its prophetic signification. And as the Passover, which was celebrated by the Jews with the slaying of a lamb, prefigured the passion of our Lord and His departure from this world to the Father, yet the same Lord celebrated the same Passover with His disciples, when they reminded Him of it, saying, Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the Passover?[fn-50-P5007_2458165:128-nf] so too He Himself also received the baptism of John, which formed a part of the latest foretelling of His coming.

And even though Christ received the others, yet are they not necessary for us, who have received the Lord Himself who was foretold in them.

And John, therefore, though the nearest to Christ in point of time, and within one year of the same age with Him, yet, while he was baptizing, went before the way of Christ who was still to come; for which reason it was said of him, \"Behold, I send my messenger before Thy face, which shall prepare Thy way before Thee.\"[fn-50-P5005_2457248:126-nf] And he himself preached, saying, \"There cometh one mightier than I after me.\"[fn-50-P5006_2457361:127-nf] In like manner, therefore, the circumcision on the eighth day, which was given to the patriarchs, foretold our justification, to the putting away of carnal lusts through the resurrection of our Lord, which took place after the seventh day, which is the Sabbath-day, on the eighth, that is, the Lord's day, which fell on the third day after His burial; yet the infant Christ received the same circumcision of the flesh, with its prophetic signification. And as the Passover, which was celebrated by the Jews with the slaying of a lamb, prefigured the passion of our Lord and His departure from this world to the Father, yet the same Lord celebrated the same Passover with His disciples, when they reminded Him of it, saying, Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to eat the Passover?[fn-50-P5007_2458165:128-nf] so too He Himself also received the baptism of John, which formed a part of the latest foretelling of His coming. But as the Jews' circumcision of the flesh is one thing, and the ceremony which we observe on the eighth day after persons are baptized is another;[fn-50-P5008_2458450:129-nf] and the Passover which the Jews still celebrate with the slaying of a lamb is one thing,[fn-50-P5009_2458913:130-nf] and that which we receive in the body and blood of our Lord is another,-so the baptism of John was one thing, the baptism of Christ is another. For by the former series of rites the latter were foretold as destined to arrive; by these latter the others are declared to be fulfilled. And even though Christ received the others, yet are they not necessary for us, who have received the Lord Himself who was foretold in them. But when the coming of our Lord was as yet recent, it was necessary for any one who had received the former that he should be imbued with the latter also; but it was wholly needless that any one who had been so imbued should be compelled to go back to the former rites.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_19_tractate_xiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"10. \"For He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God.\" This, of course, he said of Christ, to distinguish himself from Christ. What then? Did not God send John himself? Did he not say himself, \"I am sent before Him\"? and, \"He that sent me to baptize with water\"? And is it not of John that it is said, \"Behold, I send my messenger before Thee, and he shall prepare Thy way\"?[fn-8-P836_452945:9-nf] Does he not himself speak the words of God, he of whom it is said that he is more than a prophet? Then, if God sent him too, and he speaks the words of God, how do we understand him to have distinctly said of Christ, \"He whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God\"? But see what he adds: \"For God giveth not the Spirit by measure.\" What is this, \"For God giveth not the Spirit by measure\"? We find that God does give the Spirit by measure. Hear the apostle when he says, \"According to the measure of the gift of Christ.\"[fn-8-P837_453486:10-nf] To men He gives by measure, to the only Son He gives not by measure.

Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? Have all the gift of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?\"[fn-8-P838_454032:11-nf] This man has one gift, that man another; and what that man has, this has not: there is a measure, a certain division of gifts. To men, therefore, it is given by measure, and concord among them makes one body. As the hand receives one kind of gift to work, the eye another to see, the ear another to hear, the foot another to walk; nevertheless the soul that does all is one, in the hand to work, in the foot to walk, in the ear to hear, in the eye to see; so are also the gifts of believers diverse, distributed to them as to members, to each according to his proper measure.

And so the prophet Isaiah says: \"Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is interpreted God with us.\"[fn-69-P6932_2495653:12-nf] What room is there here for doubt, you incredulous person?[fn-69-P6933_2495763:13-nf] The prophet said that a virgin should conceive: a virgin has conceived: that a Son should be born: a Son has been born: that He Should be called God: He is called God. For He is called by that name as being of that nature. Therefore when the Spirit of God said that He should be called God, He proved that He is without the Spirit of God who makes himself a stranger to all fellowship with the Divine title. \"Behold then,\" he says, \"a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is interpreted God with us.\" But here is a point on which it is possible that your shuffling incredulity may fasten; viz., by saying that this which the prophet declared He should be called referred not to the glory of His Divinity, but to the name by which He should be addressed. But what are we to do because Christ is never spoken of by this name in the gospels, though the Spirit of God cannot be said to have spoken falsely through the prophet? How is it then? Surely that we should understand that that prophecy then foretold the name of His Divine nature and not of His humanity. For since in His manhood united to the Godhead[fn-69-P6934_2497436:14-nf] He received another name in the gospel, it is certainly clear that this name belonged to His humanity, that to His Divinity. But let us proceed further and summon other true witnesses to establish the truth: For where we are speaking about the Godhead, the Divinity cannot be better established than by His own witnesses. So then the same prophet says elsewhere: \"For unto us a Son is born: unto us a child is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called the angel of great counsel, God the mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of peace.\"[fn-69-P6935_2498968:15-nf] Just as above the prophet had expressly said that He should be called Emmanuel, so here he says that He should be called \"the angel of great counsel, and God the mighty, and the Father of the world to come and the prince of peace\" (although we certainly never read that He was called by these names in the gospel): of course that we may understand that these are not terms belonging to His human, but to His Divine nature; and that the name used in the gospel belonged to the manhood which He took upon Him,[fn-69-P6936_2499625:16-nf] and this one to His innate power. And because God was to be born in human form, these names were so distributed in the sacred economy, that to the manhood a human name was given and to the Divinity a Divine one. Therefore he says: \"He shall be cat led the angel of great counsel, God the mighty, the Father of the world to come, the prince of peace.\" Not, O heretic, whoever you may be, not that here the prophet, full as he was of the Holy Spirit, followed your example and compared Him who was born to a molten image and a figure fashioned without sense.[fn-69-P6937_2500275:17-nf] For \"a Son,\" he says, \"is born to us, a Child is given to us; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and His name shall be called the angel of great counsel, God the mighty.\"And that you may not imagine Him whom He announced as God[fn-69-P6938_2500552:18-nf] to be other than Him who was born in the flesh, he adds a term referring to His birth, saying: \"A child is born to us: a son is given to us.\" Do you see how many titles the prophet used to make clear the reality of His birth in the body? for he called Him both Son and child on purpose that the manner of the child which was born might be more clearly shown by a name referring to His infancy; and the Holy Spirit foreseeing without doubt this perversity of blasphemous heretics, showed to the whole world that it was God who was born, by the very terms and words used; that even if a heretic was determined to utter blashemy, he might not find any loophole for his blasphemy. Therefore he says: \"A Son is born to us; a child is given to us; and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called the angel of great counsel, God the mighty, the Father of the world to come, the prince of peace.\" He teaches that this child which was born is both prince of peace and Father of the world to come and God the mighty. What room is there then for shuffling? This child which is born cannot be severed from God who is born in Him, for he called Him, whom he spoke of as born, Father of the world to come; Him whom he called a child, he foretold as God the mighty. What is it, O heretic? Whither will you betake yourself? Every place is hedged and shut in: there is no possibility of getting out of it. There is nothing for it but that you should at length be obliged to confess the mistake which you would not understand. But not content with these passages which are indeed enough let us inquire what the Holy Ghost said through another prophet. \"Shall a man,\" says he, \"pierce his God, for you are piercing me?\"[fn-69-P6939_2502753:19-nf] In order that the subject of the prophecy might be still clearer the prophet foretells what he proclaimed of the Lord's passion as if from the mouth of Him of whom he was speaking. \"Shall a man pierce his God, for you are piercing me?\" Does not our Lord God, I ask, seem to have said this when He was led to the Cross? Why indeed do you not acknowledge Me as your Redeemer? Why are ye ignorant of God clothed in flesh for you? Are you preparing death for your Saviour? Are yon leading forth to death the Author of life? I am your God whom ye are lifting up: your God whom ye are crucifying. What mistake, I ask, is here or what madness is it? \"Shall a man pierce his God, for you are piercing me?\" Do you see how exactly the words describe what was actually done? Could you ask for anything more express or clearer? Do you see how sacred testimonies follow our Incarnate Lord Jesus Christ from the very cradle to the Cross which He bore, as here you can see that He whom elsewhere you read of as God when born in the flesh was God when pierced on the cross? And so there, where His birth was treated of, He is spoken of by the prophet as God: and here where His crucifixion is concerned, He is most clearly named God; that the taking upon Him of manhood might not in any point prejudice dignity of His Divinity, nor the humiliation of His body and the shame of the passion affect the glory of His majesty; for His condescension to so lowly a birth and His generous goodness in enduring his passion ought to increase our love and devotion to Him; since it is certainly a great and monstrous sin if, the more He lavishes love upon us, the less He is honoured by us.","title":"Book II.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_85_book_vii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"As it happens to those who having escaped the perils of the sea, are in terror of the sands\nthat stretch before the harbour, or the rocks that line the shore, so it is in my case that, -as I\nhave kept to the last some of the slandersof the heretics, - although I have reached the limit of the\nwork which I set myself, yet I am beginning to dread the close, which I had longed to reach. But, as\nthe Prophet says,\"The Lord is my helper; I will not fear what man can do to me,\"[fn-74-P7436_2727449:1-nf] so we will not fear the pitfalls which crafty\nheretics have dug in front of us, nor the paths thickly strewn with horrid thorns.

For when, as we are walking feebly along the right road,\nthey come in our way, and frighten the walkers rather than hurt them, our work and business has more\nto do in clearing them away, than to fear from the difficulty of this: And so, laying our hands upon\nthat monstrous head of the deadly serpent, and longing to lay hold of all the limbs that are\nentangled in the huge folds and coils of his body, again and again do we pray to Thee, O Lord Jesus,\nto whom we have ever prayed, that Thou wouldst give us words by opening our mouth \"to the pulling\ndown of strongholds, destroying counsels, and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge\nof God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto Thine obedience:\"[fn-74-P7437_2728489:2-nf] for he is indeed free, who has begun to be led\ncaptive by Thee.

It is not very different from\nthe previous one, for it differs from it in terms rather than in fact and reality. For when we are\ntreating of the birth of God, you maintain that one of greater power could not be born of Mary just\nas above you maintain than one older could not be begotten. And so you may take it that the same\nanswer may be given to this as to what you said before: or you may conceive that the answer given to\nthis assertion, which you are now making, applies to that also. You say then that the one who is born\nmust be of one substance with the one who bears. If this refers to earthly creatures, it is most\ncertainly the case. But if it refers to the birth of God, why in the case of His birth do you regard\nprecedents from nature? for appointments are subject to Him who appointed them, and not the appointer\nto His appointments. But would you like to know more fully how these slanders of yours are not only\nwicked but foolish, and the idle talk of one who does not in the least see the omnipotence of God?\nTell me, I pray, you who think that like things can only be produced from like things, whence was the\norigin of that unaccountable host of quails in thewilderness of old time to feed the children of\nIsrael, for nowhere do we read that they had been previously born of mother birds, but that they were\nbrought up and came suddenly. Again whence came that heavenly food which for forty years fell on the\ncamp of the Hebrews? Did manna produce manna? But these refer to ancient miracles. And what of more\nrecent ones? With a few loaves and small fishes the Lord Jesus Christ fed countless hosts of\nthepeople that followed Him, and not once only. The reason that they were satisfied lay not in the\nfood: for a secret and unseen cause satisfied the hungry folk, especially as there was much more left\nwhen they were filled than there had been set before them when they were hungry. And how was all this\nbrought about that when those who ate were satisfied, the food itself was multiplied by an\nextraordinary increase? We read that in Galilee wine was produced from water. Tell me how what was of\none nature produced something of an altogether different substance from its own quality? Especially\nwhen (which exactly applies to the birth of the Lord) it was the production of a nobler substance\nfrom what was inferior to it? Tell me then how from merewater there could be produced rich and\nsplendid wine? How was it that one thing was drawn out, another poured in? Was the cistern a well of\nsuch a nature as to change the water drawn from it into the best wine? Or did the character of the\nvessels or the diligence of the servants effect this? Most certainly neither of these. And how is it\nthat the manner of the fact is not understood by the thoughts of the heart, though the\ntruth of the fact is firmly held by the conscience? In the gospel clay was placed on the eyes\nof a blind man and when it was washed off[fn-74-P7452_2737913:9-nf]\neyes were produced. Had water the power of giving birth to eyes, or clay of creating light? Certainly\nnot, especially as water could be of no use to a blind man, and clay would actually hinder the sight\nof those who could see. And how was it that a thing that itself in its own nature was injurious,\nbecame the means of restoring health; and that what was ordinarily hurtful to sound people, was then\nmade the instrument of healing? You say that the power of God brought it about, and the remedy of God\ncaused it, and that all these things of which we have been speaking were simply brought about by\nDivine Omnipotence; which is able to fashion new things from unwonted material, and to make\nserviceable things out of their opposites, and to change what belongs to the realm of things\nimpossible and impracticable into possibilities and actual performances.","title":"Book VII.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_82_letter_xiii_for_341_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"3.
