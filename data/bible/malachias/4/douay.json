{"verses":["For behold the day shall come kindled as a furnace:  and all the\nproud, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble:  and the day that\ncometh shall set them on fire, saith the Lord of hosts, it shall not\nleave them root, nor branch.","But unto you that fear my name, the Sun of justice shall arise,\nand health in his wings:  and you shall go forth, and shall leap like\ncalves of the herd.","And you shall tread down the wicked when they shall be ashes under\nthe sole of your feet in the day that I do this, saith the Lord of\nhosts.","Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded him in\nHoreb for all Israel, the precepts, and judgments.","Behold, I will send you Elias the prophet, before the coming of\nthe great and dreadful day of the Lord.","And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and\nthe heart of the children to their fathers:  lest I come, and strike the\nearth with anathema."]}
