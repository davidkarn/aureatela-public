Wisdom relates to sons, and this relation requires love; religion to servants, and this relation requires fear. For as the former are bound to love and honour their father, so are the latter bound to respect and venerate their lord. But with respect to God, who is one only, inasmuch as He sustains the twofold character both of Father and Lord, we are bound both to love Him, inasmuch as we are sons, and to fear Him, inasmuch as we are servants.[fn-11-P1150_515653:19-nf] Religion, therefore, cannot be divided from wisdom, nor can wisdom be separated from religion; because it is the same God, who ought to be understood, which is the part of wisdom, and to be honoured, which is the part of religion. But wisdom precedes, religion follows; for the knowledge of God comes first, His worship is the result of knowledge. Thus in the two names there is but one meaning, though it seems to be different in each case. For the one is concerned with the understanding, the other with action. But, however, they resemble two streams flowing from one fountain. But the fountain of wisdom and religion is God; and if these two streams shall turn aside from Him, they must be dried up: for they who are ignorant of Him cannot be wise or religious.","title":"Book IV.

But He commanded His own Son, the first-begotten,[fn-12-P1258_548912:90-nf] the maker of all things, His own counsellor, to descend from heaven, that He might transfer the sacred religion of God to the Gentiles,[fn-12-P1259_549124:91-nf] that is, to those who were ignorant of God, and might teach them righteousness, which the perfidious people had cast asideÂ· And He had long before threatened that He would do this, as the prophet Malachi[fn-12-P1260_549346:92-nf] shows, saying: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, and I will not accept an offering from your hands; for from the rising of the sun even unto its setting, my name shall be great[fn-12-P1261_549554:93-nf] among the Gentiles.\" David also in the seventeenth Psalm[fn-12-P1262_549669:94-nf] says: \"Thou wilt make me the head of the heathen; a people whom I have not known shall serve me\" Isaiah[fn-12-P1263_549885:95-nf] also thus speaks: \"I come to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and see my glory; and I will send among them a sign, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations which are afar off, which have not heard my fame; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.\" Therefore, when God wished to send to the earth one who should measure[fn-12-P1264_550327:96-nf] His temple, He was unwilling to send him with heavenly power and glory, that the people who had been ungrateful towards God might be led into the greatest error, and suffer punishment for their crimes, since they had not received their Lord and God, as the prophets had before foretold that it would thus happen. For Isaiah whom the Jews most cruelly slew, cutting him asunder with a saw,[fn-12-P1265_550830:97-nf] thus speaks:[fn-12-P1266_550970:98-nf] \"Hear, O heaven; and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I have begotten sons, and lifted[fn-12-P1267_551088:99-nf] them up on high, and they have rejected me.

And if I am a master where is my fear?\"[fn-19-P1936_477919:1354-nf] in your case the bishop combines in himself many titles to your respect. He is at once a monk, a prelate, and an uncle who has before now instructed you in all holy things. This also I say that the bishops should know themselves to be priests not lords. Let them render to the clergy the honour which is their due that the clergy may offer to them the respect which belongs to bishops. There is a witty saying of the orator Domitius which is here to the point: \"Why am I to recognize you as leader of the Senate when you will not recognize my rights as a private member?\"[fn-19-P1937_478511:1355-nf] We should realize that a bishop and his presbyters are like Aaron and his sons. As there is but one Lord and one Temple; so also should there be but one ministry. Let us ever bear in mind the charge which the apostle Peter gives to priests: \"feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly as God would have you;[fn-19-P1938_478913:1356-nf] not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage but being ensamples to the flock,\" and that gladly; that \"when the chief-shepherd shall appear ye may receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.\"[fn-19-P1939_479173:1357-nf] It is a bad custom which prevails in certain churches for presbyters to be silent when bishops are present on the ground that they would be jealous or impatient hearers. \"If anything,\" writes the apostle Paul, \"be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. For ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted; and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

So far the `five words' of the Pentateuch, with which the apostle boasts his wish to speak in the Church.[fn-20-P2074_513403:1456-nf] Then, as for Job,[fn-20-P2075_513446:1457-nf] that pattern of patience, what mysteries are there not contained in his discourses?

To say nothing of other topics, it prophesies the resurrection of men's bodies at once with more clearness and with more caution than any one has yet shewn. \"I know,\" Job says, \"that my redeemer liveth, and that at the last day I shall rise again from the earth; and I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh shall I see God.

Again in Zadok and in David he bears witness to the mysteries of the new priesthood and of the new royalty. The third and fourth books of Kings called in Hebrew Malachim give the history of the kingdom of Judah from Solomon to Jeconiah,[fn-20-P2080_515583:1462-nf] and of that of Israel from Jeroboam the son of Nebat to Hoshea who was carried away into Assyria. If you merely regard the narrative, the words are simple enough, but if you look beneath the surface at the hidden meaning of it, you find a description of the small numbers of the church and of the wars which the heretics wage against it. The twelve prophets whose writings are compressed within the narrow limits of a single volume,[fn-20-P2081_516060:1463-nf] have typical meanings far different from their literal ones. Hosea speaks many times of Ephraim, of Samaria, of Joseph, of Jezreel, of a wife of whoredoms and of children of whoredoms,[fn-20-P2082_516313:1464-nf] of an adulteress shut up within the chamber of her husband, sitting for a long time in widowhood and in the garb of mourning, awaiting the time when her husband will return to her.[fn-20-P2083_516514:1465-nf] Joel the son of Pethuel describes the land of the twelve tribes as spoiled and devastated by the palmerworm the canker-worm, the locust, and the blight,[fn-20-P2084_516695:1466-nf] and predicts that after the overthrow of the former people the Holy Spirit shall be poured out upon God's servants and handmaids;[fn-20-P2085_516845:1467-nf] the same spirit, that is, which was to be poured out in the upper chamber at Zion upon the one hundred and twenty believers.[fn-20-P2086_516992:1468-nf] These believers rising by gradual and regular gradations from one to fifteen form the steps to which there is a mystical allusion in the \"psalms of degrees.\"[fn-20-P2087_517183:1469-nf] Amos, although he is only \"an herdman\" from the country, \"a gatherer of sycomore fruit,\"[fn-20-P2088_517386:1470-nf] cannot be explained in a few words. For who can adequately speak of the three transgressions and the four of Damascus, of Gaza, of Tyre, of Idumaea, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, and in the seventh and eighth place of Judah and of Israel? He speaks to the fat kine that are in the mountain of Samaria,[fn-20-P2089_517716:1471-nf] and bears witness that the great house and the little house shall fall.[fn-20-P2090_517809:1472-nf] He sees now the maker of the grasshopper,[fn-20-P2091_517873:1473-nf] now the Lord, standing upon a wall[fn-20-P2092_517930:1474-nf] daubed[fn-20-P2093_517959:1475-nf] or made of adamant,[fn-20-P2094_518004:1476-nf] now a basket of apples[fn-20-P2095_518048:1477-nf] that brings doom to the transgressors, and now a famine upon the earth \"not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\"[fn-20-P2096_518229:1478-nf] Obadiah, whose name means the servant of God, thunders against Edom red with blood and against the creature born of earth.[fn-20-P2097_518376:1479-nf] He smites him with the spear of the spirit because of his continual rivalry with his brother Jacob. Jonah, fairest of doves, whose shipwreck shews in a figure the passion of the Lord, recalls the world to penitence, and while he preaches to Nineveh, announces salvation to all the heathen. Micah the Morasthite a joint heir with Christ[fn-20-P2098_518792:1480-nf] announces the spoiling of the daughter of the robber and lays siege against her, because she has smitten the jawbone of the judge of Israel.[fn-20-P2099_519018:1481-nf] Nahum, the consoler of the world, rebukes \"the bloody city\"[fn-21-P2100_519104:1482-nf] and when it is overthrown cries: -\"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.\"[fn-21-P2101_519247:1483-nf] Habakkuk, like a strong and unyielding wrestler,[fn-21-P2102_519318:1484-nf] stands upon his watch and sets his foot upon the tower[fn-21-P2103_519419:1485-nf] that he may contemplate Christ upon the cross and say \"His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.\"[fn-21-P2104_519677:1486-nf] Zephaniah, that is the bodyguard and knower of the secrets of the Lord,[fn-21-P2105_519784:1487-nf] hears \"a cry from the fishgate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.\"[fn-21-P2106_519938:1488-nf] He proclaims \"howling to the inhabitants of the mortar;[fn-21-P2107_520016:1489-nf] for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.\"[fn-21-P2108_520161:1490-nf] Haggai, that is he who is glad or joyful, who has sown in tears to reap in joy,[fn-21-P2109_520267:1491-nf] is occupied with the rebuilding of the temple. He represents the Lord(the Father, that is) as saying \"Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations and he who is desired[fn-21-P2110_520552:1492-nf] of all nations shall come'[fn-21-P2111_520616:1493-nf] Zechariah, he that is mindful of his Lord,[fn-21-P2112_520692:1494-nf] gives us many prophecies. He sees Jesus,[fn-21-P2113_520776:1495-nf] \"clothed with filthy garments,\"[fn-21-P2114_520847:1496-nf] a stone with seven eyes,[fn-21-P2115_520895:1497-nf] a candle-stick all of gold with lamps as many as the eyes, and two olivetrees on the right side of the bowl[fn-21-P2116_521026:1498-nf] and on the left. After he has described the horses, red, black, white, and grisled,[fn-21-P2117_521145:1499-nf] and the cutting off of the chariot from Ephraim and of the horse from Jerusalem[fn-21-P2118_521249:1500-nf] he goes on to prophesy and predict a king who shall be a poor man and who shall sit \"upon a colt the foal of an ass.\"[fn-21-P2119_521390:1501-nf] Malachi, the last of all the prophets, speaks openly of the rejection of Israel and the calling of the nations. \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles: and in every place incense[fn-21-P2120_521758:1502-nf] is offered unto my name, and a pure offering.\"[fn-21-P2121_521844:1503-nf] As for Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, who can fully understand or adequately explain them? The first of them seems to compose not a prophecy but a gospel. The second speaks of a rod of an almond tree[fn-21-P2122_522089:1504-nf] and of a seething pot with its face toward the north,[fn-21-P2123_522164:1505-nf] and of a leopard which has changed its spots.[fn-21-P2124_522231:1506-nf] He also goes four times through the alphabet in different metres.[fn-21-P2125_522321:1507-nf] The beginning and ending of Ezekiel, the third of the four, are involved in so great obscurity that like the commencement of Genesis they are not studied by the Hebrews until they are thirty years old. Daniel, the fourth and last of the four prophets, having knowledge of the times and being interested in the whole world, in clear language proclaims the stone cut out of the mountain without hands that overthrows all kingdoms.[fn-21-P2126_522852:1508-nf] David, who is our Simonides, Pindar, and Alcaeus, our Horace, our Catullus, and our Serenus all in one, sings of Christ to his lyre; and on a psaltery with ten strings calls him from the lower world to rise again. Solomon, a lover of peace[fn-21-P2127_523114:1509-nf] and of the Lord, corrects morals, teaches nature, unites Christ and the church, and sings a sweet marriage song[fn-21-P2128_523258:1510-nf] to celebrate that holy bridal. Esther, a type of the church, frees her people from danger and, after having slain Haman whose name means iniquity, hands down to posterity a memorable day and a great feast.[fn-21-P2129_523492:1511-nf] The book of things omitted[fn-21-P2130_523569:1512-nf] or epitome of the old dispensation[fn-21-P2131_523683:1513-nf] is of such importance and value that without it any one who should claim to himself a knowledge of the scriptures would make himself a laughing stock in his own eyes. Every name used in it, nay even the conjunction of the words, serves to throw light on narratives passed over in the books of Kings and upon questions suggested by the gospel. Ezra and Nehemiah, that is the Lord's helper and His consoler, are united in a single book. They restore the Temple and build up the walls of the city. In their pages we see the throng of the Israelites returning to their native land, we read of priests and Levites, of Israel proper and of proselytes; and we are even told the several families to which the task of building the walls and towers was assigned. These references convey one meaning upon the surface, but another below it.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"641","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8.

This my hope is stored up in my own bosom.\"[fn-20-P2076_514427:1458-nf] I will pass on to Jesus the son of Nave[fn-20-P2077_514498:1459-nf] -a type of the Lord in name as well as in deed-who crossed over Jordan, subdued hostile kingdoms, divided the land among the conquering people and who, in every city, village, mountain, river, hill-torrent, and boundary which he dealt with, marked out the spiritual realms of the heavenly Jerusalem, that is, of the church.[fn-20-P2078_514923:1460-nf] In the book of Judges every one of the popular leaders is a type. Ruth the Moabitess fulfils the prophecy of Isaiah:-\"Send thou a lamb, O Lord, as ruler of the land from the rock of the wilderness to the mount of the daughter of Zion.\"[fn-20-P2079_515181:1461-nf] Under the figures of Eli's death and the slaying of Saul Samuel shews the abolition of the old law. Again in Zadok and in David he bears witness to the mysteries of the new priesthood and of the new royalty. The third and fourth books of Kings called in Hebrew Malachim give the history of the kingdom of Judah from Solomon to Jeconiah,[fn-20-P2080_515583:1462-nf] and of that of Israel from Jeroboam the son of Nebat to Hoshea who was carried away into Assyria. If you merely regard the narrative, the words are simple enough, but if you look beneath the surface at the hidden meaning of it, you find a description of the small numbers of the church and of the wars which the heretics wage against it. The twelve prophets whose writings are compressed within the narrow limits of a single volume,[fn-20-P2081_516060:1463-nf] have typical meanings far different from their literal ones. Hosea speaks many times of Ephraim, of Samaria, of Joseph, of Jezreel, of a wife of whoredoms and of children of whoredoms,[fn-20-P2082_516313:1464-nf] of an adulteress shut up within the chamber of her husband, sitting for a long time in widowhood and in the garb of mourning, awaiting the time when her husband will return to her.[fn-20-P2083_516514:1465-nf] Joel the son of Pethuel describes the land of the twelve tribes as spoiled and devastated by the palmerworm the canker-worm, the locust, and the blight,[fn-20-P2084_516695:1466-nf] and predicts that after the overthrow of the former people the Holy Spirit shall be poured out upon God's servants and handmaids;[fn-20-P2085_516845:1467-nf] the same spirit, that is, which was to be poured out in the upper chamber at Zion upon the one hundred and twenty believers.[fn-20-P2086_516992:1468-nf] These believers rising by gradual and regular gradations from one to fifteen form the steps to which there is a mystical allusion in the \"psalms of degrees.\"[fn-20-P2087_517183:1469-nf] Amos, although he is only \"an herdman\" from the country, \"a gatherer of sycomore fruit,\"[fn-20-P2088_517386:1470-nf] cannot be explained in a few words. For who can adequately speak of the three transgressions and the four of Damascus, of Gaza, of Tyre, of Idumaea, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, and in the seventh and eighth place of Judah and of Israel? He speaks to the fat kine that are in the mountain of Samaria,[fn-20-P2089_517716:1471-nf] and bears witness that the great house and the little house shall fall.[fn-20-P2090_517809:1472-nf] He sees now the maker of the grasshopper,[fn-20-P2091_517873:1473-nf] now the Lord, standing upon a wall[fn-20-P2092_517930:1474-nf] daubed[fn-20-P2093_517959:1475-nf] or made of adamant,[fn-20-P2094_518004:1476-nf] now a basket of apples[fn-20-P2095_518048:1477-nf] that brings doom to the transgressors, and now a famine upon the earth \"not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\"[fn-20-P2096_518229:1478-nf] Obadiah, whose name means the servant of God, thunders against Edom red with blood and against the creature born of earth.[fn-20-P2097_518376:1479-nf] He smites him with the spear of the spirit because of his continual rivalry with his brother Jacob. Jonah, fairest of doves, whose shipwreck shews in a figure the passion of the Lord, recalls the world to penitence, and while he preaches to Nineveh, announces salvation to all the heathen. Micah the Morasthite a joint heir with Christ[fn-20-P2098_518792:1480-nf] announces the spoiling of the daughter of the robber and lays siege against her, because she has smitten the jawbone of the judge of Israel.[fn-20-P2099_519018:1481-nf] Nahum, the consoler of the world, rebukes \"the bloody city\"[fn-21-P2100_519104:1482-nf] and when it is overthrown cries: -\"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.\"[fn-21-P2101_519247:1483-nf] Habakkuk, like a strong and unyielding wrestler,[fn-21-P2102_519318:1484-nf] stands upon his watch and sets his foot upon the tower[fn-21-P2103_519419:1485-nf] that he may contemplate Christ upon the cross and say \"His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.\"[fn-21-P2104_519677:1486-nf] Zephaniah, that is the bodyguard and knower of the secrets of the Lord,[fn-21-P2105_519784:1487-nf] hears \"a cry from the fishgate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.\"[fn-21-P2106_519938:1488-nf] He proclaims \"howling to the inhabitants of the mortar;[fn-21-P2107_520016:1489-nf] for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.\"[fn-21-P2108_520161:1490-nf] Haggai, that is he who is glad or joyful, who has sown in tears to reap in joy,[fn-21-P2109_520267:1491-nf] is occupied with the rebuilding of the temple. He represents the Lord(the Father, that is) as saying \"Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations and he who is desired[fn-21-P2110_520552:1492-nf] of all nations shall come'[fn-21-P2111_520616:1493-nf] Zechariah, he that is mindful of his Lord,[fn-21-P2112_520692:1494-nf] gives us many prophecies. He sees Jesus,[fn-21-P2113_520776:1495-nf] \"clothed with filthy garments,\"[fn-21-P2114_520847:1496-nf] a stone with seven eyes,[fn-21-P2115_520895:1497-nf] a candle-stick all of gold with lamps as many as the eyes, and two olivetrees on the right side of the bowl[fn-21-P2116_521026:1498-nf] and on the left. After he has described the horses, red, black, white, and grisled,[fn-21-P2117_521145:1499-nf] and the cutting off of the chariot from Ephraim and of the horse from Jerusalem[fn-21-P2118_521249:1500-nf] he goes on to prophesy and predict a king who shall be a poor man and who shall sit \"upon a colt the foal of an ass.\"[fn-21-P2119_521390:1501-nf] Malachi, the last of all the prophets, speaks openly of the rejection of Israel and the calling of the nations. \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles: and in every place incense[fn-21-P2120_521758:1502-nf] is offered unto my name, and a pure offering.\"[fn-21-P2121_521844:1503-nf] As for Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, who can fully understand or adequately explain them? The first of them seems to compose not a prophecy but a gospel. The second speaks of a rod of an almond tree[fn-21-P2122_522089:1504-nf] and of a seething pot with its face toward the north,[fn-21-P2123_522164:1505-nf] and of a leopard which has changed its spots.[fn-21-P2124_522231:1506-nf] He also goes four times through the alphabet in different metres.[fn-21-P2125_522321:1507-nf] The beginning and ending of Ezekiel, the third of the four, are involved in so great obscurity that like the commencement of Genesis they are not studied by the Hebrews until they are thirty years old. Daniel, the fourth and last of the four prophets, having knowledge of the times and being interested in the whole world, in clear language proclaims the stone cut out of the mountain without hands that overthrows all kingdoms.[fn-21-P2126_522852:1508-nf] David, who is our Simonides, Pindar, and Alcaeus, our Horace, our Catullus, and our Serenus all in one, sings of Christ to his lyre; and on a psaltery with ten strings calls him from the lower world to rise again. Solomon, a lover of peace[fn-21-P2127_523114:1509-nf] and of the Lord, corrects morals, teaches nature, unites Christ and the church, and sings a sweet marriage song[fn-21-P2128_523258:1510-nf] to celebrate that holy bridal. Esther, a type of the church, frees her people from danger and, after having slain Haman whose name means iniquity, hands down to posterity a memorable day and a great feast.[fn-21-P2129_523492:1511-nf] The book of things omitted[fn-21-P2130_523569:1512-nf] or epitome of the old dispensation[fn-21-P2131_523683:1513-nf] is of such importance and value that without it any one who should claim to himself a knowledge of the scriptures would make himself a laughing stock in his own eyes. Every name used in it, nay even the conjunction of the words, serves to throw light on narratives passed over in the books of Kings and upon questions suggested by the gospel. Ezra and Nehemiah, that is the Lord's helper and His consoler, are united in a single book. They restore the Temple and build up the walls of the city. In their pages we see the throng of the Israelites returning to their native land, we read of priests and Levites, of Israel proper and of proselytes; and we are even told the several families to which the task of building the walls and towers was assigned. These references convey one meaning upon the surface, but another below it.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1309","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8.

I say this, however, inasmuch as they received the commands of the law, which they were ordered to observe: for the prophets often show that this same Lord of ours might have been their Father also, if they had not strayed from His commandments: as, for instance, we have that statement, \"I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me;\"[fn-6-P639_238652:30-nf] and that other,\" I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the Most High;\"[fn-6-P640_238758:31-nf] and this again, \"If then I be a Father, where is mine honour? and if I be a Master, where is my fear?\"[fn-6-P641_238881:32-nf] and very many other statements, where the Jews are accused of showing by their sin that they did not wish to become sons: those things being left out of account which are said in prophecy of a future Christian people, that they would have God as a Father, according to that gospel statement,\" To them gave He power to become the sons of God.\"[fn-6-P642_239240:33-nf] The Apostle Paul, again, says, \"The heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant;\" and mentions that we have received the Spirit of adoption, \"whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-6-P643_239451:34-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"137","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"46.

For the elder, Cain, offered gifts to God from the fruit of the earth; but the younger son, Abel, from the fruit of his ewes. \"God had respect unto Abel, and unto his gifts; but unto Cain and unto his gifts He had not respect. And God said unto Cain, Why is thy countenance fallen? hast thou not-if thou offerest indeed aright, but dost not divide aright-sinned? Hold thy peace. For unto thee shall thy conversion be and he shall lord it over thee. And then Cain said unto Abel his brother, Let us go into the field: and he went away with him thither, and he slew him. And then God said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper? To whom God said, The voice of the blood of thy brother crieth forth unto me from the earth. Wherefore cursed is the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother. Groaning and trembling shalt thou be upon the earth, and every one who shall have found thee shall slay thee.\"[fn-21-P2116_719963:73-nf] From this proceeding we gather that the twofold sacrifices of \"the peoples\" were even from the very beginning foreshown. In short, when the sacerdotal law was being drawn up, through Moses, in Leviticus, we find it prescribed to the people of Israel that sacrifices should in no other place be offered to God than in the land of promise; which the Lord God was about to give to \"the people\" Israel and to their brethren, in order that, on Israel's introduction thither, there should there be celebrated sacrifices and holocausts, as well for sins as for souls; and nowhere else but in the holy land.[fn-21-P2117_720711:74-nf] Why, accordingly, does the Spirit afterwards predict, through the prophets, that it should come to pass that in every place and in every land there should be offered sacrifices to God? as He says through the angel Malachi, one of the twelve prophets: \"I will not receive sacrifice from your hands; for from the rising sun unto the setting my Name hath been made famous among all the nations, saith the Lord Almighty: and in every place they offer clean sacrifices to my Name.\"[fn-21-P2118_721230:75-nf] Again, in the Pslams, David says: \"Bring to God, ye countries of the nations\"-undoubtedly because \"unto every land\" the preaching of the apostles had to \"go out\"[fn-21-P2119_721425:76-nf] -\"bring to God fame and honour; bring to God the sacrifices of His name: take up[fn-21-P2120_721639:77-nf] victims and enter into His courts.\"[fn-21-P2121_721724:78-nf] For that it is not by earthly sacrifices, but by spiritual, that offering is to be made to God, we thus read, as it is written, An heart contribulate and humbled is a victim for God; \"[fn-21-P2122_721987:79-nf] and elsewhere, \"Sacrifice to God a sacrifice of praise, and render to the Highest thy vows.\"[fn-21-P2123_722117:80-nf] Thus, accordingly, the spiritual \"sacrifices of praise\" are pointed to, and \"an heart contribulate\" is demonstrated an acceptable sacrifice to God. And thus, as carnal sacrifices are understood to be reprobated-of which Isaiah withal speaks, saying, \"To what end is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith the Lord\"[fn-21-P2124_722471:81-nf] -so spiritual sacrifices are predicted[fn-21-P2125_722527:82-nf] as accepted, as the prophets announce. For, \"even if ye shall have brought me,\" He says, \"the finest wheat flour, it is a vain supplicatory gift: a thing execrable to me; \"and again He says, \"Your holocausts and sacrifices, and the fat of goats, and blood of bulls, I will not, not even if ye come to be seen by me: for who hath required these things from your hands? \"[fn-21-P2126_722918:83-nf] for \"from the rising sun unto the setting, my Name hath been made famous among all the nations, saith the Lord.\"[fn-21-P2127_723081:84-nf] But of the spiritual sacrifices He adds, saying, \"And in every place they offer dean sacrifices to my Name, saith the Lord.\"[fn-21-P2128_723233:85-nf] ","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_108_elucidations_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Here is an instance of a usage just becoming common to the East and West,-to give the name of priesthood to the chief ministry as distinguished from the presbyterate.

For just as He is called a servant on account of the form of a servant in which He came to men, so He is called an angel on account of the evangel which He proclaimed to men. For if we interpret these Greek words, evangel is \"good news,\" and angel is \"messenger.\" Again he says of Him, \"Behold I will send mine angel, and He will look out the way before my face: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come into His temple, even the Angel of the testament, whom ye desire. Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand at His appearing?\"[fn-34-P3490_1885985:74-nf] In this place he has foretold both the first and second advent of Christ: the first, to wit, of which he says, \"And He shall come suddenly into His temple;\" that is, into His flesh, of which He said in the Gospel, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\"[fn-34-P3491_1886287:75-nf] And of the second advent he says, \"Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand at His appearing?\" But what he says, \"The Lord whom ye seek, and the Angel of the testament whom ye desire,\" just means that even the Jews, according to the Scriptures which they read, shall seek and desire Christ. But many of them did not acknowledge that He whom they sought and desired had come, being blinded in their hearts, which were preoccupied with their own merits. Now what he here calls the testament, either above, where he says, \"My testament had been with Him,\" or here, where he has called Him the Angel of the testament, we ought, beyond a doubt, to take to be the new testament, in which the things promised are eternal, and not the old, in which they are only temporal. Yet many who are weak are troubled when they see the wicked abound in such temporal things, because they value them greatly, and serve the true God to be rewarded with them. On this account, to distinguish the eternal blessedness of the new testament, which shall be given only to the good, from the earthly felicity of the old, which for the most part is given to the bad as well, the same prophet says, \"Ye have made your words burdensome to me: yet ye have said, In what have we spoken ill of Thee? Ye have said, Foolish is every one who serves God; and what profit is it that we have kept His observances, and that we have walked as suppliants before the face of the Lord Almighty? And now we call the aliens blessed; yea, all that do wicked things are built up again; yea, they are opposed to God and are saved. They that feared the Lord uttered these reproaches every one to his neighbor: and the Lord hearkened and heard; and He wrote a book of remembrance before Him, for them that fear the Lord and that revere His name.\"[fn-34-P3492_1888166:76-nf] By that book is meant the New Testament. Finally, let us hear what follows: \"And they shall be an acquisition for me, saith the Lord Almighty, in the day which I make; and I will choose them as a man chooseth his son that serveth him. And ye shall return, and shall discern between the just and the unjust, and between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not. For, behold, the day cometh burning as an oven, and it shall burn them up; and all the aliens and all that do wickedly shall be stubble: and the day that shall come will set them on fire, saith the Lord Almighty, and shall leave neither root nor branch. And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, and health shall be in His wings; and ye shall go forth, and exult as calves let loose from bonds. And ye shall tread down the wicked, and they shall be ashes under your feet, in the day in which I shall do [this], saith the Lord Almighty.\"[fn-34-P3493_1889123:77-nf] This day is the day of judgment, of which, if God will, we shall speak more fully in its own place.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_30_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_hero_a_deacon_of_antioch","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"Honour widows that are widows indeed.\"[fn-28-P2807_454786:14-nf] Be the friend of orphans; for God is \"the Father of the fatherless, and the Judge of the widows.\"[fn-28-P2808_454902:15-nf] Do nothing without the bishops; for they are priests, and thou a servant of the priests.

In response to which is the psalm, \"Their sound is gone through all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world; \"[fn-51-P5142_1615415:310-nf] that is, the words of them who carry round about the law that proceeded from Sion and the Lord's word from Jerusalem, in order that that might come to pass which was written: \"They who were far from my righteousness, have come near to my righteousness and truth.\"[fn-51-P5143_1615698:311-nf] When the apostles girded their loins for this business, they renounced the elders and rulers and priests of the Jews. Well, says he, but was it not above all things that they might preach the other god? Rather[fn-51-P5144_1616043:312-nf] (that they might preach) that very self-same God, whose scripture they were with all their might fulfilling! \"Depart ye, depart ye,\" exclaims Isaiah; \"go ye out from thence, and touch not the unclean thing,\" that is blasphemy against Christ; \"Go ye out of the midst of her,\" even of the synagogue\" Be ye separate who bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-51-P5145_1616406:313-nf] For already had the Lord, according to the preceding words (of the prophet), revealed His Holy One with His arm, that is to say, Christ by His mighty power, in the eyes of the nations, so that all the[fn-51-P5146_1616628:314-nf] nations and the utmost parts of the earth have seen the salvation, which was from God. By thus departing from Judaism itself, when they exchanged the obligations and burdens of the law for the liberty of the gospel, they were fulfilling the psalm, \"Let us burst their bonds asunder, and cast away their yoke from us; \"and this indeed (they did) after that \"the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain devices; \"after that \"the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers took their counsel together against the Lord, and against His Christ.\"[fn-51-P5147_1617197:315-nf] What did the apostles thereupon suffer? You answer: Every sort of iniquitous persecutions, from men that belonged indeed to that Creator who was the adversary of Him whom they were preaching. Then why does the Creator, if an adversary of Christ, not only predict that the apostles should incur this suffering, but even express His displeasure[fn-51-P5148_1617587:316-nf] thereat? For He ought neither to predict the course of the other god, whom, as you contend, He knew not, nor to have expressed displeasure at that which He had taken care to bring about. \"See how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and how merciful men are taken away, and no man considereth. For the righteous man has been removed from the evil person.\"[fn-51-P5149_1617980:317-nf] Who is this but Christ? \"Come, say they, let us take away the righteous, because He is not for our turn, (and He is clean contrary to our doings).\"[fn-51-P5150_1618149:318-nf] Premising, therefore, and likewise subjoining the fact that Christ suffered, He foretold that His just ones should suffer equally with Him-both the apostles and all the faithful in succession; and He signed them with that very seal of which Ezekiel spake: \"The Lord said unto me, Go through the gate, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set the mark <i>tau upon the foreheads of the men.\"[fn-51-P5151_1618567:319-nf] Now the Greek letter <i>tau and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which He predicted would be the sign on our foreheads in the true Catholic Jerusalem,[fn-51-P5152_1619095:320-nf] in which, according to the twenty-first Psalm, the brethren of Christ or children of God would ascribe glory to God the Father, in the person of Christ Himself addressing His Father; \"I will declare Thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I sing praise unto Thee.\" For that which had to come to pass in our day in His name, and by His Spirit, He rightly foretold would be of Him. And a little afterwards He says: \"My praise shall be of Thee in the great congregation.\"[fn-51-P5153_1619694:321-nf] In the sixty-seventh Psalm He says again: \"In the congregations bless ye the Lord God.\"[fn-51-P5154_1619807:322-nf] So that with this agrees also the prophecy of Malachi: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord; neither will I accept your offerings: for from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place sacrifice shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering\"[fn-51-P5155_1620161:323-nf] -such as the ascription of glory, and blessing, and praise, and hymns.

To encourage a belief of this Gospel he has actually[fn-52-P5238_1638178:4-nf] devised for it a sort of dower,[fn-52-P5239_1638227:5-nf] in a work composed of contrary statements set in opposition, thence entitled Antitheses, and compiled with a view to such a severance of the law from the gospel as should divide the Deity into two, nay, diverse, gods-one for each Instrument, or Testament[fn-52-P5240_1638500:6-nf] as it is more usual to call it; that by such means he might also patronize[fn-52-P5241_1638600:7-nf] belief in \"the Gospel according to the Antitheses.\" These, however, I would have attacked in special combat, hand to hand; that is to say, I would have encountered singly the several devices Of the Pontic heretic, if it were not much more convenient to refute them in and with that very gospel to which they contribute their support. Although it is so easy to meet them at once with a peremptory demurrer,[fn-52-P5242_1639025:8-nf] yet, in order that I may both make them admissible in argument, and account them valid expressions of opinion, and even contend that they make for our side, that so there may be all the redder shame for the blindness of their author, we have now drawn out some antitheses of our own in opposition to Marcion.And indeed[fn-52-P5243_1639576:9-nf] I do allow that one order did run its course in the old dispensation under the Creator,[fn-52-P5244_1639680:10-nf] and that another is on its way in the new under Christ. I do not deny that there is a difference in the language of their documents, in their precepts of virtue, and in their teachings of the law; but yet all this diversity is consistent with one and the same God, even Him by whom it was arranged and also foretold. Long ago[fn-52-P5245_1640028:11-nf] did Isaiah declare that \"out of Sion should go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem\"[fn-52-P5246_1640142:12-nf] -some other law, that is, and another word. In short, says he, \"He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; \"[fn-52-P5247_1640289:13-nf] meaning not those of the Jewish people only, but of the nations which are judged by the new law of the gospel and the new word of the apostles, and are amongst themselves rebuked of their old error as soon as they have believed. And as the result of this, \"they beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears (which are a kind of hunting instruments) into pruning-hooks; \"[fn-52-P5248_1640686:14-nf] that is to say, minds, which once were fierce and cruel, are changed by them into good dispositions productive of good fruit. And again: \"Hearken unto me, hearken unto me, my people, and ye kings, give ear unto me; for a law shall proceed from me, and my judgment for a light to the nations; \"[fn-52-P5249_1640997:15-nf] wherefore He had determined and decreed that the nations also were to be enlightened by the law and the word of the gospel. This will be that law which (according to David also) is unblameable, because \"perfect, converting the soul\"[fn-52-P5250_1641270:16-nf] from idols unto God. This likewise will be the word concerning which the same Isaiah says, \"For the Lord will make a decisive word in the land.\"[fn-52-P5251_1641432:17-nf] Because the New Testament is compendiously short,[fn-52-P5252_1641554:18-nf] and freed from the minute and perplexing[fn-52-P5253_1641614:19-nf] burdens of the law. But why enlarge, when the Creator by the same prophet foretells the renovation more manifestly and clearly than the light itself? \"Remember not the former things, neither consider the things of old\" (the old things have passed away, and new things are arising). \"Behold, I will do new things, which shall now spring forth.\"[fn-52-P5254_1641975:20-nf] So by Jeremiah: \"Break up for yourselves new pastures,[fn-52-P5255_1642055:21-nf] and sow not among thorns, and circumcise yourselves in the foreskin of your heart.\"[fn-52-P5256_1642186:22-nf] And in another passage: \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Jacob, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I arrested their dispensation, in order to bring them out of the land of Egypt.\"[fn-52-P5257_1642532:23-nf] He thus shows that the ancient covenant is temporary only, when He indicates its change; also when He promises that it shall be followed by an eternal one. For by Isaiah He says: \"Hear me, and ye shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,\" adding \"the sure mercies of David,\"[fn-52-P5258_1642871:24-nf] in order that He might show that that covenant was to run its course in Christ. That He was of the family of David, according to the genealogy of Mary,[fn-52-P5259_1643040:25-nf] He declared in a figurative way even by the rod which was to proceed out of the stem of Jesse.[fn-52-P5260_1643581:26-nf] Forasmuch then as he said, that from the Creator there would come other laws, and other words, and new dispensations of covenants, indicating also that the very sacrifices were to receive higher offices, and that amongst all nations, by Malachi when he says: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, neither will I accept your sacrifices at your hands. For from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place a sacrifice is offered unto my name, even a pure offering\"[fn-52-P5261_1644145:27-nf] -meaning simple prayer from a pure conscience,-it is of necessity that every change which comes as the result of innovation, introduces a diversity in those things of which the change is made, from which diversity arises also a contrariety. For as there is nothing, after it has undergone a change, which does not become different, so there is nothing different which is not contrary.[fn-52-P5262_1644551:28-nf] Of that very thing, therefore, there will be predicated a contrariety in consequence of its diversity, to which there accrued a change of condition after an innovation. He who brought about the change, the same instituted the diversity also; He who foretold the innovation, the same announced beforehand the contrariety likewise. Why, in your interpretation, do you impute a difference in the state of things to a difference of powers? Why do you wrest to the Creator's prejudice those examples from which you draw your antitheses, when you may recognise them all in His sensations and affections? \"I will wound,\" He says, \"and I will heal; \"\"I will kill,\" He says again, \"and I will make alive\"[fn-52-P5263_1645272:29-nf] -even the same \"who createth evil and maketh peace; \"[fn-52-P5264_1645349:30-nf] from which you are used even to censure Him with the imputation of fickleness and inconstancy, as if He forbade what He commanded, and commanded what He forbade. Why, then, have you not reckoned up the Antitheses also which occur in the natural works of the Creator, who is for ever contrary to Himself? You have not been able, unless I am misinformed, to recognise the fact,[fn-52-P5265_1645743:31-nf] that the world, at all events,[fn-52-P5266_1645791:32-nf] even amongst your people of Pontus, is made up of a diversity of elements which are hostile to one another.[fn-52-P5267_1645912:33-nf] It was therefore your bounden duty first to have determined that the god of the light was one being, and the god of darkness was another, in such wise that you might have been able to have distinctly asserted one of them to be the god of the law and the other the god of the gospel. It is, however, the settled conviction already[fn-52-P5268_1646266:34-nf] of my mind from manifest proofs, that, as His works and plans[fn-52-P5269_1646352:35-nf] exist in the way of Antitheses, so also by the same rule exist the mysteries of His religion.[fn-52-P5270_1646474:36-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_23_lecture_xviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"25.

For he says, \"You say, then, unto me, \"Why doth He yet find fault? For who has resisted His will?\" And to him who says this he answered, \"O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Doth the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power of the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour \"[fn-53-P5322_2092551:26-nf] Then, following on, he opened up this great and hidden secret as far as he judged it fit that it should be disclosed to men, saying, \"But if God, willing to show His wrath and to demonstrate His power, endured in much patience the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, even that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy which He has prepared for glory.\"[fn-53-P5323_2092953:27-nf] This is notonly the assistance, but, moreover, the proof of God's grace-the assistance, namely, in thevessels of mercy, but the proof in the vessels of wrath; for in these He shows His anger andmakes known His power, because His goodnessis so mighty that He even uses the evil well; andin those He makes known the riches of Hisglory on the vessels of mercy, because what thejustice of a punisher requires from the vessels ofwrath, the grace of the Deliverer remits to the i vessels of mercy. Nor would the kindnesswhich is bestowed on some freely appear, unless I to other equally guilty and from the same massGod showed what was really due to both, andcondemned them with a righteous judgment.\"For who maketh thee to differ?\"[fn-53-P5324_2093702:28-nf] says the same apostle to a man as it were boasting concerning himself and his own benefits. \"For who maketh thee to differ\" from the vessels of wrath; of course, from the mass of perdition which has sent all by one into damnation? \"Who maketh thee to differ?\" And as if he had answered, \"My faith maketh me to differ,-my purpose, my merit,\"-he says, \"For what hast thou which thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou boast as if thou receivedst it not?\"-that is, as if that by which thou art made to differ were of thine own. Therefore He maketh thee to differ who bestows that whence thou art made to differ, by removing the penalty that is due, by conferring the grace which is not due. He maketh to differ, who, when the darkness was upon the face of the abyss, said,\" Let there be light; and there was light, and divided\"-that is, made to differ-\"between the light and the darkness.\"[fn-53-P5325_2094635:29-nf] For when there was only darkness, He did not find what He should make to differ; but by making the light, He made to differ; so that it may be said to the justified wicked, \"For ye were sometime darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.\"[fn-53-P5326_2094891:30-nf] And thus he who glories must glory not in himself, but in the Lord. He makes to differ who-of those who are not yet born, and who have not yet done any good or evil, that His purpose, according to the election, might stand not of works, but of Himself that calleth-said, The older shall serve the younger, and commending that very purpose afterwards by the mouth of the prophet, said, \"Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.\"[fn-53-P5327_2095337:31-nf] Because he said \"the election,\" and in this God does not find made by another what He may choose, but Himself makes what He may find; just as it is written of the remnant of Israel: \"There is made a remnant by the election of grace; but if by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace.\"[fn-53-P5328_2095667:32-nf] On which account you are certainly foolish who, when the Truth declares, \"Not of works, but of Him that calleth, it was said,\" say that Jacob was loved on account of future works which God foreknew that he would do, and thus contradict the apostle when he says, \"Not of works;\" as if he could not have said, \"Not of present, but of future works.\" But he says, \"Not of works,\" that He night commend grace; \"but if of grace, now is it no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace.\" For grace, not due, but free, precedes, that by it good works may be done; but if good works should precede, grace should be repaid, as it were, to works, and thus grace should be no more grace.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_43_the_first_book_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"It was not thus that pious and humble teacher thought-I speak of the most blessed Cyprian-when he said \"that we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.\"[fn-66-P6696_2549356:21-nf] And in order to show the, he appealed to the apostle as a witness, where he said, \"For what hast thou that thou hast not received? And if thou hast received it, why boastest thou as if thou hadst not received it?\"[fn-66-P6697_2549667:22-nf] And it was chiefly by this testimony that I myself also was convinced when I was in a similar error, thinking that faith whereby we believe on God is not God's gift, but that it is in us from ourselves, and that by it we obtain the gifts of God, whereby we may live temperately and righteously and piously in this world. For I did not think that faith was preceded by God's grace, so that by its means would be given to us what we might profitably ask, except that we could not believe if the proclamation of the truth did not precede; but that we should consent when the gospel was preached to us I thought was our own doing, and came to us from ourselves. And this my error is sufficiently indicated in some small works of mine written before my episcopate. Among these is that which you have mentioned in your letters[fn-66-P6698_2550507:23-nf] wherein is an exposition of certain propositions from the Epistle to the Romans. Eventually, when I was retracting all my small works, and was committing that retractation to writing,of which task I had already completed two books before I had taken up your more lengthy letters,-when in the first volume I had reached the retractation of this book, I then spoke thus:-\"Also discussing, I say, `what God could have chosen in him who was as yet unborn, whom He said that the elder should serve; and what in the same elder, equally as yet unborn, He could have rejected; concerning whom, on this account, the prophetic testimony is recorded, although declared long subsequently, \"Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated,\"'[fn-66-P6699_2551301:24-nf] I carried out my reasoning to the point of saying: `God did not therefore choose the works of any one in foreknowledge of what He Himself would give them, but he chose the faith, in the foreknowledge that He would choose that very person whom He foreknew would believe on Him,-to whom He would give the Holy Spirit, so that by doing good works he might obtain eternal life also.' I had not yet very carefully sought, nor had I as yet found, what is the nature of the election of grace, of which the apostle says, `A remnant are saved according to the election of grace.'[fn-67-P6700_2551909:25-nf] Which assuredly is not grace if any merits precede it; lest what is now given, not according to grace, but according to debt, be rather paid to merits than freely given. And what I next subjoined: `For the same apostle says, \"The same God which worketh all in all;\"[fn-67-P6701_2552192:26-nf] but it was never said, God believeth all in all;' and then added, `Therefore what we believe is our own, but what good thing we do is of Him who giveth the Holy Spirit to them that believe:' I certainly could not have said, had I already known that faith itself also is found among those gifts of God which are given by the same Spirit. Both, therefore, are ours on account of the choice of the will, and yet both are given by the spirit of faith and love, For faith is not alone but as it is written, `Love with faith, from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.'[fn-67-P6702_2552781:27-nf] And what I said a little after, `For it is ours to believe and to will, but it is His to give to those who believe and will, the power of doing good works through the Holy Spirit, by whom love is shed abroad in our hearts,'-is true indeed; but by the same rule both are also God's, because God prepares the will; and both are ours too, because they are only brought about with our good wills. And thus what I subsequently said also: `Because we are not able to will unless we are called; and when, after our calling, we would will, our willing is not sufficiently nor our running, unless God gives strength to us that run, and leads us whither He calls us;' and thereupon added:' It is plain, therefore, that it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy, that we do good works'-this is absolutely most true. But I discovered little concerning the calling itself, which is according to God's purpose; for not such is the calling of all that are called, but only of the elect. Therefore what I said a little afterwards: `For as in those whom God elects it is not works but faith that begins the merit so as to do good works by the gift of God, so in those whom He condemns, unbelief and impiety begin the merit of punishment, so that even by way of punishment itself they do evil works'-I spoke most truly. But that even the merit itself of faith was God's gift, I neither thought of inquiring into, nor did I say. And in another place I say: `For whom He has mercy upon, He makes to do good works, and whom He hardeneth He leaves to do evil works; but that mercy is bestowed upon the preceding merit of faith, and that hardening is applied to preceding iniquity.' And this indeed is true; but it should further have been asked, whether even the merit of faith does not come from God's mercy,-that is, whether that mercy is manifested in man only because he is a believer, or whether it is also manifested that he may be a believer? For we read in the apostles words: `I obtained mercy to be a believer.'[fn-67-P6703_2554843:28-nf] He does not say, `Because I was a believer.' Therefore although it is given to the believer, yet it has been given also that he may be a believer. Therefore also, in another place in the same book I most truly said: `Because, if it is of God's mercy, and not of works, that we are even called that we may believe and it is granted to us who believe to do good works, that mercy must not be grudged to the heathen;'-although I there discoursed less carefully about that calling which is given according to God's purpose.\"[fn-67-P6704_2555385:29-nf] ","title":"The First Book.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"284","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Then I said, \"Since I bring from the Scriptures and the facts themselves both the proofs and the inculcation of them, do not delay or hesitate to put faith in me, although I am an uncircumcised man; so short a time is left you in which to become proselytes.

But He utterly rejects those presented by you and by those priests of yours, saying, `And I will not accept your sacrifices at your hands; for from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is glorified among the Gentiles (He says); but ye profane it.'[fn-50-P5025_1128771:442-nf] Yet even now, in your love of contention, you assert that God does not accept the sacrifices of those who dwelt then in Jerusalem, and were called Israelites; but says that He is pleased with the prayers of the individuals of that nation then dispersed, and calls their prayers sacrifices.

For we read that many were slain in mercy by Moses the servant of the Lord; for in that he prayed thus in intercession to the Lord for their wicked sacrilege, saying, \"O Lord, if Thou wilt forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of the book which Thou hast written,\"[fn-53-P5319_2567399:242-nf] his unspeakable charity and mercy are plainly shown.

But I grieve and am pained, that all people do not know this man, as much as they ought to know him; but some are so far ignorant of him, as not even to know for certainty the number of his Epistles. And this comes not of incapacity, but of their not having the wish to be continually conversing with this blessed man. For it is not through any natural readiness and sharpness of wit that even I am acquainted with as much as I do know, if I do know anything, but owing to a continual cleaving to the man, and an earnest affection towards him. For, what belongs to men beloved, they who love them know above all others; because they are interested in them. And this also this blessed Apostle shows in what he said to the Philippians; \"Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the Gospel.\" (Phil. i. 7.) And so ye also, if ye be willing to apply to the reading of him with a ready mind, will need no other aid. For the word of Christ is true which saith, \"Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" (Matt. vii. 7.) But since the greater part of those who here gather themselves to us, have taken upon themselves the bringing up of children, and the care of a wife, and the charge of a family, and for this cause cannot afford to all events aroused to receive those things which have been brought together by others, and bestow as much attention upon the hearing of what is said as ye give to the gathering together of goods. For although it is unseemly to demand only so much of you, yet still one must be content if ye give as much. For from this it is that our countless evils have arisen-from ignorance of the Scriptures; from this it is that the plague of heresies has broken out; from this that there are negligent lives; from this labors without advantage. For as men deprived of this daylight would not walk aright, so they that look not to the gleaming of the Holy Scriptures must needs be frequently and constantly sinning, in that they are walking the worst darkness. And that this fall not out, let us hold our eyes open to the bright shining of the Apostle's words; for this man's tongue shone forth above the sun, and be abounded more than all the rest in the word of doctrine; for since he labored more abundantly than they, he also drew upon himself a large measure of the Spirit's grace. (1 Cor. xv. 10.) And this I constantly affirm, not only from his Epistles, but also from the Acts. For if there were anywhere a season for oratory, to him men everywheregave place. Wherefore also he was thought by the unbelievers to be Mercurius, because he took the lead in speech. (Acts xiv. 12.) And as we are going to enter fully into this Epistle, it is necessary to give the date also at which it was written. For it is not, as most think, before all the others, but before all that were written from Rome, yet subsequent to the rest, though not to all of them. For both those to the Corinthians were sent before this: and this is plain from what he wrote at the end of this, saying as follows: \"But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints: for it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.\" (Rom. xv. 25, Rom xv. 26..) For in writing to the Corinthians he says: \"If it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me\" (I Cor. xvi. 4); meaning this about those who were to carry the money from thence. Whence it is plain, that when he wrote to the Corinthians, the matter of this journey of his was in doubt, but when to the Romans, it stood now a decided thing. And this being allowed, the other point is plain, that this Epistle was after those. But that to the Thessalonians also seems to me to be before the Epistle to the Corinthians: for having written to them before, and having moved the question of alms to them, when he said, \"But as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren\" (1 Thess. iv. 9, 1 Thess. iv. I0): then he wrote to the Corinthians. And this very point he makes plain in the words, \"For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago, and your zeal hath provoked very many\" (2 Cor. ix. 2): whence he shows that they were the first he had spoken to about this. This Epistle then is later than those, but prior (prwth) to those from Rome; for he had not as yet set foot in the city of the Romans when he wrote this Epistle, and this he shows by saying, \"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift.\" (Rom. i. 11.) But it was from Rome he wrote to the Philip plans; wherefore he says, \"All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caear's household\" (Phil. iv. 22): and to the Hebrews from thence likewise, wherefore also he says, \"all they of Italy salute them.\" (Heb. xiii. 24.) And the Epistle to Timothy he sent also from Rome, when in prison; which also seems to me to be the last of all the Epistles; and this is plain from the end: \"For I am now ready to be offered,\" he says, \"and the time of my departure is at hand.\" (2 Tim. iv. 6.) But that he ended his life there, is clear, I may say, to every one. And that to Philemon is also very late, (for he wrote it in extreme old age, wherefore also he said, \"as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner in Christ Jesus\") (Philem. 9), yet previous to that to the Colossians. And this again is plain from the end. For in writing to the Colossians, he says, \"All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, whom I have sent with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother.\" (Col. iv. 7.) For this was that Onesimus in whose behalf he composed the Epistle to Philemon. And that this was no other of the same name with him, is plain from the mention of Archippus. For it is he whom he had taken as worker together with himself in the Epistle to Philemon, when he besought him for Onesimus, whom when writing to the Colossians he stirreth up, saying, \"Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received, that thou fulfil it.\" (Col. iv. 17.) And that to the Galatians seems to me to be before that to the Romans.[fn-19-P1946_1959935:2-nf] But if they have a different order in the Bibles, that is nothing wonderful, since the twelve Prophets, though not exceeding one another in order of time, but standing at great intervals from one another, are in the arrangement of the Bible placed in succession. Thus Haggai and Zachariah and the Messenger[fn-19-P1947_1960627:3-nf] prophesied after Ezekiel and Daniel, and long after Jonah and Zephaniah and all the rest. Yet they are nevertheless joined with all those from whom they stand so far off in time.","title":"Preface to Homilies on Romans","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_64_preface_to_homilies_on_romans","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"As I keep hearing the Epistles of the blessed Paul read, and that twice every week, and often three or four times, whenever we are celebrating the memorials of the holy martyrs, gladly do I enjoy the spiritual trumpet, and get roused and warmed with desire at recognizing the voice so dear to me, and seem to fancy him all but present to my sight, and behold him conversing with me.

(1 Cor. xv. 10.) And this I constantly affirm, not only from his Epistles, but also from the Acts. For if there were anywhere a season for oratory, to him men everywheregave place. Wherefore also he was thought by the unbelievers to be Mercurius, because he took the lead in speech. (Acts xiv. 12.) And as we are going to enter fully into this Epistle, it is necessary to give the date also at which it was written. For it is not, as most think, before all the others, but before all that were written from Rome, yet subsequent to the rest, though not to all of them. For both those to the Corinthians were sent before this: and this is plain from what he wrote at the end of this, saying as follows: \"But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints: for it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.\" (Rom. xv. 25, Rom xv. 26..) For in writing to the Corinthians he says: \"If it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me\" (I Cor. xvi. 4); meaning this about those who were to carry the money from thence. Whence it is plain, that when he wrote to the Corinthians, the matter of this journey of his was in doubt, but when to the Romans, it stood now a decided thing. And this being allowed, the other point is plain, that this Epistle was after those. But that to the Thessalonians also seems to me to be before the Epistle to the Corinthians: for having written to them before, and having moved the question of alms to them, when he said, \"But as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren\" (1 Thess. iv. 9, 1 Thess. iv. I0): then he wrote to the Corinthians. And this very point he makes plain in the words, \"For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago, and your zeal hath provoked very many\" (2 Cor. ix. 2): whence he shows that they were the first he had spoken to about this. This Epistle then is later than those, but prior (prwth) to those from Rome; for he had not as yet set foot in the city of the Romans when he wrote this Epistle, and this he shows by saying, \"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift.\" (Rom. i. 11.) But it was from Rome he wrote to the Philip plans; wherefore he says, \"All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caear's household\" (Phil. iv. 22): and to the Hebrews from thence likewise, wherefore also he says, \"all they of Italy salute them.\" (Heb. xiii. 24.) And the Epistle to Timothy he sent also from Rome, when in prison; which also seems to me to be the last of all the Epistles; and this is plain from the end: \"For I am now ready to be offered,\" he says, \"and the time of my departure is at hand.\" (2 Tim. iv. 6.) But that he ended his life there, is clear, I may say, to every one. And that to Philemon is also very late, (for he wrote it in extreme old age, wherefore also he said, \"as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner in Christ Jesus\") (Philem. 9), yet previous to that to the Colossians. And this again is plain from the end. For in writing to the Colossians, he says, \"All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, whom I have sent with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother.\" (Col. iv. 7.) For this was that Onesimus in whose behalf he composed the Epistle to Philemon. And that this was no other of the same name with him, is plain from the mention of Archippus. For it is he whom he had taken as worker together with himself in the Epistle to Philemon, when he besought him for Onesimus, whom when writing to the Colossians he stirreth up, saying, \"Say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received, that thou fulfil it.\" (Col. iv. 17.) And that to the Galatians seems to me to be before that to the Romans.[fn-19-P1946_1959935:2-nf] But if they have a different order in the Bibles, that is nothing wonderful, since the twelve Prophets, though not exceeding one another in order of time, but standing at great intervals from one another, are in the arrangement of the Bible placed in succession. Thus Haggai and Zachariah and the Messenger[fn-19-P1947_1960627:3-nf] prophesied after Ezekiel and Daniel, and long after Jonah and Zephaniah and all the rest. Yet they are nevertheless joined with all those from whom they stand so far off in time.","title":"Preface to Homilies on Romans","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_61_xi_the_first_conference_of_abbot_chaeremon_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"And if to anyone relying on the help of God and not on his own efforts, it has been vouch-safed to acquire this state, from the condition of a Servant, wherein is fear, and from a mercenary greed of hope, whereby there is sought not so much the good of the donor as the recompense of reward, he will begin to pass on to the adoption of sons, where there is no longer fear, nor greed, but that love which never faileth continually endures. Of which fear and love the Lord in chiding some shows what is befitting for each one: \"A son knoweth his own father, and a servant feareth his lord: And if I be a Father, where is My honour: and if I be a Lord, where is my fear?\"[fn-51-P5163_1867256:19-nf] For one who is a servant must needs fear because \"if knowing his lord's will he has done things worthy of stripes, he shall be beaten with many stripes.\"[fn-51-P5164_1867426:20-nf] Whoever then by this love has attained the image and likeness of God, will now delight in goodness for the pleasure of goodness itself, and having somehow a like feeling of patience and gentleness will henceforth be angered by no faults of sinners, but in his compassion and sympathy will rather ask for pardon for their infirmities, and, remembering that for so long he himself was tried by the stings of similar passions till by the Lord's mercy he was saved, will feel that, as he was saved from carnal attacks not by the teaching of his own exertions but by God's protection, not anger but pity ought to be shown to those who go astray; and with full peace of mind will he sing to God the following verse: \"Thou hast broken my chains. I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of praise;\" and: \"except the Lord had helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell.\"[fn-51-P5165_1868307:21-nf] And while he continues in this humility of mind he will be able even to fulfil this Evangelic command of perfection: \"Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that persecute you and slander you.\"[fn-51-P5166_1868584:22-nf] And so it will be vouchsafed to us to attain that reward which is subjoined, whereby we shall not only bear the image and likeness of God, but shall even be called sons: \"that ye may be,\" says He \"sons of your Father which is in heaven, Who maketh His sun to rise on the good and evil, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust:\"[fn-51-P5167_1868938:23-nf] and this feeling the blessed John knew that he had attained when he said: \"that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because as He is so are we also in this world.\"[fn-51-P5168_1869126:24-nf] For in what can a weak and fragile human nature be like Him, except in always showing a calm love in its heart towards the good and evil, the just and the unjust, in imitation of God, and by doing good for the love of goodness itself, arriving at that true adoption of the sons of God, of which also the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: \"Every one that is born of God doeth not sin, for His seed is in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God;\" and again: \"We know that every one who is born of God sinneth not, but his birth of God preserves him, and the wicked one toucheth him not?\"[fn-51-P5169_1869743:25-nf] And this must be understood not of all kinds of sins, but only of mortal sins: and if any one will not extricate and cleanse himself from these, for him the aforesaid Apostle tells us in another place that we ought not even to pray, saying: \"If a man knows his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, let him ask, and He will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he should ask for it.\"[fn-51-P5170_1870216:26-nf] But of those which he says are not unto death, from which even those who serve Christ faithfully cannot, with whatever care they keep themselves, be free, of these he says: \"If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us;\" and again: \"If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.\"[fn-51-P5171_1870583:27-nf] For it is an impossibility for any one of the saints not to fall into those trivial faults which are committed by word, and thought, and ignorance, and forgetfulness, and necessity, and will, and surprise: which though quite different from that sin which is said to be unto death, still cannot be free from fault and blame.","title":"XI. The First Conference of Abbot Chaeremon.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_61_xi_the_first_conference_of_abbot_chaeremon_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Whoever then has been established in this perfect love is sure to mount by a higher stage to that still more sublime fear belonging to love, which is the outcome of no dread of punishment or greed of reward, but of the greatest love; whereby a son fears with earnest affection a most indulgent father, or a brother fears his brother, a friend his friend, or a wife her husband, while there is no dread of his blows or reproaches, but only of a slight injury to his love, and while in every word as well as act there is ever care taken by anxious affection lest the warmth of his love should cool in the very slightest degree towards the object of it. And one of the prophets has finely described the grandeur of this fear, saying: \"Wisdom and knowledge are the riches of salvation: the fear of the Lord is his treasure.\"[fn-52-P5207_1879765:46-nf] He could not describe with greater clearness the worth and value of that fear than by saying that the riches of our salvation, which consist in true wisdom and knowledge of God, can only be preserved by the fear of the Lord. To this fear then not sinners but saints are invited by the prophetic word where the Psalmist says: \"O fear the Lord, all ye His Saints: for they that fear Him lack nothing.\"[fn-52-P5208_1880185:47-nf] For where a man fears the Lord with this fear it is certain that nothing is lacking to his perfection. For it was clearly of that other penal fear that the Apostle John said that \"He who feareth is not made perfect in love, for fear hath punishment.\"[fn-52-P5209_1880466:48-nf] There is then a great difference between this fear, to which nothing is lacking, which is the treasure of wisdom and knowledge, and that imperfect fear which is called \"the beginning of wisdom,\"[fn-52-P5210_1880681:49-nf] and which has in it punishment and so is expelled from the hearts of those who are perfect by the incoming of the fulness of love. For \"there is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear.\"[fn-52-P5211_1880903:50-nf] And in truth if the beginning of wisdom consists in fear, what will its perfection be except in the love Of Christ which, as it contains in it the fear which belongs to perfect love, is called not the beginning but the treasure of wisdom and knowledge? And therefore there is a twofold stage of fear. The one for beginners, i.e., for those who are still subject to the yoke and to servile terror; of which we read: \"And the servant shall fear his Lord;\"[fn-52-P5212_1881377:51-nf] and in the gospel: \"I no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth;\" and therefore \"the servant,\" He tells us, \"abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth for ever.\"[fn-52-P5213_1881610:52-nf] For He is instructing us to pass on from that penal fear to the fullest freedom of love, and the confidence of the friends and sons of God. Finally the blessed Apostle, who had by the power of the Lord's love already passed through the servile stage of fear, scorns lower things and declares that he has been enriched with good things by the Lord, \"for God hath not given us\" he says \"a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind.\"[fn-52-P5214_1882090:53-nf] Those also who are inflamed with a perfect love of their heavenly Father, and whom the Divine adoption has already made sons instead of servants, he addresses in these words: \"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-52-P5215_1882417:54-nf] It is of this fear too, that the prophet spoke when he would describe that sevenfold spirit, which according to the mystery of the Incarnation, full surely descended on the God man:[fn-52-P5216_1882619:55-nf] \"And there shall rest upon Him the Spirit of the Lord: the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of knowledge and of true godliness,\" and in the last place he adds as something special these words: \"And the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-52-P5217_1882984:56-nf] Where we must in the first place notice carefully that he does not say \"and there shall rest upon Him the Spirit of fear,\" as he said in the earlier cases, but he says \"there shall fill Him the Spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" For such is the greatness of its richness that when once it has seized on a man by its power, it takes possession not of a portion but of his whole mind. And not without good reason. For as it is closely joined to that love which \"never faileth,\" it not only fills the man, but takes a lasting and inseparable and continual possession of him in whom it has begun, and is not lessened by any allurements of temporal joy or delights, as is sometimes the case with that fear which is cast out. This then is the fear belonging to perfection, with which we are told that the God-man,[fn-52-P5218_1883810:57-nf] who came not only to redeem mankind, but also to give us a pattern of perfection and example of goodness, was filled. For the true Son of God \"who did no sin neither was guile found in His mouth,\"[fn-52-P5219_1884028:58-nf] could not feel that servile fear of punishment.","title":"XI.

For it is from prophecy that we convince gainsaying pagans. Who is Christ says the pagan. To whom we reply, He whom the prophets foretold. What prophets asks he. We quote Isaiah, Daniel, Jeremiah, and other holy prophets: we tell him that they came long before Christ, by what length of time they preceded His coming. We make this reply then: Prophets came before Him, and they foretold His coming. One of them answers: What prophets? We quote for him those which are daily read to us. And, said he, Who are these prophets? We answer: Those who also foretold the things which we see come to pass. And he urges: You have forged these for yourselves, you have seen them come to pass, and have written them in what books you pleased, as if their coming had been predicted. Here in opposition to pagan enemies the witness of other enemies offers itself. We produce books written by the Jews, and reply: Doubtless both you and they are enemies of our faith. Hence are they scattered among the nations, that we may convince one class of enemies by another.

For although, as in the historical account, in no other place might the feast of the Passover be kept save only in Jerusalem, yet when the things pertaining to that time were fulfilled, and those which belonged to shadows had passed away, and the preaching of the Gospel was about to extend everywhere; when indeed the disciples were spreading the feast in all places, they asked the Saviour, `Where wilt Thou that we shall make, ready?' The Saviour also, since He was changing the typical for the spiritual, promised them that they should no longer eat the flesh of a lamb, but His own, saying, `Take, eat and drink; this is My body, and My blood[fn-90-P9005_3291044:23-nf] .' When we are thus nourished by these things, we also, my beloved, shall truly keep the feast of the Passover.","title":"Letter IV.
