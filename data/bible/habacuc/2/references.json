Genesis, we shall be told, needs no explanation; its topics are too simple-the birth of the world, the origin of the human race,[fn-20-P2064_512271:1446-nf] the division of the earth,[fn-20-P2065_512316:1447-nf] the confusion of tongues,[fn-20-P2066_512357:1448-nf] and the descent of the Hebrews into Egypt![fn-20-P2067_512416:1449-nf] Exodus, no doubt, is equally plain, containing as it does merely an account of the ten plagues,[fn-20-P2068_512530:1450-nf] the decalogue,[fn-20-P2069_512567:1451-nf] and sundry mysterious and divine precepts! The meaning of Leviticus is of course self-evident, although every sacrifice that it describes, nay more every word that it contains, the description of Aaron's vestments,[fn-20-P2070_512798:1452-nf] and all the regulations connected with the Levites are symbols of things heavenly! The book of Numbers too-are not its very figures,[fn-20-P2071_512949:1453-nf] and Balaam's prophecy,[fn-20-P2072_512990:1454-nf] and the forty-two camping places in the wilderness[fn-20-P2073_513068:1455-nf] so many mysteries? Deuteronomy also, that is the second law or the foreshadowing of the law of the gospel,-does it not, while exhibiting things known before, put old truths in a new light? So far the `five words' of the Pentateuch, with which the apostle boasts his wish to speak in the Church.[fn-20-P2074_513403:1456-nf] Then, as for Job,[fn-20-P2075_513446:1457-nf] that pattern of patience, what mysteries are there not contained in his discourses? Commencing in prose the book soon glides into verse and at the end once more reverts to prose. By the way in which it lays down propositions, assumes postulates, adduces proofs, and draws inferences, it illustrates all the laws of logic. Single words occurring in the book are full of meaning. To say nothing of other topics, it prophesies the resurrection of men's bodies at once with more clearness and with more caution than any one has yet shewn. \"I know,\" Job says, \"that my redeemer liveth, and that at the last day I shall rise again from the earth; and I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. This my hope is stored up in my own bosom.\"[fn-20-P2076_514427:1458-nf] I will pass on to Jesus the son of Nave[fn-20-P2077_514498:1459-nf] -a type of the Lord in name as well as in deed-who crossed over Jordan, subdued hostile kingdoms, divided the land among the conquering people and who, in every city, village, mountain, river, hill-torrent, and boundary which he dealt with, marked out the spiritual realms of the heavenly Jerusalem, that is, of the church.[fn-20-P2078_514923:1460-nf] In the book of Judges every one of the popular leaders is a type. Ruth the Moabitess fulfils the prophecy of Isaiah:-\"Send thou a lamb, O Lord, as ruler of the land from the rock of the wilderness to the mount of the daughter of Zion.\"[fn-20-P2079_515181:1461-nf] Under the figures of Eli's death and the slaying of Saul Samuel shews the abolition of the old law. Again in Zadok and in David he bears witness to the mysteries of the new priesthood and of the new royalty. The third and fourth books of Kings called in Hebrew Malachim give the history of the kingdom of Judah from Solomon to Jeconiah,[fn-20-P2080_515583:1462-nf] and of that of Israel from Jeroboam the son of Nebat to Hoshea who was carried away into Assyria. If you merely regard the narrative, the words are simple enough, but if you look beneath the surface at the hidden meaning of it, you find a description of the small numbers of the church and of the wars which the heretics wage against it. The twelve prophets whose writings are compressed within the narrow limits of a single volume,[fn-20-P2081_516060:1463-nf] have typical meanings far different from their literal ones. Hosea speaks many times of Ephraim, of Samaria, of Joseph, of Jezreel, of a wife of whoredoms and of children of whoredoms,[fn-20-P2082_516313:1464-nf] of an adulteress shut up within the chamber of her husband, sitting for a long time in widowhood and in the garb of mourning, awaiting the time when her husband will return to her.[fn-20-P2083_516514:1465-nf] Joel the son of Pethuel describes the land of the twelve tribes as spoiled and devastated by the palmerworm the canker-worm, the locust, and the blight,[fn-20-P2084_516695:1466-nf] and predicts that after the overthrow of the former people the Holy Spirit shall be poured out upon God's servants and handmaids;[fn-20-P2085_516845:1467-nf] the same spirit, that is, which was to be poured out in the upper chamber at Zion upon the one hundred and twenty believers.[fn-20-P2086_516992:1468-nf] These believers rising by gradual and regular gradations from one to fifteen form the steps to which there is a mystical allusion in the \"psalms of degrees.\"[fn-20-P2087_517183:1469-nf] Amos, although he is only \"an herdman\" from the country, \"a gatherer of sycomore fruit,\"[fn-20-P2088_517386:1470-nf] cannot be explained in a few words. For who can adequately speak of the three transgressions and the four of Damascus, of Gaza, of Tyre, of Idumaea, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, and in the seventh and eighth place of Judah and of Israel? He speaks to the fat kine that are in the mountain of Samaria,[fn-20-P2089_517716:1471-nf] and bears witness that the great house and the little house shall fall.[fn-20-P2090_517809:1472-nf] He sees now the maker of the grasshopper,[fn-20-P2091_517873:1473-nf] now the Lord, standing upon a wall[fn-20-P2092_517930:1474-nf] daubed[fn-20-P2093_517959:1475-nf] or made of adamant,[fn-20-P2094_518004:1476-nf] now a basket of apples[fn-20-P2095_518048:1477-nf] that brings doom to the transgressors, and now a famine upon the earth \"not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\"[fn-20-P2096_518229:1478-nf] Obadiah, whose name means the servant of God, thunders against Edom red with blood and against the creature born of earth.[fn-20-P2097_518376:1479-nf] He smites him with the spear of the spirit because of his continual rivalry with his brother Jacob. Jonah, fairest of doves, whose shipwreck shews in a figure the passion of the Lord, recalls the world to penitence, and while he preaches to Nineveh, announces salvation to all the heathen. Micah the Morasthite a joint heir with Christ[fn-20-P2098_518792:1480-nf] announces the spoiling of the daughter of the robber and lays siege against her, because she has smitten the jawbone of the judge of Israel.[fn-20-P2099_519018:1481-nf] Nahum, the consoler of the world, rebukes \"the bloody city\"[fn-21-P2100_519104:1482-nf] and when it is overthrown cries: -\"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.\"[fn-21-P2101_519247:1483-nf] Habakkuk, like a strong and unyielding wrestler,[fn-21-P2102_519318:1484-nf] stands upon his watch and sets his foot upon the tower[fn-21-P2103_519419:1485-nf] that he may contemplate Christ upon the cross and say \"His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.\"[fn-21-P2104_519677:1486-nf] Zephaniah, that is the bodyguard and knower of the secrets of the Lord,[fn-21-P2105_519784:1487-nf] hears \"a cry from the fishgate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.\"[fn-21-P2106_519938:1488-nf] He proclaims \"howling to the inhabitants of the mortar;[fn-21-P2107_520016:1489-nf] for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.\"[fn-21-P2108_520161:1490-nf] Haggai, that is he who is glad or joyful, who has sown in tears to reap in joy,[fn-21-P2109_520267:1491-nf] is occupied with the rebuilding of the temple. He represents the Lord(the Father, that is) as saying \"Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations and he who is desired[fn-21-P2110_520552:1492-nf] of all nations shall come'[fn-21-P2111_520616:1493-nf] Zechariah, he that is mindful of his Lord,[fn-21-P2112_520692:1494-nf] gives us many prophecies. He sees Jesus,[fn-21-P2113_520776:1495-nf] \"clothed with filthy garments,\"[fn-21-P2114_520847:1496-nf] a stone with seven eyes,[fn-21-P2115_520895:1497-nf] a candle-stick all of gold with lamps as many as the eyes, and two olivetrees on the right side of the bowl[fn-21-P2116_521026:1498-nf] and on the left. After he has described the horses, red, black, white, and grisled,[fn-21-P2117_521145:1499-nf] and the cutting off of the chariot from Ephraim and of the horse from Jerusalem[fn-21-P2118_521249:1500-nf] he goes on to prophesy and predict a king who shall be a poor man and who shall sit \"upon a colt the foal of an ass.\"[fn-21-P2119_521390:1501-nf] Malachi, the last of all the prophets, speaks openly of the rejection of Israel and the calling of the nations. \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles: and in every place incense[fn-21-P2120_521758:1502-nf] is offered unto my name, and a pure offering.\"[fn-21-P2121_521844:1503-nf] As for Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, who can fully understand or adequately explain them? The first of them seems to compose not a prophecy but a gospel. The second speaks of a rod of an almond tree[fn-21-P2122_522089:1504-nf] and of a seething pot with its face toward the north,[fn-21-P2123_522164:1505-nf] and of a leopard which has changed its spots.[fn-21-P2124_522231:1506-nf] He also goes four times through the alphabet in different metres.[fn-21-P2125_522321:1507-nf] The beginning and ending of Ezekiel, the third of the four, are involved in so great obscurity that like the commencement of Genesis they are not studied by the Hebrews until they are thirty years old. Daniel, the fourth and last of the four prophets, having knowledge of the times and being interested in the whole world, in clear language proclaims the stone cut out of the mountain without hands that overthrows all kingdoms.[fn-21-P2126_522852:1508-nf] David, who is our Simonides, Pindar, and Alcaeus, our Horace, our Catullus, and our Serenus all in one, sings of Christ to his lyre; and on a psaltery with ten strings calls him from the lower world to rise again. Solomon, a lover of peace[fn-21-P2127_523114:1509-nf] and of the Lord, corrects morals, teaches nature, unites Christ and the church, and sings a sweet marriage song[fn-21-P2128_523258:1510-nf] to celebrate that holy bridal. Esther, a type of the church, frees her people from danger and, after having slain Haman whose name means iniquity, hands down to posterity a memorable day and a great feast.[fn-21-P2129_523492:1511-nf] The book of things omitted[fn-21-P2130_523569:1512-nf] or epitome of the old dispensation[fn-21-P2131_523683:1513-nf] is of such importance and value that without it any one who should claim to himself a knowledge of the scriptures would make himself a laughing stock in his own eyes. Every name used in it, nay even the conjunction of the words, serves to throw light on narratives passed over in the books of Kings and upon questions suggested by the gospel. Ezra and Nehemiah, that is the Lord's helper and His consoler, are united in a single book. They restore the Temple and build up the walls of the city. In their pages we see the throng of the Israelites returning to their native land, we read of priests and Levites, of Israel proper and of proselytes; and we are even told the several families to which the task of building the walls and towers was assigned. These references convey one meaning upon the surface, but another below it.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_08_tractate_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"9.

And now, because it is not a goddess, but a gift of God, let it be obtained by prayer from Him, by whom alone it can be given, and the whole crowd of false gods vanishes. But why is Faith believed to be a goddess, and why does she herself receive temple and altar? For whoever prudently acknowledges her makes his own self an abode for her. But how do they know what faith is, of which it is the prime and greatest function that the true God may be believed in? But why had not virtue sufficed? Does it not include faith also? Forasmuch as they have thought proper to distribute virtue into four divisions-prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance-and as each of these divisions has its own virtues, faith is among the parts of justice, and has the chief place with as many of us as know what that saying means, \"The just shall live by faith.\"[fn-7-P791_390777:16-nf] But if Faith is a goddess, I wonder why these keen lovers of a multitude of gods have wronged so many other goddesses, by passing them by, when they could have dedicated temples and altars to them likewise. Why has temperance not deserved to be a goddess, when some Roman princes have obtained no small glory on account of her? Why, in fine, is fortitude not a goddess, who aided Mucius when he thrust his right hand into the flames; who aided Curtius, when for the sake of his country he threw himself headlong into the yawning earth; who aided Decius the sire, and Decius the son, when they devoted themselves for the army?-though we might question whether these men had true fortitude, if this concerned our present discussion. Why have prudence and wisdom merited no place among the gods? Is it because they are all worshipped under the general name of Virtue itself?

He next explains what He has said\" of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.\" \"Of sin indeed,\" He says, \"because they have believed not on me.\" For this sin, as if it were the only one, He has put before the others; because with the continuance of this one, all others are retained, and in the removal of this, the others are remitted. \"But of righteousness,\" He adds, \"because I go to the Father, and ye shall see me no more.\" And here we have to consider in the first place, if any one is rightly reproved of sin, how he may also be rightly reproved of righteousness. For if a sinner ought to be reproved just because he is a sinner, will any one imagine that a righteous man is also to be reproved because he is righteous? Surely not. For if at any time a righteous man also is reproved, he is rightly reproved on this account, that, according to Scripture, \"There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.\" And accordingly, when a righteous man is reproved, he is reproved of sin, and not of righteousness. Since in that divine utterance also, where we read, \"Be not made righteous over-much,\"[fn-31-P3167_1771807:9-nf] there is notice taken, not of the righteousness of the wise man, but of the pride of the presumptuous. The man, therefore, that becomes \"righteous over-much,\" by that very excess becomes unrighteous.

This is now our righteousness, in which we pass through our course hungering and thirsting after the perfect and full righteousness, in order that we may hereafter be satisfied therewith. Therefore our Lord in the Gospel (after saying, \"Take heed that ye do not your righteousness[fn-25-P2508_1009792:55-nf] before men, to be seen of them,\"[fn-25-P2509_1010014:56-nf] ])in order that we should not measure our course of life by the limit of human glory, declared in his exposition of righteousness itself that there is none except there be these three,-fasting, alms, prayers. Now in the fastingHe indicates the entire subjugation of the body; in the alms,all kindness of will and deed, either by giving or forgiving; and in prayers He implies all the rules of a holy desire. So that, although by the subjugation of the body a check is given to that concupiscence, which ought not only to be bridled but to be put altogether out of existence (and which will not be found at all in that state of perfect righteousness, where sin shall be absolutely excluded),-yet it often exerts its immoderate desire even in the use of things which are allowable and right. In that real beneficence in which the just man consults his neighbour's welfare, things are sometimes done which are prejudicial, although it was thought that they would be advantageous. Sometimes, too, through infirmity, when the amount of the kindness and trouble which is expended either fails short of the necessities of the objects, or is of little use under the circumstances, then there steals over us a disappointment which tarnishes that \"cheerfulness\" which secures to the \"giver\" the approbation of God.[fn-25-P2510_1011337:57-nf] This trail of sadness,however, is the greater or the less, as each man has made more or less progress in his kindly purposes. If, then, these considerations, and such as these, be duly weighed, we are only right when we say in our prayers, \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.\"[fn-25-P2511_1011653:58-nf] But what we say in our prayers we must carry into act, even to loving our very enemies; or if any one who is still a babe in Christ fails as yet to reach this point, he must at any rate, whenever one who has trespassed against him repents and craves his pardon, exercise forgiveness from the bottom of his heart, if he would have his heavenly Father listen to his prayer.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Furthermore, concerning these words of Job, \"My heart shall not reproach me in all my life,\"[fn-25-P2596_1031351:115-nf] we remark, that it is in this present life of ours, in which we live by faith, that our heart does not reproach us, if the same faith whereby we believe unto righteousness does not neglect to rebuke our sin. On this principle the apostle says: \"The good that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.\"[fn-25-P2597_1031693:116-nf] Now it is a good thing to avoid concupiscence, and this good the just man would, who lives by faith;[fn-25-P2598_1031815:117-nf] and still he does what he hates, because he has concupiscence, although \"he goes not after his lusts;\"[fn-25-P2599_1031937:118-nf] if he has done this, he has himself at that time really done it, so as to yield to, and acquiesce in, and obey the desire of sin. His heart then reproaches him, because it reproaches himself, and not his sin which dwelleth in him. But whensoever he suffers not sin to reign in his mortal body to obey it in the lusts thereof,[fn-26-P2600_1032289:119-nf] and yields not his members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,[fn-26-P2601_1032380:120-nf] sin no doubt is present in his members, but it does not reign, because its desires are not obeyed. Therefore, while he does that which he would not,- in other words, while he wishes not to lust, but still lusts,-he consents to the law that it is good:[fn-26-P2602_1032652:121-nf] for what the law would, that he also wishes; because it is his desire not to indulge concupiscence, and the law expressly says, \"Thou shalt not covet.\"[fn-26-P2603_1032825:122-nf] Now in that he wishes what the law also would have done, he no doubt consents to the law: but still he lusts, because he is not without sin; it is, however, no longer himself that does the thing, but the sin which dwells within him. Hence it is that \"his heart does not reproach him in all his life;\" that is, in his faith, because the just man lives by faith, so that his faith is his very life. He knows, to be sure, that in himself dwells nothing good,- even in his flesh, which is the dwelling-place of sin. By not consenting, however, to it, he lives by faith, wherewith he also calls upon God to help him in his contest against sin. Moreover, there is present to him to will that no sin at all should be in him, but then how to perfect this good is not present. It is not the mere \"doing\" of a good thing that is not present to him, but the \"perfecting\" of it. For in this, that he yields no consent, he does good; he does good again, in this, that he hates his own lust; he does good also, in this, that he does not cease to give alms; and in this, that he forgives the man who sins against him, he does good; and in this, that he asks forgiveness for his own trespasses,-sincerely avowing in his petition that he also forgives those who trespass against himself, and praying that he may not be led into temptation, but be delivered from evil,-he does good. But how to perfect the good is not present to him; it will be, however, in that final state, when the concupiscence which dwells in his members shall exist no more. His heart, therefore, does not reproach him, when it reproaches the sin which dwells in his members; nor can it reproach unbelief in him. Thus \"in all his life,\"-that is, in his faith,-he is neither reproached by his own heart, nor convinced of not being withoutsin. And Job himself acknowledges this concerning himself, when he says, \"Not one of mysins hath escaped Thee; Thou hast sealed upmy transgressions in a bag, and marked if I havedone iniquity unawares.\"[fn-26-P2604_1034840:123-nf] With regard, then, to the passages which he has adduced from the book of holy Job, we have shown to the best of our ability in what sense they ought to be taken. He, however, has failed to explain the meaning of the words which he has himself quoted from the same Job: \"Who then is pure from uncleanness? Not one; even if he be an infant of only one day upon the earth.\"[fn-26-P2605_1035235:124-nf] ","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_110_sermon_xciii_cxliii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"4.

Why, however, might He not have used the example of faith in another[fn-59-P5947_1792781:658-nf] god? Because, if He had done so, He would have said that no such faith had ever had existence in Israel; but as the case stands,[fn-59-P5948_1792933:659-nf] He intimates that He ought to have found so great a faith in Israel, inasmuch as He had indeed come for the purpose of finding it, being in truth the God and Christ of Israel, and had now stigmatized[fn-59-P5949_1793149:660-nf] it, only as one who would enforce and Uphold it. If, indeed, He had been its antagonist,[fn-59-P5950_1793258:661-nf] He would have preferred finding it to be such faith,[fn-59-P5951_1793327:662-nf] having come to weaken and destroy it rather than to approve of it. He raised also the widow's son from death.[fn-59-P5952_1793485:663-nf] This was not a strange miracle.[fn-59-P5953_1793541:664-nf] The Creator's prophets had wrought such; then why not His Son much rather? Now, so evidently had the Lord Christ introduced no other god for the working of so momentous a miracle as this, that all who were present gave glory to the Creator, saying: \"A great prophet is risen up among us, and God hath visited His people.\"[fn-59-P5954_1793882:665-nf] What God? He, of course, whose people they were, and from whom had come their prophets. But if they glorified the Creator, and Christ (on hearing them, and knowing their meaning) refrained from correcting them even in their very act of invoking[fn-59-P5955_1794148:666-nf] the Creator in that vast manifestation of His glory in this raising of the dead, undoubtedly He either announced no other God but Him, whom He thus permitted to be honoured in His own beneficent acts and miracles, or else how happens it that He quietly permitted these persons to remain so long in their error, especially as He came for the very purpose to cure them of their error? But John is offended[fn-59-P5956_1794584:667-nf] when he hears of the miracles of Christ, as of an alien god.[fn-59-P5957_1794761:668-nf] Well, I on my side[fn-59-P5958_1794869:669-nf] will first explain the reason of his offence, that I may the more easily explode the scandal[fn-59-P5959_1794974:670-nf] of our heretic. Now, that the very Lord Himself of all might, the Word and Spirit of the Father,[fn-59-P5960_1795171:671-nf] was operating and preaching on earth, it was necessary that the portion of the Holy Spirit which, in the form of the prophetic gift,[fn-59-P5961_1795780:672-nf] had been through John preparing the ways of the Lord, should now depart from John,[fn-59-P5962_1795898:673-nf] and return back again of course to the Lord, as to its all-embracing original.[fn-59-P5963_1796513:674-nf] Therefore John, being now an ordinary person, and only one of the many,[fn-59-P5964_1796620:675-nf] was offended indeed as a man, but not because he expected or thought of another Christ as teaching or doing nothing new, for he was not even expecting such a one.[fn-59-P5965_1796809:676-nf] Nobody will entertain doubts about any one whom (since he knows him not to exist) he has no expectation or thought of. Now John was quite sure that there was no other God but the Creator, even as a Jew, especially as a prophet.[fn-59-P5966_1797052:677-nf] Whatever doubt he felt was evidently rather[fn-59-P5967_1797120:678-nf] entertained about Him[fn-59-P5968_1797159:679-nf] whom he knew indeed to exist but knew not whether He were the very Christ. With this fear, therefore, even John asks the question, \"Art thou He that should come, or look we for another? \"[fn-59-P5969_1797361:680-nf] -simply inquiring whether He was come as He whom he was looking for. \"Art thou He that should come? \"i.e. Art thou the coming One? \"or look we for another? \"i.e. Is He whom we are expecting some other than Thou, if Thou art not He whom we expect to come? For he was supposing,[fn-59-P5970_1797659:681-nf] as all men then thought, from the similarity of the miraculous evidences,[fn-59-P5971_1797750:682-nf] that a prophet might possibly have been meanwhile sent, from whom the Lord Himself, whose coming was then expected, was different, and to whom He was superior.[fn-59-P5972_1797931:683-nf] And there lay John's difficulty.[fn-59-P5973_1797978:684-nf] He was in doubt whether He was actually come whom all men were looking for; whom, moreover, they ought to have recognised by His predicted works, even as the Lord sent word to John, that it was by means of these very works that He was to be recognised.[fn-59-P5974_1798249:685-nf] Now, inasmuch as these predictions evidently related to the Creator's Christ-as we have proved in the examination of each of them-it was perverse enough, if he gave himself out to be not the Christ of the Creator, and rested the proof of his statement on those very evidences whereby he was urging his claims to be received as the Creator's Christ. Far greater still is his perverseness when, not being the Christ of John,[fn-59-P5975_1798698:686-nf] he yet bestows on John his testimony, affirming him to be a prophet, nay more, his messenger,[fn-59-P5976_1798979:687-nf] applying to him the Scripture, \"Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.\"[fn-59-P5977_1799114:688-nf] He graciously[fn-59-P5978_1799172:689-nf] adduced the prophecy in the superior sense of the alternative mentioned by the perplexed John, in order that, by affirming that His own precursor was already come in the person of John, He might quench the doubt[fn-59-P5979_1799402:690-nf] which lurked in his question: \"Art thou He that, should come, or look we for another? \"Now that the forerunner had fulfilled his mission, and the way of the Lord was prepared, He ought now to be acknowledged as that (Christ) for whom the forerunner had made ready the way. That forerunner was indeed \"greater than all of women born; \"[fn-59-P5980_1799755:691-nf] but for all that, He who was least in the kingdom of God[fn-59-P5981_1799833:692-nf] was not subject to him;[fn-59-P5982_1799921:693-nf] as if the kingdom in which the least person was greater than John belonged to one God, while John, who was greater than all of women born, belonged himself to another God. For whether He speaks of any \"least person\" by reason of his humble position, or of Himself, as being thought to be less than John-since all were running into the wilderness after John rather than after Christ (\"What went ye out into the wilderness to see? \"[fn-59-P5983_1801460:694-nf] )-the Creator has equal right[fn-59-P5984_1801511:695-nf] to claim as His own both John, greater than any born of women, and Christ, or every \"least person in the kingdom of heaven,\" who was destined to be greater than John in that kingdom, although equally pertaining to the Creator, and who would be so much greater than the prophet,[fn-59-P5985_1801825:696-nf] because he would not have been offended at Christ, an infirmity which then lessened the greatness of John.We have already spoken of the forgiveness[fn-59-P5986_1802002:697-nf] of sins. The behaviour of \"the woman which was a sinner,\" when she covered the Lord's feet with her kisses, bathed them with her tears, wiped them with the hairs of her head, anointed them with ointment,[fn-59-P5987_1802225:698-nf] produced an evidence that what she handled was not an empty phantom,[fn-59-P5988_1802318:699-nf] but a really solid body, and that her repentance as a sinner deserved forgiveness according to the mind of the Creator, who is accustomed to prefer mercy to sacrifice.[fn-59-P5989_1802541:700-nf] But even if the stimulus of her repentance proceeded from her faith, she heard her justification by faith through her repentance pronounced in the words, \"Thy faith hath saved thee,\" by Him who had declared by Habakkuk, \"The just shall live by his faith.\"[fn-59-P5990_1802816:701-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"29. Unless Christ had considered this Sabbath-which in your want of knowledge and of piety you laugh at-one of the prophecies written of Himself, He would not have borne such a testimony to it as He did. For when, as you say in praise of Christ, He suffered voluntarily, and so could choose His own time for suffering and for resurrection, He brought it about that His body rested from all its works on Sabbath in the tomb, and that His resurrection on the third day. which we call the Lord's day, the day after the Sabbath, and therefore the eighth, proved the circumcision of the eighth day to be also prophetical of Him. For what does circumcision mean, but the eradication of the mortality which comes from our carnal generation? So the apostle says: \"Putting off from Himself His flesh, He made a show of principalities and powers, triumphing over them in Himself.\"[fn-17-P1736_979119:52-nf] The flesh here said to be put off is that mortality of flesh on account of which the body is properly called flesh. The flesh is the mortality, for in the immortality of the resurrection there will be no flesh; as it is written, \"Flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\" You are accustomed to argue from these words against our faith in the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, which has already taken place in the Lord Himself. You keep out of view the following words, in which the apostle explains his meaning. To show what he here means by flesh, he adds, \"Neither shall corruption inherit incorruption.\" For this body, which from its mortality is properly called flesh, is changed in the resurrection, so as to be no longer corruptible and mortal. This is the apostle's statement, and not a supposition of ours, as his next words prove. \"Lo\" he says, \"I show you a mystery: we shall all use again, but we shall not all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the last trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-17-P1737_980339:53-nf] To put on immortality, the body puts off mortality. This is the mystery of circumcision, which by the law took place on the eighth day; and on the eighth day, the Lord's day, the day after the Sabbath, was fulfilled in its true meaning by the Lord. Hence it is said, \"Putting off His flesh, He made a show of principalities and powers.\" For by means of this mortality the hostile powers of hell ruled over us. Christ is said to have made a show or example of these, because in Himself, our Head, He gave an example which will be fully realized in the liberation of His whole body, the Church, from the power of the devil at the last resurrection. This is our faith. And according to the prophetic declaration quoted by Paul, \"The just shall live by faith.\" This is our justification.[fn-17-P1738_981146:54-nf] Even Pagans believe that Christ died. But only Christians believe that Christ rose again. \"If thou confess with thy mouth,\" says the apostle, \"that Jesus is the Lord, and believest in thy heart that God raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\"[fn-17-P1739_981431:55-nf] Again, because we are justified by faith in Christ's resurrection, the apostle says, \"He died for our offenses, and rose again for our justification.\"[fn-17-P1740_981598:56-nf] And because this resurrection by faith in which we are justified was prefigured by the circumcision of the eighth day, the apostle says of Abraham, with whom the observance began, \"He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of faith.\"[fn-17-P1741_981874:57-nf] Circumcision, then, is one of the prophecies of Christ, written by Moses, of whom Christ said, \"He wrote of me.\" In the words of the Lord, \"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves,\"[fn-17-P1742_982214:58-nf] it is not the circumcision of the proselyte which is meant, but his imitation of the conduct of the scribes and Pharisees, which the Lord forbids His disciples to imitate, when He says: \"The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat: what they say unto you, do; but do not after their works; for they say, and do not.\"[fn-17-P1743_982554:59-nf] These words of the Lord teach us both the honor due to the teaching of Moses, in whose seat even bad men were obliged to teach good things, and the reason of the proselyte becoming a child of hell, which was not that he heard from the Pharisees the words of the law, but that he copied their example. Such a circumcised proselyte might have been addressed in the words of Paul: \"Circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law.\"[fn-17-P1744_983011:60-nf] His imitation of the Pharisees in not keeping the law made him a child of hell.

For the Faith there confessed by the Fathers according to the divine Scriptures is enough by itself at once to overthrow all impiety, and to establish the religious belief in Christ. For this reason at the present time, at the assembling of diverse synods, both in Gaul and Spain, and great Rome[fn-100-P10027_3585617:2-nf] , all who came together, as though moved by one spirit, unanimously anathematised those who still were secretly holding with Arius, namely Auxentius of Milan, Ursacius, Valens, and Gaius of Pannonia.

The object, therefore, of the faith whereby the just man shall live, will be that same God to whom likewise belongs the law, by doing which no man is justified. Since, then, there equally are found the curse in the law and the blessing in faith, you have both conditions set forth by[fn-72-P7263_2100163:114-nf] the Creator: \"Behold,\" says He, \"I have set before you a blessing and a curse.\"[fn-72-P7264_2100256:115-nf] You cannot establish a diversity of authors because there happens to be one of things; for the diversity is itself proposed by one and the same author. Why, however, \"Christ was made a curse for us,\"[fn-72-P7265_2100477:116-nf] is declared by the apostle himself in a way which quite helps our side, as being the result of the Creator's appointment. But yet it by no means follows, because the Creator said of old, \"Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,\"[fn-72-P7266_2100731:117-nf] that Christ belonged to another god, and on that account was accursed even then in the law. And how, indeed, could the Creator have cursed by anticipation one whom He knew not of? Why, however, may it not be more suitable for the Creator to have delivered His own Son to His own curse, than to have submitted Him to the malediction of that god of yours,-in behalf, too, of man, who is an alien to him? Now, if this appointment of the Creator respecting His Son appears to you to be a cruel one, it is equally so in the case of your own god; if, on the contrary, it be in accordance with reason in your god, it is equally so-nay, much more so-in mine. For it would be more credible that that God had provided blessing for man, through the curse of Christ, who formerly set both a blessing and a curse before man, than that he had done so, who, according to you,[fn-72-P7267_2101673:118-nf] never at any time pronounced either. \"We have received therefore, the promise of the Spirit,\" as the apostle says, \"through faith,\" even that faith by which the just man lives, in accordance with the Creator's purpose.[fn-72-P7268_2101908:119-nf] What I say, then, is this, that that God is the object of faith who prefigured the grace of faith. But when he also adds, \".For ye are all the children of faith,\"[fn-72-P7269_2102148:120-nf] it becomes dear that what the heretic's industry erased was the mention of Abraham's name; for by faith the apostle declares us to be \"children of Abraham,\"[fn-72-P7270_2102326:121-nf] and after mentioning him he expressly called us \"children of faith\" also. But how are we children of faith? and of whose faith, if not Abraham's? For since \"Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness; \"[fn-72-P7271_2102581:122-nf] since, also, he deserved for that reason to be called \"the father of many nations,\" whilst we, who are even more like him[fn-72-P7272_2102723:123-nf] in believing in God, are thereby justified as Abraham was, and thereby also obtain life-since the just lives by his faith,-it therefore happens that, as he in the previous passage called us \"sons of Abraham,\" since he is in faith our (common) father,[fn-72-P7273_2103072:124-nf] so here also he named us \"children of faith,\" for it was owing to his faith that it was promised that Abraham should be the father of (many) nations. As to the fact itself of his calling off faith from circumcision, did he not seek thereby to constitute us the children of Abraham, who had believed previous to his circumcision in the flesh?[fn-72-P7274_2103435:125-nf] In short,[fn-72-P7275_2103475:126-nf] faith in one of two gods cannot possibly admit us to the dispensation[fn-72-P7276_2103561:127-nf] of the other,[fn-72-P7277_2103615:128-nf] so that it should impute righteousness to those who believe in him, and make the just live through him, and declare the Gentiles to be his children through faith. Such a dispensation as this belongs wholly to Him through whose appointment it was already made known by the call of this self-same Abraham, as is conclusively shown[fn-72-P7278_2103978:129-nf] ' by the natural meaning.[fn-72-P7279_2104023:130-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For he remembered that the time was come of which the Psalm spake, \"Let us break their bands asunder, and cast off their yoke from us; \"[fn-72-P7259_2099301:110-nf] since the time when \"the nations became tumultuous, and the people imagined vain counsels; \"when \"the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ,\"[fn-72-P7260_2099531:111-nf] in order that thenceforward man might be justified by the liberty of faith, not by servitude to the law,[fn-72-P7261_2099657:112-nf] \"because the just shall live by his faith.\"[fn-72-P7262_2099733:113-nf] Now, although the prophet Habakkuk first said this, yet you have the apostle here confirming the prophets, even as Christ did. The object, therefore, of the faith whereby the just man shall live, will be that same God to whom likewise belongs the law, by doing which no man is justified. Since, then, there equally are found the curse in the law and the blessing in faith, you have both conditions set forth by[fn-72-P7263_2100163:114-nf] the Creator: \"Behold,\" says He, \"I have set before you a blessing and a curse.\"[fn-72-P7264_2100256:115-nf] You cannot establish a diversity of authors because there happens to be one of things; for the diversity is itself proposed by one and the same author. Why, however, \"Christ was made a curse for us,\"[fn-72-P7265_2100477:116-nf] is declared by the apostle himself in a way which quite helps our side, as being the result of the Creator's appointment. But yet it by no means follows, because the Creator said of old, \"Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,\"[fn-72-P7266_2100731:117-nf] that Christ belonged to another god, and on that account was accursed even then in the law. And how, indeed, could the Creator have cursed by anticipation one whom He knew not of? Why, however, may it not be more suitable for the Creator to have delivered His own Son to His own curse, than to have submitted Him to the malediction of that god of yours,-in behalf, too, of man, who is an alien to him? Now, if this appointment of the Creator respecting His Son appears to you to be a cruel one, it is equally so in the case of your own god; if, on the contrary, it be in accordance with reason in your god, it is equally so-nay, much more so-in mine. For it would be more credible that that God had provided blessing for man, through the curse of Christ, who formerly set both a blessing and a curse before man, than that he had done so, who, according to you,[fn-72-P7267_2101673:118-nf] never at any time pronounced either. \"We have received therefore, the promise of the Spirit,\" as the apostle says, \"through faith,\" even that faith by which the just man lives, in accordance with the Creator's purpose.[fn-72-P7268_2101908:119-nf] What I say, then, is this, that that God is the object of faith who prefigured the grace of faith. But when he also adds, \".For ye are all the children of faith,\"[fn-72-P7269_2102148:120-nf] it becomes dear that what the heretic's industry erased was the mention of Abraham's name; for by faith the apostle declares us to be \"children of Abraham,\"[fn-72-P7270_2102326:121-nf] and after mentioning him he expressly called us \"children of faith\" also. But how are we children of faith? and of whose faith, if not Abraham's? For since \"Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness; \"[fn-72-P7271_2102581:122-nf] since, also, he deserved for that reason to be called \"the father of many nations,\" whilst we, who are even more like him[fn-72-P7272_2102723:123-nf] in believing in God, are thereby justified as Abraham was, and thereby also obtain life-since the just lives by his faith,-it therefore happens that, as he in the previous passage called us \"sons of Abraham,\" since he is in faith our (common) father,[fn-72-P7273_2103072:124-nf] so here also he named us \"children of faith,\" for it was owing to his faith that it was promised that Abraham should be the father of (many) nations.

Therefore the prophet brought the virgin from Nazareth, in order that she might give birth at Bethlehem to her salvation-bestowing child, and brought her back again to Nazareth, in order to make manifest to the world the hope of life. Hence it was that the ark of God removed from the inn at Bethlehem, for there He paid to the law that debt of the forty days, due not to justice but to grace, and rested upon the mountains of Sion, and receiving into His pure bosom as upon a lofty throne, and one transcending the nature of man, the Monarch of all,[fn-60-P6038_1846492:29-nf] she presented Him there to God the Father, as the joint-partner of His throne and inseparable from His nature, together with that pure and undefiled flesh which he had of her substance assumed. The holy mother goes up to the temple to exhibit to the law a new and strange wonder, even that child long expected, who opened the virgin's womb, and yet did not burst the barriers of virginity; that child, superior to the law, who yet fulfilled the law; that child that was at once before the law, and yet after it; that child, in short, who was of her incarnate beyond the law of nature.[fn-60-P6039_1847099:30-nf] For in other cases every womb being first opened by connection with a man, and, being impregnated by his seed, receives the beginning of conception, and by the pangs which make perfect parturition, doth at length bring forth to light its offspring endowed with reason, and with its nature consistent, in accordance with the wise provision of God its Creator. For God said, \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.\" But the womb of this virgin, without being opened before, or being impregnated with seed, gave birth to an offspring that transcended nature, while at the same time it was cognate to it, and that without detriment to the indivisible unity, so that the miracle was the more stupendous, the prerogative of virginity likewise remaining intact. She goes up, therefore to the temple, she who was more exalted than the temple, clothed with a double glory-the glory, I say, of undefiled virginity, and that of ineffable fecundity, the benediction of the law, and the sanctification of grace. Wherefore he says who saw it: \"And the whole house was full of His glory, and the seraphim stood round about him; and one cried unto another, and said. Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of His glory.\"[fn-60-P6040_1848447:31-nf] As also the blessed prophet Habakkuk has charmingly sung, saying, \"In the midst of two living creatures thou shalt be known: as the years draw nigh thou shalt be recognised-when the time is come thou shalt be shown forth.\"[fn-60-P6041_1848688:32-nf] See, I pray you, the exceeding accuracy of the Spirit. He speaks of knowledge, recognition, showing forth. As to the first of these: \"In the midst of two living creatures thou shalt be known,\"[fn-60-P6042_1848956:33-nf] he refers to that overshadowing of the divine glory which, in the time of the law, rested in the Holy of holies upon the covering of the ark, between the typical cherubim, as He says to Moses, \"There will I be known to thee.\"[fn-60-P6043_1849200:34-nf] But He refers likewise to that concourse of angels, which hath now come to meet us, by the divine and ever adorable manifestation of the Saviour Himself in the flesh, although He in His very nature cannot be beheld by us, as Isaiah has even before declared. But when He says, \"As the years draw nigh, thou shalt be recognised,\" He means, as has been said before, that glorious recognition of our Saviour, God in the flesh, who is otherwise invisible to mortal eye; as somewhere Paul, that great interpreter of sacred mysteries, says: \"But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.\"[fn-60-P6044_1849944:35-nf] And then, as to that which is subjoined, \"When the time is come, Thou shalt be shown forth,\" what exposition doth this require, if a man diligently direct the eye of his mind to the festival which we are now celebrating? \"For then shalt Thou be shown forth,\" He says, \"as upon a kingly charger, by Thy pure and chaste mother, in the temple, and that in the grace and beauty of the flesh assumed by Thee.\" All these things the prophet, summing up for the sake of greater clearness, exclaims in brief: \"The Lord is in His holy temple; \"[fn-60-P6045_1850499:36-nf] \"Fear before Him all the earth.\"[fn-60-P6046_1850550:37-nf] ","title":"Oration Concerning Simeon and Anna","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_36_book_i_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"It is not, therefore, true, as some affirm that we say, and as that correspondent of yours ventures moreover to write, that \"all are forced into sin,\" as if they were unwilling, \"by the necessity of their flesh;\" but if they are already of the age to use the choice of their own mind, they are both retained in sin by their own will, and by their own will are hurried along from sin to sin. For even he who persuades and deceives does not act in them, except that they may commit sin by their will, either by ignorance of the truth or by delight in iniquity, or by both evils, -as well of blindness as of weakness.

Yet again He speaks of this[fn-33-P3332_565845:164-nf] in Moses, when Israel was attacked by strangers. And that He might remind them, when assailed, that it was on account of their sins they were delivered to death, the Spirit speaks to the heart of Moses, that he should make a figure of the cross,[fn-33-P3333_566137:165-nf] and of Him about to suffer thereon; for unless they put their trust in Him, they shall be overcome for ever. Moses therefore placed one weapon above another in the midst of the hill,[fn-33-P3334_566350:166-nf] and standing upon it, so as to be higher than all the people, he stretched forth his hands,[fn-33-P3335_566735:167-nf] and thus again Israel acquired the mastery. But when again he let down his hands, they were again destroyed. For what reason? That they might know that they could not be saved unless they put their trust in Him.[fn-33-P3336_566992:168-nf] And in another prophet He declares, \"All day long I have stretched forth My hands to an unbelieving people, and one that gainsays My righteous way.\"[fn-33-P3337_567182:169-nf] And again Moses makes a type of Jesus, [signifying] that it was necessary for Him to suffer, [and also] that He would be the author of life[fn-33-P3338_567342:170-nf] [to others], whom they believed to have destroyed on the cross[fn-33-P3339_567458:171-nf] when Israel was failing. For since transgression was committed by Eve through means of the serpent, [the Lord] brought it to pass that every [kind of] serpents bit them, and they died,[fn-33-P3340_567673:172-nf] that He might convince them, that on account of their transgression they were given over to the straits of death. Moreover Moses, when he commanded, \"Ye shall not have any graven or molten [image] for your God,\"[fn-33-P3341_567929:173-nf] did so that he might reveal a type of Jesus. Moses then makes a brazen serpent, and places it upon a beam,[fn-33-P3342_568097:174-nf] and by proclamation assembles the people. When, therefore, they were come together, they besought Moses that he would offer sacrifice[fn-33-P3343_568356:175-nf] in their behalf, and pray for their recovery. And Moses spake unto them, saying, \"When any one of you is bitten, let him come to the serpent placed on the pole; and let him hope and believe, that even though dead, it is able to give him life, and immediately he shall be restored.\"[fn-33-P3344_568691:176-nf] And they did so. Thou hast in this also [an indication of] the glory of Jesus; for in Him and to Him are all things.[fn-33-P3345_568828:177-nf] What, again, says Moses to Jesus (Joshua) the son of Nave, when he gave him[fn-33-P3346_568929:178-nf] this name, as being a prophet, with this view only, that all the people might hear that the Father would reveal all things concerning His Son Jesus to the son[fn-33-P3347_569169:179-nf] of Nave? This name then being given him when he sent him to spy out the land, he said, \"Take a book into thy hands, and write what the Lord declares, that the Son of God will in the last days cut off from the roots all the house of Amalek.\"[fn-33-P3348_569505:180-nf] Behold again: Jesus who was manifested, both by type and in the flesh,[fn-33-P3349_569597:181-nf] is not the Son of man, but the Son of God. Since, therefore, they were to say that Christ was the son[fn-33-P3350_569728:182-nf] of David, fearing and understanding the error of the wicked, he saith, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-33-P3351_569965:183-nf] And again, thus saith Isaiah, \"The Lord said to Christ,[fn-33-P3352_570058:184-nf] my Lord, whose right hand I have holden,[fn-33-P3353_570145:185-nf] that the nations should yield obedience before Him; and I will break in pieces the strength of kings.\"[fn-33-P3354_570291:186-nf] Behold how David calleth Him Lord and the Son of God.","title":"The Epistle of Barnabas","author":"Barnabas"},{"chapter":2,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_42_book_ii","source_chapter":34,"source_paragraph":"213","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The divine law, then, not only forbids the worshipping of idols, but also of the heavenly bodies, the sun, the moon, or the other stars; yea, not heaven, nor earth, nor the sea, nor fountains, nor rivers, must be worshipped, but we must serve in holiness of heart and sincerity of purpose only the living and true God, who also is Maker of the universe. Wherefore saith the holy law: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt not desire thy neighbour's wife.\" So also the prophets.

Moreover, they were in sore travail, bewailing the godless race of men, and they reproached those, who seemed to be wise, for their error and hardness of heart. Jeremiah, indeed, said: \"Every man is brutishly gone astray from the knowledge of Him; every founder is confounded by his graven images; in vain the silversmith makes his molten images; there is no breath in them: in the day of their visitation they shall perish.\"[fn-17-P1756_510230:78-nf] The same, too, says David: \"They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; there is none that doeth good, no, not one; they have all gone aside, they have together become profitless.\"[fn-17-P1757_510440:79-nf] So also Habakkuk: \"What profiteth the graven image that he has graven it a lying image?

And another prophet also says, \"Except ye believe, neither shall ye understand.\"[fn-56-P5649_1707495:19-nf] For how ever could the soul admit the transcendental contemplation of such themes, while unbelief respecting what was to be learned struggled within? But faith, which the Greeks disparage, deeming it futile and barbarous, is a voluntary preconception[fn-56-P5650_1707764:20-nf] the assent of piety-\"the subject of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,\" according to the divine apostle. \"For hereby,\" pre-eminently, \"the elders obtained a good report. But without faith it is impossible to please God.\"[fn-56-P5651_1708034:21-nf] Others have defined faith to be a uniting assent to an unseen object, as certainly the proof of an unknown thing is an evident assent. If then it be choice, being desirous of something, the desire is in this instance intellectual. And since choice is the beginning of action, faith is discovered to be the beginning of action, being the foundation of rational choice in the case of any one who exhibits to himself the previous demonstration through faith. Voluntarily to follow what is useful, is the first principle of understanding. Unswerving choice, then, gives considerable momentum in the direction of knowledge. The exercise of faith directly becomes knowledge, reposing on a sure foundation. Knowledge, accordingly, is defined by the sons of the philosophers as a habit, which cannot be overthrown by reason. Is there any other true condition such as this, except piety, of which alone the Word is teacher?[fn-56-P5652_1708972:22-nf] I think not. Theophrastus says that sensation is the root of faith. For from it the rudimentary principles extend to the reason that is in us, and the understanding. He who believeth then the divine Scriptures with sure judgment, receives in the voice of God, who bestowed the Scripture, a demonstration that cannot be impugned. Faith, then, is not established by demonstration. \"Blessed therefore those who, not having seen, yet have believed.\"[fn-56-P5653_1709490:23-nf] The Siren's songs, exhibiting a power above human, fascinated those that came near, conciliating them, almost against their will, to the reception of what was said.","title":"Book II.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_62_book_iv_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"223","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2.

As if in the sight of God mere words, and not mainly the will was called in fault,and as if only the actual deed of sin, and not also the wish and purpose, was reckoned as wrong; or as if it would be asked in the judgment only what each one had done and not what he also purposed to do. For it is not only the character of the anger roused, but also the purpose of the man who provokes it which is bad, and therefore the true scrutiny of our judge will ask, not how the quarrel was stirred up but by whose fault it arose: for the purpose of the sin, and not the way in which the fault is committed must be taken into account. For what does it matter whether a man kills a brother with a sword by himself, or drives him to death by some fraud, when it is clear that he is killed by his wiles and crime? As if it were enough not to have pushed a blind man down with one's own hand, though he is equally guilty who scorned to save him, when it was in his power, when fallen and on the point of tumbling into the ditch: or as if he alone were guilty who had caught a man with the hand, and not also the one who had prepared and set the trap for him, or who would not set him free when he might have done so. So then it is of no good to hold one's tongue, if we impose silence upon ourselves for this reason that by our silence we may do what would have been done by an outcry on our part, simulating certain gestures by which he whom we ought to have cured, may be made still more angry, while we are commended for all this, to his loss and damage: as if a man were not for this very reason the more guilty, because he tried to get glory for himself out of his brother's fall. For such a silence will be equally bad for both because while it increases the vexation in the heart of another, so it prevents it from being removed from one's own: and against such persons the prophet's curse is with good reason directed: \"Woe to him that giveth drink to his friend, and presenteth his gall, and maketh him drunk, that he may behold his nakedness. He is filled with shame instead of glory.\"[fn-57-P5763_2049866:29-nf] And this too which is said of such people by another: \"For every brother will utterly supplant, and every friend will walk deceitfully. And a man shall mock his brother, and they will not speak the truth, for they have bent their tongue like a bow for lies and not for truth.\"[fn-57-P5764_2050165:30-nf] But often a feigned patience excites to anger more keenly than words, and, a spiteful silence exceeds the most awful insults in words, and the wounds of enemies are more easily borne than the deceitful blandishment of mockers, of which it is well said by the prophet: \"Their words are smoother than oil, and yet they are darts:\" and elsewhere the words of the crafty are soft: but they smite within the belly:\" to which this also may be finely applied: \"With the mouth he speaks peace to his friend, but secretly he layeth snares for him;\"with which however the deceiver is rather deceived, for \"if a man prepares a net before his friend, it surrounds his own feet;\" and: \"if a man digs a pit for his neighbour, he shall fall into it himself.\"[fn-57-P5765_2050929:31-nf] Lastly when a great multitude had come with swords and staves to take the Lord, none of the murderers of the author of our life stood forth as more cruel than he who advanced before them all with a counterfeit respect and salutation and offered a kiss of reigned love; to whom the Lord said: \"Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?\"[fn-57-P5766_2051350:32-nf] i.e., the bitter- ness of thy persecution and hatred has taken as a cloke this which expresses the sweetness of true love. More openly too and more energetically does He emphasize the force of this grief by the prophet, saying: \"For if mine enemy had cursed me, I would have borne it: and if he who hated me had spoken great things against me, I would have hid myself from him. But it was thou, a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar friend: who didst take sweet meats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent.\"[fn-57-P5767_2051912:33-nf] ","title":"XVI.

Therefore, the more have been your trials, look for a more perfect reward from your just Judgeú Do not take your present troubles ill. Do not lose hope. Yet a little while and your Helper will come to you and will not tarry.[fn-55-P5555_1751052:4-nf] ","title":"Letter CCXXXVIII.","author":"St. Basil"}]
