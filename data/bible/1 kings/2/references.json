This is the faithful house, this is the everlasting temple; and if any one hath not sacrificed in this, he will not have the reward of immortality. And since Christ was the builder of this great and eternal temple, He must also have an everlasting priesthood in it; and there can be no approach to the shrine of the temple, and to the sight of God, except through Him who built the temple. David in the cixth Psalm teaches the same, saying:[fn-13-P1329_572566:148-nf] \"Before the morning-star I begat Thee.

But I for my part see that the promises made to the saints are fulfilled even in this present life. Before he began to serve Christ with his whole heart, Pammachius was a well known person in the senate. Still there were many other senators who wore the badges of proconsular rank. The whole world is filled with similar decorations. He was in the first rank it is true, but there were others in it besides him. Whilst he took precedence of some, others took precedence of him. The most distinguished privilege loses its prestige when lavished on a crowd, and dignities themselves become less dignified in the eyes of good men when held by persons who have no dignity. Thus Tully finely says of Caesar, when he wished to advance some of his adherents, \"he did not so much honour them as dishonour the honourable positions in which he placed them.\"[fn-27-P2745_718784:1945-nf] To-day all the churches of Christ are talking of Pammachius. The whole world admires as a poor man one whom heretofore it ignored as rich. Can anything be more splendid than the consulate? Yet the honour lasts only for a year and when another has succeeded to the post its former occupant gives way. Each man's laurels are i lost in the crowd and sometimes triumphs themselves are marred by the shortcomings of those who celebrate them. An office which was once handed down from patrician to patrician, which only men of noble birth could hold, of which the consul Marius-victor though he was over Numidia and the Teutons and the Cimbri-was held unworthy on account of the obscurity of his family, and which Scipio won before his time as the reward of valour,-this great office is now obtained by merely belonging to the army; and the shining robe of victory[fn-27-P2746_719742:1946-nf] now envelops men who a little while ago were country boors. Thus we have received more than we have given. The things we have renounced are small; the things we possess are great.

We have learned what we ought to be: let us now learn what priests ought not to be Indulgence in wine is the fault of diners out and revellers. When the body is heated with drink it soon boils over with lust. Wine drinking means self-indulgence, self-indulgence means sensual gratification, sensual gratification means a breach of chastity. He that lives in pleasure is dead while he lives,[fn-29-P2942_776871:2111-nf] and he that drinks himself drunk is not only dead but buried. One hour's debauch makes Noah uncover his nakedness which through sixty years of sobriety he had kept covered.[fn-29-P2943_777070:2112-nf] Lot in a fit of intoxication unwittingly adds incest to incontinence, and wine overcomes the man whom Sodom failed to conquer.[fn-29-P2944_777232:2113-nf] A bishop that is a striker is condemned by Him who gave His back to the smiters,[fn-29-P2945_777339:2114-nf] and when He was reviled reviled not again.[fn-29-P2946_777402:2115-nf] \"But moderate\";[fn-29-P2947_777442:2116-nf] one good thing is set over against two evil things. Drunkenness and passion are to be held in check by moderation. \"Not a brawler, not covetous.\" Nothing is more overweening than the assurance of the ignorant who fancy that incessant chatter will carry conviction with it and are always ready for a dispute that they may thunder with turgid eloquence against the flock committed to their charge. That a priest must avoid covetousness even Samuel teaches when he proves before all the people that he has taken nothing from any man.[fn-29-P2948_778000:2117-nf] And the same lesson is taught by the poverty of the apostles who used to receive sustenance and refreshment from their brethren and to boast that they neither had nor wished to have anything besides food and raiment.[fn-29-P2949_778243:2118-nf] What the epistle to Timothy calls covetousness, that to Titus openly censures as the desire for filthy lucre.[fn-29-P2950_778380:2119-nf] \"One that ruleth well his own house.\" Not by increasing riches, not by providing regal banquets, not by having a pile of finely-wrought plates, not by slowly steaming pheasants so that the heat may reach the bones without melting the flesh upon them; no, but by first requiring of his own household the conduct which he has to inculcate in others. \"Having his children in subjection with all gravity.\" They must not, that is, follow the example of the sons of Eli who lay with the women in the vestibule of the Temple and, supposing religion to consist in plunder, diverted to the gratification of their own appetites all the best parts of the victims.[fn-29-P2951_779053:2120-nf] \"Not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.\" I cannot sufficiently express my amazement at the great blindness which makes men discuss such questions as that of marriage before baptism and causes them to charge people with a transaction which is dead in baptism, nay even quickened into a new life with Christ, while no one regards a commandment so clear and unmistakable as this about bishops not being novices. One who was yesterday a catechumen is to-day a bishop[fn-29-P2952_779608:2121-nf] ; one who was yesterday in the amphitheatre is to-day in the church; one who spent the evening in the circus stands in the morning at the altar: one who a little while ago was a patron of actors is now a dedicator of virgins. Was the apostle ignorant of our shifts and subterfuges? did he know nothing of our foolish arguments? He not only says that a bishop must be the husband of one wife, but he has given commandment that he must be blameless, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach, moderate,[fn-29-P2953_780168:2122-nf] not given to wine, no striker, not a brawler, not covetous, not a novice. Yet to all these requirements we shut our eyes and notice nothing but the wives of the aspirants. Who cannot give instances to shew the need of the warning: \"lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil?\" A priest[fn-29-P2954_780512:2123-nf] who is made such in a moment knows nothing of the lowliness and meekness which mark the meanest of the faithful, he knows nothing of Christian courtesy, he is not wise enough to think little of himself. He passes from one dignity to another, yet he has not fasted, he has not wept, he has not taken himself to task for his life, he has not striven by constant meditation to amend it, he has not given his substance to the poor. Yet he is moved from one see[fn-29-P2955_781016:2124-nf] to another, he passes, that is, from pride to pride. There can be no doubt that arrogance is what the Apostle means when he speaks of the condemnation and downfall of the devil. And all men fall into this who are in a moment made masters, actually before they are disciples. \"Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without.\" The last requirement is like the first. One who is really \"blameless\" obtains the unanimous approval not only of his own household but of outsiders as well. By aliens and persons outside the church we are to understand Jews, heretics and Gentiles. A Christian bishop then must be such that they who cavil at his religion may not venture to cavil at his life. At present however we see but too many bishops who are willing, like the charioteers in the horse races, to bid money for the popular applause; while there are some so universally hated that they can wring no money from their people, a feat which clowns accomplish by means of a few gestures.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1073","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"6.

No one administers drugs till be has rubbed the rim of the cup with honey;[fn-37-P3794_1021348:2690-nf] so, the better to deceive us, vice puts on the mien and the semblance of virtue.

But perhaps you imagine that, if they are not baptized, the children of Christians are liable for their own sins; and that no guilt attaches to parents who withhold from baptism those who by reason of their tender age can offer no objection to it. The truth is that, as baptism ensures the salvation of the child, this in turn brings advantage to the parents. Whether you would offer your child or not lay within your choice, but now that you have offered her, you neglect her at your peril. I speak generally for in your case you have no discretion, having offered your child even before her conception. He who offers a victim that is lame or maimed or marked with any blemish is held guilty of sacrilege.[fn-37-P3798_1022909:2694-nf] How much more then shall she be punished who makes ready for the embraces of the king a portion of her own body and the purity of a stainless soul, and then proves negligent of this her offering?","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1080","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"13. You will answer, `How shall I, a woman of the world, living at Rome, surrounded by a crowd, be able to observe all these injunctions?' In that case do not undertake a burthen to which you are not equal. When you have weaned Paula as Isaac was weaned and when you have clothed her as Samuel was clothed, send her to her grandmother and aunt; give up this most precious of gems, to be placed in Mary's chamber and to rest in the cradle where the infant Jesus cried. Let her be brought up in a monastery, let her be one amid companies of virgins, let her learn to avoid swearing, let her regard lying as sacrilege, let her be ignorant of the world, let her live the angelic life, while in the flesh let her be without the flesh, and let her suppose that all human beings are like herself. To say nothing of its other advantages this course will free you from the difficult task of minding her, and from the responsibility of guardianship. It is better to regret her absence than to be for ever trembling for her. For you cannot but tremble as you watch what she says and to whom she says it, to whom she bows and whom she likes best to see. Hand her over to Eustochium while she is still but an infant and her every cry is a prayer for you. She will thus become her companion in holiness now as well as her successor hereafter.

Yes, Laeta: were it possible for you with your own eyes to see your mother-in-law and your sister, and to realize the mighty souls which animate their small bodies; such is your innate thirst for chastity that I cannot doubt but that you would go to them even before your daughter, and would emancipate yourself from God's first decree of the Law[fn-38-P3834_1037037:2723-nf] to put yourself under His second dispensation of the Gospel.[fn-38-P3835_1037119:2724-nf] You would count as nothing your desire for other offspring and would offer up yourself to the service of God. But because \"there is a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing,\"[fn-38-P3836_1037333:2725-nf] and because \"the wife hath not power of her own body,\"[fn-38-P3837_1037411:2726-nf] and because the apostle says \"Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called\"[fn-38-P3838_1037528:2727-nf] in the Lord, and because he that is under the yoke ought so to run as not to leave his companion in the mire, I counsel you to pay back to the full in your offspring what meantime you defer paying in your own person. When Hannah had once offered in the tabernacle the son whom she had vowed to God she never took him back; for she thought it unbecoming that one who was to be a prophet should grow up in the same house with her who still desired to have other children. Accordingly after she had conceived him and given him birth, she did not venture to come to the temple alone or to appear before the Lord empty, but first paid to Him what she owed; and then, when she had offered up that great sacrifice, she returned home and because she had borne her firstborn for God, she was given five children for herself.[fn-38-P3839_1038369:2728-nf] Do you marvel at the happiness of that holy woman? Imitate her faith. Moreover, if you will only send Paula, I promise to be myself both a tutor and a foster father to her. Old as I am I will carry her on my shoulders and train her stammering lips; and my charge will be a far grander one than that of the worldly philosopher;[fn-38-P3840_1038720:2729-nf] for while he only taught a King of Macedon who was one day to die of Babylonian poison, I shall instruct the handmaid and spouse of Christ who must one day be offered to her Lord in heaven.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1553","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"10.

Next he brings forward Samson, and does not consider that the Lord's Nazarite was once shaven bald by a woman. And although Samson continues to be a type of the Saviour because he loved a harlot from among the Gentiles, which harlot corresponds to the Church, and because he slew more enemies in his death than he did in his life, yet he does not set an example of conjugal chastity. And he surely reminds us[fn-62-P6294_1925823:138-nf] of Jacob's prophecy-he was shaken by his runaway steed, bitten by an adder and fell backwards. But why he enumerated Deborah, and Barak, and the wife of Heber the Kenite, I am at a loss to understand. For it is one thing to draw up a list of military commanders in historical sequence, another to indicate certain figures of marriage which cannot be found in them. And whereas he prefers the fidelity of the father Jephthah to the tears of the virgin daughter, that makes for us. For we are not commending virgins of the world so much as those who are virgins for Christ's sake, and most Hebrews blame the father for the rash vow he made,[fn-62-P6295_1926516:139-nf] \"If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into mine hand, then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be for the Lord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.\" Supposing (they say) a dog or an ass had met him, what would he have done? Their meaning is that God so ordered events that he who had improvidently made a vow, should learn his error by the death of his daughter. And if Samuel who was brought up in the tabernacle married a wife, how does that prejudice virginity? As if at the present day also there were not many married priests, and as though the Apostle did not[fn-62-P6296_1927244:140-nf] describe a bishop as the husband of one wife, having children with all purity. At the same time we must not forget that Samuel was a Levite, not a priest or high-priest. Hence it was that his mother made for him a linen ephod, that is, a linen garment to go over the shoulders, which was the proper dress of the Levites and of the inferior order. And so he is not named in the Psalms among the priests, but among those who call upon the name of the Lord:[fn-62-P6297_1927721:141-nf] \"Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call upon his name.\" For[fn-62-P6298_1927829:142-nf] Levi begat Kohath, Kohath begat Amminadab, Amminadab begat Korah, Korah begat Assir, Assir begat Elkanah, Elkanah begat Zuph, Zuph begat Tahath, Tahath begat Eliel, Eliel begat Jeroham, Jeroham begat Elkanah, Elkanah begat Samuel. And no one doubts that the priests sprang from the stock of Aaron, Eleazar, and Phinees. And seeing that they had wives, they would be rightly brought against us, if, led away by the error of the Encratites, we were to maintain that marriage deserved censure, and our high priest were not after the order of Melchizedek, without father, without mother,[fn-62-P6299_1928444:143-nf] Agenealo/ghtoj, that is, unmarried.

Reversing the order, we have given our answer respecting the state of souls and the resurrection of the flesh; and, leaving out the opening portions of the letter, we have confined ourselves to the refutation of this most remarkable treatise.

John writes to Bishop Theophilus an apology, of which the introduction runs thus: \"You, indeed, as a man of God, adorned with apostolic grace, have upon you the care of all the Churches, especially of that which is at Jerusalem, though you yourself are distracted with countless anxieties for the Church of God, which is under you.\" This is barefaced adulation, and an attempt to concentrate[fn-71-P7164_2365738:127-nf] authority in the hands of an individual. You, who ask for ecclesiastical rules, and make use of the[fn-71-P7165_2366013:128-nf] canons of the Council of Nicaea, and claim authority over clerics who belong to another diocese and are[fn-71-P7166_2366662:129-nf] actually living with their own bishop, answer my question, What has Palestine to do with the bishop of Alexandria? Unless I am deceived, it is decreed in those canons that Caesarea is the metropolis of Palestine, and Antioch of the whole of the East. You ought therefore either to appeal to the bishop of Caesarea, with whom you know that we have communion while we disdain to communicate with you, or, if judgment were to be sought at a distance, letters ought rather to be addressed to Antioch. But I know why you were unwilling to send to Caesarea, or to Antioch. You knew what to flee from, what to avoid. You preferred to assail with your complaints ears that were preoccupied rather than pay due honour to your metropolitan. And I do not say this because I have anything to blame in the mission itself, except certain partialities which beget suspicion, but because you ought rather to clear yourself in the actual presence of your questioners. You begin with the words, \"You have sent a most devoted servant of God, the presbyter Isidore, a man of influence no less from the dignity of his very gait and dress than from that of his divine understanding, to heal those whose souls are grievously sick; would that they had any sense of their illness! A man of God sends a man of God.\" No difference is made between a priest and a bishop; the same dignity belongs to the sender and the sent; this is lame enough; the ship, as the saying goes, is wrecked in harbour. That Isidore, whom you extol to the sky by your praises, lies under the same imputation of heresy[fn-71-P7167_2368338:130-nf] at Alexandria as you at Jerusalem; wherefore he appears to have come to you not as an envoy, but as a confederate. Besides, the letters in his own handwriting, which, three months before the sending of the embassy, had been sent to us[fn-71-P7168_2368861:131-nf] through an error in the address, were delivered to the presbyter Vincentius, and to this day they are in his keeping. In these letters the writer encourages the leader of his army[fn-71-P7169_2369130:132-nf] to plant his foot firmly upon the rock of the faith, and not to be terrified by our Jeremiads. He promises, before we had any suspicion of his mission, that he will come to Jerusalem, and that on his arrival the ranks of his adversaries will be instantly crushed. And amongst the rest he uses these words: \"As smoke vanishes in the air, and wax melts beside the fire, so shall they be scattered who are for ever resisting the faith of the Church, and are now through simple men endeavouring to disturb that faith.\"","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_14_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Well, what do we say to this? The divine Scripture knows how to use the word \"Son\" in both senses, so that in some cases such an appellation is derived from nature, in others it is adventitious and artificial. For when it speaks of \"sons of men,\" or \"sons of rams[fn-14-P1417_775424:79-nf] ,\" it marks the essential relation of that which is begotten to that from which it has its being: but when it speaks of \"sons of power,\" or \"children of God,\" it presents to us that kinship which is the result of choice.

For when they are called \"sons of Eli,\" they are declared to have natural relationship to him, but in being called \"sons of Belial,\" they are reproved for the wickedness of their choice, as no longer emulating their father in their life, but addicting their own purpose to sin. In the case, then, of this lower nature of ours, and of the things with which we are concerned, by reason of human nature being equally inclined to either side (I mean, to vice and to virtue), it is in our power to become sons either of night or of day, while our nature yet remains, so far as the chief part of it is concerned, within its proper limits. For neither is he 'who by sin becomes a child of wrath alienated from his human generation, nor does he who by choice addicts himself to good reject his human origin by the refinement of his habits, but, while their nature in each case remains the same, the differences of their purpose assume the names of their relationship, according as they become either children of God by virtue, or of the opposite by vice.","title":"Book III","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_15_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"22. God certainly wishes bishops or priests to be such as the chosen vessel teaches they should be. As to the first qualification it is seldom or never that one is found without reproach; for who is it that has not some fault, like a mole or a wart on a lovely body? If the Apostle himself says of Peter that he did not tread a straight path in the truth of the Gospel, and was so far to blame that even Barnabas was led away into the same dissimulation, who will be indignant if that is denied to him which the chief of the Apostles had not? Then, supposing you find one, \"the husband of one wife, sober-minded, orderly, given to hospitality,\" the next attribute-didaktikon, apt to teach, not merely as the Latin renders the word, apt to be taught-you will hardly find in company with the other virtues. A bishop or priest that is a brawler, or a striker, or a lover of money, the Apostle rejects, and in his stead would have one gentle, not contentious, free from avarice, one that rules well his own house, and what is very hard, one who has his children in subjection with all modesty, whether they be children of the flesh or children of the faith. \"With all modesty,\" he says. It is not enough for him to have his own modesty unless it be enhanced by the modesty of his children, companions, and servants, as David says,[fn-73-P7394_2451273:67-nf] \"He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me.\" Let us consider, also, the emphasis laid on modesty by the addition of the words \"having his children in subjection with all modesty.\" Not only in deed but in word and gesture must he hold aloof from immodesty, lest perchance the experience of Eli be his. Eli certainly rebuked his sons, saying,[fn-73-P7395_2451648:68-nf] \"Nay, my sons, nay; it is not a good report which I hear of you.\" He chided them, and yet was punished, because he should not have chided, but cast them off. What will he do who rejoices at vice or lacks the courage to correct it? Who fears his own conscience, and therefore pretends to be ignorant of what is in everybody's mouth? The next point is that the bishop must be free from accusation, that he have a good report from them who are without, that no reproaches of opponents be levelled at him, and that they who dislike his doctrine may be pleased with his life. I suppose it would not be easy to find all this, and particularly one \"able to resist the gain-sayers,\" to check and overcome erroneous opinions. He wishes no novice to be ordained bishop, and yet in our time we see the youthful novice sought after as though he represented the highest righteousness. If baptism immediately made a man righteous, and full of all righteousness, it was of course idle for the Apostle to repel a novice; but baptism annuls old sins, does not bestow new virtues; it looses from prison, and promises rewards to the released if he will work. Seldom or never, I say, is there a man who has all the virtues which a bishop should have. And yet if a bishop lacked one or two of the virtues in the list, it does not follow that he can no longer be called righteous, nor will he be condemned for his deficiencies, but will be crowned for what he has. For to have all and lack nothing is the virtue of Him[fn-73-P7396_2453165:69-nf] \"Who did no sin; neither was guile found in His mouth; Who, when He was reviled, reviled not again;\" Who, confident in the consciousness of virtue, said,[fn-73-P7397_2453339:70-nf] \"Behold the prince of this world cometh, and findeth nothing in me;\"[fn-73-P7398_2453430:71-nf] \"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be on an equality with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.

The Lord shall make His adversary weak: the Lord is holy. Let not the prudent glory in his prudence and let not the mighty glory in his might; and let not the rich glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, to understand and know the Lord, and to do judgment and justice in the midst of the earth.

From usury and injustice shall He redeem their souls, and in His sight shall their name be honoured.\"[fn-57-P5741_1746542:464-nf] Again: \"The wicked shall be turned into hell, even all the nations that forget God; because the needy shall not alway be forgotten; the endurance of the poor shall not perish for ever.\"[fn-57-P5742_1746758:465-nf] Again: \"Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high, and yet looketh on the humble things that are in heaven and on earth!-who raiseth up the needy from off the ground, and out of the dunghill exalteth the poor; that He may set him with the princes of His people,\"[fn-57-P5743_1747058:466-nf] that is, in His own kingdom. And likewise earlier, in the book of Kings,[fn-57-P5744_1747154:467-nf] Hannah the mother of Samuel gives glory to God in these words: \"He raiseth the poor man from the ground, and the beggar, that He may set him amongst the princes of His people (that is, in His own kingdom), and on thrones of glory\" (even royal ones).[fn-57-P5745_1747472:468-nf] And by Isaiah how He inveighs against the oppressors of the needy \"What mean ye that ye set fire to my vineyard, and that the spoil of the poor is in your houses? Wherefore do ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the face of the needy? \"[fn-57-P5746_1747733:469-nf] And again: \"Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees; for in their decrees they decree wickedness, turning aside the needy from judgment, and taking away their rights from the poor of my people.\"[fn-57-P5747_1747959:470-nf] These righteous judgments He requires for the fatherless also, and the widows, as well as for consolation[fn-57-P5748_1748086:471-nf] to the very needy themselves. \"Do justice to the fatherless, and deal justly with the widow; and come, let us be reconciled,[fn-57-P5749_1748227:472-nf] saith the Lord.\"[fn-57-P5750_1748356:473-nf] To him, for whom in every stage of lowliness there is provided so much of the Creator's compassionate regard, shall be given that kingdom also which is promised by Christ, to whose merciful compassion belong, and for a great while have belonged,[fn-57-P5751_1748625:474-nf] those to whom the promise is made. For even if you suppose that the promises of the Creator were earthly, but that Christ's are heavenly, it is quite clear that heaven has been as yet the property of no other God whatever, than Him who owns the earth also; quite clear that the Creator has given even the lesser promises (of earthly blessing), in order that I may more readily believe Him concerning His greater promises (of heavenly blessings) also, than (Marcion's god), who has never given proof of his liberality by any preceding bestowal of minor blessings. \"Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-57-P5752_1749273:475-nf] I might connect this clause with the former one, because none but the poor and needy suffer hunger, if the Creator had not specially designed that the promise of a similar blessing should serve as a preparation for the gospel, that so men might know it to be His.[fn-57-P5753_1749557:476-nf] For thus does He say, by Isaiah, concerning those whom He was about to call from the ends of the earth-that is, the Gentiles: \"Behold, they shall come swiftly with speed: \"[fn-57-P5754_1749779:477-nf] swiftly, because hastening towards the fulness of the times; with speed, because unclogged by the weights of the ancient law. They shall neither hunger nor thirst. Therefore they shall be filled,-a promise which is made to none but those who hunger and thirst. And again He says: \"Behold, my servants shall be filled, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty.\"[fn-57-P5755_1750199:478-nf] As for these oppositions, we shall see whether they are not premonitors of Christ.[fn-57-P5756_1750303:479-nf] Meanwhile the promise of fulness to the hungry is a provision of God the Creator. \"Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.\"[fn-57-P5757_1750473:480-nf] Turn again to the passage of Isaiah: \"Behold, my servants shall exult with joy, but ye shall be ashamed; behold, my servants shall be glad, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart.\"[fn-57-P5758_1750672:481-nf] And recognise these oppositions also in the dispensation of Christ. Surely gladness and joyous exultation is promised to those who are in an opposite condition-to the sorrowful, and sad, and anxious. Just as it is said in the 125th Psalm: \"They who sow in tears shall reap in joy.\"[fn-57-P5759_1750979:482-nf] Moreover, laughter is as much an accessory to the exulting and glad, as weeping is to the sorrowful and grieving. Therefore the Creator, in foretelling matters for laughter and tears, was the first who said that those who mourned should laugh. Accordingly, He who began (His course) with consolation for the poor, and the humble, and the hungry, and the weeping, was at once eager[fn-57-P5760_1751437:483-nf] to represent Himself as Him whom He had pointed out by the mouth of Isaiah: \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the poor.\"[fn-57-P5761_1751633:484-nf] \"Blessed are the needy, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-57-P5762_1751719:485-nf] \"He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted.\"[fn-57-P5763_1751788:486-nf] \"Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-57-P5764_1751866:487-nf] \"To comfort all that mourn.\"[fn-57-P5765_1751915:488-nf] \"Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.\"[fn-57-P5766_1751987:489-nf] \"To give unto them that mourn in Sion, beauty (or glory) for ashes, and the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.\"[fn-57-P5767_1752164:490-nf] Now since Christ, as soon as He entered on His course,[fn-57-P5768_1752239:491-nf] fulfilled such a ministration as this, He is either, Himself, He who predicted His own coming to do all this; or else if he is not yet come who predicted this, the charge to Marcion's Christ must be a ridiculous one (although I should perhaps add a necessary[fn-57-P5769_1752522:492-nf] one), which bade him say, \"Blessed shall ye be, when men shall bate you, and shall reproach you, and shall cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.\"[fn-57-P5770_1752754:493-nf] In this declaration there is, no doubt, an exhortation to patience. Well, what did the Creator say otherwise by Isaiah? \"Fear ye not the reproach of men, nor be diminished by their contempt.\"[fn-57-P5771_1752966:494-nf] What reproach? what contempt? That which was to be incurred for the sake of the Son of man. What Son of man? He who (is come) according to the Creator's will. Whence shall we get our proof? From the very cutting off, which was predicted against Him; as when He says by Isaiah to the Jews, who were the instigators of hatred against Him: \"Because of you, my name is blasphemed amongst the Gentiles; \"[fn-57-P5772_1753400:495-nf] and in another passage: \"Lay the penalty on[fn-57-P5773_1753464:496-nf] Him who surrenders[fn-57-P5774_1753499:497-nf] His own life, who is held in contempt by the Gentiles, whether servants or magistrates.\"[fn-57-P5775_1753610:498-nf] Now, since hatred was predicted against that Son of man who has His mission from the Creator, whilst the Gospel testifies that the name of Christians, as derived from Christ, was to be hated for the Son of man's sake, because He is Christ, it determines the point that that was the Son of man in the matter of hatred who came according to the Creator's purpose, and against whom the hatred was predicted. And even if He had not yet come, the hatred of His name which exists at the present day could not in any case have possibly preceded Him who was to bear the name.[fn-57-P5776_1754316:499-nf] But He has both suffered the penalty[fn-57-P5777_1754378:500-nf] in out presence, and surrendered His life, laying it down for our sakes, and is held in contempt by the Gentiles. And He who was born (into the world) will be that very Son of man on whose account our name also is rejected.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Justly, therefore, was the hypocrisy of the Pharisees displeasing to Him, loving God as they did with their lips, but not with their heart. \"Beware,\" He says to the disciples, \"of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy,\" not the proclamation of the Creator. The Son hates those who refused obedience[fn-64-P6458_1904078:1138-nf] to the Father; nor does He wish His disciples to show such a disposition towards Him-not (let it be observed) towards another god, against whom such hypocrisy indeed might have been admissible, as that which He wished to guard His disciples against. It is the example of the Pharisees which He forbids. It was in respect of Him against whom the Pharisees were sinning that (Christ) now forbade His disciples to offend. Since, then, He had censured their hypocrisy, which covered the secrets of the heart, and obscured with superficial offices the mysteries of unbelief, because (while holding the key of knowledge) it would neither enter in itself, nor permit others to enter in, He therefore adds, \"There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall not be known,\"[fn-64-P6459_1904892:1139-nf] in order that no one should suppose that He was attempting the revelation and the recognition of an hitherto unknown and hidden god. When He remarks also on their murmurs and taunts, in saying of Him, \"This man casteth out devils only through Beelzebub,\" He means that all these imputations would come forth to the light of day, and be in the mouths of men in consequence of the promulgation of the Gospel. He then turns to His disciples with these words, \"I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them which can only kill the body, and after that have no more power over you.\"[fn-64-P6460_1905496:1140-nf] They will, however, find Isaiah had already said, \"See how the just man is taken away, and no man layeth it to heart.\"[fn-64-P6461_1905637:1141-nf] \"But I will show you whom ye shall fear: fear Him who, after He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell\" (meaning, of course, the Creator); \"yea, I say unto you, fear Him.\"[fn-64-P6462_1905836:1142-nf] Now, it would here be enough for my purpose that He forbids offence being given to Him whom He orders to be feared; and that He orders Him to be respected[fn-64-P6463_1906013:1143-nf] whom He forbids to be offended; and that He who gives these commands belongs to that very God for whom He procures this fear, this absence of offence, and this respect. But this conclusion I can draw also from the following words: \"For I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before God.\"[fn-64-P6464_1906360:1144-nf] Now they who shall confess Christ will have to be slain[fn-64-P6465_1906438:1145-nf] before men, but they will have nothing more to suffer after they have been put to death by them. These therefore will be they whom He forewarns above not to be afraid of being only killed; and this forewarning He offers, in order that He might subjoin a clause on the necessity of confessing Him: \"Every one that denieth me before men shall be denied before God\"[fn-64-P6466_1906827:1146-nf] -by Him, of course, who would have confessed him, if he had only confessed God. Now, He who will confess the confessor is the very same God who will also deny the denier of Himself. Again, if it is the confessor who will have nothing to fear after his violent death,[fn-64-P6467_1907116:1147-nf] it is the denier to whom everything will become fearful after his natural death. Since, therefore, that which will have to be feared after death, even the punishment of hell, belongs to the Creator, the denier, too, belongs to the Creator. As with the denier, however, so with the confessor: if he should deny God, he will plainly have to suffer from God, although from men he had nothing more to suffer after they had put him to death. And so Christ is the Creator's, because He shows that all those who deny Him ought to fear the Creator's hell. After deterring His disciples from denial of Himself, He adds an admonition to fear blasphemy: \"Whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him.\"[fn-64-P6468_1907939:1148-nf] Now, if both the remission and the retention of sin savour of a judicial God, the Holy Ghost, who is not to be blasphemed, will belong to Him, who will not forgive the, blasphemy; just as He who, in the preceding passage, was not to be denied, belonged to, Him who would, after He had killed, also cast into hell. Now, since it is Christ who averts blasphemy from the Creator, I am at a loss to know in what manner His adversary.[fn-64-P6469_1908392:1149-nf] could have come. Else, if by these sayings He throws a black cloud of censure[fn-64-P6470_1908532:1150-nf] over the severity of Him who will not forgive blasphemy and will kill even to hell, it follows that the very spirit of that rival god may be blasphemed with impunity, and his Christ denied; and that there is no difference, in fact, between worshipping and despising him; but that, as there is no punishment for the contempt, so there is no reward for the worship, which men need expect. When \"brought before magistrates,\" and examined, He forbids them \"to take thought how they shall answer; \"\"for,\" says He, \"the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.\"[fn-64-P6471_1909133:1151-nf] If such an injunction[fn-64-P6472_1909182:1152-nf] as this comes from the Creator, the precept will only be His by whom an example was previously given. The prophet Balaam, in Numbers, when sent forth by king Balak to curse lsrµl, with whom he was commencing war, was at the same moment[fn-64-P6473_1909439:1153-nf] filled with the Spirit. Instead of the curse which he was come to pronounce, he uttered the blessing which the Spirit at that very hour inspired him with; having previously declared to the king's messengers, and then to the king himself, that he could only speak forth that which God should put into his mouth.[fn-64-P6474_1909766:1154-nf] The novel doctrines of the new Christ are such as the Creator's servants initiated long before! But see how clear a difference there is between the example of Moses and of Christ.[fn-64-P6475_1909972:1155-nf] Moses voluntarily interferes with brothers[fn-64-P6476_1910048:1156-nf] who were quarrelling, and chides the offender: \"Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? \"He is, however, rejected by him: \"Who made thee a prince or a judge over us? \"[fn-64-P6477_1910251:1157-nf] Christ, on the contrary, when requested by a certain man to compose a strife between him and his brother about dividing an inheritance, refused His assistance, although in so honest a cause. Well, then, my Moses is better than your Christ, aiming as he did at the peace of brethren, and obviating their wrong. But of course the case must be different with Christ, for he is the Christ of the simply good and non-judicial god. \"Who,\" says he, \"made me a judge over you? \"[fn-64-P6478_1910747:1158-nf] No other word of excuse was he able to find, without using[fn-64-P6479_1910834:1159-nf] that with which the wicked, man and impious brother had rejected[fn-64-P6480_1910921:1160-nf] the defender of probity and piety! In short, he approved of the excuse, although a bad one, by his use of it; and of the act, although a bad one, by his refusal to make peace between brothers. Or rather, would He not show His resentment[fn-64-P6481_1911222:1161-nf] at the rejection of Moses with such a word? And therefore did He not wish in a similar case of contentious brothers, to confound them with the recollection of so harsh a word? Clearly so. For He had Himself been present in Moses, who heard such a rejection-even He, the Spirit of the Creator.[fn-64-P6482_1911549:1162-nf] I think that we have already, in another passage,[fn-64-P6483_1911778:1163-nf] sufficiently shown that the glory of riches is condemned by our God, \"who putteth down the mighty from their throne, and exalts the poor from the dunghill.\"[fn-64-P6484_1911990:1164-nf] From Him, therefore, will proceed the parable of the rich man, who flattered himself about the increase of his fields, and to Whom God said: \"Thou fool, this night shall they require thy soul of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided? \"[fn-64-P6485_1912314:1165-nf] It was just in the like manner that the king Hezekiah heard from Isaiah the sad doom of his kingdom, when he gloried, before the envoys of Babylon,[fn-64-P6486_1912488:1166-nf] in his treasures and the deposits of his precious things.[fn-64-P6487_1912568:1167-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But Christ prohibits divorce, saying, \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery.\"[fn-66-P6658_1950353:1320-nf] In order to forbid divorce, He makes it unlawful to marry a woman that has been put away. Moses, however, permitted repudiation in Deuteronomy: \"When a man hath taken a wife, and hath lived with her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found unchastity in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house.\"[fn-66-P6659_1950781:1321-nf] You see, therefore, that there is a difference between the law and the gospel- between Moses and Christ?[fn-66-P6660_1950910:1322-nf] To be sure there is![fn-66-P6661_1950964:1323-nf] But then you have rejected that other gospel which witnesses to the same verity and the same Christ.[fn-66-P6662_1951081:1324-nf] There, while prohibiting divorce, He has given us a solution of this special question respecting it: \"Moses,\" says He, \"because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the beginning it was not so\"[fn-66-P6663_1951354:1325-nf] -for this reason, indeed, because He who had \"made them male and female\" had likewise said, \"They twain shall become one flesh; what therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\"[fn-66-P6664_1951572:1326-nf] Now, by this answer of His (to the Pharisees), He both sanctioned the provision of Moses, who was His own (servant), and restored to its primitive purpose[fn-66-P6665_1951753:1327-nf] the institution of the Creator, whose Christ He was. Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the Scriptures which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground, as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and yet at the same time represented[fn-66-P6666_1952051:1328-nf] the Father, even Him who united male and female, must He not have rather exculpated[fn-66-P6667_1952153:1329-nf] than abolished the enactment of Moses? But, observe, if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to Moses and the Creator, on the same principle must He be mine if I can show that His teaching is not contrary to them. I maintain, then, that there was a condition in the prohibition which He now made of divorce; the case supposed being, that a man put away his wife for the express purpose of[fn-66-P6668_1952574:1330-nf] marrying another. His words are: \"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth adultery,\"[fn-66-P6669_1952791:1331-nf] -\"put away,\" that is, for the reason wherefore a woman ought not to be dismissed, that another wife may be obtained. For he who marries a woman who is unlawfully put away is as much of an adulterer as the man who marries one who is un-divorced. Permanent is the marriage which is not rightly dissolved; to marry,[fn-66-P6670_1953127:1332-nf] therefore, whilst matrimony is undissolved, is to commit adultery. Since, therefore, His prohibition of divorce was a conditional one, He did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely forbid, that He permitted on some occasions,[fn-66-P6671_1953445:1333-nf] when there is an absence of the cause why He gave His prohibition. In very deed[fn-66-P6672_1953541:1334-nf] His teaching is not contrary to Moses, whose precept He partially[fn-66-P6673_1953651:1335-nf] defends, I will not[fn-66-P6674_1953689:1336-nf] say confirms. If, however, you deny that divorce is in any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on your side[fn-66-P6675_1953822:1337-nf] destroy marriage, not uniting man and woman, nor admitting to the sacrament of baptism and of the eucharist those who have been united in marriage anywhere else,[fn-66-P6676_1953997:1338-nf] unless they should agree together to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, and so the very Creator Himself? Well, then, what is a husband to do in your sect,[fn-66-P6677_1954213:1339-nf] if his wife commit adultery? Shall he keep her? But your own apostle, you know,[fn-66-P6678_1954311:1340-nf] does not permit \"the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.\"[fn-66-P6679_1954396:1341-nf] Divorce, therefore, when justly deserved,[fn-66-P6680_1954462:1342-nf] has even in Christ a defender. So that Moses for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the Gospel of Matthew he says, \"Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.\"[fn-66-P6681_1954845:1343-nf] He also is deemed equally guilty of adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in his power to put away his wife.[fn-66-P6682_1955226:1344-nf] Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result of agreement! This has the sanction of the prophet: \"Thou shalt not forsake the wife of thy youth.\"[fn-66-P6683_1955481:1345-nf] Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere, both in permitting divorce and in for-bidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them separated. I have[fn-66-P6684_1956049:1346-nf] now to show whence the Lord derived this decision[fn-66-P6685_1956115:1347-nf] of His, and to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His object was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance[fn-66-P6686_1956277:1348-nf] by any suddenly devised proposal of divorce; because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the previously mentioned John. For John reproved Herod, because he had illegally married the wife of his deceased brother, who had a daughter by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion of the brother dying childless,[fn-66-P6687_1956648:1349-nf] when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order that by his own brother, and from his own wife,[fn-66-P6688_1956811:1350-nf] seed might be reckoned to the deceased husband),[fn-66-P6689_1956904:1351-nf] and was in consequence cast into prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was even put to death. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the occurrence of his death, hurled His censure[fn-66-P6690_1957139:1352-nf] against Herod in the form of unlawful marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who married a woman that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by divorce; who had been impelled thereto by his lust, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law-for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful on that very account;[fn-66-P6691_1957709:1353-nf] and who, when the prophet asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man[fn-66-P6692_1958021:1354-nf] tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham's bosom.[fn-66-P6693_1958128:1355-nf] For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally[fn-66-P6694_1958278:1356-nf] fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage.[fn-66-P6695_1958413:1357-nf] It sets forth in bold outline[fn-66-P6696_1958486:1358-nf] the end of both of them, the \"torments\" of Herod and the \"comfort\" of John, that even now Herod might hear that warning: \"They have there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.\"[fn-66-P6697_1958689:1359-nf] Marcion, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life[fn-66-P6698_1958882:1360-nf] for those who have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the Scripture itself which dazzles[fn-66-P6699_1959142:1361-nf] his sight expressly distinguishes between Abraham's bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. \"Hell\" (I take it) means one thing, and \"Abraham's bosom\" another. \"A great gulf.\" is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have \"lifted up his eyes,\"[fn-67-P6700_1959569:1362-nf] and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called Abraham's bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls of Abraham's children, even from among the Gentiles (since he is \"the father of many nations,\" which must be classed amongst his family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, therefore, I call Abraham's bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than hell,[fn-67-P6701_1960313:1363-nf] and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of all men with the \"full recompense of their reward.\"[fn-67-P6702_1960565:1364-nf] This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them. Amos, however, tells us of \"those stories towards heaven\"[fn-67-P6703_1960835:1365-nf] which Christ \"builds\"-of course for His people. There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks, \"Who shall declare unto you the eternal place, but He (that is, of course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness, speaketh of the straight path, hateth injustice and iniquity? \"[fn-67-P6704_1961363:1366-nf] Now, although this everlasting abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the Creator, who further promises that the seed of Abraham shall be even as the stars of heaven, by virtue certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be possible,[fn-67-P6705_1961749:1367-nf] without any injury to that promise, that by Abraham's bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful souls, wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where is given some foresight of the glory[fn-67-P6706_1961990:1368-nf] of both judgments? If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear Moses and the prophets, but Christ; Hear Him is the command.[fn-67-P6707_1962564:1369-nf] This is true enough. For the apostles had by that time sufficiently heard Moses and the prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded by Moses and the prophets. For even Peter would not have been able[fn-67-P6708_1962835:1370-nf] to say, \"Thou art the Christ,\"[fn-67-P6709_1962892:1371-nf] unless he had beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by whom alone Christ had been hitherto announced. Their faith, indeed, had deserved this confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them hear Him, whom they had recognized as preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, promising an everlasting abode, building for them steps upwards into heaven.[fn-67-P6710_1963289:1372-nf] Down in hell, however, it was said concerning them: \"They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them!\"-event hose who did not believe them or at least did not sincerely[fn-67-P6711_1963525:1373-nf] believe that after death there were punishments for the arrogance of wealth and the glory of luxury, announced indeed by Moses and the prophets, but decreed by that God, who deposes princes from their thrones, and raiseth up the poor from dunghills.[fn-67-P6712_1963792:1374-nf] Since, therefore, it is quite consistent in the Creator to pronounce different sentences in the two directions of reward and punishment, we shall have to conclude that there is here no diversity of gods,[fn-67-P6713_1964055:1375-nf] but only a difference in the actual matters[fn-67-P6714_1964138:1376-nf] before us.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_120_treatise_x_on_jealousy_and_envy_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"ANF-05","text":"15.

But by mentioning both the judgment-seat and the distinction between works good and bad, he sets before us a Judge who is to award both sentences,[fn-77-P7752_2214756:572-nf] and has thereby affirmed that all will have to be present at the tribunal in their bodies. For it will be impossible to pass sentence except on the body, for what has been done in the body. God would be unjust, if any one were not punished or else rewarded in that very condition,[fn-77-P7753_2215058:573-nf] wherein the merit was itself achieved. \"If therefore any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old; things are passed away; behold, all things are become new; \"[fn-77-P7754_2215260:574-nf] and so is accomplished the prophecy of Isaiah.[fn-77-P7755_2215328:575-nf] When also he (in a later passage) enjoins us \"to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and blood\"[fn-77-P7756_2215458:576-nf] (since this substance enters not the kingdom of Gods[fn-77-P7757_2215548:577-nf] ); when, again, he \"espouses the church as a chaste virgin to Christ,\"[fn-77-P7758_2215641:578-nf] a spouse to a spouse in very deed,[fn-77-P7759_2215697:579-nf] an image cannot be combined and compared with what is opposed to the real nature the thing (with which it is compared). when he designates \"false apostles, deceitful workers transforming themselves\" into likenesses of himself,[fn-77-P7760_2215957:580-nf] of course by their hypocrisy, he charges them with the guilt of disorderly conversation, rather than of false doctrine.[fn-77-P7761_2216099:581-nf] The contrariety, therefore, was one of conduct, not of gods.[fn-77-P7762_2216195:582-nf] If \"Satan himself, too, is transformed into an angel of light,\"[fn-77-P7763_2216412:583-nf] such an assertion must not be used to the prejudice of the Creator.

By words, and also by deeds, is the resurrection foretold. When Moses puts his hand into his bosom, and then draws it out again dead, and again puts his hand into his bosom, and plucks it out living,[fn-99-P9961_2753489:198-nf] does not this apply as a presage to all mankind?-inasmuch as those three signs[fn-99-P9962_2753589:199-nf] denoted the threefold power of God: when it shall, first, in the appointed order, subdue to man the old serpent, the devil,[fn-99-P9963_2753733:200-nf] however formidable; then, secondly, draw forth the flesh from the bosom of death;[fn-99-P9964_2753840:201-nf] and then, at last, shall pursue all blood (shed) in judgment.[fn-99-P9965_2753927:202-nf] On this subject we read in the writings of the same prophet, (how that) God says: \"For your blood of your lives will I require of all wild beasts; and I will require it of the hand of man, and of his brother's hand.\"[fn-99-P9966_2754165:203-nf] Now nothing is required except that which is demanded back again, and nothing is thus demanded except that which is to be given up; and that will of course be given up, which shall be demanded and required on the ground of vengeance. But indeed there cannot possibly be punishment of that which never had any existence. Existence, however, it will have, when it is restored in order to be punished. To the flesh, therefore, applies everything which is declared respecting the blood, for without the flesh there cannot be blood. The flesh will be raised up in order that the blood may be punished. There are, again, some statements (of Scripture) so plainly made as to be free from all obscurity of allegory, and yet they strongly require[fn-99-P9967_2754922:204-nf] their very simplicity to be interpreted. There is, for instance, that passage in Isaiah: \"I will kill, and I will make alive.\"[fn-99-P9968_2755065:205-nf] Certainly His making alive is to take place after He has killed.

Augustin answered: I seemed too a little while ago, when we were disputing about the oil of the sinner, to anoint your forehead, in order that you might say, if you dared, whether you yourself were not a sinner. You have had the hardihood to say as much. What a portentous sin! For in that you assert yourself to be a priest, what else have you maintained by quoting this testimony of the prophet, save that you are wholly without sin? For if you have sin, who is there that shall pray for you, according to your understanding of the words? For thus you blazon yourselves among the wretched people, quoting from the prophet: \"If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?[fn-54-P5499_2661755:334-nf] to the intent that they may believe you to be without sin, and entrust the wiping away their sins to your prayers. Truly ye are great men, exalted above your fellows, heavenly, godlike, angels indeed rather than men, who pray for the people, and will not have the people pray for you! Are you more righteous than Paul, more perfect than that great apostle, who was wont to commend himself to the prayers of those whom he taught? \"Continue,\" he says, \"in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.\"[fn-55-P5500_2662496:335-nf] See how prayer is made for an apostle, which you would have not made for a bishop. Do you perceive of how devilish a nature your pride is? Prayer is made for an apostle, that he may make manifest the mystery of Christ as he ought to speak. Accordingly, if you had a pious people under you, you ought to have exhorted them to pray for you, that you might not give utterance as you ought not. Are you more righteous than the evangelist John, who says, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-55-P5501_2663050:336-nf] Finally, are you more righteous than Daniel, whom you yourself quoted in this very epistle, going so far as to say, \"The most righteous king cast forth Daniel, as he supposed, to be devoured by wild beasts?\"-a thing which he never did suppose, since he said to Daniel himself, in the most friendly spirit, as the context of the lesson shows, \"Thy God, whom thou servest continually, He will deliver thee.\"[fn-55-P5502_2663476:337-nf] But on this subject we have already said much. With regard to the question now before us, viz., that Daniel was most righteous, it is proved not by your testimony, though that might be sufficient for me in the argument which I hold with you, but by the testimony of the Spirit of God, speaking also by the mouth of Ezekiel, where he named three men of most eminent righteousness, Noah, Daniel, and Job, who, he said, were the only men that could be saved from a certain excessive wrath of God, which was hanging over all the rest.[fn-55-P5503_2664027:338-nf] A man, therefore, of the highest righteousness, one of three conspicuous for righteousness, prays, and says, \"While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God.\"[fn-55-P5504_2664306:339-nf] And you say that you are without sin, because forsooth you are a priest; and if the people sin, you pray for them: but if you sin, who shall pray for you? For clearly by the impiety of such arrogance you show yourself to be unworthy of the mediation of that Priest whom the prophet would have to be understood in these words, which you do not understand. For now that no one may ask why this was said, I will explain it so far as by God's grace I shall be able. God was preparing the minds of men, by His prophet, to desire a Priest of such a sort that none should pray for Him. He was Himself prefigured in the times of the first people and the first temple, in which all things were figures for our ensample. Therefore the high priest used to enter alone into the holy of holies, that he might make supplication for the people, which did not enter with the priest into that inner sanctuary;[fn-55-P5505_2665220:340-nf] just as our High Priest is entered into the secret places of the heavens, into that truer holy of holies, whilst we for whom He prays are still placed here.[fn-55-P5506_2665407:341-nf] It is with this reference that the prophet says, \"If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?\" Seek therefore a priest of such a kind that he cannot sin, nor need that one should pray for him. And for this reason prayer is made for the apostles by the people;[fn-55-P5507_2665762:342-nf] but for that Priest who is the Master and Lord of the apostles is prayer not made. Hear John confessing this, and saying, \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation for our sins.\"[fn-55-P5508_2666101:343-nf] \"We have,\" he says; and \"for our sins.\" I pray you, learn humility, that you may not fall, or rather, that in time you may arise again.

Next, if He is first Word and then Son, it will appear that He knew the Father afterwards, not before; for not as being Word does He know Him, but as Son. For `No one knoweth the Father but the Son.' And this too will result, that He has come afterwards to be `in the bosom of the Fathers[fn-72-P7212_2866903:94-nf] ,' and afterwards He and the Father have become One; and afterwards is, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father[fn-72-P7213_2867050:95-nf] .' For all these things are said of the Son. Hence they will be forced to say, The Word was nothing but a name. For neither is it He who is in us with the Father, nor whoso has seen the Word, hath seen the Father, nor was the Father known to any one at all, for through the Son is the Father known (for so it is written, `And he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him'), and, the Word not being yet Son, not yet did any know the Father. How then was He seen by Moses, how by the fathers? for He says Himself in the Kingdoms, `Was I not plainly revealed to the house of thy father[fn-72-P7214_2867647:96-nf] ?' But if God was revealed, there must have been a Son to reveal, as He says Himself, `And he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.' It is irreligious then and foolish to say that the Word is one and the Son another, and whence they gained such an idea it were well to ask them. They answer, Because no mention is made in the Old Testament of the Son, but of the Word; and for this reason they are positive in their opinion that the Son came later than the Word, because not in the Old, but in the New only, is He spoken of. This is what they irreligiously say; for first to separate between the Testaments, so that the one does not hold with the other, is the device of Manichees and Jews, the one of whom oppose the Old, and the other the New[fn-72-P7215_2868418:97-nf] . Next, on their shewing, if what is contained in the Old is of older date, and what in the New of later, and times depend upon the writing, it follows that `I and the Father are One,' and `Only-begotten,' and `He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-72-P7216_2868708:98-nf] ,' are later, for these testimonies are adduced not from the Old but from the New.","title":"Discourse IV","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_165_letter_clxvii_to_rusticus_bishop_of_gallia_narbonensis_with_the_replies_to_his_questions_on_various_points_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Reply.
