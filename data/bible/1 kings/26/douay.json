{"verses":["And the men of Ziph came to Saul in Gabaa, saying:  Behold David\nis hid in the hill of Hachila, which is over against the wilderness.","And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph having\nwith him three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek David in the\nwilderness of Ziph.","And Saul encamped in Gabaa Hachila, which was over against the\nwilderness in the way:  and David abode in the wilderness.  And seeing\nthat Saul was come after him into the wilderness,","He sent spies, and learned that he was most certainly come\nthither.","And David arose secretly, and came to the place where Saul was:\nand when he had beheld the place, wherein Saul slept, and Abner, the\nson of Ner, the captain of his army, and Saul sleeping in a tent, and\nthe rest of the multitude round about him,","David spoke to Achimelech, the Hethite, and Abisai, the son of\nSarvia, the brother of Joab, saying:  Who will go down with me to Saul\ninto the camp?  And Abisai said:  I will go with thee.","So David and Abisai came to the people by night, and found Saul\nlying and sleeping in the tent, and his spear fixed in the ground at\nhis head:  and Abner and the people sleeping round about him.","And Abisai said to David:  God hath shut up thy enemy this day\ninto thy hands:  now then I will run him through with my spear, even to\nthe earth at once, and there shall be no need of a second time.","And David said to Abisai:  Kill him not:  for who shall put forth\nhis hand against the Lord's anointed, and shall be guiltless?","And David said:  As the Lord liveth, unless the Lord shall strike\nhim, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go down to battle, and\nperish:","The Lord be merciful unto me, and keep me that I never put forth\nmy hand against the Lord's anointed.  But now take the spear which is at\nhis head, and the cup of water, and let us go.","So David took the spear, and the cup of water which was at\nSaul's head, and they went away:  and no man saw it, or knew it, or\nawaked, but they were all asleep, for a deep sleep from the Lord was\nfallen upon them.","And when David was gone over to the other side, and stood on the\ntop of the hill afar off, and a good space was between them,","David cried to the people, and to Abner, the son of Ner, saying:\nWilt thou not answer, Abner?  And Abner answering, said:  Who art thou,\nthat criest, and disturbest the king?","And David said to Abner:  Art not thou a man?  and who is like\nunto thee in Israel?  why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king?  for\nthere came one of the people in to kill the king thy lord.","This thing is not good, that thou hast done:  as the Lord liveth,\nyou are the sons of death, who have not kept your master, the Lord's\nanointed.  And now where is the king's spear, and the cup of water,\nwhich was at his head?","And Saul knew David's voice, and said:  Is this thy voice, my son\nDavid?  And David said:  It is my voice, my lord the king.","And he said:  Wherefore doth my lord persecute his servant?  What\nhave I done?  or what evil is there in my hand?","Now therefore hear, I pray thee, my lord the king, the words of\nthy servant:  If the Lord stir thee up against me, let him accept of\nsacrifice:  but if the sons of men, they are cursed in the sight of the\nLord, who have cast me out this day, that I should not dwell in the\ninheritance of the Lord, saying:  Go, serve strange gods.","And now let not my blood be shed upon the earth before the Lord:\nfor the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as the partridge is\nhunted in the mountains.","And Saul said:  I have sinned; return, my son David, for I will\nno more do thee harm, because my life hath been precious in thy eyes\nthis day:  for it appeareth that I have done foolishly, and have been\nignorant in very many things.","And David answering, said:  Behold the king's spear:  let one of\nthe king's servants come over and fetch it.","And the Lord will reward every one according to his justice, and\nhis faithfulness:  for the Lord hath delivered thee this day into my\nhand, and I would not put forth my hand against the Lord's anointed.","And as thy life hath been much set by this day in my eyes, so\nlet my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord, and let him deliver\nme from all distress.","Then Saul said to David:  Blessed art thou, my son David:  and\ntruly doing thou shalt do, and prevailing thou shalt prevail.  And David\nwent on his way, and Saul returned to his place."]}
