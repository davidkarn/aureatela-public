{"verses":["And Samuel took a little vial of oil, and poured it upon his\nhead, and kissed him, and said:  Behold, the Lord hath anointed thee to\nbe prince over his inheritance, and thou shalt deliver his people out\nof the hands of their enemies, that are round about them.  And this\nshall be a sign unto thee, that God hath anointed thee to be prince.","When thou shalt depart from me this day, thou shalt find two men\nby the sepulchre of Rachel in the borders of Benjamin to the south, and\nthey shall say to thee:  The asses are found which thou wentest to seek:\nand thy father, thinking no more of the asses, is concerned for you,\nand saith:  What shall I do for my son?","And when thou shalt depart from thence, and go farther on, and\nshalt come to the oak of Thabor, there shall meet thee three men going\nup to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another three loaves\nof bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine.","And they will salute thee, and will give thee two loaves, and\nthou shalt take them at their hand.","After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where the garrison\nof the Philistines is:  and when thou shalt be come there into the city,\nthou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place,\nwith a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a pipe, and a harp before them, and\nthey shall be prophesying.","And the Spirit of the Lord shall come upon thee, and thou shalt\nprophesy with them, and shalt be changed into another man.","When therefore these signs shall happen to thee, do whatsoever\nthy hand shall find, for the Lord is with thee.","And thou shalt go down before me to Galgal, (for I will come down\nto thee), that thou mayst offer an oblation, and sacrifice victims of\npeace:  seven days shalt thou wait, till I come to thee, and I will shew\nthee what thou art to do.","So when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave unto\nhim another heart, and all these things came to pass that day.","And they came to the foresaid hill, and behold a company of\nprophets met him:  and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he\nprophesied in the midst of them.","And all that had known him yesterday and the day before, seeing\nthat he was with the prophets, and prophesied, said to each other:  What\nis this that hath happened to the son of Cis?  is Saul also among the\nprophets?","And one answered another, saying:  And who is their father?\ntherefore it became a proverb:  Is Saul also among the prophets?","And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high\nplace.","And Saul's uncle said to him, and to his servant:  Whither went\nyou?  They answered:  To seek the asses:  and not finding them, we went\nto Samuel.","And his uncle said to him:  Tell me what Samuel said to thee.","And Saul said to his uncle:  He told us that the asses were\nfound.  But of the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel had spoken to\nhim, he told him not.","And Samuel called together the people to the Lord in Maspha:","And he said to the children of Israel:  Thus saith the Lord the\nGod of Israel:  I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you from\nthe hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all the kings who\nafflicted you.","But you this day have rejected your God, who only hath saved you\nout of all your evils and your tribulations:  and you have said:  Nay:\nbut set a king over us.  Now therefore stand before the Lord by your\ntribes, and by your families.","And Samuel brought to him all the tribes of Israel, and the lot\nfell on the tribe of Benjamin.","And he brought the tribe of Benjamin and the kindreds thereof,\nand the lot fell upon the kindred of Metri, and it came to Saul, the\nson of Cis.  They sought him therefore, and he was not found.","And after this they consulted the Lord whether he would come\nthither.  And the Lord answered:  Behold he is hidden at home.","And they ran and fetched him thence:  and he stood in the midst\nof the people, and he was higher than any of the people from the\nshoulders and upward.","And Samuel said to all the people:  Surely you see him whom the\nLord hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people.  And\nall the people cried and said:  God save the king.","And Samuel told the people the law of the kingdom, and wrote it\nin a book, and laid it up before the Lord:  and Samuel sent away all the\npeople, every one to his own house.","Saul also departed to his own house in Gabaa:  and there went\nwith him a part of the army, whose hearts God had touched.","But the children of Belial said:  Shall this fellow be able to\nsave us?  And they despised him, and brought him no presents; but he\ndissembled as though he heard not."]}
