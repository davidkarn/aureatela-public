{"verses":["Now it came to pass one day that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said\nto the young man that bore his armour:  Come, and let us go over to the\ngarrison of the Philistines, which is on the other side of yonder\nplace.  But he told not this to his father.","And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gabaa, under the\npomegranate tree, which was in Magron:  and the people with him were\nabout six hundred men.","And Achias, the son of Achitob, brother of Ichabod the son of\nPhinees, the son of Heli, the priest of the Lord in Silo, wore the\nephod.  And the people knew not whither Jonathan was gone.","Now there were between the ascents, by which Jonathan sought to\ngo over to the garrison of the Philistines, rocks standing up on both\nsides, and steep cliffs like teeth on the one side, and on the other,\nthe name of the one was Boses, and the name of the other was Sene:","One rock stood out toward the north, over against Machmas, and\nthe other to the south, over against Gabaa.","And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour:  Come,\nlet us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised, it may be the\nLord will do for us:  because it is easy for the Lord to save either by\nmany, or by few.","And his armourbearer said to him:  Do all that pleaseth thy mind:\ngo whither thou wilt, and I will be with thee wheresoever thou hast a\nmind.","And Jonathan said:  Behold we will go over to these men.  And when\nwe shall be seen by them,","If they shall speak thus to us:  Stay till we come to you:  let us\nstand still in our place, and not go up to them.","But if they shall say:  Come up to us:  let us go up, because the\nLord hath delivered them into our hands, this shall be a sign unto us.","So both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the\nPhilistines:  and the Philistines said:  Behold the Hebrews come forth\nout of the holes wherein they were hid.","And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan, and to his\narmourbearer, and said:  Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing.\nAnd Jonathan said to his armourbearer:  Let us go up, follow me:  for the\nLord hath delivered them into the hands of Israel.","And Jonathan went up creeping on his hands and feet, and his\narmourbearer after him.  And some fell before Jonathan, others his\narmourbearer slew as he followed him.","And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his armourbearer\nmade, was of about twenty men, within half an acre of land, which a\nyoke of oxen is wont to plough in a day.","And there was a miracle in the camp, in the fields:  and all the\npeople of their garrison, who had gone out to plunder, were amazed, and\nthe earth trembled:  and it happened as a miracle from God.","And the watchmen of Saul, who were in Gabaa of Benjamin looked,\nand behold a multitude overthrown, and fleeing this way and that.","And Saul said to the people that were with him:  Look, and see\nwho is gone from us.  And when they had sought, it was found that\nJonathan and his armourbearer were not there.","And Saul said to Achias:  Bring the ark of the Lord.  (For the ark\nof God was there that day with the children of Israel.)","And while Saul spoke to the priest, there arose a great uproar\nin the camp of the Philistines:  and it increased by degrees, and was\nheard more clearly.  And Saul said to the priest:  Draw in thy hand.","Then Saul, and all the people that were with him, shouted\ntogether, and they came to the place of the fight:  and behold every\nman's sword was turned upon his neighbour, and there was a very great\nslaughter.","Moreover, the Hebrews that had been with the Philistines\nyesterday and the day before, and went up with them into the camp,\nreturned to be with the Israelites, who were with Saul and Jonathan.","And all the Israelites that had hid themselves in mount Ephraim,\nhearing that the Philistines fled, joined themselves with their\ncountrymen in the fight.  And there were with Saul about ten thousand\nmen.","And the Lord saved Israel that day.  And the fight went on as far\nas Bethaven.","And the men of Israel were joined together that day:  and Saul\nadjured the people, saying:  Cursed be the man that shall eat food till\nevening, till I be revenged of my enemies.  So none of the people tasted\nany food.","And all the common people came into a forest, in which there was\nhoney upon the ground.","And when the people came into the forest, behold the honey\ndropped, but no man put his hand to his mouth.  For the people feared\nthe oath.","But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people:\nand he put forth the end of the rod, which he had in his hand, and dipt\nit in a honeycomb:  and he carried his hand to his mouth, and his eyes\nwere enlightened.","And one of the people answering, said:  Thy father hath bound the\npeople with an oath, saying:  Cursed be the man that shall eat any food\nthis day.  (And the people were faint.)","And Jonathan said:  My father hath troubled the land:  you have\nseen yourselves that my eyes are enlightened, because I tasted a little\nof this honey:","How much more if the people had eaten of the prey of their\nenemies, which they found?  had there not been made a greater slaughter\namong the Philistines?","So they smote that day the Philistines, from Machmas to Aialon.\nAnd the people were wearied exceedingly.","And falling upon the spoils, they took sheep, and oxen, and\ncalves, and slew them on the ground:  and the people ate them with the\nblood.","And they told Saul that the people had sinned against the Lord,\neating with the blood.  And he said:  You have transgressed:  roll here\nto me now a great stone.","And Saul said:  Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell\nthem to bring me every man his ox and his ram and slay them upon this\nstone, and eat, and you shall not sin against the Lord, in eating with\nthe blood.  So all the people brought every man his ox with him till the\nnight:  and slew them there.","And Saul built an altar to the Lord:  and he then first began to\nbuild an altar to the Lord.","And Saul said:  Let us fall upon the Philistines by night, and\ndestroy them till the morning light, and let us not leave a man of\nthem.  And the people said:  Do all that seemeth good in thy eyes.  And\nthe priest said:  Let us draw near hither unto God.","And Saul consulted the Lord:  Shall I pursue after the\nPhilistines?  wilt thou deliver them into the hands of Israel?  And he\nanswered him not that day.","And Saul said:  Bring hither all the corners of the people:  and\nknow, and see by whom this sin hath happened to day.","As the Lord liveth, who is the Saviour of Israel, if it was done\nby Jonathan, my son, he shall surely die.  In this none of the people\ngainsayed him.","And he said to all Israel:  Be you on one side and I, with\nJonathan, my son, will be on the other side.  And the people answered\nSaul:  Do what seemeth good in thy eyes.","And Saul said to the Lord:  O Lord God of Israel, give a sign, by\nwhich we may know, what the meaning is, that thou answerest not thy\nservant to day:  If this iniquity be in me, or in my son Jonathan, give\na proof:  or if this iniquity be in thy people, give holiness.  And\nJonathan and Saul were taken, and the people escaped.","And Saul said:  (Cast lots between me, and Jonathan, my son.  And\nJonathan was taken.","And Saul said to Jonathan:  Tell me what thou hast done.  And\nJonathan told him, and said:  I did but taste a little honey with the\nend of the rod, which was in my hand, and behold I must die.","And Saul said:  May God do so and so to me, and add still more:\nfor dying thou shalt die, O Jonathan.","And the people said to Saul:  Shall Jonathan then die, who hath\nwrought this great salvation in Israel?  this must not be:  As the Lord\nliveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he\nhath wrought with God this day.  So the people delivered Jonathan, that\nhe should not die.","And Saul went back, and did not pursue after the Philistines:\nand the Philistines went to their own places.","And Saul having his kingdom established over Israel, fought\nagainst all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the\nchildren of Ammon, and Edom, and the kings of Soba, and the\nPhilistines:  and whithersoever he turned himself, he overcame.","And gathering together an army, he defeated Amalec, and\ndelivered Israel from the hand of them that spoiled them.","And the sons of Saul, were Jonathan, and Jessui, and Melchisua:\nand the names of his two daughters, the name of the firstborn was\nMerob, and the name of the younger Michol.","And the name of Saul's wife was Achinoam, the daughter of\nAchimaas; and the name of the captain of his army was Abner, the son of\nNer, the cousin german of Saul.","For Cis was the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner,\nwas son of Abiel.","And there was a great war against the Philistines all the days\nof Saul.  For whomsoever Saul saw to be a valiant man, and fit for war,\nhe took him to himself."]}
