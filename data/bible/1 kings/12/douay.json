{"verses":["And Samuel said to all Israel:  Behold I have hearkened to your\nvoice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.","And now the king goeth before you:  but I am old and greyheaded:\nand my sons are with you:  having then conversed with you from my youth\nuntil this day, behold here I am.","Speak of me before the Lord, and before his anointed, whether I\nhave taken any man's ox, or ass:  if I have wronged any man, if I have\noppressed any man, if I have taken a bribe at any man's hand:  and I\nwill despise it this day, and will restore it to you.","And they said:  Thou hast not wronged us, nor oppressed us, nor\ntaken ought at any man's hand.","And he said to them:  The Lord is witness against you, and his\nanointed is witness this day, that you have not found any thing in my\nhand.  And they said:  He is witness.","And Samuel said to the people:  It is the Lord who made Moses and\nAaron, and brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt.","Now, therefore, stand up, that I may plead in judgment against\nyou before the Lord, concerning all the kindness of the Lord, which he\nhath shewn to you, and to your fathers:","How Jacob went into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the Lord:\nand the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, and brought your fathers out of\nEgypt, and made them dwell in this place.","And they forgot the Lord their God, and he delivered them into\nthe hands of Sisara, captain of the army of Hasor, and into the hands\nof the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they\nfought against them.","But afterwards they cried to the Lord, and said:  We have sinned,\nbecause we have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim and Astaroth:\nbut now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve\nthee.","And the Lord sent Jerobaal, and Badan, and Jephte, and Samuel,\nand delivered you from the hand of your enemies round about, and you\ndwelt securely.","But seeing that Naas, king of the children of Ammon, was come\nagainst you, you said to me:  Nay, but a king shall reign over us:\nwhereas the Lord your God was your king.","Now, therefore, your king is here, whom you have chosen and\ndesired:  Behold the Lord hath given you a king.","If you will fear the Lord, and serve him, and hearken to his\nvoice, and not provoke the mouth of the Lord:  then shall both you, and\nthe king who reigneth over you, be followers of the Lord your God.","But if you will not hearken to the voice of the Lord, but will\nrebel against his words, the hand of the Lord shall be upon you, and\nupon your fathers.","Now then stand, and see this great thing which the Lord will do\nin your sight.","Is it not wheat harvest to day?  I will call upon the Lord, and\nhe shall send thunder and rain:  and you shall know, and see that you\nyourselves have done a great evil in the sight of the Lord, in desiring\na king over you.","And Samuel cried unto the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and\nrain that day.","And all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel.  And all\nthe people said to Samuel:  Pray for thy servants to the Lord thy God,\nthat we may not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil, to\nask for a king.","And Samuel said to the people:  Fear not, you have done all this\nevil:  but yet depart not from following the Lord, but serve the Lord\nwith all your heart.","And turn not aside after vain things, which shall never profit\nyou, nor deliver you, because they are vain.","And the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's\nsake:  because the Lord hath sworn to make you his people.","And far from me be this sin against the Lord, that I should\ncease to pray for you:  and I will teach you the good and right way.","Therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in truth, and with your\nwhole heart, for you have seen the great works which he hath done among\nyou.","But if you will still do wickedly:  both you and your king shall\nperish together."]}
