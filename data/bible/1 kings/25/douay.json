{"verses":["And Samuel died, and all Israel was gathered together, and they\nmourned for him, and buried him in his house in Ramatha.  And David\nrose, and went down into the wilderness of Pharan.","Now there was a certain man in the wilderness of Maon, and his\npossessions were in Carmel, and the man was very great:  and he had\nthree thousand sheep, and a thousand goats:  and it happened that he was\nshearing his sheep in Carmel.","Now the name of the man was Nabal:  and the name of his wife was\nAbigail.  And she was a prudent and very comely woman:  but her husband\nwas churlish, and very bad and ill natured:  and he was of the house of\nCaleb.","And when David heard in the wilderness, that Nabal was shearing\nhis sheep,","He sent ten young men, and said to them:  Go up to Carmel, and go\nto Nabal, and salute him in my name with peace.","And you shall say:  Peace be to my brethren, and to thee, and\npeace to thy house, and peace to all that thou hast.","I have heard that thy shepherds that were with us in the desert\nwere shearing:  we never molested them, neither was there ought missing\nto them of the flock at any time, all the while they were with us in\nCarmel.","Ask thy servants, and they will tell thee.  Now therefore let thy\nservants find favour in thy eyes:  for we are come in a good day,\nwhatsoever thy hand shall find give to thy servants, and to thy son\nDavid.","And when David's servants came, they spoke to Nabal all these\nwords in David's name, and then held their peace.","But Nabal answering the servants of David, said:  Who is David?\nand what is the son of Isai?  servants are multiplied now days who flee\nfrom their masters.","Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and the flesh of my\ncattle, which I have killed for my shearers, and give to men whom I\nknow not whence they are?","So the servants of David went back their way, and returning came\nand told him all the words that he said.","Then David said to his young men:  Let every man gird on his\nsword.  And they girded on every man his sword.  And David also girded on\nhis sword:  and there followed David about four hundred men, and two\nhundred remained with the baggage.","But one of the servants told, Abigail, the wife of Nabal,\nsaying:  Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness, to salute\nour master:  and he rejected them.","These men were very good to us, and gave us no trouble:  Neither\ndid we ever lose any thing all the time that we conversed with them in\nthe desert.","They were a wall unto us, both by night and day, all the while\nwe were with them keeping the sheep.","Wherefore consider, and think what thou hast to do:  for evil is\ndetermined against thy husband, and against thy house, and he is a son\nof Belial, so that no man can speak to him.","Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves, and two\nvessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of\nparched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes\nof dry figs, and laid them upon asses:","And she said to her servants:  Go before me:  behold, I will\nfollow after you:  but she told not her husband, Nabal.","And when she had gotten upon an ass, and was coming down to the\nfoot of the mountain, David and his men came down over against her, and\nshe met them.","And David said:  Truly in vain have I kept all that belonged to\nthis fellow in the wilderness, and nothing was lost of all that\npertained unto him:  and he hath returned me evil for good.","May God do so and so, and add more to the foes of David, if I\nleave of all that belong to him till the morning, any that pisseth\nagainst the wall.","And when Abigail saw David, she made haste and lighted off the\nass, and fell before David, on her face, and adored upon the ground.","And she fell at his feet, and said:  Upon me let this iniquity\nbe, my lord:  let thy handmaid speak, I beseech thee, in thy ears, and\nhear the words of thy servant.","Let not my lord the king, I pray thee, regard this naughty man,\nNabal:  for according to his name, he is a fool, and folly is with him:\nbut I, thy handmaid, did not see thy servants, my lord, whom thou\nsentest.","Now therefore, my lord, the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth,\nwho hath withholden thee from coming to blood, and hath saved thy hand\nto thee:  and now let thy enemies be as Nabal, and all they that seek\nevil to my lord.","Wherefore receive this blessing, which thy handmaid hath brought\nto thee, my lord:  and give it to the young men that follow thee, my\nlord.","Forgive the iniquity of thy handmaid:  for the Lord will surely\nmake for my lord a faithful house, because thou, my lord, fightest the\nbattles of the Lord:  let not evil therefore be found in thee all the\ndays of thy life.","For if a man at any time shall rise, and persecute thee, and\nseek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be kept, as in the bundle of\nthe living, with the Lord thy God:  but the souls of thy enemies shall\nbe whirled, as with the violence and whirling of a sling.","And when the Lord shall have done to thee, my lord, all the good\nthat he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have made thee prince\nover Israel,","This shall not be an occasion of grief to thee, and a scruple of\nheart to my lord, that thou hast shed innocent blood, or hast revenged\nthyself:  and when the Lord shall have done well by my lord, thou shalt\nremember thy handmaid.","And David said to Abigail:  Blessed be the Lord the God of\nIsrael, who sent thee this day to meet me, and blessed be thy speech:","And blessed be thou, who hast kept me to day from coming to\nblood, and revenging me with my own hand.","Otherwise, as the Lord liveth, the God of Israel, who hath\nwithholden me from doing thee any evil, if thou hadst not quickly come\nto meet me, there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light, any\nthat pisseth against the wall.","And David received at her hand all that she had brought him, and\nsaid to her:  Go in peace into thy house, behold I have heard thy voice,\nand honoured thy face.","And Abigail came to Nabal:  and behold he had a feast in his\nhouse, like the feast of a king:  and Nabal's heart was merry, for he\nwas very drunk:  and she told him nothing less or more until morning.","But early in the morning, when Nabal had digested his wine, his\nwife told him these words, and his heart died within him, and he became\nas a stone.","And after ten days had passed, the Lord struck Nabal, and he\ndied.","And when David had heard that Nabal was dead, he said:  Blessed\nbe the Lord, who hath judged the cause of my reproach, at the hand of\nNabal, and hath kept his servant from evil, and the Lord hath returned\nthe wickedness of Nabal upon his head.  Then David sent and treated with\nAbigail, that he might take her to himself for a wife.","And David's servants came to Abigail, to Carmel, and spoke to\nher, saying:  David hath sent us to thee, to take thee to himself for a\nwife.","And she arose, and bowed herself down with her face to the\nearth, and said:  Behold, let thy servant be a handmaid, to wash the\nfeet of the servants of my lord.","And Abigail arose, and made haste, and got upon an ass, and five\ndamsels went with her, her waiting maids, and she followed the\nmessengers of David, and became his wife.","Moreover David took also Achinoam of Jezrahel:  and they were\nboth of them his wives.","But Saul gave Michol, his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti, the\nson of Lais, who was of Gallim."]}
