{"verses":["Now the ark of God was in the land of the Philistines seven\nmonths.","And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,\nsaying:  What shall we do with the ark of the Lord?  tell us how we are\nto send it back to its place.  And they said:","If you send back the ark of the God of Israel, send it not away\nempty, but render unto him what you owe for sin, and then you shall be\nhealed:  and you shall know why his hand departeth not from you.","They answered:  What is it we ought to render unto him for sin?  and\nthey answered:","According to the number of the provinces of the Philistines you\nshall make five golden emerods, and five golden mice:  for the same\nplague hath been upon you all, and upon your lords.  And you shall make\nthe likeness of your emerods, and the likeness of the mice, that have\ndestroyed the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel:  to\nsee if he will take off his hand from you, and from your gods, and from\nyour land.","Why do you harden your hearts, as Egypt and Pharao hardened their\nhearts?  did not he, after he was struck, then let them go, and they\ndeparted?","Now, therefore, take and make a new cart:  and two kine that have\ncalved, on which there hath come no yoke, tie to the cart, and shut up\ntheir calves at home.","And you shall take the ark of the Lord, and lay it on the cart,\nand the vessels of gold, which you have paid him for sin, you shall put\ninto a little box at the side thereof:  and send it away, that it may\ngo.","And you shall look:  and if it go up by the way of his own coasts,\ntowards Bethsames, then he hath done us this great evil:  but if not, we\nshall know that it is not his hand hath touched us, but it hath\nhappened by chance.","They did therefore in this manner:  and taking two kine, that had\nsucking calves, they yoked them to the cart, and shut up their calves\nat home.","And they laid the ark of God upon the cart, and the little box\nthat had in it the golden mice, and the likeness of the emerods.","And the kine took the straight way, that leadeth to Bethsames,\nand they went along the way, lowing as they went:  and turned not aside\nneither to the right hand nor to the left:  and the lords of the\nPhilistines followed them as far as the borders of Bethsames.","Now the Bethsamites were reaping wheat in the valley:  and lifting\nup their eyes, they saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.","And the cart came into the field of Josue, a Bethsamite, and\nstood there.  And there was a great stone, and they cut in pieces the\nwood of the cart, and laid the kine upon it a holocaust to the Lord.","And the Levites took down the ark of God, and the little box that\nwas at the side of it, wherein were the vessels of gold, and they put\nthem upon the great stone.  The men also of Bethsames offered\nholocausts, and sacrificed victims that day to the Lord.","And the five princes of the Philistines saw, and they returned to\nAccaron the same day.","And these are the golden emerods, which the Philistines returned\nfor sin to the Lord:  For Azotus one, for Gaza one, for Ascalon one, for\nGeth one, for Accaron one:","And the golden mice, according to the number of the cities of the\nPhilistines, of the five provinces, from the fenced city to the village\nthat was without wall, and to the great Abel (the stone) whereon they\nset down the ark of the Lord, which was till that day in the field of\nJosue the Bethsamite.","But he slew of the men of Bethsames, because they had seen the\nark of the Lord, and he slew of the people seventy men, and fifty\nthousand of the common people.  And the people lamented, because the\nLord had smitten the people with a great slaughter.","And the men of Bethsames said:  Who shall be able to stand before\nthe Lord this holy God?  and to whom shall he go up from us?","And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Cariathiarim,\nsaying:  The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord, come ye\ndown and fetch it up to you."]}
