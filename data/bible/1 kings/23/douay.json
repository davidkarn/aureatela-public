And the Lord said to David:  Go, and thou shalt smite\nthe Philistines, and shalt save Ceila.","And the men that were with David, said to him:  Behold we are in\nfear here in Judea, how much more if we go to Ceila against the bands\nof the Philistines?","Therefore David consulted the Lord again.  And he answered and\nsaid to him:  Arise, and go to Ceila:  for I will deliver the Philistines\ninto thy hand.","David, therefore, and his men, went to Ceila, and fought against\nthe Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and made a great\nslaughter of them:  and David saved the inhabitants of Ceila.","Now at that time, when Abiathar, the son of Achimelech, fled to\nDavid, to Ceila, he came down, having an ephod with him.","And it was told Saul that David was come to Ceila:  and Saul said:\nThe Lord hath delivered him into my hands, and he is shut up, being\ncome into a city that hath gates and bars.","And Saul commanded all the people to go down to fight against\nCeila, and to besiege David and his men.","Now when David understood that Saul secretly prepared evil\nagainst him, he said to Abiathar, the priest:  Bring hither the ephod.","And David said:  O Lord God of Israel, thy servant hath heard a\nreport, that Saul designeth to come to Ceila, to destroy the city for\nmy sake:","Will the men of Ceila deliver me into his hands?  and will Saul\ncome down, as thy servant hath heard?  O Lord God of Israel, tell thy\nservant.  And the Lord said:  He will come down.","And David said:  Will the men of Ceila deliver me and my men into\nthe hands of Saul?
