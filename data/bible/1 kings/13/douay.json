{"verses":["Saul was a child of one year when he began to reign, and he\nreigned two years over Israel.","And Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel:  and two thousand\nwere with Saul in Machmas, and in mount Bethel:  and a thousand with\nJonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin:  and the rest of the people he sent back\nevery man to their dwellings.","And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines which was in\nGabaa.  And when the Philistines had heard of it, Saul sounded the\ntrumpet over all the land, saying:  Let the Hebrews hear.","And all Israel heard this report:  Saul hath smitten the garrison\nof the Philistines:  and Israel took courage against the Philistines.\nAnd the people were called together after Saul to Galgal.","The Philistines also were assembled to fight against Israel,\nthirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and a multitude of\npeople besides, like the sand on the seashore for number.  And going up\nthey camped in Machmas, at the east of Bethaven.","And when the men of Israel saw that they were straitened (for the\npeople were distressed), they hid themselves in caves, and in thickets,\nand in rocks, and in dens, and in pits.","And some of the Hebrews passed over the Jordan into the land of\nGad and Galaad.  And when Saul was yet in Galgal, all the people that\nfollowed him were greatly afraid.","And he waited seven days, according to the appointment of Samuel,\nand Samuel came not to Galgal, and the people slipt away from him.","Then Saul said:  Bring me the holocaust, and the peace offerings.\nAnd he offered the holocaust.","And when he had made an end of offering the holocaust, behold\nSamuel came:  and Saul went forth to meet him and salute him.","And Samuel said to him:  What hast thou done?  Saul answered:\nBecause I saw that the people slipt from me, and thou wast not come\naccording to the days appointed, and the Philistines were gathered\ntogether in Machmas,","I said:  Now will the Philistines come down upon me to Galgal,\nand I have not appeased the face of the Lord.  Forced by necessity, I\noffered the holocaust.","And Samuel said to Saul:  Thou hast done foolishly, and hast not\nkept the commandments of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee.  And\nif thou hadst not done thus, the Lord would now have established thy\nkingdom over Israel for ever:","But thy kingdom shall not continue.  The Lord hath sought him a\nman according to his own heart:  and him hath the Lord commanded to be\nprince over his people, because thou hast not observed that which the\nLord commanded.","And Samuel arose and went up from Galgal to Gabaa of Benjamin.\nAnd the rest of the people went up after Saul, to meet the people who\nfought against them, going from Galgal to Gabaa, in the hill of\nBenjamin.  And Saul numbered the people, that were found with him, about\nsix hundred men.","And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present\nwith them, were in Gabaa of Benjamin:  But the Philistines encamped in\nMachmas.","And there went out of the camp of the Philistines three\ncompanies to plunder.  One company went towards the way of Ephra to the\nland of Sual;","And another went by the way of Bethoron, and the third turned to\nthe way of the border, above the valley of Seboim towards the desert.","Now there was no smith to be found in all the land of Israel,\nfor the Philistines had taken this precaution, lest the Hebrews should\nmake them swords or spears.","So all Israel went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man\nhis ploughshare, and his spade, and his axe, and his rake.","So that their shares, and their spades, and their forks, and\ntheir axes, were blunt, even to the goad, which was to be mended.","And when the day of battle was come, there was neither sword nor\nspear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and\nJonathan, except Saul and Jonathan his son.","And the army of the Philistines went out in order to advance\nfurther in Machmas."]}
