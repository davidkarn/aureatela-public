{"verses":["And the Lord said to Samuel:  How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,\nwhom I have rejected from reigning over Israel?  fill thy horn with oil,\nand come, that I may send thee to Isai, the Bethlehemite:  for I have\nprovided me a king among his sons.","And Samuel said:  How shall I go?  for Saul will hear of it, and he\nwill kill me.  And the Lord said:  Thou shalt take with thee a calf of\nthe herd, and thou shalt say:  I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.","And thou shalt call Isai to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee\nwhat thou art to do, and thou shalt anoint him whom I shall shew to\nthee.","Then Samuel did as the Lord had said to him.  And he came to\nBethlehem, and the ancients of the city wondered, and meeting him, they\nsaid:  Is thy coming hither peaceable?","And he said:  It is peaceable:  I am come to offer sacrifice to the\nLord, be ye sanctified, and come with me to the sacrifice.  And he\nsanctified Isai and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.","And when they were come in, he saw Eliab, and said:  Is the Lord's\nanointed before him?","And the Lord said to Samuel:  Look not on his countenance, nor on\nthe height of his stature:  because I have rejected him, nor do I judge\naccording to the look of man:  for man seeth those things that appear,\nbut the Lord beholdeth the heart.","And Isai called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel.  And he\nsaid:  Neither hath the Lord chosen this,","And Isai brought Samma, and he said of him:  Neither hath the Lord\nchosen this.","Isai therefore brought his seven sons before Samuel:  and Samuel\nsaid to Isai:  The Lord hath not chosen any one of these.","And Samuel said to Isai:  Are here all thy sons?  He answered:\nThere remaineth yet a young one, who keepeth the sheep.  And Samuel said\nto Isai:  Send, and fetch him:  for we will not sit down till he come\nhither.","He sent therefore and brought him.  Now he was ruddy and\nbeautiful to behold, and of a comely face.  And the Lord said:  Arise,\nand anoint him, for this is he.","Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst\nof his brethren:  and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that\nday forward:  and Samuel rose up, and went to Ramatha.","But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil\nspirit from the Lord troubled him.","And the servants of Saul said to him:  Behold now an evil spirit\nfrom God troubleth thee.","Let our lord give orders, and thy servants who are before thee,\nwill seek out a man skilful in playing on the harp, that when the evil\nspirit from the Lord is upon thee, he may play with his hand, and thou\nmayst bear it more easily.","And Saul said to his servants:  Provide me then some man that can\nplay well, and bring him to me.","And one of the servants answering, said:  Behold I have seen a\nson of Isai, the Bethlehemite, a skilful player, and one of great\nstrength, and a man fit for war, and prudent in his words, and a comely\nperson:  and the Lord is with him.","Then Saul sent messengers to Isai, saying:  Send me David, thy\nson, who is in the pastures.","And Isai took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and\na kid of the flock, and sent them by the hand of David, his son, to\nSaul.","And David came to Saul, and stood before him:  and he loved him\nexceedingly, and made him his armourbearer.","And Saul sent to Isai, saying:  Let David stand before me:  for he\nhath found favour in my sight.","So whensoever the evil spirit from the Lord was upon Saul, David\ntook his harp, and played with his hand, and Saul was refreshed, and\nwas better, for the evil spirit departed from him."]}
