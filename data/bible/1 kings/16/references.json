The Lord gives commandment that those who sin against us are to be arraigned privately or else in the presence of a witness, and that if they refuse to hear reason, the matter is to be laid before the church, and those who persist in their wickedness are to be regarded as heathen men and publicans.[fn-49-P4900_1343977:3500-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":16,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1455","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"I need not go through the lives of the saints or call attention to the moles and spots which mark the fairest skins.

Now, short and simple as this utter-ante is, it appears to me, as I consider it that its meanings are many and various. For of the senses in which \"in\" is used, we find that all help our conceptions of the Spirit. Form is said to be in Matter; Power to be in what is capable of it; Habit to be in him who is affected by it; and so on.[fn-18-P1809_468427:522-nf] Therefore, inasmuch as the Holy Spirit perfects rational beings, completing their excellence, He is analogous to Form. For he, who no longer \"lives after the flesh,\"[fn-18-P1810_468612:523-nf] but, being\"led by the Spirit of God,\"[fn-18-P1811_468786:524-nf] is called a Son of God, being\"conformed to tile image of the Son of God,\"[fn-18-P1812_468885:525-nf] is described as spiritual. And as is the power of seeing in the healthy eye, so is the operation of the Spirit in the purified soul. Wherefore also Paul prays for the Ephesians that they may have their\"eyes enlightened\" by \"the Spirit of wisdom.\"[fn-18-P1813_469516:526-nf] And as the art in him who has acquired it, so is the grace of the Spirit in the recipient ever present, though not continuously in operation. For as the art is potentially in the artist, but only in operation when he is working in accordance with it, so also the Spirit is ever present with those that are worthy, but works, as need requires, in prophecies, or in healings, or in some other actual carrying into effect of His potential action.[fn-18-P1814_469982:527-nf] Furthermore as in our bodies is health, or heat, or, generally, their variable conditions, so, very frequently is the Spirit in the soul; since He does not abide with those who, on account of the instability of their will, easily reject the grace which they have received. An instance of this is seen in Saul,[fn-18-P1815_470314:528-nf] and the seventy elders of the children of Israel, except Eldad and Medad, with whom alone the Spirit appears to have remained,[fn-18-P1816_470462:529-nf] and, generally, any one similar to these in character. And like reason in the soul, which is at one time the thought in the heart, and at another speech uttered by the tongue,[fn-18-P1817_470661:530-nf] so is the Holy Spirit, as when He\"beareth witness with our spirit,\"[fn-18-P1818_471173:531-nf] and when lie \"cries in our hearts, Abba, Father,\"[fn-18-P1819_471246:532-nf] or when He speaks on our behalf, as it is said, \"It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of our Father which speaketh in you.\"[fn-18-P1820_471457:533-nf] Again, the Spirit is conceived of, in relation to the distribution of gifts, as a whole in parts. For we all are \"members one of another, having girls differing according to the grace that is given us.\"[fn-18-P1821_471960:534-nf] Wherefore \"the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you,\"[fn-18-P1822_472105:535-nf] but all together complete the Body of Christ in the Unity of the Spirit, and render to one another the needful aid that comes of the gifts. \"But God hath set the members in the body, every one of them, as it hath pleased Him.\"[fn-18-P1823_472351:536-nf] But \"the members have the same care for one another,\"[fn-18-P1824_472425:537-nf] according to the inborn spiritual communion of their sympathy. Wherefore, \"whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.\"[fn-18-P1825_472643:538-nf] And as parts in the whole so are we individually in the Spirit, because we all \"were baptized in one body into one spirit.\"[fn-18-P1826_472791:539-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":16,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_23_ix_de_fuga_in_persecutione_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"ANF-04","text":"2. If, because injustice is not from God, but from the devil, and persecution consists of injustice (for what more unjust than that the bishops of the true God, that all the followers of the truth, should be dealt with after the manner o the vilest criminals?), persecution therefore seems to proceed from the devil, by whom the injustice which constitutes persecution is perpetrated, we ought to know, as you have neither persecution without the injustice of the devil, nor the trial of faith without persecution, that the injustice necessary for the trial of faith does not give a warrant for persecution, but supplies an agency; that in reality, in reference to the trial of faith, which is the reason of persecution, the will of God goes first, but that as the instrument of persecution, which is the way of trial, the injustice of the devil follows. For in other respects, too, injustice in proportion to the enmity it displays against righteousness affords occasion for attestations of that to which it is opposed as an enemy, that so righteousness may be perfected in injustice, as strength is perfected in weakness.[fn-19-P1936_571808:4-nf] For the weak things of the world have been chosen by God to confound the strong, and the foolish things of the world to confound its wisdom.[fn-19-P1937_571967:5-nf] Thus even injustice is employed, that righteousness may be approved in putting unrighteousness to shame. Therefore, since the service is not of free-will, but of subjection (for persecution is the appointment of the Lord for the trial of faith, but its ministry is the injustice of the devil, supplied that persecution may be got up), we believe that persecution comes to pass, no question, by the devil's agency, but not by the devil's origination. Satan will not be at liberty to do anything against the servants of the living God unless the Lord grant leave, either that He may overthrow Satan himself by the faith of the elect which proves victorious in the trial, or in the face of the world show that apostatizers to the devil's cause have been in reality His servants. You have the case of Job, whom the devil, unless he had received authority from God, could not have visited with trial, not even, in fact, in his property, unless the Lord had said, \"Behold, all that he has I put at your disposal; but do not stretch out your hand against himself.\"[fn-19-P1938_573046:6-nf] In short, he would not even have stretched it out, unless afterwards, at his request, the Lord had granted him this permission also, saying, \"Behold, I deliver him to you; only preserve his life.\" So he asked in the case of the apostles likewise an opportunity to tempt them, having it only by special allowance, since the Lord in the Gospel says to Peter, \"Behold, Satan asked that he might sift you as grain; but I have prayed for you that your faith fail not; \"[fn-19-P1939_573525:7-nf] that is, that the devil should not have power granted him sufficient to endanger his faith. Whence it is manifest that both things belong to God shaking of faith as well as the shielding of it, when both are sought from Him-the shaking by the devil, the shielding by the Son. And certainly, when the Son of God has faith's protection absolutely committed to Him, beseeching it of the Father, from whom He receives all power in heaven and on earth, how entirely out of the question is it that the devil should have the assailing of it in his own power! But in the prayer prescribed to us, when we say to our Father, \"Lead us not into temptation \"[fn-19-P1940_574193:8-nf] (now what greater temptation is there than persecution?), we acknowledge that that comes to pass by His will whom we beseech to exempt us from it. For this is what follows, \"But deliver us from the wicked one,\" that is, do not lead us into temptation by giving us up to the wicked one, for then are we delivered from the power of the devil, when we are not handed over to him to be tempted. Nor would the devil's legion have had power over the herd of swine[fn-19-P1941_574668:9-nf] unless they had got it from God; so far are they from having power over the sheep of God. I may say that the bristles of the swine, too, were then counted by God, not to speak of the hairs of holy men. The devil, it must be owned, seems indeed to have power-in this case really his own-over those who do not belong to God, the nations being once for all counted by God as a drop of the bucket, and as the dust of the threshing-floor, and as the spittle of the mouth, and so thrown open to the devil as, in a sense, a free possession. But against those who belong to the household of God he may not do ought as by any right of his own, because the cases marked out in Scripture show when-that is, for what reasons-he may touch them. For either, with a view to their being approved, the power of trial is granted to him, challenged or challenging, as in the instances already referred to, or, to secure an opposite result, the sinner is handed over to him, as though he were an executioner to whom belonged the inflicting of punishment, as in the case of Saul. \"And the Spirit of the Lord,\" says Scripture, \"departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled and stifled him; \"[fn-19-P1942_575871:10-nf] or the design is to humble, as the apostle tells us, that there was given him a stake, the messenger of Satan, to buffet him;[fn-19-P1943_576019:11-nf] and even this son of thing is not permitted in the case of holy men, unless it be that at the same time strength of endurance may be perfected in weakness. For the apostle likewise delivered Phygellus and Hermogenes over to Satan that by chastening they might be taught not to blaspheme.[fn-19-P1944_576327:12-nf] You see, then, that the devil receives more suitably power even from the servants of God; so far is he from having it by any fight of his own.","title":"IX.

But l the Word is the one Shepherd of things rational which may have an appearance of discord to those who have not ears to hear, but are truly at perfect concord. For as the different chords of the psalter or the lyre, each of which gives forth a certain sound of its own which seems unlike the sound of another chord, are thought by a man who is not musical and ignorant of the principle of musical harmony, to be inharmonious, because of the dissimilarity of the sounds, so those who are not skilled in hearing the harmony of God in the sacred Scriptures think that the Old is not in harmony with the New, or the Prophets with the Law, or the Gospels with one another, or the Apostle with the Gospel, or with himself, or with the other Apostles. But he who comes instructed in the music of God, being a man wise in word and deed, and, on this account, like another David-which is, by interpretation, skilful with the hand-will bring out the sound of the music of God, having learned from this at the right time to strike the chords, now the chords of the Law, now the Gospel chords in harmony with them, and again the Prophetic chords, and, when reason demands it, the Apostolic chords which are in harmony with the Prophetic, and likewise the Apostolic with those of the Gospels. For he knows that all the Scripture is the one perfect and harmonised[fn-72-P7270_1472628:6-nf] instrument of God, which from different sounds gives forth one saving voice to those willing to learn, which stops and restrains every working of an evil spirit, just as the music of David laid to rest the evil spirit in Saul, which also was choking him.[fn-72-P7271_1472898:7-nf] You see, then, that he is in the third place a peacemaker, who sees in accordance with the Scripture the peace of it all, and implants this peace in those who rightly seek and make nice distinctions in a genuine spirit.
