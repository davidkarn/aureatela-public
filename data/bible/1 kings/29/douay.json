{"verses":["Now all the troops of the Philistines were gathered together to\nAphec:  and Israel also encamped by the fountain, which is in Jezrahel.","And the lords of the Philistines marched with their hundreds and\ntheir thousands:  but David and his men were in the rear with Achis.","And the princes of the Philistines said to Achis:  What mean these\nHebrews?  And Achis said to the princes of the Philistines:  Do you not\nknow David who was the servant of Saul, the king of Israel, and hath\nbeen with me many days, or years, and I have found no fault in him,\nsince the day that he fled over to me until this day?","But the prices of the Philistines were angry with him, and they\nsaid to him:  Let this man return, and abide in his place, which thou\nhast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest he\nbe an adversary to us, when we shall begin to fight:  for how can he\notherwise appease his master, but with our heads?","Is not this David, to whom they sung in their dances, saying:\nSaul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?","Then Achis called David, and said to him:  As the Lord liveth,\nthou art upright and good in my sight:  and so is thy going out, and thy\ncoming in with me in the army:  and I have not found any evil in thee,\nsince the day that thou camest to me unto this day:  but thou pleasest\nnot the lords.","Return therefore, and go in peace, and offend not the eyes of the\nprinces of the Philistines.","And David said to Achis:  But what have I done, or what hast thou\nfound in me thy servant, from the day that I have been in thy sight\nuntil this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my\nlord the king?","And Achis answering, said to David:  I know that thou art good in\nmy sight, as an angel of God:  But the princes of the Philistines have\nsaid:  He shall not go up with us to the battle.","Therefore arise in the morning, thou, and the servants of thy\nlord, who came with thee:  and when you are up before day, and it shall\nbegin to be light, go on your way.","So David and his men arose in the night, that they might set\nforward in the morning, and returned to the land of the Philistines:\nand the Philistines went up to Jezrahel."]}
