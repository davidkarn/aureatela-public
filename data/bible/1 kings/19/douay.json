{"verses":["And Saul spoke to Jonathan, his son, and to all his servants,\nthat they should kill David.  But Jonathan, the son of Saul, loved David\nexceedingly.","And Jonathan told David, saying:  Saul, my father, seeketh to kill\nthee:  wherefore look to thyself, I beseech thee, in the morning and\nthou shalt abide in a secret place, and shalt be hid.","And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where\nthou art:  and I will speak of thee to my father, and whatsoever I shall\nsee, I will tell thee.","And Jonathan spoke good things of David to Saul, his father:  and\nsaid to him:  Sin not, O king, against thy servant, David, because he\nhath not sinned against thee, and his works are very good towards thee.","And he put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the\nLord wrought great salvation for all Israel.  Thou sawest it and didst\nrejoice.  Why therefore wilt thou sin against innocent blood, by killing\nDavid, who is without fault?","And when Saul heard this, he was appeased with the words of\nJonathan, and swore:  As the Lord liveth, he shall not be slain.","Then Jonathan called David, and told him all these words:  and\nJonathan brought in David to Saul, and he was before him, as he had\nbeen yesterday and the day before.","And the war began again, and David went out, and fought against\nthe Philistines, and defeated them with a great slaughter, and they\nfled from his face.","And the evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul; and he sat in\nhis house, and held a spear in his hand:  and David played with his\nhand.","And Saul endeavoured to nail David to the wall with his spear.\nAnd David slipt away out of the presence of Saul:  and the spear missed\nhim, and was fastened in the wall, and David fled, and escaped that\nnight.","Saul therefore sent his guards to David's house to watch him,\nthat he might be killed in the morning.  And when Michol, David's wife,\nhad told him this, saying:  Unless thou save thyself this night, to\nmorrow thou wilt die:","She let him down through a window.  And he went and fled away,\nand escaped.","And Michol took an image, and laid it on the bed, and put a\ngoat's skin, with the hair at the head of it, and covered it with\nclothes.","And Saul sent officers to seize David; and it was answered that\nhe was sick.","And again Saul sent to see David, saying:  Bring him to me in the\nbed, that he may be slain.","And when the messengers were come in, they found an image upon\nthe bed, and a goat skin at his head.","And Saul said to Michol:  Why hast thou deceived me so, and let\nmy enemy go and flee away?  And Michol answered Saul:  Because he said to\nme:  Let me go, or else I will kill thee.","But David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel in Ramatha, and\ntold him all that Saul had done to him:  and he and Samuel went and\ndwelt in Najoth.","And it was told Saul by some, saying:  Behold David is in Najoth,\nin Ramatha.","So Saul sent officers to take David:  and when they saw a company\nof prophets prophesying, and Samuel presiding over them, the Spirit of\nthe Lord came also upon them, and they likewise began to prophesy.","And when this was told Saul, he sent other messengers:  but they\nalso prophesied.  And again Saul sent messengers the third time:  and\nthey prophesied also.  And Saul being exceeding angry,","Went also himself to Ramatha, and came as far as the great\ncistern, which is in Socho, and he asked, and said:  In what place are\nSamuel and David?  And it was told him:  Behold they are in Najoth, in\nRamatha.","And he went to Najoth, in Ramatha, and the Spirit of the Lord\ncame upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied till he came to\nNajoth, in Ramatha.","And he stripped himself also of his garments, and prophesied\nwith the rest before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and night.\nThis gave occasion to a proverb:  What! is Saul too among the prophets?"]}
