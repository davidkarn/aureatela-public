{"verses":["Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother:  to\nPhilemon, our beloved and fellow labourer,","And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow\nsoldier, and to the church which is in thy house.","Grace to you and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord\nJesus Christ.","I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my\nprayers.","Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord\nJesus and towards all the saints:","That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the\nacknowledgment of every good work that is in you in Christ Jesus.","For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because\nthe bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.","Wherefore, though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus to\ncommand thee that which is to the purpose:","For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as\nPaul, an old man and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.","I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands,\nOnesimus,","Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee but now is\nprofitable both to me and thee:","Whom I have sent back to thee.  And do thou receive him as my own\nbowels.","Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might\nhave ministered to me in the bands of the gospel.","But without thy counsel I would do nothing:  that thy good deed\nmight not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.","For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee that\nthou mightest receive him again for ever:","Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear\nbrother, especially to me.  But how much more to thee, both in the flesh\nand in the Lord?","If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.","And if he hath wronged thee in any thing or is in thy debt, put\nthat to my account.","I Paul have written it with my own hand:  I will repay it:  not to\nsay to thee that thou owest me thy own self also.","Yea, brother.  May I enjoy thee in the Lord!  Refresh my bowels in\nthe Lord.","Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee:  knowing that\nthou wilt also do more than I say.","But withal prepare me also a lodging.  For I hope that through\nyour prayers I shall be given unto you.","There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus:","Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow labourers.","The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Amen."]}
