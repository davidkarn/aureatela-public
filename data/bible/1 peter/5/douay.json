{"verses":["The ancients therefore that are among you, I beseech who am myself\nalso an ancient and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as also a\npartaker of that glory which is to be revealed in time to come:","Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking care of it, not\nby constraint but willingly, according to God:  not for filthy lucre's\nsake but voluntarily:","Neither as lording it over the clergy but being made a pattern of\nthe flock from the heart.","And when the prince of pastors shall appear, you shall receive a\nnever fading crown of glory.","In like manner, ye young men, be subject to the ancients.  And do\nyou all insinuate humility one to another:  for God resisteth the proud,\nbut to the humble he giveth grace.","Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may\nexalt you in the time of visitation:","Casting all your care upon him, for he hath care of you.","Be sober and watch:  because your adversary the devil, as a roaring\nlion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour.","Whom resist ye, strong in faith:  knowing that the same affliction\nbefalls, your brethren who are in the world.","But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal\nglory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little, will himself\nperfect you and confirm you and establish you.","To him be glory and empire, for ever and ever.  Amen.","By Sylvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I think, I have\nwritten briefly:  beseeching and testifying that this is the true grace\nof God, wherein you stand.","The church that is in Babylon, elected together with you,\nsaluteth you.  And so doth my son, Mark.","Salute one another with a holy kiss.  Grace be to all you who are\nin Christ Jesus.  Amen."]}
