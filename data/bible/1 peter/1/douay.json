{"verses":["Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers dispersed\nthrough Pontus, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, elect,","According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, unto the\nsanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the\nblood of Jesus Christ.  Grace unto you and peace be multiplied.","Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who\naccording to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by\nthe resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead:","Unto an inheritance, incorruptible, and undefiled and that cannot\nfade, reserved in heaven for you,","Who, by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation, ready\nto be revealed in the last time.","Wherein you shalt greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little\ntime made sorrowful in divers temptations:","That the trial of your faith (much more precious than gold which\nis tried by the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at\nthe appearing of Jesus Christ.","Whom having not seen, you love:  in whom also now though you see\nhim not, you believe and, believing, shall rejoice with joy unspeakable\nand glorified;","Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.","Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and diligently\nsearched, who prophesied of the grace to come in you.","Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in\nthem did signify, when it foretold those sufferings that are in Christ\nand the glories that should follow.","To whom it was revealed that, not to themselves but to you, they\nministered those things which are now declared to you by them that have\npreached the gospel to you:  the Holy Ghost being sent down from heaven,\non whom the angels desire to look.","Wherefore, having the loins of your mind girt up, being sober,\ntrust perfectly in the grace which is offered you in the revelation of\nJesus Christ.","As children of obedience, not fashioned according to the former\ndesires of your ignorance,","But according to him that hath called you, who is holy, be you\nalso in all manner of conversation holy:","Because it is written:  You shall be holy, for I am holy.","And if you invoke as Father him who, without respect of persons,\njudgeth according to every one's work:  converse in fear during the time\nof your sojourning here.","Knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as\ngold or silver, from your vain conversation of the tradition of your\nfathers:","But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and\nundefiled","Foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but\nmanifested in the last times for you:","Who through him are faithful in God who raised him up from the\ndead and hath given him glory, that your faith and hope might be in\nGod.","Purifying your souls in the obedience of charity, with a\nbrotherly love, from a sincere heart love one another earnestly:","Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by\nthe word of God who liveth and remaineth for ever.","For all flesh is as grass and all the glory thereof as the flower\nof grass.  The grass is withered and the flower thereof is fallen away.","But the word of the Lord endureth for ever.  And this is the word\nwhich by the gospel hath been preached unto you."]}
