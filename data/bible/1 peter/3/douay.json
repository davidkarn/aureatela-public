{"verses":["In like manner also, let wives be subject to their husbands:  that,\nif any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the\nconversation of the wives,","Considering your chaste conversation with fear.","Whose adorning, let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or\nthe wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel:","But the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptibility of a\nquiet and a meek spirit which is rich in the sight of God.","For after this manner heretofore, the holy women also who trusted\nin God adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:","As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord:  whose daughters you are,\ndoing well and not fearing any disturbance.","Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge,\ngiving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel and as to the\nco-heirs of the grace of life:  that your prayers be not hindered.","And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of\nanother, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble:","Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but\ncontrariwise, blessing:  for unto this are you called, that you may\ninherit a blessing.","For he that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his\ntongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.","Let him decline from evil and do good:  Let him seek after peace\nand pursue it:","Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto\ntheir prayers but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil\nthings.","And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good?","But if also you suffer any thing for justice' sake, blessed are\nye.
