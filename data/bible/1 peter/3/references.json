So much also does Scripture testify, according to the words which we already quoted. For wherein does their opinion, who designate baptism by the term salvation, differ from what is written: \"He saved us by the washing of regeneration?\"[fn-4-P481_383676:105-nf] or from Peter's statement: \"The like figure where-unto even baptism doth also now save us?\"[fn-4-P482_383788:106-nf] And what else do they say who call the sacrament of the Lord's Supper life, than that which is written: \"I am the living bread which came down from heaven;\"[fn-4-P483_383968:107-nf] and \"The bread that I shall give is my flesh, for the life of the world ;\"[fn-4-P484_384063:108-nf] and \"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye shall have no life in you?\"[fn-4-P485_384183:109-nf] If, therefore, as so many and such divine witnesses agree, neither salvation nor eternal life can be hoped for by any man without baptism and the Lord's body and blood, it is vain to promise these blessings to infants without them. Moreover, if it be only sins that separate man from salvation and eternal life, there is nothing else in infants which these sacraments can be the means of removing, but the guilt of sin,-respecting which guilty nature it is written, that \"no one is clean, not even if his life be only that of a day.\"[fn-4-P486_384737:110-nf] Whence also that exclamation of the Psalmist: \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me!\"[fn-4-P487_384876:111-nf] This is either said in the person of our common humanity, or if of himself only David speaks, it does not imply that he was born of fornication, but in lawful wedlock. We therefore ought not to doubt that even for infants yet to be baptized was that precious blood shed, which previous to its actual effusion was so given, and applied in the sacrament, that it was said, \"This is my blood, which shall be shed for many for the remission of sins.\"[fn-4-P488_385341:112-nf] Now they who will not allow that they are under sin, deny that there is any liberation.

For this cause the Lord, who is the Dispenser of our life, gave us the covenant of baptism, containing a type of life and death, for the water fulfils the image of death, and the Spirit gives us the earnest of life.

Furthermore, from this too may be apprehended the difference between the grace that comes from the Spirit and the baptism by water: in that John indeed baptized with water, but our Lord Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost. \"I indeed,\" he says, \"baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\"[fn-15-P1545_378945:318-nf] Here He calls the trial at the judgment the baptism of fire, as the apostle says, \"The fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is.\"[fn-15-P1546_379109:319-nf] And again, \"The day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire.\"[fn-15-P1547_379206:320-nf] And ere now there have been some who in their championship of true religion have undergone the death for Christ's sake, not in mere similitude, but in actual fact, and so have needed none of the outward signs of water for their salvation, because they were baptized in their own blood.[fn-15-P1548_379514:321-nf] Thus I write not to disparage the baptism by water, but to overthrow the arguments[fn-15-P1549_379620:322-nf] of those who exalt themselves against the Spirit; who confound things that are distinct from one another, and compare those which admit of no comparison.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":3,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"187","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"72. There is the famous Irenaeus,[fn-19-P1913_512764:606-nf] and Clement of Rome;[fn-19-P1914_512805:607-nf] Dionysius of Rome,[fn-19-P1915_513091:608-nf] and, strange to say, Dionysius of Alexandria, in his second Letter to his namesake, on \"Conviction and Defence,\" so concludes. I will give you his very words. \"Following all these, we, too, since we have received from the presbyters who were before us a form and rule, offering thanksgiving in the same terms with them, thus conclude our Letter to you. To God the Father and the Son our Lord Jesus Christ, with the Holy Ghost, glory and might for ever and ever; amen.\" And no one can say that this passage has been altered. He would not have so persistently stated that he had received a form and rule if he had said \"in the Spirit.\" For of this phrase the use is abundant: it was the use of \"with\" which required defence. Dionysius moreover in the middle of his treatise thus writes in opposition to the Sabellians, \"If by the hypostases being three they say that they are divided, there are three, though they like it not. Else let them destroy the divine Trinity altogether.\" And again: \"most divine on this account after the Unity is the Trinity.\"[fn-19-P1916_514160:609-nf] Clement, in more primitive fashion, writes, \"God lives, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-19-P1917_514278:610-nf] And now let us bear how Irenaeus, who lived near the times of the Apostles, mentions the Spirit in his work \"Against the Heresies.\"[fn-19-P1918_514424:611-nf] \"The Apostle rightly calls carnal them that are unbridled and carried away to their own desires, having no desire for the Holy Spirit,\"[fn-19-P1919_515132:612-nf] and in another passage Irenaeus says, \"The Apostle exclaimed that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of the heavens lest we, being without share in the divine Spirit, fall short of the kingdom of the heavens.\" If any one thinks Eusebius of Palestine[fn-19-P1920_515471:613-nf] worthy of credit on account of his wide experience, I point further to the very words he uses in discussing questions concerning the polygamy of the ancients. Stirring up himself to his work, he writes \"invoking the holy God of the Prophets, the Author of light, through our Saviour Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit.\"73. Origen, too, in many of his expositions of the Psalms, we find using the form of doxology \"with the Holy Ghost. The opinions which he held concerning the Spirit were not always and everywhere sound; nevertheless in many passages even he himself reverently recognises the force of established usage, and expresses himself concerning the Spirit in terms consistent with true religion. It is, if I am not mistaken, in the Sixth[fn-19-P1921_516605:614-nf] Book of his Commentary on the Gospel of St. John that he distinctly makes the Spirit an object of worship. His words are:-\"The washing or water is a symbol of the cleaning of the soul which is washed clean of all filth that comes of wickedness;[fn-19-P1922_516914:615-nf] but none the less is it also by itself, to him who yields himself to the God-head of the adorable Trinity, through the power of the invocations, the origin and source of blessings.\" And again, in his Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans \"the holy powers,\" he says\"are able to receive the Only-begotten, and the Godhead of the Holy Spirit.\" Thus I apprehend, the powerful influence of traditionfrequently impels men to express themselves in terms contradictory to their own opinions.[fn-19-P1923_517703:616-nf] Moreover this form of the doxology was not unknowneven to Africanus the historian. In the Fifth Book of his Epitome of the Times he says \"we who know the weight of those terms, and are not ignorant of the grace of faith, render thanks to the Father, who bestowed on us His own creatures, Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world and our Lord, to whom be glory and majesty with the Holy Ghost, for ever.\"[fn-19-P1924_518151:617-nf] The rest of the passages may peradventure be viewed with suspicion; or may really have been altered, and the fact of their having been tampered with will be difficult to detect because the difference consists in a single syllable. Those however which I have quoted at length are out of the reach of any dishonest manipulation, and can easily be verified from the actual works.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":3,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_06_on_the_councils_or_the_faith_of_the_easterns","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"173","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"85. But perhaps on the opposite side it will be said that it ought to meet with disapproval, because an erroneous interpretation is generally put upon it. If such is our fear, we ought to erase the words of the Apostle, There is one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus[fn-9-P900_559324:49-nf] , because Photinus uses this to support his heresy, and refuse to read it because he interprets it mischievously.

We must dispense, too, with the books of Moses, lest the darkness be thought coeval with God who dwells in the unborn light, since in Genesis the day began to be after the night; lest the years of Methuselah extend later than the date of the deluge, and consequently more than eight souls were saved[fn-9-P905_560420:54-nf] lest God hearing the cry of Sodom when the measure of its sins was full should come down as though ignorant of the cry to see if the measure of its sins was full according to the cry, and be found to be ignorant of what He knew; lest any one of those who buried Moses should have known his sepulchre when he was buried; lest these passages, as the heretics think, should prove that the contradictions of the law make it its own enemy. So as they do not understand them, we ought not to read them. And though I should not have said it myself unless forced by the argument, we must, if it seems fit, abolish all the divine and holy Gospels with their message of our salvation, lest their statements be found inconsistent; lest we should read that the Lord who was to send the Holy Spirit was Himself born of the Holy Spirit; lest He who was to threaten death by the sword to those who should take the sword, should before His passion command that a sword should be brought; lest He who was about to descend into hell should say that He would be in paradise with the thief; lest finally the Apostles should be found at fault, in that when commanded to baptize in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, they baptized in the name of Jesus only. I speak to ton, brethren, to you, who are no longer nourished with milk, but with meat, and are strong[fn-9-P906_562291:55-nf] . Shall we, because the wise men of the world have not understood these things, and they are foolish unto them, be wise as the world is wise and believe these things foolish? Because they are hidden from the godless, shall we refuse to shine with the truth of a doctrine which we understand? We prejudice the cause of divine doctrines when we think that they ought not to exist, because some do not regard them as holy. If so, we must not glory in the cross of Christ, because it is a stumbling-block to the world; and we must not preach death in connection with the living God, lest the godless argue that God is dead.","title":"On the Councils, or the Faith of the Easterns","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":3,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_07_the_dialogue_against_the_luciferians","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"84","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"22. Noah's ark was a type of the Church, as the Apostle Peter says-[fn-59-P5947_1751491:86-nf] \"In Noah's ark few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: which also after a true likeness doth now save us, even baptism.\" As in the ark there were all kinds of animals, so also in the Church there are men of all races and characters. As in the one there was the leopard with the kids, the wolf with the lambs, so in the other there are found the righteous and sinners, that is,[fn-59-P5948_1751902:87-nf] vessels of gold and silver with those of wood and of earth. The ark had its rooms: the Church has many mansions. Eight souls were saved in Noah's ark. And[fn-59-P5949_1752077:88-nf] Ecclesiastes bids us \"give a portion to seven yea, even unto eight,\" that is to believe both Testaments. This is why some psalms bear the inscription[fn-59-P5950_1752244:89-nf] for the octave, and why the one hundred and nineteenth psalm is divided into portions of eight verses each beginning with its own letter for the instruction of the righteous. The beatitudes which our Lord spoke to his disciples on the mountain, thereby delineating the Church, are eight. And Ezekiel for the building of the temple employs the number eight. And you will find many other things expressed in the same way in the Scriptures. The raven also is sent forth from the ark but does not return, and afterwards the dove announces peace to the earth. So also in the Church's baptism, that most unclean bird the devil is expelled, and the dove of the Holy Spirit announces peace to our earth. The construction of the ark was such that it began with being thirty cubits broad and gradually narrowed to one. Similarly the Church, consisting of many grades, ends in deacons, presbyters, and bishops. The ark was in peril in the flood, the Church is in peril in the world. When Noah left the ark he planted a vineyard, drank thereof, and was drunken. Christ also, born in the flesh, planted the Church and suffered. The elder son made sport of his father's nakedness, the younger covered it: and the Jews mocked God crucified, the Gentiles honoured Him. The daylight would fail me if I were to explain all the mysteries of the ark and compare them with the Church. Who are the eagles amongst us? Who the doves and lions, who the stags, who the worms and serpents? So far as our subject requires I will briefly show you. It is not the sheep only who abide in the Church, nor do clean birds only fly to and fro there; but amid the grain other seed is sown,[fn-59-P5951_1754141:90-nf] \"amidst the neat corn-fields burrs and caltrops and barren oats lord it in the land.\" What is the husbandman to do? Root up the darnel? In that case the whole harvest is destroyed along with it. Every day the farmer diligently drives the birds away with strange noises, or frightens them with scarecrows: here he cracks a whip, there he spreadsout some other object to terrify them. Nevertheless he suffers from the raids of nimble roes or the wantonness of the wild asses; here the mice convey the corn to their garners underground, there the ants crowd thickly in and ravage the corn-field. Thus the case stands. No one who has land is free from care.[fn-59-P5952_1754821:91-nf] While the householder slept the enemy sowed tares among the wheat, and when the servants proposed to go and root them up the master forbade them, reserving for himself the separation of the chaff and the grain.[fn-59-P5953_1755059:92-nf] There are vessels of wrath and of mercy which the Apostle speaks of in the house of God. The day then will come when the storehouses of the Church shall be opened and the Lord will bring forth the vessels of wrath; and, as they depart, the saints will say,[fn-59-P5954_1755378:93-nf] \"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.\" No one can take to himself the prerogative of Christ, no one before the day of judgment can pass judgment upon men.

And in case it were allowable to take wives, would the Apostle direct that only Christian wives, or Gentiles also, should be taken?

But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: And likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife. Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency. But this I say by way of permission not of commandment. Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that. But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.\" Let us turn back to the chief point of the evidence: \"It is good,\" he says, \"for a man not to touch a woman.\" If it is good not to touch a woman, it is bad to touch one: for there is no opposite to goodness but badness. But if it be bad and the evil is pardoned, the reason for the concession is to prevent worse evil. But surely a thing which is only allowed because there may be something worse has only a slight degree of goodness. He would never have added \"let each man have his own wife,\" unless he had previously used the words \"but, because of fornications.\" Do away with fornication, and he will not say \"let each man have his own wife.\" Just as though one were to lay it down: \"It is good to feed on wheaten bread, and to eat the finest wheat flour,\" and yet to prevent a person pressed by hunger from devouring cow-dung, I may allow, him to eat barley. Does it follow that the wheat will not have its peculiar purity, because such an one prefers barley to excrement? That is naturally good which does not admit of comparison with what is bad, and is not eclipsed because something else is preferred. At the same time we must notice the Apostle's prudence. He did not say, it is good not to have a wife: but, it is good not to touch a woman: as though there were danger even in the touch: as though he who touched her, would not escape from her who \"hunteth for the precious life,\" who causeth the young man's understanding to fly away.[fn-61-P6178_1858076:38-nf] \"Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?\" As then he who touches fire is instantly burned, so by the mere touch the peculiar nature of man and woman is perceived, and the difference of sex is understood, Heathen fables relate how[fn-61-P6179_1858426:39-nf] Mithras and[fn-61-P6180_1858584:40-nf] Ericthonius were begotten of the soil, in stone or earth, by raging lust. Hence it was that our Joseph, because the Egyptian woman wished to touch him, fled from her hands, and, as if he had been bitten by a mad dog and feared the spreading poison, threw away the cloak which she had touched. \"But, because of fornications let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.\" He did not say, because of fornication let each man marry a wife: otherwise by this excuse he would have thrown the reins to lust, and whenever a man's wife died, he would have to marry another to prevent fornication, but \"have his own wife.\" Let him he says have and use his own wife, whom he had before he became a believer, and whom it would have been good not to touch, and, when once he became a follower of Christ, to know only as a sister, not as a wife unless fornication should make it excusable to touch her. \"The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.\" The whole question here concerns those who are married men. Is it lawful for them to do what our Lord forbade in the Gospel, and to put away their wives? Whence it is that the Apostle says, \"It is good for a man not to touch a woman.\" But inasmuch as he who is once married has no power to abstain except by mutual consent, and may not reject an unoffending partner, let the husband render unto the wife her due. He bound himself voluntarily that he might be under compulsion to render it. \"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer.\" What, I pray you, is the quality of that good thing which hinders prayer? which does not allow the body of Christ to be received? So long as I do the husband's part, I fail in continency. The same Apostle in another place commands us to pray always. If we are to pray always, it follows that we must never be in the bondage of wedlock, for as often as I render my wife her due, I cannot pray. The Apostle Peter had experience of the bonds of marriage. See how he fashions the Church, and what lesson he teaches Christians:[fn-61-P6181_1860965:41-nf] \"Ye husbands in like manner dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honour unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.\" Observe that, as S. Paul before, because in both cases the spirit is the same, so S. Peter now, says that prayers are hindered by the performance of marriage duty. When he says \"likewise,\" he challenges the husbands to imitate their wives, because he has already given them commandment:[fn-61-P6182_1861498:42-nf] \"beholding your chaste conversation coupled with fear. Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel: but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\" You see what kind of wedlock he enjoins. Husbands and wives are to dwell together according to knowledge, so that they may know what God wishes and desires, and give honour to the weak vessel, woman. If we abstain from intercourse, we give honour to our wives: if we do not abstain, it is clear that insult is the opposite of honour. He also tells the wives to let their husbands \"see their chaste behaviour, and the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit.\" Words truly worthy of an apostle, and of Christ's rock! He lays down the law for husbands and wives, condemns outward ornament, while he praises continence, which is the ornament of the inner man, as seen in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit. In effect he says this: Since your outer man is corrupt, and you have ceased to possess the blessing of incorruption characteristic of virgins, at least imitate the incorruption of the spirit by subsequent abstinence, and what you cannot show in the body exhibit in the mind. For these are the riches, and these the ornaments of your union, which Christ seeks.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"7.

But if it be bad and the evil is pardoned, the reason for the concession is to prevent worse evil. But surely a thing which is only allowed because there may be something worse has only a slight degree of goodness. He would never have added \"let each man have his own wife,\" unless he had previously used the words \"but, because of fornications.\" Do away with fornication, and he will not say \"let each man have his own wife.\" Just as though one were to lay it down: \"It is good to feed on wheaten bread, and to eat the finest wheat flour,\" and yet to prevent a person pressed by hunger from devouring cow-dung, I may allow, him to eat barley. Does it follow that the wheat will not have its peculiar purity, because such an one prefers barley to excrement? That is naturally good which does not admit of comparison with what is bad, and is not eclipsed because something else is preferred. At the same time we must notice the Apostle's prudence. He did not say, it is good not to have a wife: but, it is good not to touch a woman: as though there were danger even in the touch: as though he who touched her, would not escape from her who \"hunteth for the precious life,\" who causeth the young man's understanding to fly away.[fn-61-P6178_1858076:38-nf] \"Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?\" As then he who touches fire is instantly burned, so by the mere touch the peculiar nature of man and woman is perceived, and the difference of sex is understood, Heathen fables relate how[fn-61-P6179_1858426:39-nf] Mithras and[fn-61-P6180_1858584:40-nf] Ericthonius were begotten of the soil, in stone or earth, by raging lust. Hence it was that our Joseph, because the Egyptian woman wished to touch him, fled from her hands, and, as if he had been bitten by a mad dog and feared the spreading poison, threw away the cloak which she had touched. \"But, because of fornications let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.\" He did not say, because of fornication let each man marry a wife: otherwise by this excuse he would have thrown the reins to lust, and whenever a man's wife died, he would have to marry another to prevent fornication, but \"have his own wife.\" Let him he says have and use his own wife, whom he had before he became a believer, and whom it would have been good not to touch, and, when once he became a follower of Christ, to know only as a sister, not as a wife unless fornication should make it excusable to touch her. \"The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.\" The whole question here concerns those who are married men. Is it lawful for them to do what our Lord forbade in the Gospel, and to put away their wives? Whence it is that the Apostle says, \"It is good for a man not to touch a woman.\" But inasmuch as he who is once married has no power to abstain except by mutual consent, and may not reject an unoffending partner, let the husband render unto the wife her due. He bound himself voluntarily that he might be under compulsion to render it. \"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer.\" What, I pray you, is the quality of that good thing which hinders prayer? which does not allow the body of Christ to be received? So long as I do the husband's part, I fail in continency. The same Apostle in another place commands us to pray always. If we are to pray always, it follows that we must never be in the bondage of wedlock, for as often as I render my wife her due, I cannot pray. The Apostle Peter had experience of the bonds of marriage. See how he fashions the Church, and what lesson he teaches Christians:[fn-61-P6181_1860965:41-nf] \"Ye husbands in like manner dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honour unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.\" Observe that, as S. Paul before, because in both cases the spirit is the same, so S. Peter now, says that prayers are hindered by the performance of marriage duty. When he says \"likewise,\" he challenges the husbands to imitate their wives, because he has already given them commandment:[fn-61-P6182_1861498:42-nf] \"beholding your chaste conversation coupled with fear. Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel: but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\" You see what kind of wedlock he enjoins. Husbands and wives are to dwell together according to knowledge, so that they may know what God wishes and desires, and give honour to the weak vessel, woman. If we abstain from intercourse, we give honour to our wives: if we do not abstain, it is clear that insult is the opposite of honour. He also tells the wives to let their husbands \"see their chaste behaviour, and the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit.\" Words truly worthy of an apostle, and of Christ's rock! He lays down the law for husbands and wives, condemns outward ornament, while he praises continence, which is the ornament of the inner man, as seen in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit. In effect he says this: Since your outer man is corrupt, and you have ceased to possess the blessing of incorruption characteristic of virgins, at least imitate the incorruption of the spirit by subsequent abstinence, and what you cannot show in the body exhibit in the mind. For these are the riches, and these the ornaments of your union, which Christ seeks.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8. The words which follow, \"that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again,\" might lead one to suppose that the Apostle was expressing a wish and not making a concession because of the danger of a greater fall. He therefore at once adds, \"lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.\" It is a fine permission which is conveyed in the words \"be together again.\" What it was that he blushed to call by its own name, and thought only better than a temptation of Satan and the effect of incontinence, we take trouble to discuss as if it were obscure, although he has explained his meaning by saying, \"this I say by way of permission, not by way of command.\" And do we still hesitate to speak of marriage as a concession to weakness, not a thing commanded, as though second and third marriages were not allowed on the same ground, as though the doors of the Church were not opened by repentance even to fornicators, and what is more, to the incestuous? Take the case of the man who outraged his step-mother. Does not the Apostle, after delivering him, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that his spirit might be saved, in the second Epistle take the offender back and strive to prevent a brother from being swallowed up by overmuch grief. The Apostle's wish is one thing, his pardon another. If a wish be expressed, it confers a right; if a thing is only called pardonable, we are wrong in using it. If you wish to know the Apostle's real mind, you must take in what follows: \"but I would that all men were as I am.\" Happy is the man who is like Paul! Fortunate is he who attends to the Apostle's command, not to his concession. This, says he, I wish, this I desire that ye be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ, who was a Virgin born of a Virgin, uncorrupt of her who was uncorrupt. We, because we are men, cannot imitate our Lord's nativity; but we may at least imitate His life. The former was the blessed prerogative of divinity, the latter belongs to our human condition and is part of human effort. I would that all men were like me, that while they are like me, they may also become like Christ, to whom I am like. For[fn-61-P6184_1865179:43-nf] \"he that believeth in Christ ought himself also to walk even as He walked.\"[fn-61-P6185_1865274:44-nf] \"Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.\" What I wish, he says, is clear. But since in the Church there is a diversity of gifts, I acquiesce in marriage, lest I should seem to condemn nature. At the same time consider, that the gift of virginity is one, that of marriage, another. For were the reward the same for the married and for virgins, he would never after enjoining continence have said:[fn-61-P6186_1865742:45-nf] \"Each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.\" Where there is a distinction in one particular, there is a diversity also in other points. I grant that even marriage is a gift of God, but between gift and gift there is great diversity. In fact the Apostle himself speaking of the same person who had repented of his incestuous conduct, says:[fn-61-P6187_1866141:46-nf] \"so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, and to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also.\" And that we might not think a man's gift contemptible, he added,[fn-61-P6188_1866352:47-nf] \"for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it, in the presence of Christ.\" There is diversity in the gifts of Christ. Hence it is that by way of type Joseph has a coat of many colours. And in the forty-fifth psalm we read,[fn-61-P6189_1866667:48-nf] \"at thy right hand doth stand the queen in a vesture of gold wrought about with divers colours.\" And the Apostle Peter says,[fn-61-P6190_1866841:49-nf] \"as heirs together of the manifold grace of God,\" where the more expressive Greek word poiki/lhj, i.e., varied, is used.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"17.

Noah, moreover, who was preserved as a kind of second root for the human race, must of course be preserved together with his wife and sons, although in this there is a Scripture mystery. The ark,[fn-62-P6250_1909819:100-nf] according to the Apostle Peter, was a type of the Church, in which eight souls were saved. When Noah entered into it, both he and his sons were separated from their wives; but when he landed from it, they united in pairs, and what had been separated in the ark, that is, in the Church, was joined together in the intercourse of the world. And at the same time if the ark had many compartments and little chambers, and was made with second and third stories, and was filled with different beasts, and was furnished with dwellings, great or small, according to the kind of animal, I think all this diversity in the compartments was a figure of the manifold character of the Church.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Now we must proceed, in the case of the prodigal son, to consider first that which is more useful; for no adjustment of examples, albeit in the most nicely-poised balance, shall be admitted if it shall prove to be most hurtful to salvation.

And first, before I translate and insert in this book the letter which you wrote to Bishop Theophilus, and show you that I understand your excessive care and circumspection, I should like a word of expostulation with you. What is the meaning of this towering arrogance which makes you refuse to reply to those who question you respecting the faith? How is it that you regard almost as public enemies the vast multitude of brethren, and the bands of monks, who refuse to communicate with you in Palestine? The Son of God, for the sake of one sick sheep, leaving the ninety and nine on the mountains, endured the buffering, the cross, the scourge; He took up the burden, and patiently carried on His shoulders to heaven the voluptuous woman that was a sinner. Is it for you to act the \"most reverend father in God,\" the fastidious prelate; to stand apart in your wealth and wisdom, in your grandeur and your learning; to frown superciliously upon your fellow servants, and,. scarce vouchsafe a glance to those who have been redeemed with the blood of your Lord? Is this what you have learnt from the Apostles' precept to be[fn-70-P7017_2274122:13-nf] \"ready always to give answer to ever), man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you\"? Suppose we do, as you pretend, seek occasion, and that, under the pretext of zeal for the faith, we are sowing strife, framing a schism, and fomenting quarrels. Then take away the occasion from those who wish for an occasion; so that having given satisfaction on the point of faith, and solved all the difficulties in which you are involved, you may show clearly to all that the dispute is not one of doctrine, but of[fn-70-P7018_2274666:14-nf] order. But perhaps when questioned concerning the faith, you say that it is from wise forethought that you hold your tongue, so that it may not be said that you have proved yourself a heretic-in as much as you make satisfaction to your accusers. If that be so, then men ought not to refute any charges of which they are accused, lest, having denied them, they may be held to be guilty. The accusations of the laity, deacons, and presbyters, are, I suppose, beneath your notice. For yon can, as you are perpetually boasting, make a thousand clerics in an hour. But you have to answer Epiphanius, our father in God, who, in the letters which he sent, openly calls you a heretic. Certainly you are not his superior in respect of years, of learning, of his exemplary life, or of the judgment of the whole world. If it is a question of age, you are a young man writing to an old one. If it is one of knowledge, you are a person not so very accomplished writing to a learned man, although your partisans maintain that you are a more finished speaker than Demosthenes, more sharp-witted than Chrysippus, wiser than Plato, and perhaps have persuaded you that they are right. As regards his life and devotion to the faith, I will say no more, that I may not seem to be seeking to wound you. At the time when the whole East (except our fathers in God Athanasius and Paulinus) was overrun by the Arian and Eunomian heresies; when you did not hold communion with the Westerns; then, in the very worst of the exile which made them confessors, he, though a simple convent priest, gained the ear of Eutychius, and afterwards as bishop of Cyprus was unmolested by Valens. For he was always so highly venerated that heretics on the throne thought it would redound to their own disgrace if they persecuted such a man. Write therefore to him. Answer his letter. So let the rest understand your purpose and judge of your eloquence and wisdom; do not keep all your accomplishments to yourself. Why, when you are challenged, in one quarter, do you turn your arms towards another? A question is put to you in Palestine, your answer is given in Egypt. When some are blear-eyed, you anoint the eyes of others who are not affected. If you tell another what is meant to give us satisfaction, such action springs entirely from pride; if you tell him what we do not ask for, it is entirely uncalled for.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":57,"source_paragraph":"177","folder":"ANF-03","text":"By ourselves the lower regions (of Hades) are not supposed to be a bare cavity, nor some subterranean sewer of the world, but a vast deep space in the interior of the earth, and a concealed recess in its very bowels; inasmuch as we read that Christ in His death spent three days in the heart of the earth,[fn-30-P3043_1098549:310-nf] that is, in the secret inner recess which is hidden in the earth, and enclosed by the earth, and superimposed on the abysmal depths which lie still lower down.

But it was for this purpose, say they, that Christ descended into hell, that we might not ourselves have to descend thither. Well, then, what difference is there between heathens and Christians, if the same prison awaits them all when dead? How, indeed, shall the soul mount up to heaven, where Christ is already sitting at the Father's right hand, when as yet the archangel's trumpet has not been heard by the command of God,[fn-30-P3049_1100127:316-nf] -when as yet those whom the coming of the Lord is to find on the earth, have not been caught up into the air to meet Him at His coming,[fn-30-P3050_1100305:317-nf] in company with the dead in Christ, who shall be the first to arise?[fn-30-P3051_1100398:318-nf] To no one is heaven opened; the earth is still safe for him, I would not say it is shut against him. When the world, indeed, shall pass away, then the kingdom of heaven shall be opened. Shall we then have to sleep high up in ether, with the boy-loving worthies of Plato; or in the air with Arius; or around the moon with the Endymions of the Stoics? No, but in Paradise, you tell me, whither already the patriarchs and prophets have removed from Hades in the retinue of the Lord's resurrection. How is it, then, that the region of Paradise, which as revealed to John in the Spirit lay under the altar,[fn-30-P3052_1101016:319-nf] displays no other souls as in it besides the souls of the martyrs? How is it that the most heroic martyr Perpetua on the day of her passion saw only her fellow-martyrs there, in the revelation which she received of Paradise, if it were not that the sword which guarded the entrance permitted none to go in thereat, except those who had died in Christ and not in Adam? A new death for God, even the extraordinary one for Christ, is admitted into the reception-room of mortality, specially altered and adapted to receive the new-comer. Observe, then, the difference between a heathen and a Christian in their death: if you have to lay down your life for God, as the Comforter[fn-30-P3053_1101709:320-nf] counsels, it is not in gentle fevers and on soft beds, but in the sharp pains of martyrdom: you must take up the cross and bear it after your Master, as He has Himself instructed you.[fn-30-P3054_1101912:321-nf] The sole key to unlock Paradise is your own life's blood.[fn-30-P3055_1101992:322-nf] You have a treatise by us,[fn-30-P3056_1102130:323-nf] (on Paradise), in which we have established the position that every soul is detained in safe keeping in Hades until the day of the Lord.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_112_treatise_ii_on_the_dress_of_virgins_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"ANF-05","text":"8.

For she is holy, alike in body and in spirit, who sins neither in mind nor heart, knowing that God is one who examines also the heart; and, therefore, she takes every pains to possess a mind as well as a body free from sin. Such a person is aware that it is written, \"Keep thy[fn-8-P802_322021:38-nf] heart with all diligence\"; and again, \"God loveth[fn-8-P803_322099:39-nf] holy hearts, and all the undefiled are acceptable to him\"; and elsewhere, \"Blessed[fn-8-P804_322199:40-nf] are those of a pure heart; for they shall see God.\" I think that this last statement is made regarding those whom conscience accuses of the guilt of no sin; concerning whom I think that John also spoke in his Epistle when he said, \"If our heart[fn-8-P805_322465:41-nf] condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God, and whatsoever we ask we shall receive from him.\" I do not wish you to think that you have escaped the accusation of sin, although act does not follow desire, since it is written, \"Whosoever[fn-8-P806_322727:42-nf] looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.\" And do not say, \"I had the thought, indeed, but I did not carry it out in act\"; for it is unlawful even to desire that which it is unlawful to do. Wherefore also blessed Peter issues a precept to this effect: \"purify your[fn-8-P807_323062:43-nf] souls\"; and if he had not been aware of such a thing as defilement of the soul, he would not have expressed a desire that it should be purified. But we should also very carefully consider that passage which says, \"These[fn-8-P808_323301:44-nf] are they who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins, and they follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth\"; and should reflect whether, if these are joined to the Divine retinue, and traverse all the regions of the heavens, through the merit of chastity and purity alone, there may be also other means by which virginity being assisted may attain to the glory of so great blessedness. But whence shall we be able to know this?From the following passages (if I mistake not) in which it is written, \"These were[fn-8-P809_323851:45-nf] purchased from among men as the first fruits to God and the Lamb, and in their mouth there was found no falsehood, for they are without spot before the throne of God.\" You see, then, that they are spoken of as closely following in the footsteps of the Lord, not in virtue of one member only, but those are said to do so, who, besides virginity, had passed a life freed from all the pollution of sin. Wherefore, let the virgin especially despise marriage on this account, that, while she is safer than others, she may the more easily accomplish what is also required from those who are married; viz. keep herself from all sin, and obey all the commandments of the law. For if she does not marry, and nevertheless indulges in those things from which even married women are enjoined to keep themselves free, what will it profit her not to have married?For although it is not allowed to any Christian to commit sin, and it befits all without exception who are purified through the sanctification of the spiritual bath, to lead an unstained life, that they may be thoroughly identified[fn-8-P810_324960:46-nf] with the Church, which is described as being \"without[fn-8-P811_325031:47-nf] spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,\" much more is it requisite that a virgin should reach this standard, whom neither the existence of a husband, nor of sons, nor of any other necessity, prevents from fully carrying out the demands of holy Scripture; nor shall she be able, if she fail, to defend herself by any sort of excuse.","title":"Letter II.

Now I confess the reason of this is hidden from me; only I think that even those men, to whom certainly the Holy Spirit revealed those things which ought to be held as of religious authority, might write some things as men by historical diligence, and others as prophets by divine inspiration; and these things were so distinct, that it was judged that the former should be ascribed to themselves, but the latter to God speaking through them: and so the one pertained to the abundance of knowledge, the other to the authority of religion. In that authority the canon is guarded. So that, if any writings outside of it are now brought forward under the name of the ancient prophets, they cannot serve even as an aid to knowledge, because it is uncertain whether they are genuine; and on this account they are not trusted, especially those of them in which some things are found that are even contrary to the truth of the canonical books, so that it is quite apparent they do not belong to them.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_20_dialogue_ii_the_unconfounded_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"215","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Orth.-Why not then teach the faithful the reality of the doctrine?

But if any woman had so acted, what feeling but that of a disgraceful concupiscence could impel her to have more husbands, seeing that by such licence she could not have more children? That the good purpose of marriage, however, is better promoted by one husband with one wife, than by a husband with several wives, is shown plainly enough by the very first union of a married pair, which was made by the Divine Being Himself, with the intention of marriages taking their beginning therefrom, and of its affording to them a more honourable precedent. In the advance, however, of the human race, it came to pass that to certain good men were united a plurality of good wives,-many to each; and from this it would seem that moderation sought rather unity on one side for dignity, while nature permitted plurality on the other side for fecundity. For on natural principles it is more feasible for one to have dominion over many, than for many to have dominion over one. Nor can it be doubted, that it is more consonant with the order of nature that men should bear rule over women, than women over men. It is with this principle in view that the apostle says, \"The head of the woman is the man;\"[fn-38-P3881_1472966:28-nf] and, \"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands.\"[fn-38-P3882_1473041:29-nf] So also the Apostle Peter writes: \"Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord.\"[fn-38-P3883_1473144:30-nf] Now, although the fact of the matter is, that while nature loves singleness in her dominations, but we may see plurality existing more readily in the subordinate portion of our race; yet for all that, it was at no time lawful for one man to have a plurality of wives, except for the purpose of a greater number of children springing from him.

But this is not so, far be the thought. For he `takes hold of the seed of Abraham[fn-100-P10041_3593934:12-nf] ,' as the apostle said; whence it behoved Him to be made like His brethren in all things, and to take a Body like us. This is why Mary is truly presupposed, in order that He may take it from her, and offer it for us as His own. And this Isaiah pointed to in his prophecy, in the words: `Behold the Virgin[fn-100-P10042_3594257:13-nf] ,' while Gabriel is sent to her-not simply to a virgin, but `to a virgin betrothed to a man[fn-100-P10043_3594368:14-nf] ,' in order that by means of the betrothed man he might shew that Mary was really a human being. And for this reason Scripture also mentions her bringing forth, and tells of her wrapping Him in swaddling clothes; and therefore, too, the paps which He sucked were called blessed[fn-100-P10044_3594663:15-nf] . And He was offered as a sacrifice, in that He Who was born had opened the womb[fn-100-P10045_3594761:16-nf] . Now all these things are proofs that the Virgin brought forth. And Gabriel preached the Gospel to her without uncertainty, saying not merely `what is born in thee,' lest the body should be thought to be extraneously induced upon her, but `of thee,' that what was born might be believed to be naturally from her, inasmuch as Nature clearly shews that it is impossible for a virgin to produce milk unless she has brought forth, and impossible for a body to be nourished with milk and wrapped in swaddling clothes unless it has previously been naturally brought forth. This is the meaning of His being circumcised on the eighth day: of Symeon taking Him in his arms, of His becoming a young child, and growing when He was twelve years old, and of His coming to His thirtieth year. For it was not, as some suppose, the very Essence of the Word that was changed, and was circumcised, because it is incapable of alteration or change.

Lastly, as regards Faustus' crafty insinuation, that the Old Testament misrepresents God as threatening to come with a sword which will spare neither the righteous nor the wicked, if the words were explained to the Pagan, he would perhaps disagree neither with the Old Testament nor with the New; and he might see the beauty of the parable in the Gospel, which people who pretend to be Christians either misunderstand from their blindness, or reject from their perversity. The great husbandman of the vine uses his pruning-hook differently in the fruitful and in the unfruitful branches; yet he spares neither good nor bad, pruning one and cutting off the other.[fn-20-P2079_1220162:41-nf] There is no man so just as not to require to be tried by affliction to advance, or to establish, or to prove his virtue. Do the Manichaeans not reckon Paul as righteous, who, while confessing humbly and honestly his past sins, still gives thanks for being justified by faith in Jesus Christ? Was Paul then spared by Him whom fools misunderstand, when He says, \"I will spare neither the righteous nor the sinner\"? Hear the apostle himself: \"Lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelation, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me. For this I besought the Lord thrice, that He would remove it from me; and He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for strength is perfected in weakness.\"[fn-20-P2080_1220937:42-nf] Here a just man is not spared that his strength might be perfected in weakness by Him who had given him an angel of Satan to buffet him. If you say that the devil gave this angel, it follows that the devil sought to prevent Paul's being exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelation, and to perfect his strength. This is impossible. Therefore He who gave up this righteous man to be buffeted by the messenger of Satan, is the same as He who, through Paul, gave up to Satan himself the wicked persons of whom Paul says: \"I have delivered them to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.\"[fn-20-P2081_1221561:43-nf] Do you see now how the Most High spares neither the righteous nor the wicked? Or is it the sword that frightens you? For to be buffeted is not so bad as to be put to death. But did not the thousands of martyrs suffer death in various forms? And could their persecutors have had this power against them except it had been given them by God, who thus spared neither the righteous nor the wicked? For the Lord Himself, the chief martyr, says expressly to Pilate: \"Thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.\"[fn-20-P2082_1222126:44-nf] Paul also, besides recording his own experience, says that the afflictions and persecutions of the righteous exhibit the judgment of God.[fn-20-P2083_1222283:45-nf] This truth is set forth at length by the Apostle Peter in the passage already quoted, where he says: \"It is time that judgment should begin at the house of the Lord. And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of those that believe not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely are saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?\"[fn-20-P2084_1222654:46-nf] Peter also explains how the wicked are not spared, for they are branches broken off to be burnt; while the righteous are not spared, because their purification is to be brought to perfection. He ascribes these things to the will of Him who says in the Old Testament, I will spare neither the righteous nor the wicked; for he says: \"It is better, if the will of the Spirit of God be so, that we suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.\"[fn-20-P2085_1223116:47-nf] So, when by the will of the Spirit of God men suffer for well-doing, the righteous are not spared; when they suffer for evil-doing, the wicked are not spared. In both cases it is according to the will of Him who says: I will spare neither the righteous nor the wicked; correcting the one as a son, and punishing the other as a transgressor.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":50,"source_paragraph":"163","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But \"flesh and blood,\" you say, \"cannot inherit the kingdom of God.\"[fn-101-P10162_2833899:339-nf] We are quite aware that this too is written; but although our opponents place it in the front of the battle, we have intentionally reserved the objection until now, in order that we may in our last assault overthrow it, after we have removed out of the way all the questions which are auxiliary to it. However, they must contrive to recall to their mind even now our preceding arguments, in order that the occasion which originally suggested this passage may assist our judgment in arriving at its meaning. The apostle, as I take it, having set forth for the Corinthians the details of their church discipline, had summed up the substance of his own gospel, and of their belief in an exposition of the Lord's death and resurrection, for the purpose of deducing therefrom the rule of our hope, and the groundwork thereof. Accordingly he subjoins this statement: \"Now if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain, because ye are yet in your sins, and they which have fallen asleep in Christ are perished.\"[fn-101-P10163_2835410:340-nf] Now, what is the point which he evidently labours hard to make us believe throughout this passage? The resurrection of the dead, you say, which was denied: he certainly wished it to be believed on the strength of the example which he adduced-the Lord's resurrection. Certainly, you say. Well now, is an example borrowed from different circumstances, or from like ones? From like ones, by all means, is your answer. How then did Christ rise again? In the flesh, or not? No doubt, since you are told that He \"died according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-101-P10164_2835977:341-nf] and \"that He was buried according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-101-P10165_2836046:342-nf] no otherwise than in the flesh, you will also allow that it was in the flesh that He was raised from the dead. For the very same body which fell in death, and which lay in the sepulchre, did also rise again; (and it was) not so much Christ in the flesh, as the flesh in Christ. If, therefore, we are to rise again after the example of Christ, who rose in the flesh, we shall certainly not rise according to that example, unless we also shall ourselves rise again in the flesh. \"For,\" he says, \"since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-101-P10166_2836628:343-nf] (This he says) in order, on the one hand, to distinguish the two authors-Adam of death, Christ of resurrection; and, on the other hand, to make the resurrection operate on the same substance as the death, by comparing the authors themselves under the designation man. For if \"as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive,\"[fn-101-P10167_2836984:344-nf] their vivification in Christ must be in the flesh, since it is in the flesh that arises their death in Adam. \"But every man in his own order,\"[fn-101-P10168_2837149:345-nf] because of course it will be also every man in his own body. For the order will be arranged severally, on account of the individual merits. Now, as the merits must be ascribed to the body, it must needs follow that the order also should be arranged in respect of the bodies, that it may be in relation to their merits. But inasmuch as \"some are also baptized for the dead,\"[fn-101-P10169_2837539:346-nf] we will see whether there be a good reason for this. Now it is certain that they adopted this (practice) with such a presumption as made them suppose that the vicarious baptism (in question) would be beneficial to the flesh of another in anticipation of the resurrection; for unless it were a bodily resurrection, there would be no pledge secured by this process of a corporeal baptism. \"Why are they then baptized for the dead,\"[fn-101-P10170_2837986:347-nf] he asks, unless the bodies rise again which are thus baptized? For it is not the soul which is sanctified by the baptismal bath:[fn-101-P10171_2838131:348-nf] its sanctification comes from the \"answer.\"[fn-101-P10172_2838193:349-nf] \"And why,\" he inquires, \"stand we in jeopardy every hour? \"[fn-101-P10173_2838282:350-nf] -meaning, of course, through the flesh. \"I die daily,\"[fn-101-P10174_2838359:351-nf] (says he); that is, undoubtedly, in the perils of the body, in which \"he even fought with beasts at Ephesus,\"[fn-101-P10175_2838485:352-nf] -even with those beasts which caused him such peril and trouble in Asia, to which he alludes in his second epistle to the same church of Corinth: \"For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed above measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life.\"[fn-101-P10176_2838829:353-nf] Now, if I mistake not, he enumerates all these particulars in order that in his unwillingness to have his conflicts in the flesh supposed to be useless, he may induce an unfaltering belief in the resurrection of the flesh. For useless must that conflict be deemed (which is sustained in a body) for which no resurrection is in prospect. \"But some man will say, How are the dead to be raised? And with what body will they come? \"[fn-101-P10177_2839278:354-nf] Now here he discusses the qualities of bodies, whether it be the very same, or different ones, which men are to resume.

Mark's account of John's preaching agrees with the other. The words are, \"There cometh after me He that is mightier than I,\" which amounts to the same thing as \"He that cometh after me is mightier than I.\" There is a difference, however, in what follows, \"The latchets of His shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.\" For it is one thing to bear a person's shoes,-they must, it is evident, have been untied already from the feet of the wearer,-and it is another thing to stoop down and untie the latchet of his shoes. And it follows, since believers cannot think that either of the Evangelists made any mistake or misrepresentation, that the Baptist must have made these two utterances at different times and have meant them to express different things. It is not the case, as some suppose. that the reports refer to the same incident and turned out differently because of a loose-ness of memory as to some of the facts or words. Now it is a great thing to bear the shoes of Jesus, a great thing to stoop down to the bodily features of His mission, to that which took place in some lower region, so as to contemplate His image in the lower sphere, and to untie each difficulty connected with the mystery of His incarnation, such being as it were His shoe-latchets. For the fetter of obscurity is one as the key of knowledge also is one; not even He who is greatest among those born of women is sufficient of Himself to loose such things or to open them, for He who tied and locked at first, He also grants to whom He will to loose His shoe-latchet and to unlock what He has shut. If the passage about the shoes has a mystic meaning we ought not to scorn to consider it. Now I consider that the inhumanisation when the Son of God assumes flesh and bones is one of His shoes, and that the other is the descent to Hades, whatever that Hades be, and the journey with the Spirit to the prison. As to the descent into Hades, we read in the sixteenth Psalm, \"Thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades,\" and as for the journey in prison with the Spirit we read in Peter in his Catholic Epistle,[fn-68-P6849_1267986:105-nf] \"Put to death,\" he says, \"in the flesh, but quickened in the Spirit; in which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison, which at one time were disobedient, when the long-suffering of God once waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing.\" He, then, who is able worthily to set forth the meaning of these two journeys is able to untie the latchet of the shoes of Jesus; he, bending down in his mind and going with Jesus as He goes down into Hades, and descending from heaven and the mysteries of Christ's deity to the advent He of necessity made with us when He took on man (as His shoes). Now He who put on man also put on the dead, for[fn-68-P6850_1268674:106-nf] \"for this end Jesus both died and revived, that He might be Lord both of dead and living.\" This is why He put on both living and dead, that is, the inhabitants of the earth and those of Hades, that He might be the Lord of both dead and living. Who, then, is able to stoop down and untie the latchet of such shoes, and having untied them not to let them drop, but by the second faculty he has received to take them up and bear them, by bearing the meaning of them in his memory?","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":47,"source_paragraph":"145","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"You must refer the matter, then, to the hidden determinations of God, when you see, in one and the same condition, such as all infants unquestionably have,-who derive their hereditary evil from Adam,-that one is assisted so as to be baptized, and another is not assisted, so that he dies in his very bondage; and again, that one baptized person is left and forsaken in his present life, who God foreknew would be ungodly, while another baptized person is taken away from this life,\" lest that wickedness should alter his understanding;\"[fn-62-P6289_2420452:272-nf] and be sure that you do not in such cases ascribe unrighteousness or unwisdom to God, in whom is the very fountain of righteousness and wisdom, but, as I have exhorted you from the commencement of this treatise, \"whereto you have already attained, walk therein,\"[fn-62-P6290_2420736:273-nf] and \"even this shall God reveal unto you,\"[fn-62-P6291_2420800:274-nf] -if not in this life, yet certainly in the next, \"for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed.\"[fn-62-P6292_2420930:275-nf] When, therefore, you hear the Lord say, \"I the Lord have deceived that prophet,\"[fn-62-P6293_2421031:276-nf] and likewise what the apostle says: \"He hath mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth,\"[fn-62-P6294_2421163:277-nf] believe that, in the case of him whom He permits to be deceived and hardened, his evil deeds have deserved the judgment; whilst in the case of him to whom He shows mercy, you should loyally and unhesitatingly recognise the grace of the God who \"rendereth not evil for evil; but contrariwise blessing.\"[fn-62-P6295_2421485:278-nf] Nor should you take away from Pharaoh free will, because in several passages God says, \"I have hardened Pharaoh ;\" or,\" I have hardened or I will harden Pharaoh's heart;\"[fn-62-P6296_2421678:279-nf] for it does not by any means follow that Pharaoh did not, on this account, harden his own heart.

And now, what we have drawn from the authority of Scripture ought to be sufficient to refute the arguments of the heretics. It will not, however, appear improper if we discuss the matter with them shortly, on the grounds of reason itself. We ask them, then, if they know what is regarded among men as the ground of virtue and wickedness, and if it appears to follow that we can speak of virtues in God, or, as they think, in these two Gods. Let them give an answer also to the question, whether they consider goodness to be a virtue; and as they will undoubtedly admit it to be so, what will they say of injustice? They will never certainly, in my opinion, be so foolish as to deny that justice is a virtue. Accordingly, if virtue is a blessing, and justice is a virtue, then without doubt justice is goodness. But if they say that justice is not a blessing, it must either be an evil or an indifferent thing. Now I think it folly to return any answer to those who say that justice is an evil, for I shall have the appearance of replying either to senseless words, or to men out of their minds. How can that appear an evil which is able to reward the good with blessings, as they themselves also admit? But if they say that it is a thing of indifference, it follows that since justice is so, sobriety also, and prudence, and all the other virtues, are things of indifference. And what answer shall we make to Paul, when he says, \"If there be any virtue, and, if there be any praise, think on these things, which ye have learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me? \"[fn-65-P6558_1303501:60-nf] Let them learn, therefore, by searching the holy Scriptures, what are the individual virtues, and not deceive themselves by saying that that God who rewards every one according to his merits, does, through hatred of evil, recompense the wicked with evil, and not because those who have sinned need to be treated with severer remedies, and because He applies to them those measures which, with the prospect of improvement, seem nevertheless, for the present, to produce a feeling of pain. They do not read what is written respecting the hope of those who were destroyed in the deluge; of which hope Peter himself thus speaks in his first Epistle: \"That Christ, indeed, was put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit, by which He went and preached to the spirits who were kept in prison, who once were unbelievers, when they awaited the long-suffering of God in the days of Noah, when the ark was preparing, in which a few, i.e., eight souls, were saved by water. Whereunto also baptism by a like figure now saves you.\"[fn-65-P6559_1304552:61-nf] And with regard to Sodom and Gomorrah, let them tell us whether they believe the prophetic words to be those of the Creator God-of Him, viz., who is related to have rained upon them a shower of fire and brimstone. What does Ezekiel the prophet say of them? \"Sodom,\" he says, \"shall be restored to her former condition.\"[fn-65-P6560_1304897:62-nf] But why, in afflicting those who are deserving of punishment, does He not afflict them for their good?-who also says to Chaldea, \"Thou hast coals of fire, sit upon them; they will be a help to thee.\"[fn-65-P6561_1305125:63-nf] And of those also who fell in the desert, let them hear what is related in the Psalms 78, which bears the superscription of Asaph; for he says, \"When He slew them, then they sought Him.\"[fn-65-P6562_1305448:64-nf] He does not say that some sought Him after others had been slain, but he says that the destruction of those who were killed was of such a nature that, when put to death, they sought God.

And if it be not, how is that\nsaying of the apostle true: \"Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on\nHim, but also to suffer for His sake\"?[fn-69-P6947_2654532:3-nf] Of\nthese things, certainly, one has respect to the beginning, the other to the end. Yet each is the gift\nof God, because both are said to be given; as, also, I have already said above. For what is more\ntruly the beginning for a Christian than to believe in Christ? What end is better than to suffer for\nChrist? But so far as pertains to believing in Christ, whatever kind of contradiction has been\ndiscovered, that not the beginning but the increase of faith should be called God's gift,-to this\nopinion, by God's gift, I have answered enough, and more than enough. But what reason can be given\nwhy perseverance to the end should not be given in Christ to him to whom it is given to suffer for\nChrist, or, to speak more distinctly, to whom it is given to die for Christ? For the Apostle Peter,\nshowing that this is the gift of God, says, \"It is better, if the will of God be so, to suffer for\nwell-doing than for evil-doing.\"[fn-69-P6948_2655474:4-nf] When he\nsays, \"If the will of God be so,\" he shows that this is divinely given, and yet not to all saints, to\nsuffer for Christ's sake.

But who can say that this perseverance is not given to those who die in Christ\nfrom any weakness of booty, or by any kind of accident, although a far more difficult perseverance is\ngiven to those by whom even death itself is undergone for Christ's sake? Because perseverance is much\nmore difficult when the persecutor is engaged in preventing a man's perseverance; and therefore he is\nsustained in his perseverance unto death. Hence it is more difficult to have the former\nperseverance,-easier to have the latter; but to Him to whom nothing is difficult it is easy to give\nboth.

For Cyprian himself says, \"The Lord is able of His mercy to grant pardon, and not to sever from the gifts of His Church those who, being in all simplicity admitted to the Church, have fallen asleep within her pale.\"[fn-38-P3835_2106814:113-nf] If not by water, how in the ark? If not in the ark, how in the Church? But if in the Church, certainly in the ark; and if in the ark, certainly by water. It is therefore possible that some who have been baptized without may beconsidered, through the foreknowledge of God, to have been really baptized within, because within the water begins to be profitable to them unto salvation; nor can they be said to have been otherwise saved in the ark except by water. And again, some who seemed to have been baptized within may be considered, through the same foreknowledge of God, more truly to have been baptized without, since, by making a bad use of baptism, they die by water, which then happened to no one who was not outside the ark. Certainly it is clear that, when we speak of within and without in relation to the Church, it is the position of the heart that we must consider, not that of the body, since all who are within in heart are saved in the unity of the ark through the same water, through which all who are in heart without, whether they are also in body without or not, die as enemies of unity. As therefore it was not another but the same water that saved those who were placed within the ark, and destroyed those who were left without the ark, so it is not by different baptisms, but by the same, that good Catholics are saved, and bad Catholics or heretics perish. But what the most blessed Cyprian thinks of the Catholic Church, and how the heretics are utterly crushed by his authority; notwithstanding the much I have already said, I have yet determined to set forth by itself, if God will, with somewhat greater fullness and perspicuity, so soon as I shall have first said about his Council what I think is due from me, which, in God's will, shall attempt in the following book.

Now therefore concerning this same boldness, let us see what he says. Whence do we understand that charity is perfect? \"There is no fear in charity.\"[fn-45-P4573_2467647:13-nf] Then what say we of him that has begun to fear the day of judgment? If charity in him were perfect, he would not fear. For perfect charity would make perfect righteousness, and he would have nothing to fear: nay rather he would have something to desire; that iniquity may pass away, and God's kingdom come. So then, \"there is no fear in charity.\" But in what charity? Not in charity begun: in whatthen? \"But perfect charity,\" saith he, \"casteth out fear.\" Then let fear make the beginning, because \"the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.\" Fear, so to say, prepares a place for charity. But when once charity has begun to inhabit, the fear which prepared the place for it is cast out. For in proportion as this increases, that decreases: and the more this comes to be within, is the fear cast out. Greater charity, less fear; less charity, greater fear. But if no fear, there is no way for charity to come in. As we see in sewing, the thread is introduced by means of the bristle;[fn-45-P4574_2468657:14-nf] the bristle first enters, but except it come out the thread does not come into its place: so fear first occupies the mind, but the fear does not remain there, because it enters only in order to introduce charity. When once there is the sense of security in the mind, what joy have we both in this world and in the world to come! Even in this world, who shall hurt us, being full of charity? See how the apostle exults concerning this very charity: \"Who shall separate us from the charity of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?\"[fn-45-P4575_2469266:15-nf] And Peter saith: \"And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers[fn-45-P4576_2469357:16-nf] of that which is good?-There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment.\"[fn-45-P4577_2469502:17-nf] The consciousness of sins torments the heart: justification has not yet taken place. There is that in it which itches, which pricks. Accordingly in the Psalm what saith he concerning this same perfection of righteousness? \"Thou hast turned for me my mourning into joy: Thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; to the end that my glory may sing to thee, and that I be not pricked.\"[fn-45-P4578_2469924:18-nf] What is this, \"That I be not pricked?\" That there be not that which shall goad my conscience. Fear doth goad: but fear not thou: charity enters in, and she heals the wound that fear inflicts. The fear of God so wounds as doth the leech's knife;[fn-45-P4579_2470206:19-nf] it takes away the rottenness, and seems to make the wound greater. Behold, when the rottenness was in the body, the wound was less, but perilous: then comes the knife; the wound smarted less than it smarts now while the leech is cutting it. It smarts more while he is operating upon it than it would if it were not operated upon; it smarts more under the healing operation, but only that it may never smart when the healing is effected. Then let fear occupy thine heart, that it may bring in charity; let the cicatrice succeed to the leech's knife. He is such an Healer, that the cicatrices do not even appear: only do thou put thyself under His hand. For if thou be without fear, thou canst not be justified. It is a sentence pronounced by the Scriptures; \"For he that is without fear, cannot be justified.\"[fn-45-P4580_2471034:20-nf] Needs then must fear first enter in, that by it charity may come. Fear is the healing operation: charity, the sound condition. \"But he that feareth is not made perfect in love.\" Why? \"Because fear hath torment;\" just as the cutting of the surgeon's knife hath torment.","title":"Homily IX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_62_book_iv_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"182","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2.

For as these men did not impute unto us (the Gentiles) our transgressions, which we wrought before Christ was manifested among us, so also it is not right that we should lay blame upon those who sinned before Christ's coming. For \"all men come short of the glory of God,\"[fn-85-P8532_2401782:386-nf] and are not justified of themselves, but by the advent of the Lord,-they who earnestly direct their eyes towards His light. And it is for our instruction that their actions have been committed to writing, that we might know, in the first place, that our God and theirs is one, and that sins do not please Him although committed by men of renown; and in the second place, that we should keep from wickedness. For if these men of old time, who preceded us in the gifts [bestowed upon them], and for whom the Son of God had not yet suffered, when they committed any sin and served fleshly lusts, were rendered objects of such disgrace, what shall the men of the present day suffer, who have despised the Lord's coming, and become the slaves of their own lusts? And truly the death of the Lord became [the means of] healing and remission of sins to the former, but Christ shall not die again in behalf of those who now commit sin, for death shall no more have dominion over Him; but the Son shall come in the glory of the Father, requiring from His stewards and dispensers the money which He had entrusted to them, with usury; and from those to whom He had given most shall He demand most. We ought not, therefore, as that presbyter remarks, to be puffed up, nor be severe upon those of old time, but ought ourselves to fear, lest perchance, after [we have come to] the knowledge of Christ, if we do things displeasing to God, we obtain no further forgiveness of sins, but be shut out from His kingdom.[fn-85-P8533_2403564:387-nf] And therefore it was that Paul said, \"For if [God] spared not the natural branches, [take heed] lest He also spare not thee, who, when thou wert a wild olive tree, wert grafted into the fatness of the olive tree, and wert made a partaker of its fatness.\"[fn-85-P8534_2404102:388-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":3,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_62_book_vii_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"ANF-04","text":"He thinks, besides, that those who support the cause of Christ by a reference to the writings of the prophets can give no proper answer in regard to statements in them which attribute to God that which is wicked, shameful, or impure; and assuming that no answer can be given, he proceeds to draw a whole train of inferences, none of which can be allowed. But he ought to know that those who wish to live according to the teaching of sacred Scripture understand the saying, \"The knowledge of the unwise is as talk without sense,\"[fn-108-P10894_2921134:14-nf] and have learnt \"to be ready always to give an answer to every one that asketh us a reason for the hope that is in us.\"[fn-108-P10895_2921276:15-nf] And they are not satisfied with affirming that such and such things have been predicted; but they endeavour to remove any apparent inconsistencies, and to show that, so far from there being anything evil, shameful, or impure in these predictions, everything is worthy of being received by those who understand the sacred Scriptures.

Augustin answered: To flee from one state to another from the face of persecution has not been enjoined as precept or permission on heretics or schismatics, such as you are; but it was enjoined on the preachers of the gospel, whom you resist. And this we may easily prove in this wise: you are now in your own cities, and no man persecutes you. You must therefore come forth, and give an account of your separation. For it cannot be maintained that, as the weakness of the flesh is excused when it yields before the violence of persecution, so truth also ought to yield to falsehood. Furthermore, if you are suffering persecution, why do you not retire from the cities in which you are, that you may fulfill the instructions which you quote out of the gospel? But if you are not suffering persecution, why are you unwilling to reply to us? Or if the fact be that you are afraid lest, when you should have made reply, you then should suffer persecution, in that case how are you following the example of those preachers to whom it was said, \"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves?\" To whom it was also further said \"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.\"[fn-48-P4864_2389682:64-nf] And how do you escape the charge of acting contrary to the injunction of the Apostle Peter, who says, \"Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the faith and hope that is in you?\"[fn-48-P4865_2389918:65-nf] And, lastly, wherefore are you ever eager to annoy thee Catholic Churches by the most violent disturbances, whenever it is in your power, as is proved by innumerable instances of simple fact? But you say that you must defend your places, and that you resist with cudgels and massacres and with whatever else you can. Wherefore in such a case did you not hearken to the voice of the Lord, when He says, \"But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil\"?[fn-48-P4866_2390388:66-nf] Or, allowing that it is possible that in some cases it should be right for violent men to be resisted by bodily force, and that it does not violate the precept which we receive from the Lord, \"But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil,\" why may it not also be that a pious man should eject an impious man, or a just man him that is unjust, in the exercise of duly and lawfully constituted authority, from seats which are unlawfully usurped, or retained to the despite of God? For you would not say that the false prophets suffered persecution at the hands of Elijah, in the same sense that Elijah suffered persecution from the wickedest of kings?[fn-48-P4867_2391055:67-nf] Or that because the Lord was scourged by His persecutors, therefore those whom He Himself drove out of the temple with scourges are to be put in comparison with His sufferings? It remains, therefore, that we should acknowledge that there is no other question requiring solution, except whether you have been pious or impious in separating yourselves from the communion of the whole world. For if it shall be found that you have acted impiously, you would not be surprised if there should be no lack of ministers of God by whom you might be scourged, seeing that you suffer persecution not from us, but as it is written, from their own abominations.[fn-48-P4868_2391724:68-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_56_oration_xlv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XXV.

That which is known to Him who is ever holy is received with perfect safety, whatever be the character of the minister at whose hands it is received. For unless the words which are spoken from Moses' seat were necessarily holy, He that is the Truth would never have said, \"Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do.\" But if the men who uttered holy words were themselves holy, He would not have said, \"Do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.\"[fn-56-P5600_2700001:41-nf] For it is true that in no way do men gather grapes of thorns, because grapes never spring from the root of a thorn; but when the shoot of the vine has entwined itself in a thorn hedge, the fruit which hangs upon it is not therefore looked upon with dread, but the thorn is avoided, while the grape is plucked.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_67_book_vi_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"389","folder":"ANF-02","text":"But how?

There is certainly another which is not only not common to men and beasts, but to men themselves is not common to good and bad. In a word, when he had there spoken of this health which men and cattle receive in common, because of that health which men, but only the good, ought to hope for, he added as he went on: \"But the sons of men shall put their trust under the cover of Thy wings.

For what is said by Peter, `receiving from God honour and glory, Angels being made subject unto Him[fn-68-P6856_2717244:308-nf] ,' has this meaning. As He inquired humanly, and raised Lazarus divinely, so `He received' is spoken of Him humanly, but the subjection of the Angels marks the Word's Godhead.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":3,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_73_sermon_lvi_cvi_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1. Ye have heard the holy Gospel, how the Lord Jesus in that which He said to the Pharisees, conveyed doubtless a lesson to His own disciples, that they should not think that righteousness consists in the cleansing of the body. For every day did the Pharisees wash themselves in water before they dined; as if a daily washing could be a cleansing of the heart. Then He showed what sort of persons they were. He told them who saw them; for He saw not their faces only but their inward parts. For that ye may know this, that Pharisee, to whom Christ made answer, thought within himself, he uttered nothing aloud, yet the Lord heard him. For within himself he blamed the Lord Christ, because He had so come to his feast without having washed. He was thinking, the Lord heard, therefore He answered. What then did He answer? \"Now do ye Pharisees wash the outside of the platter; but within ye are full of guile and ravening.\"[fn-54-P5434_2302348:1-nf] What! is this to come to a feast! how did He not spare the man by whom He had been invited? Yea rather by rebuking He did spare him, that being reformed He might spare him in the judgment. And what is it that He showeth to us? That Baptism also which is conferred once for all, cleanses by faith. Now faith is within, not without. Wherefore it is said and read in the Acts of the Apostles, \"Cleansing their hearts by faith.\"[fn-54-P5435_2302789:2-nf] And the Apostle Peter thus speaks in his Epistle; \"So too hath He given yon a similitude from Noah's ark, how that eight souls were saved by water.\" And then he added, \"So also in a like figure will baptism save us, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience.[fn-54-P5436_2303105:3-nf] \"This answer of a good conscience\" did thePharisees despise, and washed \"that which was without;\" within they continued full of pollution.","title":"Sermon LVI.

Many miracles were wrought, divine benefits imparted. They were brought right through to the land of promise, delivered from Egyptian bondage: Prophets were raised up among them, they received the temple, they received the priesthood, they received the anointing, they received the Law. Yet of this very people was it said afterwards, \"The strange children have lied unto me.\"[fn-55-P5549_2351491:9-nf] At last He was sent who had been promised afore by the Prophets. \"Let not man prevail,\" even the more, because that God was made Man. But even He, though He did divine works, was despised, though He showed forth so many acts of mercy, He was apprehended, He was scourged, He was hanged.

So far \"did man prevail:\" how far, but up to the time that having been taken down from the tree, He was laid in the sepulchre? If He had remained there, man would have \"prevailed\" indeed.

The Word above us, the Flesh among us, the Word-flesh[fn-55-P5550_2352389:10-nf] between God and Man: Thou didst choose a virgin to be born from according to the flesh, when Thou wast to be conceived, Thou didst find a Virgin; when Thou wast born, Thou didst leave a Virgin. But Thou wast not acknowledged; Thou wast Seen, and yet wast hidden. Infirmity was seen, Power was hidden. All this was done, that Thou mightest shed that Blood, which is our Price. Thou didst so great miracles, didst give health to the weaknesses of the sick, didst show forth many acts of mercy, and receivedst evil for good. They mocked Thee, Thou didst hang upon the tree; the ungodly wagged their heads before Thee, and said, \"If Thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.\"[fn-55-P5551_2353103:11-nf] Hadst Thou then lost Thy power, or rather wast Thou showing forth Thy Patience? and yet they mocked Thee, and yet they derided Thee, yet, when Thou wast slain, they went away as if victorious. Lo, Thou art laid in the sepulchre: \"Arise, Lord, let not man prevail.\" \"Let not\" the ungodly enemy \"prevail, let not\" the blind Jew \"prevail.\" For when Thou wert crucified, the Jew in his blindness seemed to himself to have \"prevailed.\" \"Arise, Lord, let not man prevail.\" It is done, yea, it is done.

Take away the word, and the water is neither more nor less than water. The word is added to the element, and there results the Sacrament, as if itself also a kind of visible word. For He had said also to the same effect, when washing the disciples' feet, \"He that is washed needeth not, save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit.\"[fn-28-P2876_1657044:7-nf] And whence has water so great an efficacy, as in touching the body to cleanse the soul, save by the operation of the word; and that not because it is uttered, but because it is believed? For even in the word itself the passing sound is one thing, the abiding efficacy another. \"This is the word of faith which we preach,\" says the apostle, \"that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth that Jesus is the Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shall be saved.

Many things are set forth by inspired Scripture as binding upon all who are anxious to please God. But, for the present, I have only deemed it necessary to speak by way of brief reminder concerning the questions which have recently been stirred among you, so far as I have learnt from the study of inspired Scripture itself. I shall thus leave behind me detailed evidence, easy of apprehension, for the information of industrious students, who in their turn will be able to inform others. The Christian ought to be so minded as becomes his heavenly calling,[fn-28-P2894_958820:2-nf] and his life and conversation ought to be worthy of the Gospel of Christ.[fn-28-P2895_958911:3-nf] The Christian ought not to be of doubtful mind,[fn-28-P2896_958979:4-nf] nor by anything drawn away from the recollection of God and of His purposes and judgments. The Christian ought in all things to become superior to the righteousness existing under the law, and neither swear nor lie.[fn-28-P2897_959216:5-nf] He ought not to speak evil;[fn-28-P2898_959264:6-nf] to do violence;[fn-28-P2899_959296:7-nf] to fight;[fn-29-P2900_959324:8-nf] to avenge himself;[fn-29-P2901_959360:9-nf] to return evil for evil;[fn-29-P2902_959403:10-nf] to be angry.[fn-29-P2903_959435:11-nf] The Christian ought to be patient,[fn-29-P2904_959488:12-nf] whatever he have to suffer, and to convict the wrong-doer in season,[fn-29-P2905_959574:13-nf] not with the desire of his own vindication, but of his brother's reformation,[fn-29-P2906_959670:14-nf] according to the commandment of the Lord. The Christian ought not to say anything behind his brother's back with the object of calumniating him, for this is slander, even if what is said is true.[fn-29-P2907_959885:15-nf] He ought to turn away from the brother who speaks evil against him;[fn-29-P2908_959997:16-nf] he ought not to indulge in jesting.[fn-29-P2909_960081:17-nf] he ought not to laugh nor even to suffer laugh makers.[fn-29-P2910_960151:18-nf] He must not talk idly, saying things which are of no service to the hearers nor to such usage as is necessary and permitted us by God;[fn-29-P2911_960597:19-nf] so that workers may do their best as far as possible to work in silence; and that good words be suggested to them by those who are entrusted with the duty of carefully dispensing the word to the building up of the faith, lest God's Holy Spirit be grieved.
