Nepotian is happy who neither sees these things nor hears them. We are unhappy, for either we suffer ourselves or we see our brethren suffer. Yet we desire to live, and regard those beyond the reach of these evils as miserable rather than blessed. We have long felt that God is angry, yet we do not try to appease Him. It is our sins which make the barbarians strong, it is our vices which vanquish Rome's soldiers: and, as if there were here too little material for carnage, civil wars have made almost greater havoc among us than the swords of foreign foes. Miserable must those Israelites have been compared with whom Nebuchadnezzar was called God's servant.[fn-26-P2649_682885:1890-nf] Unhappy too are we who are so displeasing to God that He uses the fury of the barbarians to execute His wrath against us. Still when Hezekiah repented, one hundred and eighty-five thousand Assyrians were destroyed in one night by a single angel.[fn-26-P2650_683155:1891-nf] When Jehosaphat sang the praises of the Lord, the Lord gave His worshipper the victory.[fn-26-P2651_683266:1892-nf] Again when Moses fought against Amalek, it was not with the sword but with prayer that he prevailed.[fn-26-P2652_683393:1893-nf] Therefore, if we wish to be lifted up, we must first prostrate ourselves. Alas! for our shame and folly reaching even to unbelief! Rome's army, once victor and lord of theworld, now trembles with terror at the sight ofthe foe and accepts defeat from men who cannot walk afoot and fancy themselves dead if once they are unhorsed.[fn-26-P2653_683745:1894-nf] We do not understand the prophet's words: \"One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one.\"[fn-26-P2654_683913:1895-nf] We do not cut away the causes of the disease, as we must do to remove the disease itself.

Hear me, I beg you with patience and do not take truthfulness for flattery. Is any man reluctant to communicate with you? Does any turn his face away when you hold out your hand? Does any at the holy banquet offer you the kiss of Judas?[fn-34-P3457_910305:2505-nf] At your approach the monks instead of trembling rejoice. They race to meet you and leaving their dens in the desert are fain to master you by their humility. What compels them to come forth? Is it not their love for you? What draws together the scattered dwellers in the desert? Is it not the esteem in which they hold you? A parent ought to love his children; and not only a parent but a bishop ought to be loved by his children. Neither ought to be feared. There is an old saying:[fn-34-P3458_910934:2506-nf] \"whom a man fears he hates; and whom he hates, he would fain see dead.\" Accordingly, while for the young the holy scripture makes fear the beginning of knowledge,[fn-34-P3459_911138:2507-nf] it also tells us that \"perfect love casteth out fear.\"[fn-34-P3460_911214:2508-nf] You exact no obedience from them; therefore the monks obey you. You offer them a kiss; therefore they bow the neck. You shew yourself a common soldier; therefore they make you their general. Thus from being one among many you become one above many. Freedom is easily roused if attempts are made to crush it. No one gets more from a free man than he who does not force him to be a slave. I know the canons of the church; I know what rank her ministers hold; and from men and books I have daily up to the present learned and gathered many things. The kingdom of the mild David was quickly dismembered by one who chastised his people with scorpions and fancied that his fingers were thicker than his father's loins.[fn-34-P3461_911951:2509-nf] The Roman people refused to brook insolence even in a king.[fn-34-P3462_912034:2510-nf] Moses was leader of the host of Israel; he brought ten plagues upon Egypt; sky, earth, and sea alike obeyed his commands: yet he is spoken of as \"very meek above all the men which were\" at that time \"upon the face of the earth.\"[fn-34-P3463_912371:2511-nf] He maintained his forty-years' supremacy because he tempered the insolence of office with gentleness and meekness. When he was being stoned by the people he made intercession for them;[fn-34-P3464_912578:2512-nf] nay more he wished to be blotted out of God's book sooner than that the flock committed to him should perish.[fn-34-P3465_912712:2513-nf] He sought to imitate the Shepherd who would, he knew, carry on his shoulders even the wandering sheep. \"The good Shepherd\"-they are the Lord's own words-\"layeth down his life for the sheep.\"[fn-34-P3466_912946:2514-nf] One of his disciples can wish to be anathema from Christ for his brethren's sake, his kinsmen according to the flesh who were Israelites.[fn-34-P3467_913134:2515-nf] If then Paul can desire to perish that the lost may not be lost, how much should good parents not provoke their children to wrath[fn-34-P3468_913301:2516-nf] or by too great severity embitter those who are naturally mild.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":17,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1004","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"To his most loving lord, son, and brother, the presbyter Jerome, Epiphanius sends greeting in the Lord.

There are, however, some who think themselves capable of being cleansed by their own righteousness, so as to contemplate God, and to dwell in God; whom their very pride itself stains above all others.

Moses for forty days and forty nights fasted on Mount Sinai, and showed even then that man does not live on bread alone, but on every word of God. He says to the Lord, \"the people is full and maketh idols.\" Moses with empty stomach received the law written with the finger of God. The people that ate and drank and rose up to play fashioned a golden calf, and preferred an Egyptian ox to the majesty of the Lord. The toil of so many days perished through the fulness of a single hour. Moses boldly broke the tables: for he knew that drunkards cannot hear the word of God.[fn-67-P6742_2130843:133-nf] \"The beloved grew thick, waxed fat, and became sleek: he kicked and forsook the Lord which made him, and departed from the God of his salvation.\" Hence also it is enjoined in the same Book of Deuteronomy:[fn-67-P6743_2131154:134-nf] \"Beware, lest when thou hast eaten and drunk, and hast built goodly houses, and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and gold is multiplied, then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.\" In short the people ate and their heart grew thick, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart: so the people well fed and fat-fleshed could not bear the countenance of Moses who fasted, for, to correctly render the Hebrew, it was[fn-67-P6744_2131689:135-nf] furnished with horns through his converse with God. And it was not, as some think, to show that there is no difference between virginity and marriage, but to assert his sympathy with severe fasting, that our Lord and Saviour when he was transfigured on the Mount revealed Moses and Elias with Himself in glory. Although Moses and Elias were properly types of the Law and the Prophets, as is clearly witnessed by the Gospel:[fn-67-P6745_2132373:136-nf] \"They spake of his departure which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.\" For the passion of our Lord is declared not by virginity or marriage, but by the Law and the Prophets. If, however, any persons contentiously maintain that by Moses is signified marriage, by Elias virginity, let me tell them briefly that Moses died and was buried, but Elias was carried off in a chariot of fire and entered on immortality before he approached death. But the second writing of the tables could not be effected without fasting. What was lost by drunkenness was regained by abstinence, a proof that by fasting we can return to paradise, whence, though fulness, we have been expelled. In[fn-67-P6746_2133071:137-nf] Exodus we read that the battle was fought against Amalek while Moses prayed, and the whole people fasted until the evening.[fn-67-P6747_2133215:138-nf] Joshua, the son of Nun, bade sun and moon stand still, and the victorious army prolonged its fast for more than a day.[fn-67-P6748_2133354:139-nf] Saul, as it is written in the first book of Kings, pronounced a curse on him who ate bread before the evening, and until he had avenged himself upon his enemies. So none of his people tasted any food. And all they of the land took food. And so binding was a solemn fast once it was proclaimed to the Lord, that Jonathan, to whom the victory was due, was taken by lot, and[fn-67-P6749_2133964:140-nf] could not escape the charge of sinning in ignorance, and his father's hand was raised against him, and the prayers of the people scarce availed to save him.[fn-67-P6750_2134144:141-nf] Elijah after the preparation of a forty days fast saw God on Mount Horeb, and heard from Him the words, \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\" There is much more familiarity in this than in the \"Where art thou, Adam?\" of Genesis. The latter was intended to excite the fears of one who had fed and was lost; the former was affectionately addressed to a fasting servant.[fn-67-P6751_2134533:142-nf] When the people were assembled in Mizpeh, Samuel proclaimed a fast, and so strengthened them, and thus made them prevail against the enemy.[fn-67-P6752_2134695:143-nf] The attack of the Assyrians was repulsed, and the might of Sennacherib utterly crushed, by the tears and sackcloth of King Hezekiah, and by his humbling himself with fasting. So also the city of Nineveh by fasting excited compassion and turned aside the threatening wrath of the Lord. And[fn-67-P6753_2135006:144-nf] Sodom and Gomorrha might have appeased it, had they been willing to repent, and through the aid of fasting gain for themselves tears of repentance.[fn-67-P6754_2135180:145-nf] Ahab, the most impious of kings, by fasting and wearing sackcloth, succeeded in escaping the sentence of God, and in deferring the overthrow of his house to the days of his posterity.[fn-67-P6755_2135391:146-nf] Hannah, the wife of Elkanah, by fasting won the gift of a son.[fn-67-P6756_2135489:147-nf] At Babylon the magicians came into peril, every interpreter of dreams, soothsayer, and diviner was slain. Daniel and the three youths gained a good report by fasting, and although they were fed on pulse, they were fairer and wiser than they who ate the flesh from the king's table. Then it is written that Daniel fasted for three weeks; he ate no pleasant bread; flesh and wine entered not his mouth; he was not anointed with oil; and the angel came to him saying,[fn-67-P6757_2135981:148-nf] \"Daniel, thou art worthy of compassion.\" He who in the eyes of God was worthy of compassion, afterwards was an object of terror to the lions in their den. How fair a thing is that which propitiates God, tames lions, terrifies demons!Habakkuk (although we do not find this in the Hebrew Scriptures[fn-67-P6758_2136344:149-nf] ) was sent to him with the reaper's meal, for by a week's abstinence he had merited so distinguished a server. David, when his son was in danger after his adultery, made confession in ashes and with fasting.[fn-67-P6759_2136618:150-nf] He tells us that he ate ashes like bread, and mingled his drink with weeping.[fn-67-P6760_2136715:151-nf] And that his knees became weak through fasting. Yet he had certainly heard from Nathan the words,[fn-67-P6761_2136833:152-nf] \"The Lord also hath put away thy sin.\" Samson and Samuel drank neither wine nor strong drink, for they were children of promise, and conceived in abstinence and fasting.[fn-67-P6762_2137026:153-nf] Aaron and the other priests when about to enter the temple, refrained from all intoxicating drink for fear they should die. Whence we learn that they die who minister in the Church without sobriety. And hence it is a reproach against Israel:[fn-67-P6763_2137286:154-nf] \"Ye gave my Nazarites wine to drink.\" Jonadab, the son of Rechab, commanded his sons to drink no wine for ever. And when Jeremiah offered them wine to drink, and they of their own accord refused it, the Lord spake by the prophet, saying:[fn-67-P6764_2137544:155-nf] \"Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.\" On the[fn-67-P6765_2137714:156-nf] threshold of the Gospel appears Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, the wife of one husband, and a woman who was always fasting. Long-continued chastity and persistent fasting welcomed a Virgin Lord. His forerunner and herald, John, fed on locusts and wild honey, not on flesh; and the hermits of the desert and the monks in their cells, at first used the same sustenance. But the Lord Himself consecrated His baptism by a forty days' fast, and He taught us that the more violent devils[fn-67-P6766_2138219:157-nf] cannot be overcome, except by prayer and fasting.[fn-67-P6767_2138561:158-nf] Cornelius the centurion was found worthy through alms-giving and frequent fasts to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit before baptism.[fn-67-P6768_2138714:159-nf] The Apostle Paul, after speaking of hunger and thirst, and his other labours, perils from robbers, shipwrecks, loneliness, enumerates frequent fasts. And he[fn-67-P6769_2138893:160-nf] advises his disciple Timothy, who had a weak stomach, and was subject to many infirmities, to drink wine in moderation: \"Drink no longer water,\" he says. The fact that he bids him no longer drink water shows that he had previously drunk water. The apostle would not have allowed this had not frequent infirmities and bodily pain demanded the concession.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":17,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_10_book_iii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"2.

What does it tell us? \"Accustom not thy mouth to swearing; neither use thyself to the naming of the Holy One.\" And why? \"For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a blue mark, so he that sweareth.\" (Ecclus. xxiii. 10.) See the discernment of this wise man. He did not say, \"Accustom not to swearing\" thy mind, but \"thy mouth\"; because being altogether an affair of the mouth, thus it is easily remedied. For at last it becomes a habit without intention; as for instance, there are many who entering the public baths, as soon as they have passed the threshold, cross (Hom. in 1 Cor. xi. 7) themselves (sfragizontai).[fn-5-P583_422952:24-nf] This the hand has got to do, without any one's bidding, by force of habit. Again, at the lighting of a candle, often when the mind is intent on something else, the hand makes the sign. In the same way also the mouth, without concurrence of the mind, articulates the word, from mere habit, and the whole affair is in the tongue. \"Neither use thyself,\" he says, \"to the naming of the Holy One. For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a blue mark, so he that sweareth.\" He speaks not here of false oaths, but he cuts down all oaths, and to them also assigns their punishment. Why then, swearing is a sin. For such in truth is the soul; full of all these ulcers, all these scars. But you do not see them? Yes, this is the mischief of it; and yet you might see if you wished; for God has given you eyes. With eyes of this kind did the Prophet see, when he said, \"My wounds stink, and are corrupt, because of my foolishness.\" (Ps. xxxviii. 5.) We have despised God, we have hated that good Name, we have trodden Christ under foot, we have lost all reverence, none names the Name of God with honor. Yet if you love any one, even at his name you start to your feet; but God you thus continually invoke, and make nothing of it. Call upon Him for the benefit of your enemy; call upon Him for the salvation of your own soul; then he will be present, then you will delight Him; whereas now you provoke Him to anger. Call upon Him as Stephen did; \"Lord,\" he said, \"lay not this sin to their charge.\" (ch. vii. 59.) Call upon Him as did the wife of Elkanah, with tears and sobs, and prayers. (1 Sam. i. 10.) I prevent you not, rather I earnestly exhort you to it. Call upon him as Moses called upon Him, yea, cried, interceding for those[fn-5-P584_424941:25-nf] who had driven him into banishment. For you to make mention at random of any person of consideration, is taken as an insult: and do you bandy God about in your talk, in season, out of season? I do not want to hinder you from keeping God always in your mind: nay, this I even desire and pray for, only that you should do this, so as to honor Him. Great good would this have done us, if we had called upon God only when we ought, and for what we ought. And why, I would ask, were such miracles wrought in the Apostles' times, and not in ours? And yet it is the same God, the same Name. But no, the case is not the same. For then they called upon Him only for those objects which I have mentioned; whereas we call upon Him not for these, but quite other purposes.-If a man refuse to believe you, and that is why you swear, say to him, \"Believe me:\" however, if you will needs make oath, swear by yourself.

What does it tell us? \"Accustom not thy mouth to swearing; neither use thyself to the naming of the Holy One.\" And why? \"For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a blue mark, so he that sweareth.\" (Ecclus. xxiii. 10.) See the discernment of this wise man. He did not say, \"Accustom not to swearing\" thy mind, but \"thy mouth\"; because being altogether an affair of the mouth, thus it is easily remedied. For at last it becomes a habit without intention; as for instance, there are many who entering the public baths, as soon as they have passed the threshold, cross (Hom. in 1 Cor. xi. 7) themselves (sfragizontai).[fn-5-P583_422952:24-nf] This the hand has got to do, without any one's bidding, by force of habit. Again, at the lighting of a candle, often when the mind is intent on something else, the hand makes the sign. In the same way also the mouth, without concurrence of the mind, articulates the word, from mere habit, and the whole affair is in the tongue. \"Neither use thyself,\" he says, \"to the naming of the Holy One. For as a servant that is continually beaten shall not be without a blue mark, so he that sweareth.\" He speaks not here of false oaths, but he cuts down all oaths, and to them also assigns their punishment. Why then, swearing is a sin. For such in truth is the soul; full of all these ulcers, all these scars. But you do not see them? Yes, this is the mischief of it; and yet you might see if you wished; for God has given you eyes. With eyes of this kind did the Prophet see, when he said, \"My wounds stink, and are corrupt, because of my foolishness.\" (Ps. xxxviii. 5.) We have despised God, we have hated that good Name, we have trodden Christ under foot, we have lost all reverence, none names the Name of God with honor. Yet if you love any one, even at his name you start to your feet; but God you thus continually invoke, and make nothing of it. Call upon Him for the benefit of your enemy; call upon Him for the salvation of your own soul; then he will be present, then you will delight Him; whereas now you provoke Him to anger. Call upon Him as Stephen did; \"Lord,\" he said, \"lay not this sin to their charge.\" (ch. vii. 59.) Call upon Him as did the wife of Elkanah, with tears and sobs, and prayers. (1 Sam. i. 10.) I prevent you not, rather I earnestly exhort you to it. Call upon him as Moses called upon Him, yea, cried, interceding for those[fn-5-P584_424941:25-nf] who had driven him into banishment. For you to make mention at random of any person of consideration, is taken as an insult: and do you bandy God about in your talk, in season, out of season? I do not want to hinder you from keeping God always in your mind: nay, this I even desire and pray for, only that you should do this, so as to honor Him. Great good would this have done us, if we had called upon God only when we ought, and for what we ought. And why, I would ask, were such miracles wrought in the Apostles' times, and not in ours? And yet it is the same God, the same Name. But no, the case is not the same. For then they called upon Him only for those objects which I have mentioned; whereas we call upon Him not for these, but quite other purposes.-If a man refuse to believe you, and that is why you swear, say to him, \"Believe me:\" however, if you will needs make oath, swear by yourself. I say this, not to set up a law against Christ's law; God forbid; for it is said. \"Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay (Matt. v. 37): but by way of coming down to your present level, that I may more easily lead you to the practice of this commandment, and divert you from this tyrannical habit.

Yea, moreover, the rod of the priest which, without culture, blossomed forth in fruit,[fn-60-P6091_1870205:77-nf] the pledge and earnest of a perpetual priesthood, furnished no contemptible symbol of thy supernatural child-bearing.[fn-60-P6092_1870342:78-nf] What, moreover? Hath not the mighty Moses expressly declared, that on account of these types of thee, hard to be understood,[fn-60-P6093_1870484:79-nf] he delayed longer on the mountain, in order that he might learn, O holy one, the mysteries that with thee are connected? For being commanded to build the ark as a sign and similitude of this thing, he was not negligent in obeying the command, although a tragic occurrence happened on his descent from the mount; but having made it in size five cubits and a half, he appointed it to be the receptacle of the law, and covered it with the wings of the cherubim, most evidently pre-signifying thee, the mother of God, who hast conceived Him without corruption, and in an ineffable manner brought forth Him who is Himself, as it were, the very consistence of incorruption, and that within the limits of the five and a half circles of the world. On thy account, and the undefiled Incarnation of God, the Word, which by thee had place for the sake of that flesh which immutably and indivisibly remains with Him for ever.[fn-60-P6094_1871418:80-nf] The golden pot also, as a most certain type, preserved the manna contained in it, which in other cases was changed day by day, unchanged, and keeping fresh for ages. The prophet Elijah[fn-60-P6095_1871620:81-nf] likewise, as prescient of thy chastity, and being emulous of it through the Spirit, bound around him the crown of that fiery life, being by the divine decree adjudged superior to death. Thee also, prefiguring his successor Elisha,[fn-60-P6096_1871872:82-nf] having been instructed by a wise master, and anticipating thy presence who wast not yet born, by certain sure indications of the things that would have place hereafter,[fn-60-P6097_1872065:83-nf] ministered help and healing to those who were in need of it, which was of a virtue beyond nature; now with a new cruse, which contained healing salt, curing the deadly waters, to show that the world was to be recreated by the mystery manifested in thee; now with unleavened meal, in type responding to thy child-bearing, without being defiled by the seed of man, banishing from the food the bitterness of death; and then again, by efforts which transcended nature, rising superior to the natural elements in the Jordan, and thus exhibiting, in signs beforehand, the descent of our Lord into Hades, and His wonderful deliverance of those who were held fast in corruption. For all things yielded and succumbed to that divine image which prefigured thee.","title":"Oration Concerning Simeon and Anna","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":17,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_41_the_epistle_of_barnabas","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"ANF-01","text":"In like manner He points to the cross of Christ in another prophet, who saith,[fn-33-P3330_565437:162-nf] \"And when shall these things be accomplished? And the Lord saith, When a tree shall be bent down, and again arise, and when blood shall flow out of wood.\"[fn-33-P3331_565653:163-nf] Here again you have an intimation concerning the cross, and Him who should be crucified. Yet again He speaks of this[fn-33-P3332_565845:164-nf] in Moses, when Israel was attacked by strangers. And that He might remind them, when assailed, that it was on account of their sins they were delivered to death, the Spirit speaks to the heart of Moses, that he should make a figure of the cross,[fn-33-P3333_566137:165-nf] and of Him about to suffer thereon; for unless they put their trust in Him, they shall be overcome for ever. Moses therefore placed one weapon above another in the midst of the hill,[fn-33-P3334_566350:166-nf] and standing upon it, so as to be higher than all the people, he stretched forth his hands,[fn-33-P3335_566735:167-nf] and thus again Israel acquired the mastery. But when again he let down his hands, they were again destroyed. For what reason? That they might know that they could not be saved unless they put their trust in Him.[fn-33-P3336_566992:168-nf] And in another prophet He declares, \"All day long I have stretched forth My hands to an unbelieving people, and one that gainsays My righteous way.\"[fn-33-P3337_567182:169-nf] And again Moses makes a type of Jesus, [signifying] that it was necessary for Him to suffer, [and also] that He would be the author of life[fn-33-P3338_567342:170-nf] [to others], whom they believed to have destroyed on the cross[fn-33-P3339_567458:171-nf] when Israel was failing. For since transgression was committed by Eve through means of the serpent, [the Lord] brought it to pass that every [kind of] serpents bit them, and they died,[fn-33-P3340_567673:172-nf] that He might convince them, that on account of their transgression they were given over to the straits of death. Moreover Moses, when he commanded, \"Ye shall not have any graven or molten [image] for your God,\"[fn-33-P3341_567929:173-nf] did so that he might reveal a type of Jesus. Moses then makes a brazen serpent, and places it upon a beam,[fn-33-P3342_568097:174-nf] and by proclamation assembles the people. When, therefore, they were come together, they besought Moses that he would offer sacrifice[fn-33-P3343_568356:175-nf] in their behalf, and pray for their recovery. And Moses spake unto them, saying, \"When any one of you is bitten, let him come to the serpent placed on the pole; and let him hope and believe, that even though dead, it is able to give him life, and immediately he shall be restored.\"[fn-33-P3344_568691:176-nf] And they did so. Thou hast in this also [an indication of] the glory of Jesus; for in Him and to Him are all things.[fn-33-P3345_568828:177-nf] What, again, says Moses to Jesus (Joshua) the son of Nave, when he gave him[fn-33-P3346_568929:178-nf] this name, as being a prophet, with this view only, that all the people might hear that the Father would reveal all things concerning His Son Jesus to the son[fn-33-P3347_569169:179-nf] of Nave? This name then being given him when he sent him to spy out the land, he said, \"Take a book into thy hands, and write what the Lord declares, that the Son of God will in the last days cut off from the roots all the house of Amalek.\"[fn-33-P3348_569505:180-nf] Behold again: Jesus who was manifested, both by type and in the flesh,[fn-33-P3349_569597:181-nf] is not the Son of man, but the Son of God. Since, therefore, they were to say that Christ was the son[fn-33-P3350_569728:182-nf] of David, fearing and understanding the error of the wicked, he saith, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-33-P3351_569965:183-nf] And again, thus saith Isaiah, \"The Lord said to Christ,[fn-33-P3352_570058:184-nf] my Lord, whose right hand I have holden,[fn-33-P3353_570145:185-nf] that the nations should yield obedience before Him; and I will break in pieces the strength of kings.\"[fn-33-P3354_570291:186-nf] Behold how David calleth Him Lord and the Son of God.","title":"The Epistle of Barnabas","author":"Barnabas"},{"chapter":17,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"88.
