{"verses":["And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Speak to the children of Israel:  Let them turn and encamp over\nagainst Phihahiroth, which is between Magdal and the sea over against\nBeelsephon:  you shall encamp before it upon the sea.","And Pharao will say of the children of Israel:  They are\nstraitened in the land, the desert hath shut them in.","And I shall harden his heart and he will pursue you:  and I shall\nbe glorified in Pharao, and in all his army:  and the Egyptians shall\nknow that I am the Lord.  And they did so.","And it was told the king of the Egyptians that the people was\nfled:  and the heart of Pharao and of his servants was changed with\nregard to the people, and they said:  What meant we to do, that we let\nIsrael go from serving us?","So he made ready his chariot, and took all his people with him.","And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots\nthat were in Egypt:  and the captains of the whole army.","And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao, king of Egypt, and he\npursued the children of Israel; but they were gone forth in a mighty\nhand.","And when the Egyptians followed the steps of them who were gone\nbefore, they found them encamped at the sea side:  all Pharao's horse\nand chariots and the whole army were in Phihahiroth, before Beelsephon.","And when Pharao drew near, the children of Israel lifting up\ntheir eyes, saw the Egyptians behind them:  and they feared exceedingly,\nand cried to the Lord.","And they said to Moses:  Perhaps there were no graves in Egypt,\ntherefore thou hast brought us to die in the wilderness:  why wouldst\nthou do this, to lead us out of Egypt?","Is not this the word that we spoke to thee in Egypt, saying:\nDepart from us, that we may serve the Egyptians?  for it was much better\nto serve them, than to die in the wilderness.","And Moses said to the people:  Fear not:  stand, and see the great\nwonders of the Lord, which he will do this day; for the Egyptians, whom\nyou see now, you shall see no more for ever.","The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.","And the Lord said to Moses:  Why criest thou to me?  Speak to the\nchildren of Israel to go forward.","But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand over the\nsea, and divide it:  that the children of Israel may go through the\nmidst of the sea on dry ground.","And I will harden the heart of the Egyptians to pursue you:  and\nI will be glorified in Pharao, and in all his host, and in his chariots\nand in his horsemen.","And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel,\nremoving, went behind them:  and together with him the pillar of the\ncloud, leaving the forepart,","Stood behind, between the Egyptians' camp and the camp of\nIsrael:  and it was a dark cloud, and enlightening the night, so that\nthey could not come at one another all the night.","And when Moses had stretched forth his hand over the sea, the\nLord took it away by a strong and burning wind blowing all the night,\nand turned it into dry ground:  and the water was divided.","And the children of Israel went in through the midst of the sea\ndried up; for the water was as a wall on their right hand and on their\nleft.","And the Egyptians pursuing went in after them, and all Pharao's\nhorses, his chariots and horsemen, through the midst of the sea.","And now the morning watch was come, and behold the Lord looking\nupon the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of the cloud,\nslew their host.","And overthrew the wheels of the chariots, and they were carried\ninto the deep.  And the Egyptians said:  Let us flee from Israel; for the\nLord fighteth for them against us.","And the Lord said to Moses:  Stretch forth thy hand over the sea,\nthat the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots\nand horsemen.","And when Moses had stretched forth his hand towards the sea, it\nreturned at the first break of day to the former place:  and as the\nEgyptians were fleeing away, the waters came upon them, and the Lord\nshut them up in the middle of the waves.","And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the\nhorsemen of all the army of Pharao, who had come into the sea after\nthem, neither did there so much as one of them remain.","But the children of Israel marched through the midst of the sea\nupon dry land, and the waters were to them as a wall on the right hand\nand on the left:","And the Lord delivered Israel in that day out of the hands of\nthe Egyptians.","And they saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore, and the\nmighty hand that the Lord had used against them:  and the people feared\nthe Lord, and they believed the Lord, and Moses his servant."]}
