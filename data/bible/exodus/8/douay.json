{"verses":["And the Lord said to Moses:  Go in to Pharao, and thou shalt say to\nhim:  Thus saith the Lord:  Let my people go to sacrifice to me.","But if thou wilt not let them go, behold I will strike all thy\ncoasts with frogs.","And the river shall bring forth an abundance of frogs; which shall\ncome up and enter into thy house, and thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed,\nand into the houses of thy servants, and to thy people, and into thy\novens, and into the remains of thy meats:","And the frogs shall come in to thee, and to thy people, and to all\nthy servants.","And the Lord said to Moses:  Say to Aaron:  Stretch forth thy hand\nupon the streams, and upon the rivers and the pools, and bring forth\nfrogs upon the land of Egypt.","And Aaron stretched forth his hand upon the waters of Egypt, and\nthe frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.","And the magicians also, by their enchantments, did in like manner,\nand they brought forth frogs upon the land of Egypt.","But Pharao called Moses and Aaron, and said to them:  Pray ye to\nthe Lord to take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will\nlet the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.","And Moses said to Pharao:  Set me a time when I shall pray for\nthee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs may be\ndriven away from thee and from thy house, and from thy servants, and\nfrom thy people; and may remain only in the river.","And he answered:  To morrow.  But he said:  I will do according to\nthy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like to the Lord our\nGod.","And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy house, and\nfrom thy servants, and from thy people; and shall remain only in the\nriver.","And Moses and Aaron went forth from Pharao:  and Moses cried to\nthe Lord for the promise, which he had made to Pharao concerning the\nfrogs.","And the Lord did according to the word of Moses:  and the frogs\ndied out of the houses, and out of the villages, and out of the fields:","And they gathered them together into immense heaps, and the land\nwas corrupted.","And Pharao seeing that rest was given, hardened his own heart,\nand did not hear them, as the Lord had commanded.","And the Lord said to Moses:  Say to Aaron:  Stretch forth thy rod,\nand strike the dust of the earth; and may there be sciniphs in all the\nland of Egypt.","And they did so.  And Aaron stretched forth his hand, holding the\nrod; and he struck the dust of the earth, and there came sciniphs on\nmen and on beasts:  all the dust of the earth was turned into sciniphs\nthrough all the land of Egypt.","And the magicians said to Pharao:  This is the finger of God.  And\nPharao's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them, as the\nLord had commanded.","The Lord also said to Moses:  Arise early, and stand before\nPharao; for he will go forth to the waters:  and thou shalt say to him:\nThus saith the Lord:  Let my people go to sacrifice to me.","But if thou wilt not let them go, behold I will send in upon\nthee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy houses, all kind of flies:\nand the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with flies of divers\nkinds, and the whole land wherein they shall be.","And I will make the land of Gessen wonderful in that day, so that\nflies shall not be there:  and thou shalt know that I am the Lord in the\nmidst of the earth.","And I will put a division between my people and thy people:  to\nmorrow shall this sign be.","And the Lord did so.  And there came a very grievous swarm of\nflies into the houses of Pharao and of his servants, and into all the\nland of Egypt:  and the land was corrupted by this kind of flies.","And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, and said to them:  Go and\nsacrifice to your God in this land.","And Moses said:  It cannot be so:  for we shall sacrifice the\nabominations of the Egyptians to the Lord our God:  now if we kill those\nthings which the Egyptians worship, in their presence, they will stone\nus.","We will go three days' journey into the wilderness; and we will\nsacrifice to the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.","And Pharao said:  I will let you go to sacrifice to the Lord your\nGod in the wilderness, but go no farther:  pray for me.","And Moses said:  I will go out from thee, and will pray to the\nLord:  and the flies shall depart from Pharao, and from his servants,\nand from his people to morrow:  but do not deceive any more, in not\nletting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.","So Moses went out from Pharao, and prayed to the Lord.","And he did according to his word:  and he took away the flies from\nPharao, and from his servants, and from his people:  there was not left\nso much as one.","And Pharao's heart was hardened, so that neither this time would\nhe let the people go."]}
