{"verses":["And when Jethro the priest of Madian, the kinsman of Moses, had\nheard all the things that God had done to Moses, and to Israel his\npeople, and that the Lord had brought forth Israel out of Egypt:","He took Sephora, the wife of Moses, whom he had sent back:","And her two sons, of whom one was called Gersam:  his father\nsaying, I have been a stranger in a foreign country.","And the other Eliezer:  For the God of my father, said he, is my\nhelper, and hath delivered me from the sword of Pharao.","And Jethro, the kinsman of Moses, came with his sons, and his\nwife to Moses into the desert, where he was camped by the mountain of\nGod.","And he sent word to Moses, saying:  I Jethro, thy kinsman, come to\nthee, and thy wife, and thy two sons with her.","And he went out to meet his kinsman, and worshipped and kissed\nhim:  and they saluted one another with words of peace.  And when he was\ncome into the tent,","Moses told his kinsman all that the Lord had done to Pharao, and\nthe Egyptians in favour of Israel:  and all the labour which had\nbefallen them in the journey, and that the Lord had delivered them.","And Jethro rejoiced for all the good things that the Lord had\ndone to Israel, because he had delivered them out of the hands of the\nEgyptians.","And he said:  Blessed is the Lord, who hath delivered his people\nout of the hand of Egypt.","Now I know, that the Lord is great above all gods; because they\ndealt proudly against them.","So Jethro, the kinsman of Moses, offered holocausts and\nsacrifices to God:  and Aaron and all the ancients of Israel came, to\neat bread with him before God.","And the next day Moses sat to judge the people, who stood by\nMoses from morning until night.","And when his kinsman had seen all things that he did among the\npeople, he said:  What is it that thou dost among the people?  Why\nsittest thou alone, and all the people wait from morning till night?","And Moses answered him:  The people come to me to seek the\njudgment of God?","And when any controversy falleth out among them, they come to me\nto judge between them, and to shew the precepts of God, and his laws.","But he said:  The thing thou dost is not good.","But hear my words and counsels, and God shall be with thee.  Be\nthou to the people in those things that pertain to God, to bring their\nwords to him:","And to shew the people the ceremonies, and the manner of\nworshipping; and the way wherein they ought to walk, and the work that\nthey ought to do.","And provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, in\nwhom there is truth, and that hate avarice, and appoint of them rulers\nof thousands, and of hundreds, and of fifties, and of tens,","Who may judge the people at all times:  and when any great matter\nsoever shall fall out, let them refer it to thee, and let them judge\nthe lesser matters only:  that so it may be lighter for thee, the burden\nbeing shared out unto others.","If thou dost this, thou shalt fulfil the commandment of God, and\nshalt be able to bear his precepts:  and all this people shall return to\ntheir places with peace.","And when Moses heard this, he did all things that he had\nsuggested unto him.","And choosing able men out of all Israel, he appointed them\nrulers of the people, rulers over thousands, and over hundreds, and\nover fifties, and over tens.","And they judged the people at all times:  and whatsoever was of\ngreater difficulty they referred to him, and they judged the easier\ncases only.","And he let his kinsman depart:  and he returned and went into his\nown country."]}
