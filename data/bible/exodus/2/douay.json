{"verses":["After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and took a wife\nof his own kindred.","And she conceived, and bore a son:  and seeing him a goodly child,\nhid him three months.","And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of\nbulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch:  and put the little babe\ntherein, and laid him in the sedges by the river's brink,","His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what would be\ndone.","And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash herself in the\nriver:  and her maids walked by the river's brink.  And when she saw the\nbasket in the sedges she sent one of her maids for it:  and when it was\nbrought,","She opened it, and seeing within it an infant crying, having\ncompassion on it, she said:  This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.","And the child's sister said to her:  Shall I go, and call to thee a\nHebrew woman, to nurse the babe?","She answered:  Go.  The maid went and called her mother.","And Pharao's daughter said to her:  Take this child, and nurse him\nfor me:  I will give thee thy wages.  The woman took and nursed the\nchild:  and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao's\ndaughter.","And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying:\nBecause I took him out of the water.","In those days, after Moses was grown up, he went out to his\nbrethren:  and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the\nHebrews, his brethren.","And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no\none there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.","And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarrelling:  and\nhe said to him that did the wrong:  Why strikest thou thy neighbour?","But he answered:  Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over\nus?  wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian?
