Such are their proceedings: and yet instead of blushing at their former clumsy intrigues against us, they even now abuse us for having effected our escape out of their murderous hands; nay, are grievously vexed that they were unable to put us out of the way altogether. In short, they overlook the fact that while they pretend to upbraid us with `cowardice,' they are really criminating themselves: for if it be disgraceful to flee, it is still more so to pursue, since the one is only endeavoring to avoid being murdered, while the other is seeking to commit the deed. But Scripture itself directs us to flee:[fn-10-P1062_473279:27-nf] and those who persecute unto death, in attempting to violate the law, constrain us to have recourse to flight. They should rather, therefore, be ashamed of their persecution, than reproach us for having sought to escape from it: let them cease to harass, and those who flee will also cease. Nevertheless they set no bounds to their malevolence, using every art to entrap us, in the consciousness that the flight of the persecuted is the strongest condemnation of the persecutor: for no one runs away from a mild and beneficent person, but from one who is of a barbarous and cruel disposition. Hence it was that `Every one that was discontented and in debt' fled from Saul to David.[fn-10-P1063_473979:28-nf] Wherefore these [foes of ours] in like manner desire to kill such as conceal themselves, that no evidence may exist to convict them of their wickedness. But in this also these misguided men most egregiously deceive themselves: for the more obvious the effort to elude them, the more manifestly will their deliberate slaughters and exiles be exposed. If they act the part of assassins, the voice of the blood which is shed will cry against them the louder: and if they condemn to banishment, they will raise so everywhere living monuments-of their own injustice and oppression. Surely unless their intellects were unsound they would perceive the dilemma in which their own counsels entangle them. But since they have lost sound judgment, their folly is exposed when they vanish, and when they seek to stay they do not see their wickedness.[fn-10-P1064_474846:29-nf] But if they reproach those who succeed in secreting themselves from the malice of their blood-thirsty adversaries, and revile such as flee from their persecutors, what will they say to Jacob's retreat from the rage of his brother Esau,[fn-10-P1065_475109:30-nf] and to Moses[fn-10-P1066_475140:31-nf] retiring into the land of Midian for fear of Pharaoh? And what apology will these babblers make for David's[fn-10-P1067_475265:32-nf] flight from Saul, when he sent messengers from his own house to dispatch him; and for his concealment in a cave, after contriving to extricate himself from the treacherous designs of Abimelech,[fn-10-P1068_475480:33-nf] by feigning madness? What will these reckless asserters of whatever suits their purpose answer, when they are reminded of the great prophet Elijah,[fn-10-P1069_475679:34-nf] who by calling upon God had recalled the dead to life, hiding himself from dread of Ahab, and fleeing on account of Jezebel's menaces? At which time the sons of the prophets also, being sought for in order to be slain, withdrew, and were concealed in caves by Obadiah;[fn-10-P1070_475969:35-nf] or are they unacquainted with these instances because of their antiquity? Have they forgotten also what is recorded in the Gospel, that the disciples retreated and hid themselves for fear of the Jews?[fn-10-P1071_476193:36-nf] Paul,[fn-10-P1072_476220:37-nf] when sought for by the governor [of Damascus] `was let down from the wall in a basket, and thus escaped the hands of him that sought him.' Since then Scripture relates these circumstances concerning the saints, what excuse can they fabricate for their temerity? If they charge us with `cowardice,' it is in utter insensibility to the condemnation it pronounces on themselves. If they asperse these holy men by asserting that they acted contrary to the will of God, they demonstrate their ignorance of Scripture. For it was commanded in the Law that `cities of refuge' should be constituted,[fn-10-P1073_476846:38-nf] by which provision was made that such as were pursued in order to be put to death might have means afforded of preserving themselves. Again in the consummation of the ages, when the Word of the Father, who had before spoken by Moses, came himself to the earth, he gave this express injunction, `When they persecute you in one city, flee unto another:'[fn-10-P1074_477219:39-nf] and shortly after, `When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (let whosoever reads, understand), then let those in Judea flee unto the mountains: let him that is on the house-top not come down to take anything out of his house; nor him that is in the fields return to take his clothes.'[fn-10-P1075_477598:40-nf] The saints therefore knowing these precepts, had such a sort of training for their action: for what the Lord then commanded, he had before his coming in the flesh already spoken of by his servants. And this is a universal rule for man, leading to perfection, `to practice whatever God has enjoined.' On this account the Word himself, becoming incarnate for our sake, deigned to conceal himself when he was sought for;[fn-10-P1076_478040:41-nf] and being again persecuted, condescended to withdraw to avoid the conspiracy against him. For thus it became him, by hungering and thirsting and suffering other afflictions, to demonstrate that he was indeed made man.[fn-10-P1077_478278:42-nf] For at the very commencement, as soon as he was born, he gave this direction by an angel to Joseph: `Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, for Herod will seek the infant's life.'[fn-10-P1078_478521:43-nf] And after Herod's death, it appears that for fear of his son Archelaus he retired to Nazareth. Subsequently; when he gave unquestionable evidence of his Divine character by healing the withered hand, `when the Pharisees took council how they might destroy him,[fn-10-P1079_478815:44-nf] Jesus knowing their wickedness withdrew himself thence.' Moreover, when he had raised Lazarus from the dead, and they had become still more intent on destroying him, [we are told that] `Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews,[fn-10-P1080_479080:45-nf] but retired into a region on the borders of the desert.' Again when the Saviour said, `Before Abraham was, I am;'[fn-10-P1081_479225:46-nf] and the Jews took up stones to cast at him; Jesus concealed himself, and going through the midst of them out of the Temple, went away thence, and so escaped. Since then they see these things, or rather understand them,[fn-10-P1082_479464:47-nf] (for they will not see,) are they not deserving of being burnt with fire, according to what is written, for acting and speaking so plainly contrary to all that the Lord did and taught? Finally, when John had suffered martyrdom, and his disciples had buried his body, Jesus having heard what was done, departed thence by ship into a desert place apart.[fn-10-P1083_479849:48-nf] Now the Lord did these things and so taught. But would that these men of whom I speak, had the modesty to confine their rashness to men only, without daring to be guilty of such madness as to accuse the Saviour himself of `cowardice'; especially after having already uttered blasphemies against him. But even if they be insane they will not be tolerated and their ignorance of the gospels be detected by every one. The cause for retreat and flight under such circumstances as these is reasonable and valid, of which the evangelists have afforded us precedents in the conduct of our Saviour himself: from which it may be inferred that the saints have always been justly influenced by the same principle, since whatever is recorded of him as man, is applicable to mankind in general.

You have suggested these circumstances, and you ask which of these two took the better course. I think that you will agree with me that the latter was the more praiseworthy. No one ought to withdraw himself from life unbidden, but should await either a natural or a violent death. Our Lord gave us this lesson when He bade those that are persecuted in one city flee to another and again commanded them to quit even this and depart to another.[fn-53-P5347_1287315:5-nf] In obedience to this teaching the divine Apostle escaped the violence of the governor of the city, and had no hesitation in speaking of the manner of his flight, but spoke of the basket, the wall, and the window, and boasted and glorified in the act.[fn-53-P5348_1287583:6-nf] For what looks discreditable is made honourable by the divine command. In the same manner the Apostle called himself at one time a Pharisee[fn-53-P5349_1288112:7-nf] and at another a Roman,[fn-53-P5350_1288154:8-nf] not because he was afraid of death, but acting quite fairly in fight.[fn-53-P5351_1288242:9-nf] In the same way when he had learnt the Jews' plot against him he appealed to Caesar[fn-53-P5352_1288391:10-nf] and sent his sister's son to the chief captain to report the designs hatched against him, not because he clung to this present life, but in obedience to the divine law. For assuredly our Lord does not wish us to throw ourselves into obvious peril; and this is taught us by deed as well as by word, for more than once He avoided the murderous violence of the Jews. And the great Peter, first of the Apostles, when he was loosed from his chains and had escaped from the hands of Herod, came to the house of John, who was surnamed Mark, and after removing the anxiety of his friends by his visit and bidding them maintain silence, betook himself to another house in the endeavour to conceal himself more effectually by the removal.[fn-53-P5353_1289139:11-nf] And we shall find just the same kind of wisdom in the old Testament, for the famous Moses, after playing the man in his struggle with the Egyptian and finding out the next day that the homicide had become known, ran away, travelled a long journey, and arrived at the land of Midian.[fn-53-P5354_1289446:12-nf] In like manner the great Elias when he had learnt Jezebel's threats did not give himself up to them which wished to kill him, but left the world and hurried to the desert.[fn-53-P5355_1289641:13-nf] And if it is right and agreeable to God to escape the violence of our enemies, surely it is much more right to refuse to obey them when they order a man to become his own murderer.

Except that not even He[fn-62-P6208_1854631:904-nf] would have inveighed against them, if He had not dwelt among them of old in the law and by the prophets, and with mighty deeds and many mercies, and had always experienced them to be \"faithless.\" But, behold, Christ takes[fn-62-P6209_1854930:905-nf] infants, and teaches how all ought to be like them, if they ever wish to be greater.[fn-62-P6210_1855041:906-nf] The Creator, on the contrary,[fn-62-P6211_1855095:907-nf] let loose bears against children, in order to avenge His prophet Elisha, who had been mocked by them.[fn-62-P6212_1855211:908-nf] This antithesis is impudent enough, since it throws together[fn-62-P6213_1855298:909-nf] things so different as infants[fn-62-P6214_1855347:910-nf] and children,[fn-62-P6215_1855378:911-nf] -an age still innocent, and one already capable of discretion-able to mock, if not to blaspheme. As therefore God is a just God, He spared not impious children, exacting as He does honour for every time of life, and especially, of course, from youth. And as God is good, He so loves infants as to have blessed the midwives in Egypt, when they protected the infants of the Hebrews[fn-62-P6216_1855787:912-nf] which were in peril from Pharaoh's command.[fn-62-P6217_1855855:913-nf] Christ therefore shares this kindness with the Creator. As indeed for Marcion's god, who is an enemy to marriage, how can he possibly seem to be a lover of little children, which are simply the issue of marriage? He who hates the seed must needs also detest the fruit. Yea, he ought to be deemed more ruthless than the king of Egypt.[fn-62-P6218_1856211:914-nf] For whereas Pharaoh forbade infants to be brought up, he will not allow them even to be born, depriving them of their ten months' existence in the womb. And how much more credible it is, that kindness to little children should be attributed to Him who blessed matrimony for the procreation of mankind, and in such benediction included also the promise of connubial fruit itself, the first of which is that of infancy![fn-62-P6219_1856689:915-nf] The Creator, at the request of Elias, inflicts the blow[fn-62-P6220_1856834:916-nf] of fire from heaven in the case of that false prophet (of Baalzebub).[fn-62-P6221_1856932:917-nf] I recognise herein the severity of the Judge. And I, on the contrary, the severe rebuke[fn-62-P6222_1857044:918-nf] of Christ on His disciples, when they were for inflicting[fn-62-P6223_1857475:919-nf] a like visitation on that obscure village of the Samaritans.[fn-62-P6224_1857556:920-nf] The heretic, too, may discover that this gentleness of Christ was promised by the selfsame severest Judge. \"He shall not contend,\" says He, \"nor shall His voice be heard in the street; a bruised reed shall He not crush, and smoking flax shall He not quench.\"[fn-62-P6225_1857838:921-nf] Being of such a character, He was of course much the less disposed to burn men. For even at that time the Lord said to Elias,[fn-62-P6226_1857987:922-nf] \"He was not in the fire, but in the still small voice.\"[fn-62-P6227_1858082:923-nf] Well, but why does this most humane and merciful God reject the man who offers himself to Him as an inseparable companion?[fn-62-P6228_1858229:924-nf] If it were from pride or from hypocrisy that he had said, \"I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest, ' then, by judicially reproving an act of either pride or hypocrisy as worthy of rejection, He performed the office of a Judge. And, of course, him whom He rejected He condemned to the loss of not following the Saviour.[fn-62-P6229_1858577:925-nf] For as He calls to salvation him whom He does not reject, or him whom He voluntarily invites, so does He consign to perdition him whom He rejects. When, however, He answers the man, who alleged as an excuse his father's burial, \"Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God,\"[fn-62-P6230_1858947:926-nf] He gave a clear confirmation to those two laws of the Creator-that in Leviticus, which concerns the sacerdotal office, and forbids the priests to be present at the funerals even of their parents. \"The priest,\" says He, \"shall not enter where there is any dead person;[fn-62-P6231_1859238:927-nf] and for his father he shall not be defiled\"[fn-62-P6232_1859307:928-nf] ; as well as that in Numbers, which relates to the (Nazarite) vow of separation; for there he who devotes himself to God, among other things, is bidden \"not to come at any dead body,\" not even of his father, or his mother, or his brother.[fn-62-P6233_1859601:929-nf] Now it was, I suppose, for the Nazarite and the priestly office that He intended this man whom He had been inspiring[fn-62-P6234_1859740:930-nf] to preach the kingdom of God. Or else, if it be not so, he must be pronounced impious enough who, without the intervention of any precept of the law, commanded that burials of parents should be neglected by their sons. When, indeed, in the third case before us, (Christ) forbids the man \"to look back\" who wanted first \"to bid his family farewell,\" He only follows out the rule[fn-62-P6235_1860135:931-nf] of the Creator. For this (retrospection) He had been against their making, whom He had rescued out of Sodom.[fn-62-P6236_1860259:932-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Justly, therefore, was the hypocrisy of the Pharisees displeasing to Him, loving God as they did with their lips, but not with their heart. \"Beware,\" He says to the disciples, \"of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy,\" not the proclamation of the Creator. The Son hates those who refused obedience[fn-64-P6458_1904078:1138-nf] to the Father; nor does He wish His disciples to show such a disposition towards Him-not (let it be observed) towards another god, against whom such hypocrisy indeed might have been admissible, as that which He wished to guard His disciples against. It is the example of the Pharisees which He forbids. It was in respect of Him against whom the Pharisees were sinning that (Christ) now forbade His disciples to offend. Since, then, He had censured their hypocrisy, which covered the secrets of the heart, and obscured with superficial offices the mysteries of unbelief, because (while holding the key of knowledge) it would neither enter in itself, nor permit others to enter in, He therefore adds, \"There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall not be known,\"[fn-64-P6459_1904892:1139-nf] in order that no one should suppose that He was attempting the revelation and the recognition of an hitherto unknown and hidden god. When He remarks also on their murmurs and taunts, in saying of Him, \"This man casteth out devils only through Beelzebub,\" He means that all these imputations would come forth to the light of day, and be in the mouths of men in consequence of the promulgation of the Gospel. He then turns to His disciples with these words, \"I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them which can only kill the body, and after that have no more power over you.\"[fn-64-P6460_1905496:1140-nf] They will, however, find Isaiah had already said, \"See how the just man is taken away, and no man layeth it to heart.\"[fn-64-P6461_1905637:1141-nf] \"But I will show you whom ye shall fear: fear Him who, after He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell\" (meaning, of course, the Creator); \"yea, I say unto you, fear Him.\"[fn-64-P6462_1905836:1142-nf] Now, it would here be enough for my purpose that He forbids offence being given to Him whom He orders to be feared; and that He orders Him to be respected[fn-64-P6463_1906013:1143-nf] whom He forbids to be offended; and that He who gives these commands belongs to that very God for whom He procures this fear, this absence of offence, and this respect. But this conclusion I can draw also from the following words: \"For I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before God.\"[fn-64-P6464_1906360:1144-nf] Now they who shall confess Christ will have to be slain[fn-64-P6465_1906438:1145-nf] before men, but they will have nothing more to suffer after they have been put to death by them. These therefore will be they whom He forewarns above not to be afraid of being only killed; and this forewarning He offers, in order that He might subjoin a clause on the necessity of confessing Him: \"Every one that denieth me before men shall be denied before God\"[fn-64-P6466_1906827:1146-nf] -by Him, of course, who would have confessed him, if he had only confessed God. Now, He who will confess the confessor is the very same God who will also deny the denier of Himself. Again, if it is the confessor who will have nothing to fear after his violent death,[fn-64-P6467_1907116:1147-nf] it is the denier to whom everything will become fearful after his natural death. Since, therefore, that which will have to be feared after death, even the punishment of hell, belongs to the Creator, the denier, too, belongs to the Creator. As with the denier, however, so with the confessor: if he should deny God, he will plainly have to suffer from God, although from men he had nothing more to suffer after they had put him to death. And so Christ is the Creator's, because He shows that all those who deny Him ought to fear the Creator's hell. After deterring His disciples from denial of Himself, He adds an admonition to fear blasphemy: \"Whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him.\"[fn-64-P6468_1907939:1148-nf] Now, if both the remission and the retention of sin savour of a judicial God, the Holy Ghost, who is not to be blasphemed, will belong to Him, who will not forgive the, blasphemy; just as He who, in the preceding passage, was not to be denied, belonged to, Him who would, after He had killed, also cast into hell. Now, since it is Christ who averts blasphemy from the Creator, I am at a loss to know in what manner His adversary.[fn-64-P6469_1908392:1149-nf] could have come. Else, if by these sayings He throws a black cloud of censure[fn-64-P6470_1908532:1150-nf] over the severity of Him who will not forgive blasphemy and will kill even to hell, it follows that the very spirit of that rival god may be blasphemed with impunity, and his Christ denied; and that there is no difference, in fact, between worshipping and despising him; but that, as there is no punishment for the contempt, so there is no reward for the worship, which men need expect. When \"brought before magistrates,\" and examined, He forbids them \"to take thought how they shall answer; \"\"for,\" says He, \"the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say.\"[fn-64-P6471_1909133:1151-nf] If such an injunction[fn-64-P6472_1909182:1152-nf] as this comes from the Creator, the precept will only be His by whom an example was previously given. The prophet Balaam, in Numbers, when sent forth by king Balak to curse lsrµl, with whom he was commencing war, was at the same moment[fn-64-P6473_1909439:1153-nf] filled with the Spirit. Instead of the curse which he was come to pronounce, he uttered the blessing which the Spirit at that very hour inspired him with; having previously declared to the king's messengers, and then to the king himself, that he could only speak forth that which God should put into his mouth.[fn-64-P6474_1909766:1154-nf] The novel doctrines of the new Christ are such as the Creator's servants initiated long before! But see how clear a difference there is between the example of Moses and of Christ.[fn-64-P6475_1909972:1155-nf] Moses voluntarily interferes with brothers[fn-64-P6476_1910048:1156-nf] who were quarrelling, and chides the offender: \"Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? \"He is, however, rejected by him: \"Who made thee a prince or a judge over us? \"[fn-64-P6477_1910251:1157-nf] Christ, on the contrary, when requested by a certain man to compose a strife between him and his brother about dividing an inheritance, refused His assistance, although in so honest a cause. Well, then, my Moses is better than your Christ, aiming as he did at the peace of brethren, and obviating their wrong. But of course the case must be different with Christ, for he is the Christ of the simply good and non-judicial god. \"Who,\" says he, \"made me a judge over you? \"[fn-64-P6478_1910747:1158-nf] No other word of excuse was he able to find, without using[fn-64-P6479_1910834:1159-nf] that with which the wicked, man and impious brother had rejected[fn-64-P6480_1910921:1160-nf] the defender of probity and piety! In short, he approved of the excuse, although a bad one, by his use of it; and of the act, although a bad one, by his refusal to make peace between brothers. Or rather, would He not show His resentment[fn-64-P6481_1911222:1161-nf] at the rejection of Moses with such a word? And therefore did He not wish in a similar case of contentious brothers, to confound them with the recollection of so harsh a word? Clearly so. For He had Himself been present in Moses, who heard such a rejection-even He, the Spirit of the Creator.[fn-64-P6482_1911549:1162-nf] I think that we have already, in another passage,[fn-64-P6483_1911778:1163-nf] sufficiently shown that the glory of riches is condemned by our God, \"who putteth down the mighty from their throne, and exalts the poor from the dunghill.\"[fn-64-P6484_1911990:1164-nf] From Him, therefore, will proceed the parable of the rich man, who flattered himself about the increase of his fields, and to Whom God said: \"Thou fool, this night shall they require thy soul of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided? \"[fn-64-P6485_1912314:1165-nf] It was just in the like manner that the king Hezekiah heard from Isaiah the sad doom of his kingdom, when he gloried, before the envoys of Babylon,[fn-64-P6486_1912488:1166-nf] in his treasures and the deposits of his precious things.[fn-64-P6487_1912568:1167-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"5. Furthermore, as to those critics who find a difficulty in the circumstance that Matthew enumerates one series of ancestors, beginning With David and travelling downwards to Joseph,[fn-13-P1365_545684:12-nf] while Luke specifies a different succession, tracing it from Joseph upwards as far as to David,[fn-13-P1366_545800:13-nf] they might easily perceive that Joseph may have had two fathers,-namely, one by whom he was begotten, and a second by whom he may have been adopted.[fn-13-P1367_545971:14-nf] For it was an ancient custom also among that people to adopt children with the view of making sons for themselves of those whom they had not begotten. For, leaving out of sight the fact that Pharaoh's daughter[fn-13-P1368_547253:15-nf] adopted Moses (as she was a foreigner), Jacob himself adopted his own grandsons, the sons of Joseph, in these very intelligible terms: \"Now, therefore, thy two sons which were born unto thee before I came unto thee, are mine: Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon: and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine.\"[fn-13-P1369_547618:16-nf] Whence also it came to pass that there were twelve tribes of Israel, although the tribe of Levi was omitted, which did service in the temple; for along with that one the whole number was thirteen, the sons of Jacob themselves being twelve. Thus, too, we can understand how Luke, in the genealogy contained in his Gospel, has named a father for Joseph, not in the person of the father by whom he was begotten, but in that of the father by whom he was adopted, tracing the list of the progenitors upwards until David is reached. For, seeing that there is a necessity, as both evangelists give a true narrative,-to wit, both Matthew and Luke,-that one of them should hold by the line of the father who begat Joseph, and the other by the line of the father who adopted him, whom should we suppose more likely to have preserved the lineage of the adopting father, than that evangelist who has declined to speak of Joseph as begotten by the person whose son he has nevertheless reported him to be? For it is more appropriate that one should have been called the son of the man by whom he was adopted, than that he should be said to have been begotten by the man of whose flesh he was not descended. Now when Matthew, accordingly, used the phrases, \"Abraham begat Isaac,\" \"Isaac begat Jacob,\" and so on, keeping steadily by the term \"begat,\" until he said at the close, \"and Jacob begat Joseph,\" he gave us to know with sufficient clearness, that he had traced out the order[fn-13-P1370_549110:17-nf] of ancestors on to that father by whom Joseph was not adopted, but begotten.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_25_answer_to_eunomius_second_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But since the nature of most things that are seen in Creation is not simple, so as to allow of all that they connote being comprehended in one word, as, for instance, in the case of fire, the element itself is one thing in its nature, while the word which denotes it is another (for fire itself possesses the qualities of shining, of burning, of drying and heating, and consuming whatever fuel it lays hold of, but the name is but a brief word of one syllable), on this account speech, which distinguishes the powers and qualities seen in fire, gives each of them a name of its own, as I have said before. And one cannot say that only a name has been given to fire when it is spoken of as bright, or consuming, or anything else that we observe it to be. For such words denote qualities physically inherent in it. So likewise, in the case of heaven and the firmament, though one nature is signified by each of these words, their difference represents one or other of its peculiar characteristics, in looking at which we learn one thing by the appellation \"heaven,\" and another by \"firmament.\" For when speech would define the limit of sensible creation, beyond which it is succeeded by the transmundane void apprehended by the mind alone, in contrast with the intangible and incorporeal and invisible, the beginning and the end of all material subsistences is called the firmament. And when we survey the environment of terrestrial things, we call that which encompasses all material nature, and which forms the boundary of all things visible, by the name of heaven. In the same manner with regard to earth and dry land, since all heavy and downward-tending nature was divided into these two elements, earth and water, the appellation \"dry\" defines to a certain extent its opposite, for earth is called dry in opposition to moist, since having thrown off, by Divine command, the water that overspread it, it appeared in its own character. But the name \"earth\" does not continue to express the signification of some one only of its qualities, but, by virtue of its meaning, it embraces all that the word connotes, e.g. hardness, density, weight, resistance, capability of supporting animal and vegetable life. Accordingly, the word \"dry\" was not changed by speech to the last name put upon it (for its new name did not make it cease to be called so), but while both the appellations remained, a peculiar signification attached itself to each, the one distinguishing it in nature and property from its opposite, the other embracing all its attributes collectively. And so in light and day, and again in night and darkness, we do not find a pronunciation of syllables created to suit them by the Maker of all things, but rather through these appellations we note the substance of the things which they signify. At the entrance of light, by the will of God the darkness that prevailed over the earliest creation is scattered. But the earth lying in the midst, and being upheld on all sides by its surrounding of different elements, as Job saith, \"He hangeth the earth upon nothing[fn-22-P2279_1476050:65-nf] ,\" it was necessary when light travelled over one side and the earth obstructed it on the opposite by its own bulk, that a side of darkness should be left by the obscuration, and so, as the perpetual motion of the heavens cannot but carry along with it the darkness resulting from the obscuration, God ordained this revolution for a measure of duration of time. And that measure is day and night. For this reason Moses, according to his wisdom, in his historical elucidation of these matters, named the shadow resulting from the earth's obstruction, a dividing of the light from the darkness, and the constant and measured alternation of light and darkness over the surface of the earth he called day and night. So that what was called light was not named day, but as \"there was light,\" and not the bare name of light, so the measure of time also was created and the name followed, not created by God in a sound of words, but because the very nature of the thing assumed this vocal notation. And as, if it had been plainly said by the Lawgiver that nothing that is seen or named is of spontaneous generation or unfashioned, but that it has its subsistence from God, we might have concluded of ourselves that God made the world and all its parts, and the order which is seen in them, and the faculty of distinguishing them, so also by what he says he leads us on to understand and believe that nothing which exists is without beginning. And with this view he describes the successive events of Creation in orderly method, enumerating them one after another. But it was impossible to represent them in language, except by expressing their signification by words that should indicate it. Since, then, it is written that God called the light day, it must be understood that God made the day from light, being something different, by the force of the term. For you cannot apply the same definition to \"light\" and \"day,\" but light is what we understand by the opposite of darkness, and day is the extent of the measure of the interval of light. In the same way you may regard night and darkness by the same difference of description, defining darkness as the negation of light, and calling night the extent of the encompassing darkness. Thus in every way our argument is confirmed, though not, perhaps, drawn out in strict logical form-showing that God is the Maker of things, not of empty words. For things have their names not for His sake but for ours. For as we cannot always have all things before our eyes, we take knowledge of some of the things that are present with us from time to time, and others we register in our memories. But it would be impossible to keep memory unconfused unless we had the notation of words to distinguish the things that are stored up in our minds from one another. But to God all things are present, nor does He need memory, all things being within the range of His penetrating vision. What need, then, in His case, of parts of speech, when His own wisdom and power embraces and holds the nature of all things distinct and unconfused? Wherefore all things that exist substantially are from God; but, for our guidance, all things that exist are provided with names to indicate them. And if any one say that such names were imposed by the arbitrary usage of mankind, he will be guilty of no offence against the scheme of Divine Providence. For we do not say that the nature of things was of human invention, but only their names. The Hebrew calls Heaven by one name, the Canaanite by another, but both of them understand it alike, being in no way led into error by the difference of the sounds that convey the idea of the object. But the over-cautious and timid will-worship of these clever folk, on whose authority he asserts that, if it were granted that words were given to things by men, men would be of higher authority than God, is proved to be unsubstantial even by the example which we find recorded of Moses. For who gave Moses his name? Was it not Pharaoh's daughter who named him from what had happened[fn-22-P2280_1480112:66-nf] ? For water is called Moses in the language of the Egyptians. Since, then, in consequence of the tyrant's order, his parents had placed the babe in an ark and consigned it to the stream (for so some related concerning him), but by the will of God the ark was floated by the current and carried to the bank, and found by the princess, who happened just then to be taking the refreshment of the bath, as the child had been gained \"from the water,\" she is said to have given him his name as a memorial of the occurrence,-a name by which God Himself did not disdain to address His servant, nor did He deem it beneath Him to allow the name given by the foreign woman to remain the Prophet's proper appellation.","title":"Answer to Eunomius' Second Book","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_18_sermon_i_li_benedictine_edition_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"28. And let not the law of adoption seem to you to be foreign to our Scriptures, and that, as if it were recognised[fn-30-P3012_1332469:91-nf] only in the practice of I human laws, it cannot fall in with the authority of the divine books. For it is a thing established of old time, and frequently heard of in the Ecclesiastical books[fn-30-P3013_1332679:92-nf] -that not only the natural way of birth, but the free choice[fn-30-P3014_1332761:93-nf] of the will also, should give birth to a child. For women, if they had no children of their own, used to adopt children born of their husbands by their hand-maids, and even oblige their husbands to give them children in this way; as Sarah, Rachel, and Leah.[fn-30-P3015_1333032:94-nf] And in doing this the husbands did not commit adultery, in that they obeyed their wives in that matter which had regard to conjugal duty, according to what the Apostle saith: \"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.\"[fn-30-P3016_1333369:95-nf] Moses too, who was born of a Hebrew mother and was exposed, was adopted by Pharaoh's daughter.[fn-30-P3017_1333484:96-nf] There were not then indeed the same forms oflaw as now, but the choice of the will was taken for the rule of law, as the Apostle saith also in another place, \"The Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law.\"[fn-30-P3018_1333746:97-nf] But if it is permitted to women to make those their children to whom they have not given birth, why should it not be allowed men to do so too with those whom they have not begotten of their body, but of the love of adoption. For we read that the patriarch Jacob even, the father of so many children, made his grandchildren, the sons of Joseph, his own children, in these words: \"These too shall be mine, and they shall receive the land with their brethren, and those which thou begettest after them shall be thine.\"[fn-30-P3019_1334281:98-nf] But it will be said, perhaps, that this word \"adoption\" is not found in the Holy Scriptures. As though it were of any importance by what name it is called, when the thing itself is there-for a woman to have a child to whom she has not given birth, or a man a child whom he has not begotten. And he may, without any opposition from me, refuse to call Joseph adopted, provided he grant that he may have been the son of a man of whose body he was not born. Yet the Apostle Paul does continually use this very word \"adoption,\" and[fn-30-P3020_1334832:99-nf] that to express a great mystery. For though Scripture testifies that our Lord Jesus Christ is the only Son of God, it says, that the brethren and coheirs whom He hath vouchsafed to have, are made so by a kind of adoption through Divine grace. \"When,\" saith he, \"the fulness of time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.\"[fn-30-P3021_1335297:100-nf] And in another place: \"We groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.\"[fn-30-P3022_1335432:101-nf] And again, when he was speaking of the Jews, \"I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh; who are Israelites, to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the testaments, and the giving of the law; whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, Who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-30-P3023_1335830:102-nf] Where he shows, that the word \"adoption,\" or at least the thing which it signifies, was of ancient use among the Jews, just as was the Testament and the giving of the Law, which he mentions together with it.","title":"Sermon I.

Now, Bethany, as the same evangelist tells us,[fn-68-P6878_1281319:116-nf] was the town of Lazarus, and of Martha and Mary; it is fifteen stadia from Jerusalem, anti the river Jordan is about a hundred and eighty stadia distant from it. Nor is there any other place of the same name in the neighbourhood of the Jordan, but they say that Bethabara is pointed out on the banks of the Jordan, and that John is said to have baptized there. The etymology of the name, too, corresponds with the baptism of him who made ready for the Lord a people prepared for Him; for it yields the meaning \"House of preparation,\" while Bethany means \"House of obedience.\" Where else was it fitting that he should baptize, who was sent as a messenger before the face of the Christ, to prepare His way before Him, but at the House of preparation? And what more fitting home for Mary, who chose the good part,[fn-68-P6879_1282154:117-nf] which was not taken away from her, and for Martha, who was cumbered for the reception of Jesus, and for their brother, who is called the friend of the Saviour, than Bethany, the House of obedience? Thus we see that he who aims at a complete understanding of the Holy Scriptures must not neglect the careful examination of the proper names in it. In the matter of proper names the Greek copies are often incorrect, and in the Gospels one might be misled by their authority. The transaction about the swine, which were driven down a steep place by the demons and drowned in the sea, is said to have taken place in the country of the Gerasenes.[fn-68-P6880_1282819:118-nf] Now, Gerasa is a town of Arabia, and has near it neither sea nor lake. And the Evangelists would not have made a statement so obviously and demonstrably false; for they were men who informed themselves carefully of all matters connected with Judaea. But in a few copies we have found, \"into the country of the Gadarenes; \"and, on this reading, it is to be stated that Gadara is a town of Judaea, in the neighbourhood of which are the well-known hot springs, and that there is no lake there with overhanging banks, nor any sea. But Gergesa, from which the name Gergesenes is taken, is an old town in the neighbourhood of the lake now called Tiberias, and on the edge of it there is a steep place abutting on the lake, from which it is pointed out that the swine were cast down by the demons. Now, the meaning of Gergesa is \"dwelling of the casters-out,\" and it contains a prophetic reference to the conduct towards the Saviour of the citizens of those places, who \"besought Him to depart out of their coasts.\" The same inaccuracy with regard to proper names is also to be observed in many passages of the law and the prophets, as we have been at pains to learn from the Hebrews, comparing our own copies with theirs which have the confirmation of the versions, never subjected to corruption, of Aquila and Theodotion and Symmachus. We add a few instances to encourage students to pay more attention to such points. One of the sons of Levi,[fn-68-P6881_1284318:119-nf] the first, is called Geson in most copies, instead of Gerson. His name is the same as that of the first-born of Moses;[fn-68-P6882_1284471:120-nf] it was given appropriately in each case, both children being born, because of the sojourn in Egypt, in a strange land. The second son of Juda,[fn-68-P6883_1284633:121-nf] again, has with us the name Annan, but with the Hebrews Onan, \"their labour.\" Once more, in the departures of the children of Israel in Numbers,[fn-68-P6884_1284802:122-nf] we find, \"They departed from Sochoth and pitched in Buthan; \"but the Hebrew, instead of Buthan, reads Aiman. And why should I add more points like these, when any one who desires it can examine into the proper names and find out for himself how they stand? The place-names of Scripture are specially to be suspected where many of them occur in a catalogue, as in the account of the partition of the country in Joshua, and in the first Book of Chronicles from the beginning down to, say, the passage about Dan,[fn-68-P6885_1285330:123-nf] and similarly in Ezra. Names are not to be neglected, since indications may be gathered from them which help in the interpretation of the passages where they occur. We cannot, however, leave our proper subject to examine in this place into the philosophy of names.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":61,"source_paragraph":"402","folder":"ANF-01","text":"When I had spoken these words, I continued: \"Permit me, further, to show you from the book of Exodus how this same One, who is both Angel, and God, and Lord, and man, and who appeared in human form to Abraham and Isaac,[fn-45-P4569_960824:214-nf] appeared in a flame of fire from the bush, and conversed with Moses.\" And after they said they would listen cheerfully, patiently, and eagerly, I went on: \"These words are in the book which bears the title of Exodus: `And after many days the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel groaned by reason of the works; '[fn-45-P4570_961301:215-nf] and so on until, `Go and gather the elders of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I am surely beholding you, and the things which have befallen you in Egypt.'\"[fn-45-P4571_961601:216-nf] In addition to these words, I went on: \"Have you perceived, sirs, that this very God whom Moses speaks of as an Angel that talked to him in the flame of fire, declares to Moses that He is the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob? \"","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_57_book_i","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"257","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Moses, originally of a Chaldean[fn-53-P5384_1641982:302-nf] family, was born in Egypt, his ancestors having migrated from Babylon into Egypt on account of a protracted famine. Born in the seventh generation[fn-53-P5385_1642271:303-nf] and having received a royal education, the following are the circumstances of his history. The Hebrews having increased in Egypt to a great multitude, and the king of the country being afraid of insurrection in consequence of their numbers, he ordered all the female children born to the Hebrews to be reared (woman being unfit for war), but the male to be destroyed, being suspicious of stalwart youth. But the child being goodly, his parents nursed him secretly three months, natural affection being too strong for the monarch's cruelty. But at last, dreading lest they should be destroyed along with the child, they made a basket of the papyrus that grew there, put the child in it, and laid it on the banks of the marshy river. The child's sister stood at a distance, and watched what would happen. In this emergency, the king's daughter, who for a long time had not been pregnant, and who longed for a child, came that day to the river to bathe and wash herself; and hearing the child cry, she ordered it to be brought to her; and touched with pity, sought a nurse. At that moment the child's sister ran up, and said that, if she wished, she could procure for her as nurse one of the Hebrew women who had recently had a child. And on her consenting and desiring her to do so, she brought the child's mother to be nurse for a stipulated fee, as if she had been some other person. Thereupon the queen gave the babe the name of Moses, with etymological propriety, from his being drawn out of \"the water,\"[fn-53-P5386_1643906:304-nf] -for the Egyptians call water \"mou,\"-in which he had been exposed to die. For they call Moses one who \"who breathed [on being taken] from the water.\" It is clear that previously the parents gave a name to the child on his circumcision; and he was called Joachim. And he had a third name in heaven, after his ascension,[fn-53-P5387_1644250:305-nf] as the mystics say-Melchi. Having reached the proper age, he was taught arithmetic, geometry, poetry, harmony, and besides, medicine and music, by those that excelled in these arts among the Egyptians; and besides, the philosophy which is conveyed by symbols, which they point out in the hieroglyphical inscriptions. The rest of the usual course of instruction, Greeks taught him in Egypt as a royal child, as Philo says in his life of Moses. He learned, besides, the literature of the Egyptians, and the knowledge of the heavenly bodies from the Chaldeans and the Egyptians; whence in the Acts[fn-53-P5388_1645020:306-nf] he is said \"to have been instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.\" And Eupolemus, in his book On the Kings in Judea, says that \"Moses was the first wise man, and the first that imparted grammar to the Jews, that the Phoenicians received it from the Jews, and the Greeks from the Phoenicians.\" And betaking himself to their philosophy,[fn-53-P5389_1645382:307-nf] he increased his wisdom, being ardently attached to the training received from his kindred and ancestors, till he struck and slew the Egyptian who wrongfully attacked the Hebrew. And the mystics say that he slew the Egyptian by a word only; as, certainly, Peter in the Acts is related to have slain by speech those who appropriated part of the price of the field, and lied.[fn-53-P5390_1645830:308-nf] And so Artapanus, in his work On the Jews, relates \"that Moses, being shut up in custody by Chenephres, king of the Egyptians, on account of the people demanding to be let go from Egypt, the prison being opened by night, by the interposition of God, went forth, and reaching the palace, stood before the king as he slept, and aroused him; and that the latter, struck with what had taken place, bade Moses tell him the name of the God who had sent him; and that he, bending forward, told him in his ear; and that the king on hearing it fell speechless, but being supported by Moses, revived again.\" And respecting the education of Moses, we shall find a harmonious account in Ezekiel,[fn-53-P5391_1646532:309-nf] the composer of Jewish tragedies in the drama entitled The Exodus.

The patriarch Abraham was both most friendly treated, and presented with a token of friendship, by a king who had been warned from heaven not to defile his wife.[fn-53-P5376_2590939:274-nf] Isaac his son likewise found a king most friendly to him.[fn-53-P5377_2591013:275-nf] Jacob, being received with honor by a king in Egypt, went so far as to bless him.[fn-53-P5378_2591117:276-nf] What shall I say of his son Joseph, who, after the tribulation of a prison, in which his chastity was tried as gold is tried in the fire, being raised by Pharaoh to great honors,[fn-53-P5379_2591315:277-nf] even swore by the life of Pharaoh,[fn-53-P5380_2591375:278-nf] -not as though puffed up with vain conceit, but being not unmindful of his kindness. The daughter of a king adopted Moses.[fn-53-P5381_2591520:279-nf] David took refuge with a king of another race, compelled thereto by the unrighteousness of the king of Israel.[fn-53-P5382_2591650:280-nf] Elijah ran before the chariot of a most wicked king,-not by the king's command, but from his own loyalty.[fn-53-P5383_2591777:281-nf] Elisha thought it good to offer of his own accord to the woman who had sheltered him anything that she might wish to have obtained from the king through his intercession.[fn-53-P5384_2591977:282-nf] But I will come to the actual times when the people of God were in captivity, in which, to use a mild expression, a strange forgetfulness came over you. For, wishing to prove that Christianity has never found anything in kings saving envy towards her, you made mention of the three children and Daniel, who suffered at the hands of persecuting kings, and you could not derive instruction from circumstances not occurring near, but in the very same passages, viz., from the conduct of the king himself after the miracle of the flames which did no hurt, whether as shown in praising and setting forth the name of God, or in honoring the three children themselves, or from the esteem in which the king held Daniel, and the gifts with which he honored him, nothing loth to receive them, when he, rendering the honor that was due to the king's power, as sufficiently appears from his own words, did not hesitate to use the gift with which he was endowed by God, in interpreting the king's dream. And when, in consequence, the king was compelled by the men who envied the holy prophet, and heaped calumnies upon him with sacrilegious madness, most unwillingly to cast him into the den of lions, sadly though he did it, yet he had the conviction that he would be safe through the help and protection of his God. Accordingly, when Daniel, by the miraculous repression of the lions' rage, had been preserved unhurt, when the friendly voice of the king spoke first to him, in accents of anxiety, he himself replied with benediction from the den, \"O king, live for ever!\"[fn-53-P5385_2593562:283-nf] How came it that, when your argument was turning on the very same subject, when you were yourself quoting the examples of the servants of God in whose case these things were done, you either failed to see, or were unwilling to see, or seeing and knowing, were silent, in a manner which I know not how you will defend, about those instances of friendship felt by kings for the saints? But if it were not that, as a defender of the basest cause, you are hindered by the desire of building up falsehood, and thereby turned away either as unwilling or as ignorant from the light of truth, there can be no doubt that you could, without any difficulty, recall some good kings as well as some bad ones, and some friendly to the saints as well as some unfriendly. And we cannot but wonder that your Circumcelliones thus throw themselves from precipices. Who was running after you, I pray? What Macarius, what soldier was pursuing you? Certainly none of our party thrust you into this abyss of falsehood. Why then did you thus run headlong with your eyes shut, so that when you said, \"What have you to do with the kings of this world?\" you did not add, In whom Christianity has often found envy towards herself, instead of boldly venturing to say, \"In whom Christianity has never found anything save envy towards her?\" Was it really true that you neither thought yourself, nor considered that those who read your writings would think, how many instances of kings there were that went against your views?
