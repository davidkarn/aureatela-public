In order, therefore, that the human mind might be purged from falsities of this kind, Holy Scripture, which suits itself to babes has not avoided words drawn from any class of things really existing, through which, as by nourishment, our understanding might rise gradually to things divine and transcendent. For, in speaking of God, it has both used words taken from things corporeal, as when it says, \"Hide me under the shadow of Thy wings;\"[fn-1-P175_53734:2-nf] and it has borrowed many things from the spiritual creature, whereby to signify that which indeed is not so, but must needs so be said: as, for instance, \"I the Lord thy God am a jealous God;\"[fn-1-P176_53943:3-nf] and, \"It repenteth me that I have made man.\"[fn-1-P177_54002:4-nf] But it has drawn no words whatever, whereby to frame either figures of speech or enigmatic sayings, from things which do not exist at all. And hence it is that they who are shut out from the truth by that third kind of error are more mischievously and emptily vain than their fellows; in that they surmise respecting God, what can neither be found in Himself nora in ny creature. For divine Scripture is wont to frame, as it were, allurements for children from the things which are found in the creature; whereby, according to their measure, and as it were by steps, the affections of the weak may be moved to seek those things that are above, and to leave those things that are below. But the same Scripture rarely employs those things which are spoken properly of God, and are not found in any creature; as, for instance, that which was said to Moses, \"I am that I am;\" and, \"I Am hath sent me to you.\"[fn-1-P178_54922:5-nf] For since both body and soul also are said in some sense to be, Holy Scripture certainly would not so express itself unless it meant to be understood in some special sense of the term. So, too, that which the Apostle says, \"Who only hath immortality.\"[fn-1-P179_55190:6-nf] Since the soul also both is said to be, and is, in a certain manner immortal, Scripture would not say \"only hath,\" unless because true immortality is unchangeableness; which no creature can possess, since it belongs to the creator alone.[fn-1-P180_55447:7-nf] So also James says, \"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.\"[fn-1-P181_55833:8-nf] So also David, \"Thou, shall change them, and they shall be changed; but Thou art the same.\"[fn-1-P182_55940:9-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"11. It is, then, for this reason nowhere written, that the Father is greater than the Holy Spirit, or that the Holy Spirit is less than God the Father, because the creature in which the Holy Spirit was to appear was not taken in the same way as the Son of man was taken, as the form in which the person of the Word of God Himself should be set forth not that He might possess the word of God, as other holy and wise men have possessed it, but \"above His fellows;\"[fn-4-P495_178258:37-nf] not certainly that He possessed the word more than they, so as to be of more surpassing wisdom than the rest were, but that He was the very Word Himself. For the word in the flesh is one thing, and the Word made flesh is another; i.e. the word in man is one thing, the Word that is man is another. For flesh is put for man, where it is said, \"The Word was made flesh;\"[fn-4-P496_178643:38-nf] and again, \"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\"[fn-4-P497_178719:39-nf] For it does not mean flesh without soul and without mind; but \"all flesh,\" is the same as if it were said, every man. The creature, then, in which the Holy Spirit should appear, was not so taken, as that flesh and human form were taken, of the Virgin Mary. For the Spirit did not beatify the dove, or the wind, or the fire, and join them for ever to Himself and to His person in unity and \"fashion.\"[fn-4-P498_179137:40-nf] Nor, again, is the nature of the Holy Spirit mutable and changeable; so that these things were not made of the creature, but He himself was turned and changed first into one and then into another, as water is changed into ice. But these things appeared at the seasons at which they ought to have appeared, the creature serving the Creator, and being changed and converted at the command of Him who remains immutably in Himself, in order to signify and manifest Him in such way as it was fit He should be signified and manifested to mortal men. Accordingly, although that dove is called the Spirit;[fn-4-P499_180250:41-nf] and in speaking of that fire, \"There appeared unto them,\" he says, \"cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance;[fn-5-P500_180480:42-nf] in order to show that the Spirit was manifested by that fire, as by the dove; yet we cannot call the Holy Spirit both God and a dove, or both God and fire, in the same way as we call the Son both God and man; nor as we call the Son the Lamb of God; which not only John the Baptist says, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\"[fn-5-P501_180813:43-nf] but also John the Evangelist sees the Lamb slain in the Apocalypse.[fn-5-P502_180899:44-nf] For that prophetic vision was not shown to bodily eyes through bodily forms, but in the spirit through spiritual images of bodily things. But whosoever saw that dove and that fire, saw them with their eyes. Although it may perhaps be disputed concerning the fire, whether it was seen by the eyes or in the spirit, on account of the form of the sentence. For the text does not say, They saw cloven tongues like fire, but, \"There appeared to them.\" But we are not wont to say with the same meaning, It appeared to me; as we say, I saw. And in those spiritual visions of corporeal images the usual expressions are, both, It appeared to me; and, I saw: but in those things which are shown to the eyes through express corporeal forms, the common expression is not, It appeared to me; but, I saw. There may, therefore, be a question raised respecting that fire, how it was seen; whether within in the spirit as it were outwardly, or really outwardly before the eyes of the flesh. But of that dove, which is said to have descended in a bodily form, no one ever doubted that it was seen by the eyes. Nor, again, as we call the Son a Rock (for it is written, \"And that Rock was Christ\"[fn-5-P503_182093:45-nf] ), can we so call the Spirits dove or fire. For that rock was a thing already created, and after the mode of its action was called by the name of Christ, whom it signified; like the stone placed under Jacob's head, and also anointed, which he took in order to signify the Lord;[fn-5-P504_182390:46-nf] or as Isaac was Christ, when he carried the wood for the sacrifice of himself.[fn-5-P505_182492:47-nf] A particular significative action was added to those already existing things; they did not, as that dove and fire, suddenly come into being in order simply so to signify. The dove and the fire, indeed, seem to me more like that flame which appeared to Moses in the bush,[fn-5-P506_182782:48-nf] or that pillar which the people followed in the wilderness,[fn-5-P507_182860:49-nf] or the thunders and lightnings which came when the Law was given in the mount.[fn-5-P508_182962:50-nf] For the corporeal form of these things came into being for the very purpose, that it might signify something, and then pass away.[fn-5-P509_183110:51-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"23. But when Moses was sent to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt, it is written that the Lord appeared to him thus: \"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\"[fn-5-P565_210278:80-nf] He is here also first called the Angel of the Lord, and then God. Was an angel, then, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? Therefore He may be rightly understood to be the Saviour Himself, of whom the apostle says, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-5-P566_210652:81-nf] He, therefore, \"who is over all, God blessed for ever,\" is not unreasonably here understood also to be Himself the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. But why is He previously called the Angel of the Lord, when He appeared in a flame of fire out of the bush? Was it because it was one of many angels, who by an economy [or arrangement] bare the person of his Lord? or was something of the creature assumed by Him in order to bring about a visible appearance for the business in hand, and that words might thence be audibly uttered, whereby the presence of the Lord might be shown, in such way as was fitting, to the corporeal senses of man, by means of the creature made subject? For if he was one of the angels, who could easily affirm whether it was the person of the Son which was imposed upon him to announce, or that of the Holy Spirit, or that of God the Father, or altogether of the Trinity itself, who is the one and only God, in order that he might say, \"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?\" For we cannot say that the Son of God is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and that the Father is not; nor will any one dare to deny that either the Holy Spirit, or the Trinity itself, whom we believe and understand to be the one God, is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he who is not God, is not the God of those fathers. Furthermore, if not only the Father is God, as all, even heretics, admit; but also the Son, which, whether they will or not, they are compelled to acknowledge, since the apostle says, \"Who is over all, God blessed for ever;\" and the Holy Spirit, since the same apostle says, \"Therefore glorify God in your body;\" when he had said above, \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?\"[fn-5-P567_212549:82-nf] and these three are one God, as catholic soundness believes: it is not sufficiently apparent which person of the Trinity that angel bare, if he was one of the rest of the angels, and whether any person, and not rather that of the Trinity itself. But if the creature was assumed for the purpose of the business in hand, whereby both to appear to human eyes, and to sound in human ears, and to be called the Angel of the Lord, and the Lord, and God; then cannot God here be understood to be the Father, but either the Son or the Holy Spirit. Although I cannot call to mind that the Holy Spirit is anywhere else called an angel, which yet may be understood from His work; for it is said of Him, \"And He will show you[fn-5-P568_213287:83-nf] things to come;\"[fn-5-P569_213323:84-nf] and \"angel\" in Greek is certainly equivalent to \"messenger\"[fn-5-P570_213402:85-nf] in Latin: but we read most evidently of the Lord Jesus Christ in the prophet, that He is called \"the Angel of Great Counsel,\"[fn-5-P571_213544:86-nf] while both the Holy Spirit and the Son of God is God and Lord of the angels.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"24.

And do not allow the name word to appear mean to you, through the habit of daily words, for it is added, \"and the Word was God.\" This Word is He of whom yesterday we spoke much; and I trust that God was present, and that even from only thus much speaking something reached your hearts. \"In the beginning was the Word.\" He is the same, and is in the same manner; as He is, so He is always; He cannot be changed; that is, He is.

When, therefore, you see that all those things are variable, what is that which is, unless that which transcends all things which are so that they are not? Who then can receive this? Or who, in what manner soever he may have applied the strength of his mind to touch that which is, can reach to that which he may in any way have touched with his mind? It is as if one were to see his native land at a distance, and the sea intervening; he sees whither he would go, but he has not the means of going. So we desire to arrive at that our stability where that which is, because this alone always is as it is: the sea of this world interrupts our course, even although already we see whither we go; for many do not even see whither they go, That there might be a way by which we could go, He has come from Him to whom we wished to go. And what has He done? He has appointed a tree by which we may cross the sea. For no one is able to cross the sea of this world, unless borne by the cross of Christ.

If you think fit enact a decree; and then I shall not hesitate to speak of three hypostases. Order a new creed to supersede the Nicene; and then, whether we are Arians or orthodox, one confession will do for us all. In the whole range of secular learning hypostasis never means anything but essence. And can any one, I ask, be so profane as to speak of three essences or substances in the Godhead? There is one nature of God and one only; and this, and this alone, truly is. For absolute being is derived from no other source but is all its own. All things besides, that is all things created, although they appear to be, are not. For there was a time when they were not, and that which once was not may again cease to be. God alone who is eternal, that is to say, who has no beginning, really deserves to be called an essence. Therefore also He says to Moses from the bush, \"I am that I am,\" and Moses says of Him, \"I am hath sent me.\"[fn-5-P507_95261:288-nf] As the angels, the sky, the earth, the seas, all existed at the time, it must have been as the absolute being that God claimed for himself that name of essence, which apparently was common to all. But because His nature alone is perfect, and because in the three persons there subsists but one Godhead, which truly is and is one nature; whosoever in the name of religion declares that there are in the Godhead three elements, three hypostases, that is, or essences, is striving really to predicate three natures of God. And if this is true, why are we severed by walls from Arius, when in dishonesty we are one with him? Let Ursicinus be made the colleague of your blessedness; let Auxentius be associated with Ambrose.[fn-5-P508_96001:289-nf] But may the faith of Rome never come to such a pass! May the devout hearts of your people never be infected with such unholy doctrines! Let us be satisfied to speak of one substance and of three subsisting persons-perfect, equal, coeternal. Let us keep to one hypostasis, if such be your pleasure, and say nothing of three. It is a bad sign when those who mean the same thing use different words. Let us be satisfied with the form of creed which we have hitherto used. Or, if you think it right that I should speak of three hypostases, explaining what I mean by them, I am ready to submit. But, believe me, there is poison hidden under their honey; the angel of Satan has transformed himself into an angel of light.[fn-5-P509_96793:290-nf] They give a plausible explanation of the term hypostasis; yet when I profess to hold it in the same sense they count me a heretic. Why are they so tenacious of a word? Why do they shelter themselves under ambiguous language? If their belief corresponds to their explanation of it, I do not condemn them for keeping it. On the other hand, if my belief corresponds to their expressed opinions, they should allow me to set forth their meaning in my own words.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"330","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"Some people may be eunuchs from necessity; I am one of free will.[fn-7-P737_147404:461-nf] \"There is a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing.

But we have this consolation that it is slain by the word of the Lord.

Wherefore also the blessed apostle forbids us to sorrow concerning them which are asleep,[fn-31-P3140_821680:2274-nf] telling us to believe that those whom we know to sleep now may hereafter be roused from their sleep, and when their slumber is ended may watch once more with the saints and sing with the angels:-\"Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace among men of good will.\"[fn-31-P3141_821974:2275-nf] In heaven where there is no sin, there is glory and perpetual praise and unwearied singing; but on earth where sedition reigns, and war and discord hold sway, peace must be gained by prayer, and it is to be found not among all but only among men of good will, who pay heed to the apostolic salutation: \"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-31-P3142_822376:2276-nf] For \"His abode is in peace and His dwelling place is in Zion,\"[fn-31-P3143_822459:2277-nf] that is, on a watch-tower,[fn-31-P3144_822552:2278-nf] on a height of doctrines and of virtues, in the soul of the believer; for the angel of this latter daily beholds the face of God,[fn-31-P3145_822750:2279-nf] and contemplates with unveiled face the glory of God.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"876","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2.

But because these things are known to men, in that they are done by men, they may well meet with reverence as being holy things, but they cannot cause wonder as being miracles. And therefore those things which are done by angels are the more wonderful to us, in that they are more difficult and more known; but they are known and easy to them as being their own actions. An angel speaks in the person of God to man, saying, \"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;\" the Scripture having said just before, \"The angel of the Lord appeared to him.\"[fn-7-P748_286662:49-nf] And a man also speaks in the person of God, saying, \"Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee, O Israel: I am the Lord thy God.\"[fn-7-P749_286818:50-nf] A rod was taken to serve as a sign, and was changed into a serpent by angelical power;[fn-7-P750_286928:51-nf] but although that power is wanting to man, yet a stone was taken also by man for a similar sign.[fn-7-P751_287043:52-nf] There is a wide difference between the deed of the angel and the deed of the man. The former is both to be wondered at and to be understood, the latter only to be understood. That which is understood from both, is perhaps one and the same; but those things from which it is understood, are different. Just as if the name of God were written both in gold and in ink; the former would be the more precious, the latter the more worthless; yet that which is signified in both is one and the same. And although the serpent that came from Moses' rod signified the same thing as Jacob's stone, yet Jacob's stone signified something better than did the serpents of the magicians. For as the anointing of the stone signified Christ in the flesh, in which He was anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows;[fn-7-P752_287871:53-nf] so the rod of Moses, turned into a serpent, signified Christ Himself made obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.[fn-7-P753_288012:54-nf] Whence it is said, \"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life;.\"[fn-7-P754_288226:55-nf] just as by gazing on that serpent which was lifted up in the wilderness, they did not perish by the bites of the serpents. For \"our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed.\"[fn-7-P755_288454:56-nf] For by the serpent death is understood, which was wrought by the serpent in paradise,[fn-7-P756_288557:57-nf] the mode of speech expressing the effect by the efficient. Therefore the rod passed into the serpent, Christ into death; and the serpent again into the rod, whole Christ with His body into the resurrection; which body is the Church;[fn-7-P757_288805:58-nf] and this shall be in the end of time, signified by the tail, which Moses held, in order that it might return into a rod.[fn-7-P758_288943:59-nf] But the serpents of the magicians, like those who are dead in the world, unless by believing in Christ they shall have been as it were swallowed up by,[fn-7-P759_289111:60-nf] and have entered into, His body, will not be able to rise again in Him. Jacob's stone, therefore, as I said, signified something better than did the serpents of the magicians; yet the deed of the magicians was much more wonderful.

But there can be no accident of this kind in respect to God; and therefore He who is God is the only unchangeable substance or essence, to whom certainly Being itself, whence comes the name of essence, most especially and most truly belongs. For that which is changed does not retain its own being; and that which can be changed, although it be not actually changed, is able not to be that which it had been; and hence that which not only is not changed, but also cannot at all be changed, alone falls most truly, without difficulty or hesitation, under the category of Being.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_13_book_vii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"10. If, however, it is fitting that God should be said to subsist-(For this word is rightly applied to those things, in which as subjects those things are, which are said to be in a subject, as color or shape in body. For body subsists, and so is substance; but those things are in the body, which subsists and is their subject, and they are not substances, but are in a substance: and so, if either that color or that shape ceases to be, it does notdeprive the body of being a body, because it is not of the being of body, that it should retain this or that shape or color; therefore neither changeable nor simple things are properly called substances.)-If, I say, God subsists so that He can be properly called a substance, then there is something in Him as it were in a subject, and He is not simple, i.e. such that to Him to be is the same as is anything else that is said concerning Him in respect to Himself; as, for instance, great, omnipotent, good, and whatever of this kind is not unfitly said of God. But it is an impiety to say that God subsists, and is a subject in relation to His own goodness, and that this goodness is not a substance or rather essence, and that God Himself is not His own goodness, but that it is in Him as in a subject. And hence it is clear that God is improperly called substance, in order that He may be understood to be, by the more usual name essence, which He is truly and properly called; so that perhaps it is right that God alone should be called essence. For He is truly alone, because He is unchangeable; and declared this to be His own name to His servant Moses, when He says, \"I am that I am;\" and, \"Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: He who is hath sent me unto you.\"[fn-12-P1212_520589:24-nf] However, whether He be called essence, which He is properly called, or substance, which He is called improperly, He is called both in respect to Himself, not relatively to anything; whence to God to be is the same thing as to subsist; and so the Trinity, if one essence, is also Due substance. Perhaps therefore they are more conveniently called three persons than three substances.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_15_book_vii_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"15.

And we need not be surprised at this in the case of one who was a prophet, lawgiver, and the friend of God, seeing that all the people when about to draw nigh to Mount Sinai, and to hear the voice speaking to them, were commanded to sanctify themselves in three days, and keep themselves from their wives. I am out of order in violating historical sequence, but I may point out that the same thing was said by[fn-62-P6264_1914978:111-nf] Ahimelech the priest to David when he fled to Nob: \"If only the young men have kept themselves from women.\" And David answered, \"of a truth about these three days.\" For the shew-bread, like the body of Christ, might not be eaten by those who rose from the marriage bed. And in passing we ought to consider the words \"if only the young men have kept themselves from women.\" The truth is that, in view of the purity of the body of Christ, all sexual intercourse is unclean. In the law also it is enjoined that the[fn-62-P6265_1915512:112-nf] high priest must not marry any but a virgin, nor must he take to wife a widow.

I must not linger over Moses when my purpose is at full speed to lightly touch on each topic and to sketch the outline of a proper knowledge of my subject. I will pass to Joshua the son of Nun, who was previously called Ause, or better, as in the Hebrew, Osee, that is, Saviour. For he,[fn-62-P6272_1917721:118-nf] according to the epistle of Jude, saved the people of Israel and led them forth out of Egypt, and brought them into the land of promise. As soon as this Joshua[fn-62-P6273_1918303:119-nf] reached the Jordan, the waters of marriage, which had ever flowed in the land, dried up and stood in one heap; and the whole people, barefooted and on dry ground, crossed over, and came to Gilgal, and there was a second time circumcised. If we take this literally, it cannot possibly stand. For if we had two foreskins, or if another could grow after the first was cut off, there would be room for speaking of a second circumcision. But the meaning is that Joshua circumcised the people who had crossed the desert, with the Gospel knife, and he circumcised them with a stone knife, that what in the case of Moses' son was prefigured in a few might under Joshua be fulfilled in all. Moreover, the very foreskins were heaped together and buried, and covered with earth, and the fact that the reproach of Egypt was taken away, and the name of the place, Gilgal, which is by interpretation[fn-62-P6274_1919208:120-nf] revelation, show that while the people wandered in the desert uncircumcised their eyes were blinded. Let us see what follows. After this Gospel circumcision and the consecration of twelve stones at the place of revelation, the Passover was immediately celebrated, a lamb was slain for them, and they ate the food of the Holy Land. Joshua went forth, and was met by the Prince of the host, sword in hand, that is either to shew that he was ready to fight for the circumcised people, or to sever the tie of marriage. And in the same way that Moses was commanded, so was he:[fn-62-P6275_1919866:121-nf] \"loose thy shoe, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\" For if the armed host of the Lord was represented by the trumpets of the priests, we may see in Jericho a type of the overthrow of the world by the preaching of the Gospel.

I think it is clearly to be understood that before the Lord led his people from Egypt and circumcised them, sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch had the dominion, and that to these, as to five princes, everything was subject. And when they[fn-62-P6277_1920640:123-nf] took refuge in the cave of the body and in a place of darkness, Jesus entered the body itself and slew them, that the source of their power might be the instrument of their death.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_09_book_ii_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"20.

For, because Jesus Christ was to introduce the second people (which is composed of us nations, lingering deserted in the world[fn-22-P2287_757601:164-nf] aforetime) into the land of promise, \"flowing with milk and honey\"[fn-22-P2288_757983:165-nf] (that is, into the possession of eternal life, than which nought is sweeter); and this had to come about, not through Moses (that is, not through the Law's discipline), but through Joshua (that is, through the new law's grace), after our circumcision with \"a knife of rock\"[fn-22-P2289_758306:166-nf] (that is, with Christ's precepts, for Christ is in many ways and figures predicted as a rock[fn-22-P2290_758584:167-nf] ); therefore the man who was being prepared to act as images of this sacrament was inaugurated under the figure of the Lord's name, even so as to be named Jesus.[fn-22-P2291_758781:168-nf] For He who ever spake to Moses was the Son of God Himself; who, too, was always seen.[fn-22-P2292_758888:169-nf] For God the Father none ever saw, and lived.[fn-22-P2293_758961:170-nf] And accordingly it is agreed that the Son of God Himself spake to Moses, and said to the people, \"Behold, I send mine angel before thy\"-that is, the people's-\"face, to guard thee on the march, and to introduce thee into the land which I have prepared thee: attend to him, and be not disobedient to him; for he hath not escaped[fn-22-P2294_759360:171-nf] thy notice, since my name is upon him.\"[fn-22-P2295_759553:172-nf] For Joshua was to introduce the people into the land of promise, not Moses. Now He called him an \"angel,\" on account of the magnitude of the mighty deeds which he was to achieve (which mighty deeds Joshua the son of Nun did, and you yourselves read), and on account of his office of prophet announcing (to wit) the divine will; just as withal the Spirit, speaking in the person of the Father, calls the forerunner of Christ, John, a future \"angel,\" through the prophet: \"Behold, I send mine angel before Thy\"-that is, Christ's-\"face, who shall prepare Thy way before Thee.\"[fn-22-P2296_760153:173-nf] Nor is it a novel practice to the Holy Spirit to call those \"angels\" whom God has appointed as ministers of His power. For the same John is called not merely an \"angel\" of Christ, but withal a \"lamp\" shining before Christ: for David predicts, \"I have prepared the lamp for my Christ; \"[fn-22-P2297_760504:174-nf] and him Christ Himself, coming \"to fulfil the prophets,\"[fn-22-P2298_760606:175-nf] called so to the Jews. \"He was,\" He says, \"the burning and shining lamp; \"[fn-22-P2299_760754:176-nf] as being he who not merely \"prepared His ways in the desert,\"[fn-23-P2300_760874:177-nf] but withal, by pointing out \"the Lamb of God,\"[fn-23-P2301_760983:178-nf] illumined the minds of men by his heralding, so that they understood Him to be that Lamb whom Moses was wont to announce as destined to suffer.

This saving faith which we profess is sustained by the spirit of prophecy, speaking with one voice through many mouths, and never, through long and changing ages, bearing an uncertain witness to the truths of revelation. For instance, the words which, as we are told through Moses, were spoken by God the Only-begotten, are confirmed for our better instruction by the prophetic spirit, speaking this time through those men of stature,-For God is in Thee, and there is no God beside Thee. Thou art God, and we knew it not, O God Israel, the Saviour. Let heresy fling itself with its utmost effort of despair and rage against this declaration of a name and nature inseparably joined, and rend in twain, if its furious struggles can, a union perfect in title and in fact. God is in God and beside Him there is no God. Let heresy, if it can, divide the God within from the God within Whom He is, and classify, Each after His kind, the members of that mystic union. For when He says God is in Thee, He teaches that the true nature of God the Father is present in God the Son; for we must understand that it is the God Who is[fn-13-P1382_857592:32-nf] that is in Him. And when He adds, And there is no God beside Thee, He shews that outside Him there is no God, since God's dwelling is within Himself. And the third assertion, Thou art God and we knew it not, sets forth for our instruction what must be the confession of the devout and believing soul. When it has learnt the mysteries of the Divine birth, and the name Emmanuel which the angel announced to Joseph, it must cry, Thou art God, and we knew it not, O God of Israel, the Saviour. It must recognise the subsistence of the Divine nature in Him, inasmuch as God is in God, and the nonexistence of any other God except the true. For, He being God and God being in Him, the delusion of another God, of what kind soever, must be surrendered.

Here are his remarks: \"We must answer this text with another, in which the same Lord says, `A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things.'[fn-26-P2637_1044141:144-nf] And again: `He maketh His sun to rise on the good and on the evil.'[fn-26-P2638_1044231:145-nf] Then in another passage it is written, `For the good things are created from the beginning ;'[fn-26-P2639_1044345:146-nf] and yet again, `They that are good shall dwell in the land.'\"[fn-26-P2640_1044433:147-nf] Now to all this we must say in answer, that the passages in question must be understood in the same sense as the former one, \"There is none good, save one, that is, God.\" Either because all created things, although God made them very good, are yet, when compared with their Creator, not good, being in fact incapable of any comparison with Him. For in a transcendent, and yet very proper sense, He said of Himself, \"I Am that I Am.\"[fn-26-P2641_1044888:148-nf] The statement therefore before us, \"None is good save one, that is, God,\" is used in some such way as that which is said of John, \"He was not that light;\"[fn-26-P2642_1045063:149-nf] although the Lord calls him \"a lamp,\"[fn-26-P2643_1045119:150-nf] just as He says to His disciples: \"Ye are the light of the world: . . . neither do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel.\"[fn-26-P2644_1045400:151-nf] Still, in comparison with that light which is \"the true light which light every man that cometh into the world,\"[fn-26-P2645_1045537:152-nf] he was not light.

A support for its blasphemy, because, if He did not exist before He was born, He cannot be of one nature with His eternal Origin. He must have His beginning out of nothing, if He have no powers but such as are coeval with His birth. And a screen for its heresy, for if this statement be condemned, it furnishes a ready answer. He that did exist, it will be said, could not be born; being in existence already, He could not possibly come into being by passing through the process of birth, for the very meaning of birth is the entry into existence of the being that is born. Fool and blasphemer! Who dreams of birth in the case of Him Who is the unborn and eternal?

A belief that the Son of God is Son in name only and not in nature, is not the faith of the Gospels and of the Apostles. If this be a mere title, to which adoption is His only claim; if He be not the Son in virtue of having proceeded forth from God, whence, I ask, was it that the blessed Simon Bar-Jona confessed to Him, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God[fn-14-P1462_927699:38-nf] ? Because He shared with all mankind the power of being born as one of the sons of God through the sacrament of regeneration? If Christ be the Son of God only in this titular way, what was the revelation made to Peter, not by flesh and blood, but by the Father in heaven? What praise could he deserve for making a declaration which was universally applicable? What credit was due to Him for stating a fact of general knowledge? If He be Son by adoption, wherein lay the blessedness of Peter's confession, which offered a tribute to the Son to which, in that case, He had no more title than any member of the company of saints? The Apostle's faith penetrates into a region closed to human reasoning. He had, no doubt, often heard, He that receiveth you receiveth Me, and He that receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me[fn-14-P1463_928541:39-nf] . Hence he knew well that Christ had been sent; he had heard Him, Whom he knew to have been sent, making the declaration, All things are delivered unto Me of the Father, and no one knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any one tire Father save the Son[fn-14-P1464_928825:40-nf] . What then is this truth, which the Father now reveals to Peter, which receives the praise of a blessed confession? It cannot have been that the names of `Father' and `Son' were novel to him; he had heard them often. Yet he speaks words which the tongue of man had never framed before:-Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. For though Christ, while dwelling in the body, had avowed Himself to be the Son of God, yet now for the first time the Apostle's faith had recognised in Him the presence of the Divine nature. Peter is praised not merely for his tribute of adoration, but for his recognition of the mysterious truth; for confessing not Christ only, but Christ the Son of God. It would clearly have sufficed for a payment of reverence, had he said, Thou art the Christ, and nothing more. But it would have been a hollow confession, had Peter only hailed Him as Christ, without confessing Him the Son of God. And so his words Thou art[fn-14-P1465_929792:41-nf] declare that what is asserted of Him is strictly and exactly true to His nature. Next, the Father's utterance, This is My Son, had revealed to Peter that he must confess Thou art the Son of God, for in the words This is, God the Revealer points Him out, and the response, Thou art, is the believer's welcome to the truth. And this is the rock of confession whereon the Church is built. But the perceptive faculties of flesh and blood cannot attain to the recognition and confession of this truth. It is a mystery, Divinely revealed, that Christ must be not only named, but believed, the Son of God. Was it only the Divine name; was it not rather the Divine nature that was revealed to Peter? If it were the name, he had heard it often from the Lord, proclaiming Himself the Son of God. What honour, then, did he deserve for announcing the name? No; it was not the name; it was the nature, for the name had been repeatedly proclaimed.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":3,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_13_book_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"46.

As if struck by the miracle, he ran, somehow, a middle course, assailing in no way those who believed in Jesus, but rather agreeing with them.","title":"Book I.","author":"Hermias Sozomen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_19_book_viii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"One mark of the true Godhead is indicated by the words of Holy Scripture, which Moses learnt by the voice from heaven, when He heard Him Who said, \"I am He that is[fn-18-P1817_1057940:2-nf] .\" We think it right, then, to believe that to be alone truly Divine which is represented as eternal and infinite in respect of being; and all that is contemplated therein is always the same, neither growing nor being consumed; so that if one should say of God, that formerly He was, but now is not, or that He now is, but formerly was not, we should consider each of the savings alike to be godless: for by both alike the idea of eternity is mutilated, being cut short on one side or the other by non-existence, whether one contemplates \"nothing\" as preceding \"being[fn-18-P1818_1058525:3-nf] ,\" or declares that \"being\" ends in \"nothing\"; and the frequent repetition of \"first of all\" or \"last of all\" concerning God's non-existence does not make amends for the impious conception touching the Divinity. For this reason we declare the maintenance of their doctrine as to the non-existence at some time of Him Who truly is, to be a denial and rejection of His true Godhead; and this on the ground that, on the one hand, He Who showed Himself to Moses by the light speaks of Himself as being, when He says, \"I am He that is[fn-18-P1819_1059094:4-nf] ,\" while on the other, Isaiah (being made, so to say, the instrument of Him Who spoke in him) says in the person of Him that is, \"I am the first, and hereafter am I[fn-18-P1820_1059276:5-nf] ,\" so that hereby, whichever way we consider it, we conceive eternity in God. And so, too, the word that was spoken to Manoah shows the fact that the Divinity is not comprehensible by the significance of His name, because, when Manoah asks to know His name, that, when the promise has come actually to pass, he may by name glorify his benefactor, He says to him, \"Why askest thou this? It also is wonderful[fn-18-P1821_1059752:6-nf] \"; so that by this we learn that there is one name significant of the Divine Nature-the wonder, namely, that arises unspeakably in our hearts concerning It. So, too, great David, in his discourses with himself, proclaims the same truth, in the sense that all the creation was brought into being by God, while He alone exists always in the same manner, and abides for ever, where he says, \"But Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail[fn-18-P1822_1060224:7-nf] .\" When we hear these sayings, and others like them, from men inspired by God, let us leave all that is not from eternity to the worship of idolaters, as a new thing alien from the true Godhead. For that which now is, and formerly was not, is clearly new and not eternal, and to have regard to any new object of worship is called by Moses the service of demons, when he says, \"They sacrificed to devils and not to God, to gods whom their fathers knew not; new gods were they that came newly up[fn-18-P1823_1060734:8-nf] .\" If then everything that is new in worship is a service of demons, and is alien from the true Godhead, and if what is now, but was not always, is new and not eternal, we who have regard to that which is, necessarily reckon those who contemplate non-existence as attaching to Him Who is, and who say that \"He once was not,\" among the worshippers of idols. For we may also see that the great John, when declaring in his own preaching the Only-begotten God, guards his own statement in every way, so that the conception of non-existence shall find no access to Him Who is. For he says[fn-18-P1824_1061377:9-nf] that He \"was in the beginning,\" and \"was with God,\" and \"was God,\" and was light, and life, and truth, and all good things at all times, and never at any time failed to be anything that is excellent, Who is the fulness of all good, and is in the bosom of the Father. If then Moses lays down as a law for us some such mark of true Godhead as this, that we know nothing else of God but this one thing, that He is (for to this point the words, \"I am He that is[fn-18-P1825_1061854:10-nf] \"); while Isaiah in his preaching declares aloud the absolute infinity of Him Who is, defining the existence of God as having no regard to beginning or to end (for He Who says \"I am the first, and hereafter am I,\" places no limit to His eternity in either direction, so that neither, if we look to the beginning, do we find any point marked since which He is, and beyond which He was not, nor, if 'we turn our thought to the future, can we cut short by any boundary the eternal progress of Him Who is),-and if the prophet David forbids us to worship any new and strange God[fn-18-P1826_1062447:11-nf] (both of which are involved in the heretical doctrine; \"newness\" is clearly indicated in that which is not eternal, and \"strangeness\" is alienation from the Nature of the very God),-if, I say, these things are so, we declare all the sophistical fabrication about the non-existence at some time of Him Who truly is, to be nothing else than a departure from Christianity, and a turning to idolatry. For when the Evangelist, in his discourse concerning the Nature of God, separates at all points non-existence from Him Who is, and, by his constant repetition of the word \"was,\" carefully destroys the suspicion of non-existence, and calls Him the Only-begotten God, the Word of God, the Son of God, equal with God, and all such names, we have this judgment fixed and settled in us, that if the Only-begotten Son is God, we must believe that He Who is believed to be God is eternal. And indeed He is verily God, and assuredly is eternal, and is never at any time found to be non-existent. For God, as we have often said, if He now is, also assuredly always was, and if He once was not, neither does He now exist at all. But since even the enemies of the truth confess that the Son is and continually abides the Only-begotten God, we say this, that, being in the Father, He is not in Him in one respect only, but He is in Him altogether, in respect of all that the Father is conceived to be. As, then, being in the incorruptibility of the Father, He is incorruptible, good in His goodness, powerful in His might, and, as being in each of these attributes of special excellence which are conceived of the Father, He is that particular thing, so, also, being in His eternity, He is assuredly eternal. Now the eternity of the Father is marked by His never having taken His being from nonexistence, and never terminating His being in non-existence. He, therefore, Who hath all things that are the Father's[fn-18-P1827_1064368:12-nf] , and is contemplated in all the glory of the Father, even as, being in the endlessness of the Father, He has no end, so, being in the unoriginateness of the Father, has, as the Apostle says, \"no beginning of days[fn-18-P1828_1064604:13-nf] ,\" but at once is \"of the Father,\" and is regarded in the eternity of the Father:and in this respect, more especially, is seen the complete absence of divergence in the Likeness, as compared with Him Whose Likeness He is. And herein is His saying found true which tells us, \"He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-18-P1829_1064939:14-nf] .\" Moreover, it is in this way that those words of the Apostle, that the Son is \"the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His Person[fn-18-P1830_1065106:15-nf] ,\" are best understood to have an excellent and close application. For the Apostle conveys to those hearers who are unable, by the contemplation of purely intellectual objects, to elevate their thought to the height of the knowledge of God, a sort of notion of the truth, by means of things apparent to sense. For as the body of the sun is expressly imaged by the whole disc that surrounds it, and he who looks on the sun argues, by means of what he sees, the existence of the whole solid substratum, so, he says, the majesty of the Father is expressly imaged in the greatness of the power of the Son, that the one may be believed to be as great as the other is known to be: and again, as the radiance of light sheds its brilliancy from the whole of the sun's disc (for in the disc one part is not radiant, and the rest dim), so all that glory which the Father is, sheds its brilliancy from its whole extent by means of the brightness that comes from it, that is, by the true Light; and as the ray is of the sun (for there would be no ray if the sun were not), yet the sun is never conceived as existing by itself without the ray of brightness that is shed from it, so the Apostle delivering to us the continuity and eternity of that existence which the Only-begotten has of the Father, calls the Son \"the brightness of His glory.\"","title":"Book VIII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_19_book_viii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"One mark of the true Godhead is indicated by the words of Holy Scripture, which Moses learnt by the voice from heaven, when He heard Him Who said, \"I am He that is[fn-18-P1817_1057940:2-nf] .\" We think it right, then, to believe that to be alone truly Divine which is represented as eternal and infinite in respect of being; and all that is contemplated therein is always the same, neither growing nor being consumed; so that if one should say of God, that formerly He was, but now is not, or that He now is, but formerly was not, we should consider each of the savings alike to be godless: for by both alike the idea of eternity is mutilated, being cut short on one side or the other by non-existence, whether one contemplates \"nothing\" as preceding \"being[fn-18-P1818_1058525:3-nf] ,\" or declares that \"being\" ends in \"nothing\"; and the frequent repetition of \"first of all\" or \"last of all\" concerning God's non-existence does not make amends for the impious conception touching the Divinity.

For, as we have shewn in the former books, in respect of power and veneration He is as mighty and as worthy of honour as the Father: so also, inasmuch as the Father is always Father, He too, inasmuch as He is the Son, possesses the like property of being always the Son. For according to the words spoken to Moses, He Who is, hath sent Me unto you[fn-23-P2342_1493965:23-nf] , we obtain the unambiguous conception that absolute being belongs to God; since that which is, cannot be thought of or spoken of as not being. For being and not being are contraries, nor can these mutually exclusive descriptions be simultaneously true of one and the same object: for while the one is present, the other must be absent. Therefore, where anything is, neither conception nor language will admit of its not being. When our thoughts are turned backwards, and are continually carried back further and further to understand the nature of Him Who is, this sole fact about Him, that He is, remains ever prior to our thoughts; since that quality, which is infinitely present in God, always withdraws itself from the backward gaze of our thoughts, though they reach back to an infinite distance. The result is that the backward straining of our thoughts can never grasp anything prior to God's property of absolute existence; since nothing presents itself, to enable us to understand the nature of God, even though we go on seeking to eternity, save always the fact that God always is. That then which has both been declared about God by Moses, that of which our human intelligence can give no further explanation; that very quality the Gospels testify to be a property of God Only-begotten; since in the beginning was the Word, and since the Word was with God, and since He was the true Light, and since God Only-begotten is in the bosom of the Father[fn-23-P2343_1495453:24-nf] , and since Jesus Christ is God over all[fn-23-P2344_1495521:25-nf] .","title":"Book XII.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":3,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_116_discourse_viii_thekla_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"ANF-06","text":"Furthermore, when they have come hither, they see wonderful and glorious and blessed things of beauty, and such as cannot be spoken to men.

For never has any one seen with his eyes the greatness or the form or the beauty of righteousness itself, or of understanding, or of peace; but there, in Him whose name is I AM,[fn-52-P5294_1594694:8-nf] they are seen perfect and clear, as they are. For there is a tree of temperance itself, and of love, and of understanding, as there are plants of the fruits which grow here-as of grapes, the pomegranate, and of apples; and so, too, the fruits of those trees are gathered and eaten, and do not perish and wither, but those who gather them grow to immortality and a likeness to God. Just as he from whom all are descended, before the fall and the blinding of his eyes, being in paradise, enjoyed its fruits, God appointing man to dress and to keep the plants of wisdom. For it was entrusted to the first Adam to cultivate those fruits. Now Jeremiah saw that these things exist specially in a certain place, removed to a great distance from our world, where, compassionating those who have fallen from that good state, he says:[fn-52-P5295_1595537:9-nf] \"Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding; that thou mayest know also where is length of days, and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace.

For by no other path was it possible for us to return but by humility, who fell by pride, according as it was said to our first creation, \"Taste, and ye shall be as gods.\"[fn-31-P3193_1477562:33-nf] Of this humility, therefore, that is to say, of the way by which it was needful for us to return, our Restorer Himself has deemed it meet to exhibit an example in His own person, \"who thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant;\"[fn-31-P3194_1477861:34-nf] in order that He might be created Man in the beginning of His ways, the Word by whom all things were made. Wherefore, in so far as He is the Only-begotten, He has no brethren; but in so far as He is the First-begotten, He has deemed it worthy of Him to give the name of brethren to all those who, subsequently to and by means of His pre-eminence,[fn-31-P3195_1478230:35-nf] are born again into the grace of God through the adoption of sons, according to the truth commended to us by apostolic teaching.[fn-31-P3196_1478719:36-nf] Thus, then, the Son according to nature (naturalis filius) was born of the very substance of the Father, the only one so born, subsisting as that which the Father is,[fn-31-P3197_1478960:37-nf] God of God, Light of Light. We, on the other hand, are not the light by nature, but are enlightened by that Light, so that we may be able to shine in wisdom. For, as one says, \"that was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\"[fn-31-P3198_1479353:38-nf] Therefore we add to the faith of things eternal likewise the temporal dispensation[fn-31-P3199_1479452:39-nf] of our Lord, which He deemed it worthy of Him to bear for us and to minister in behalf of our salvation. For in so far as He is the only-begotten Son of God, it cannot be said of Him that He was and that He shall be, but only that He is; because, on the one hand, that which was, now isnot; and, on the other, that which shall be, as yet is not. He, then, is unchangeable, independent of the condition of times and variation. And it is my opinion that this is the very consideration to which was due the circumstance that He introduced to the apprehension of His servant Moses the kind of name [which He then adopted]. For when he asked of Him by whom he should say that he was sent, in the event of the people to whom he was being sent despising him, he received his answer when He spake in this wise: \"I Am that I Am.\" Thereafter, too, He added this: \"Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, He that is (Qui est) has sent me unto you.\"[fn-32-P3200_1480531:40-nf] ","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_30_book_iii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"ANF-03","text":"These preliminary remarks I have ventured to make[fn-48-P4832_1530258:52-nf] at this first step of the discussion and while the conflict is, as it were, from a distance.

For if, on the one hand, it was not an angel that went forth with the people, and if, on the other, as Eunomius would have it, He Who was manifested by the name of the Existent is not the Only-begotten, this amounts to nothing less than transferring the doctrines of the synagogue to the Church of God. Accordingly, of the two alternatives they must needs admit one, namely, either that the Only-begotten God on no occasion appeared to Moses, or that the Son is Himself the \"Existent,\" from Whom the word came to His servant. But he contradicts what has been said above, alleging the Scripture itself[fn-20-P2052_1238856:31-nf] which informs us that the voice of an angel was interposed, and that it was thus that the discourse of the Existent was conveyed. This, however, is no contradiction, but a confirmation of our view. For we too say plainly, that the prophet, wishing to make manifest to men the mystery concerning Christ, called the Self-Existent \"Angel,\" that the meaning of the words might not be referred to the Father, as it would have been if the title of \"Existent\" alone had been found throughout the discourse. But just as our word is the revealer and messenger (or \"angel\") of the movements of the mind, even so we affirm that the true Word that was in the beginning, when He announces the will of His own Father, is styled \"Angel\" (or \"Messenger\"), a title given to Him on account of the operation of conveying the message. And as the sublime John, having previously called Him \"Word,\" so introduces the further truth that the Word was God, that our thoughts might not at once turn to the Father, as they would have done if the title of God had been put first, so too does the mighty Moses, after first calling Him \"Angel,\" teach us in the words that follow that He is none other than the Self-Existent Himself, that the mystery concerning the Christ might be foreshown, by the Scripture assuring us by the name \"Angel,\" that the Word is the interpreter of the Father's will, and, by the title of the \"Self-Existent,\" of the closeness of relation subsisting between the Son and the Father. And if he should bring forward Isaiah also as calling Him \"the Angel of mighty counsel[fn-20-P2053_1240447:32-nf] ,\" not even so will be overthrow our argument. For there, in clear and uncontrovertible terms, there is indicated by the prophecy the dispensation of His Humanity; for \"unto us,\" he says, \"a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the government shall be upon His shoulder, and His name is called the Angel of mighty counsel.\" And it is with an eye to this, I suppose, that David describes the establishment of His kingdom, not as though He were not a King, but in the view that the humiliation to the estate of a servant to which the Lord submitted by way of dispensation, was taken up and absorbed into the majesty of His Kingdom. For he says, \"I was established King by Him on His holy hill of Sion, declaring the ordinance of the Lord.[fn-20-P2054_1241213:33-nf] Accordingly, He Who through Himself reveals the goodness of the Father is called \"Angel\" and \"Word,\" \"Seal\" and \"Image,\" and all similar titles with the same intention. For as the \"Angel\" (or \"Messenger\") gives information from some one, even so the Word reveals the thought within, the Seal shows by Its own stamp the original mould, and the Image by Itself interprets the beauty of that whereof It is the image, so that in their signification all these terms are equivalent to one another. For this reason the title \"Angel\" is placed before that of the \"Self-Existent,\" the Son being termed \"Angel\" as the exponent of His Father's will, and the \"Existent\" as having no name that could possibly give a knowledge of His essence, but transcending all the power of names to express. Wherefore also His name is testified by the writing of the Apostle to be \"above every name[fn-20-P2055_1242109:34-nf] ,\" not as though it were some one name preferred above all others, though still comparable with them, but rather in the sense that He Who verily is is above every name.","title":"Book XI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_23_lecture_xviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"11.

I regret still to have to contend about the law-after I have so often proved that its replacement (by the gospel)[fn-77-P7778_2219605:595-nf] affords no argument for another god, predicted as it was indeed in Christ, and in the Creator's own plans[fn-77-P7779_2219732:596-nf] ordained for His Christ. (But I must revert to that discussion) so far as (the apostle leads me, for) this very epistle looks very much as if it abrogated[fn-77-P7780_2219910:597-nf] the law. We have, however, often shown before now that God is declared by the apostle to be a Judge; and that in the Judge is implied an Avenger; area in the Avenger, the Creator. And so in the passage where he says: \"I am not ashamed of the gospel (of Christ): for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that beheveth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek; for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith,\"[fn-77-P7781_2220372:598-nf] he undoubtedly ascribes both the gospel and salvation to Him whom (in accordance with our heretic's own distinction) I have called the just God, not the good one. It is He who removes (men) from confidence in the law to faith in the gospel-that is to say,[fn-77-P7782_2220651:599-nf] His own law and His own gospel. When, again, he declares that \"the wrath (of God) is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,\"[fn-77-P7783_2220864:600-nf] (I ask) the wrath of what God? Of the Creator certainly. The truth, therefore, will be His, whose is also the wrath, which has to be revealed to avenge the truth. Likewise, when adding, \"We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth,\"[fn-77-P7784_2221131:601-nf] he both vindicated that wrath from which comes this judgment for the truth, and at the same time afforded another proof that the truth emanates from the same God whose wrath he attested, by witnessing to His judgment. Marcion's averment is quite a different matter, that[fn-77-P7785_2221421:602-nf] the Creator in anger avenges Himself on the truth of the rival god which had been detained in unrighteousness. But what serious gaps Marcion has made in this epistle especially, by withdrawing whole passages at his will, will be clear from the unmutilated text of our own copy.[fn-77-P7786_2221720:603-nf] It is enough for my purpose to accept in evidence of its truth what he has seen fit to leave unerased, strange instances as they are also of his negligence and blindness. If, then, God will judge the secrets of men-both of those who have sinned in the law, and of those who have sinned without law (inasmuch as they who know not the law yet do by nature the things contained in the law)[fn-77-P7787_2222134:604-nf] -surely the God who shall judge is He to whom belong both the law, and that nature which is the rule[fn-77-P7788_2222258:605-nf] to them who know not the law. But how will He conduct this judgment? \"According to my gospel,\" says (the apostle), \"by (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7789_2222457:606-nf] So that both the gospel and Christ must be His, to whom appertain the law and the nature which are to be vindicated by the gospel and Christ-even at that judgment of God which, as he previously said, was to be according to truth.[fn-77-P7790_2222707:607-nf] The wrath, therefore, which is to vindicate truth, can only be revealed from heaven by the God of wrath;[fn-77-P7791_2222831:608-nf] so that this sentence, which is quite in accordance with that previous one wherein the judgment is declared to be the Creator's,[fn-77-P7792_2222979:609-nf] cannot possibly be ascribed to another god who is not a judge, and is incapable of wrath. It is only consistent in Him amongst whose attributes are found the judgment and the wrath of which I am speaking, and to whom of necessity must also appertain the media whereby these attributes are to be carried into effect. even the gospel and Christ. Hence his invective against the transgressors of the law, who teach that men should not steal, and yet practise theft themselves.[fn-77-P7793_2223503:610-nf] (This invective he utters) in perfect homage[fn-77-P7794_2223568:611-nf] to the law of God, not as if he meant to ten sure the Creator Himself with having commanded[fn-77-P7795_2223676:612-nf] a fraud to be practised against the Egyptians to get their gold and silver at the very time when He was forbidding men to steal,[fn-77-P7796_2223825:613-nf] -adopting such methods as they are apt (shamelessly) to charge upon Him in other particulars also. Are we then to suppose[fn-77-P7797_2224006:614-nf] that the apostle abstained through fear from openly calumniating God, from whom notwithstanding He did not hesitate to withdraw men? Well, but he had gone so far in his censure of the Jews, as to point against them the denunciation of the prophet, \"Through you the name of God is blasphemed (among the Gentiles).\"[fn-77-P7798_2224347:615-nf] But how absurd, that he should himself blaspheme Him for blaspheming whom he upbraids them as evil-doers! He prefers even circumcision of heart to neglect of it in the flesh. Now it is quite within the purpose of the God of the law that circumcision should be that of the heart, not in the flesh; in the spirit, and not in the letter.[fn-77-P7799_2224703:616-nf] Since this is the circumcision recommended by Jeremiah: \"Circumcise (yourselves to the Lord, and take away) the foreskins of your heart; \"[fn-78-P7800_2224862:617-nf] and even of Moses: \"Circumcise, therefore, the hardness of your heart,\"[fn-78-P7801_2224953:618-nf] -the Spirit which circumcises the heart will proceed from Him who prescribed the letter also which clips[fn-78-P7802_2225086:619-nf] the flesh; and \"the Jew which is one inwardly\" will be a subject of the self-same God as he also is who is \"a Jew outwardly; \"[fn-78-P7803_2225228:620-nf] because the apostle would have preferred not to have mentioned a Jew at all, unless he were a servant of the God of the Jews. It was once[fn-78-P7804_2225386:621-nf] the law; now it is \"the righteousness of God which is by the faith of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-78-P7805_2225486:622-nf] What means this distinction? Has your god been subserving the interests of the Creator's dispensation, by affording time to Him and to His law? Is the \"Now\" in the hands of Him to whom belonged the \"Then\"? Surely, then, the law was His, whose is now the righteousness of God. It is a distinction of dispensations, not of gods. He enjoins those who are justified by faith in Christ and not by the law to have peace with God.[fn-78-P7806_2225935:623-nf] With what God? Him whose enemies we have never, in any dispensation,[fn-78-P7807_2227095:624-nf] been? Or Him against whom we have rebelled, both in relation to His written law and His law of nature? Now, as peace is only possible towards Him with whom there once was war, we shall be both justified by Him, and to Him also will belong the Christ, in whom we are justified by faith, and through whom alone God's[fn-78-P7808_2227426:625-nf] enemies can ever be reduced to peace. \"Moreover,\" says he, \"the law entered, that the offence might abound.\"[fn-78-P7809_2227548:626-nf] And wherefore this? \"In order,\" he says, \"that (where sin abounded), grace might much more abound.\"[fn-78-P7810_2227667:627-nf] Whose grace, if not of that God from whom also came the law? Unless it be, forsooth, that[fn-78-P7811_2227776:628-nf] the Creator intercalated His law for the mere purpose of[fn-78-P7812_2227871:629-nf] producing some employment for the grace of a rival god, an enemy to Himself (I had almost said, a god unknown to Him), \"that as sin had\" in His own dispensation[fn-78-P7813_2228048:630-nf] \"reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto (eternal) life by Jesus Christ,\"[fn-78-P7814_2228174:631-nf] His own antagonist! For this (I suppose it was, that) the law of the Creator had \"concluded all under sin,\"[fn-78-P7815_2228301:632-nf] and had brought in \"all the world as guilty (before God),\" and had \"stopped every mouth,\"[fn-78-P7816_2228412:633-nf] so that none could glory through it, in order that grace might be maintained to the glory of the Christ, not of the Creator, but of Marcion! I may here anticipate a remark about the substance of Christ, in the prospect of a question which will now turn up. For he says that \"we are dead to the law.\"[fn-78-P7817_2228733:634-nf] It may be contended that Christ's body is indeed a body, but not exactly[fn-78-P7818_2229130:635-nf] flesh. Now, whatever may be the substance, since he mentions \"the body of Christ,\"[fn-78-P7819_2229298:636-nf] whom he immediately after states to have been \"raised from the dead,\"[fn-78-P7820_2229381:637-nf] none other body can be understood than that of the flesh,[fn-78-P7821_2229459:638-nf] in respect of which the law was called (the law) of death.[fn-78-P7822_2229894:639-nf] But, behold, he bears testimony to the law, and excuses it on the ground of sin: \"What shall we say, therefore? Is the law sin? God forbid.\"[fn-78-P7823_2230110:640-nf] Fie on you, Marcion. \"God forbid!\" (See how) the apostle recoils from all impeachment of the law. I, however, have no acquaintance with sin except through the law.[fn-78-P7824_2230294:641-nf] But how high an encomium of the law (do we obtain) from this fact, that by it there comes to light the latent presence of sin![fn-78-P7825_2230560:642-nf] It was not the law, therefore, which led me astray, but \"sin, taking occasion by the commandment.\"[fn-78-P7826_2230776:643-nf] Why then do you, (O Marcion, ) impute to the God of the law what His apostle dares not impute even to the law itself?

It appears to me, then, that the reasonable beings which exist are characterized by many forms, and that some of them are the first, some the second, some the third, and so on to the last. To pronounce exactly, however, which is the first, what kind of a being the second is, which may truly be designated third, and to carry this out to the end of the series, this is not a task for man, but transcends our nature. We shall yet venture, such as we are, to stand still a little at this point, and to make some observations on the matter. There are some gods of whom God is god, as we hear in prophecy,[fn-63-P6345_1012512:150-nf] \"Thank ye the God of gods,\" and[fn-63-P6346_1012566:151-nf] \"The God of gods hath spoken, and called the earth.\" Now God, according to the Gospel,[fn-63-P6347_1012670:152-nf] \"is not the God of the dead but of the living.\" Those gods, then, are living of whom God is god. The Apostle, too, writing to the Corinthians, says:[fn-63-P6348_1012839:153-nf] \"As there are gods many and lords many,\" and so we have spoken of these gods as really existing. Now there are, besides the gods of whom God is god, certain others, who are called thrones, and others called dominions, lordships, also, and powers in addition to these. The phrase,[fn-63-P6349_1013142:154-nf] \"above every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come,\" leads us to believe that there are yet others besides these which are less familiar to us; one kind of these the Hebrews called Sabai, from which Sabaoth was formed, who is their ruler, and is none other than God. Add to all these the reasonable being who is mortal, man. Now the God of all things made first in honour some race of reasonable beings; this I consider to be those who are called gods, and the second order, let us say, for the present, are the thrones, and the third, undoubtedly, the dominions. And thus we come down in order to the last reasonable race, which, perhaps, cannot be any other than man. The Saviour accordingly became, in a diviner way than Paul, all things to all, that He might either gain all or perfect them; it is clear that to men He became a man, and to the angels an angel. As for His becoming man no believer has any doubt, but as to His becoming an angel, we shall find reason for believing it was so, if we observe carefully the appearances and the words of the angels, in some of which the powers of the angels seem to belong to Him. In several passages angels speak in such a way as to suggest this, as when[fn-63-P6350_1014407:155-nf] \"the angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire. And he said. I am the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.\" But Isaiah also says:[fn-63-P6351_1014570:156-nf] \"His name is called Angel of Great Counsel.\" The Saviour, then, is the first and the last, not that He is not what lies between, but the extremities are named to show that He became all things. Consider, however, whether the last is man, or the things said to be under the earth, of which are the demons, all of them or some. We must ask, too, about those things which the Saviour became which He speaks of through the prophet David,[fn-63-P6352_1015023:157-nf] \"And I became as a man without any to help him, free among the dead.\" His birth from the Virgin and His life so admirably lived showed Him to be more than man, and it was the same among the dead. He was the only free person there, and His soul was not left in hell. Thus, then, He is the first and the last. Again, if there be letters of God, as such there are, by reading which the saints may say they have read what is written on the tablets of heaven, these letters, by which heavenly things are to be read, are the notions, divided into small parts, into A and so on to W, the Son of God. Again, He is the beginning and the end, but He is this not in all His aspects equally. For He is the beginning, as the Proverbs teach us, inasmuch as He is wisdom; it is written: \"The Lord rounded Me in the beginning of His ways. for His works.\" In the respect of His being the Logos He is not the beginning. \"The Word was in the beginning.\" Thus in His aspects one comes first and is the beginning, and there is a second after the beginning, and a third, and so on to the end, as if He had said, I am the beginning. inasmuch as I am wisdom, and the second, perhaps, inasmuch as I am invisible, and the third in that I am life, for \"what was made was life in Him.\" One who was qualified to examine and to discern the sense of Scripture might, no doubt, find many members of the series; I cannot say if he could find them all. \"The beginning and the end\" is a phrase we usually apply to a thing that is a completed unity; the beginning of a house is its foundation and the end the parapet. We cannot but think of this figure. since Christ is the stone which is the head of the corner, to the great unity of the body of the saved. For Christ the only-begotten Son is all and in all, He is as the beginning in the man He assumed, He is present as the end in the last of the saints, and He is also in those between, or else He is present as the beginning in Adam, as the end in His life on earth, according to the saying: \"The last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\" This saying harmonizes well with the interpretation we have given of the first and the last.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_125_oration_concerning_simeon_and_anna","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"ANF-06","text":"VI.

Then, beside all this, let my womb be a proof to thee, in which He was contained, who in nought else was ever contained, of the substance of which the incarnate Word yet deigned to become incarnate. The blast[fn-60-P6073_1861958:61-nf] of the trumpet does not now terrify those who approach, nor a second time does the mountain all on smoke cause terror to those who draw nigh, nor indeed does the law punish relentlessly[fn-60-P6074_1862164:62-nf] those who would boldly touch. What is here present speaks of love to man; what is here apparent, of the Divine condescension. Thankfully, then, receive the God who comes to thee, for He shall take away thine iniquities, and thoroughly purge thy sins. In thee, let the cleansing of the world first, as in type, have place. In thee, and by thee, let that justification which is of grace become known beforehand to the Gentiles. Thou art worthy of the quickening first-fruits. Thou hast made good use of the law. Use grace henceforth. With the letter thou hast grown weary; in the spirit be renewed. Put off that which his old, and clothe thyself with that which is new. For of these matters I think not that thou art ignorant.","title":"Oration Concerning Simeon and Anna","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_125_oration_concerning_simeon_and_anna","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"ANF-06","text":"IX. Let then, says he, what I have thus far said in brief, suffice for the present as my offering of thanks to God. But what shall I say to thee, O mother-virgin and virgin-mother? For the praise even of her who is not man's work exceeds the power of man. Wherefore the dimness of my poverty I will make bright with the splendour of the gifts of the spirits that around thee shine, and offering to thee of thine own, from the immortal meadows I will pluck a garland for thy sacred and divinely crowned head. With thine ancestral hymns will I greet thee, O daughter of David, and mother of the Lord and God of David. For it were both base and inauspicious to adorn thee, who in thine own glory excellest with that which belongeth unto another. Receive, therefore, O lady most benignant, gifts precious, and such as are fitted to thee alone, O thou who art exalted above all generations, and who, amongst all created things, both visible and invisible, shinest forth as the most honourable. Blessed is the root of Jesse, and thrice blessed is the house of David, in which thou hast sprung up.[fn-60-P6088_1869307:74-nf] God is in the midst of thee, and thou shalt not be moved, for the Most High hath made holy the place of His tabernacle. For in thee the covenants and oaths made of God unto the fathers have received a most glorious fulfilment, since by thee the Lord hath appeared, the God of hosts with us. That bush which could not be touched,[fn-60-P6089_1869657:75-nf] which beforehand shadowed forth thy figure endowed with divine majesty, bare God without being consumed, who manifested Himself to the prophet just so far as He willed to be seen. Then, again, that hard and rugged rock,[fn-60-P6090_1869896:76-nf] which imaged forth the grace and refreshment which has sprung out from thee for all the world, brought forth abundantly in the desert out of its thirsty sides a healing draught for the fainting people. Yea, moreover, the rod of the priest which, without culture, blossomed forth in fruit,[fn-60-P6091_1870205:77-nf] the pledge and earnest of a perpetual priesthood, furnished no contemptible symbol of thy supernatural child-bearing.[fn-60-P6092_1870342:78-nf] What, moreover? Hath not the mighty Moses expressly declared, that on account of these types of thee, hard to be understood,[fn-60-P6093_1870484:79-nf] he delayed longer on the mountain, in order that he might learn, O holy one, the mysteries that with thee are connected? For being commanded to build the ark as a sign and similitude of this thing, he was not negligent in obeying the command, although a tragic occurrence happened on his descent from the mount; but having made it in size five cubits and a half, he appointed it to be the receptacle of the law, and covered it with the wings of the cherubim, most evidently pre-signifying thee, the mother of God, who hast conceived Him without corruption, and in an ineffable manner brought forth Him who is Himself, as it were, the very consistence of incorruption, and that within the limits of the five and a half circles of the world. On thy account, and the undefiled Incarnation of God, the Word, which by thee had place for the sake of that flesh which immutably and indivisibly remains with Him for ever.[fn-60-P6094_1871418:80-nf] The golden pot also, as a most certain type, preserved the manna contained in it, which in other cases was changed day by day, unchanged, and keeping fresh for ages. The prophet Elijah[fn-60-P6095_1871620:81-nf] likewise, as prescient of thy chastity, and being emulous of it through the Spirit, bound around him the crown of that fiery life, being by the divine decree adjudged superior to death.

For all things yielded and succumbed to that divine image which prefigured thee.","title":"Oration Concerning Simeon and Anna","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":3,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Let us see, however, why the words are added, \"And without Him was not anything (Gr. even one thing) made.\" Some might think it superfluous to add to the words \"All things were made through Him,\" the phrase \"Without Him was not anything made.\" For if everything whatsoever was made through the Logos, then nothing was made without Him. Yet it does not follow from the proposition that without the Logos nothing was made, that all things were made through the Logos. It is possible that though nothing was made without the Logos, all things were made, not through the Logos only, but some things by Him. We must, therefore, make ourselves sure in what sense the \"all things\" is to be understood, and in what sense the \"nothing.\" For, without a clear preliminary definition of these terms, it might be maintained that, if all things were made through the Logos, and evil is a part of all things, then the whole matter of sin, and everything that is wicked, that these also were made through the Logos. But this we must regard as false. There is nothing absurd in thinking that creatures were made through the Logos, and also that men's brave deeds have been done through Him, and all the useful acts of those who are now in bliss; but with the sins and misfortunes of men it is otherwise. Now some have held that since evil is not based in the constitution of things-for it did not exist at the beginning and at the end it will have ceased-that, therefore, the evils of which we spoke are the Nothing; and as some of the Greeks say that genera and forms, such as the (general) animal and the man, belong to the category of Nothings, so it has been supposed that all that is not of God is Nothing, and has not even obtained through the Word the subsistence it appears to have. We ask whether it is possible to show from Scripture in any convincing way that this is so. As for the meanings of the word \"Nothing\" and \"Not-being,\" they would appear to be synonymous, for Nothing can be spoken of as Not-being, and the Not-being can be described as Nothing. The Apostle, however, appears to count the things which are not, not among those which have no existence whatever, but rather among things which are evil. To him the Not-being is evil; \"God,\" he says,[fn-64-P6474_1088305:31-nf] \"called the things that are not as things that are.\" And Mardochaeus, too, in the Esther of the Septuagint, calls the enemies of Israel \"those that are not,\" saying,[fn-64-P6475_1088489:32-nf] \"Deliver not Thy sceptre, O Lord, to those that are not.\" We may also notice how evil men, on account of their wickedness, are said not to be, from the name ascribed to God in Exodus:[fn-64-P6476_1088692:33-nf] \"For the Lord said to Moses, I am, that is My name.\" The good God says this with respect of us also who pray that we may be part of His congregation. The Saviour praises him, saying,[fn-64-P6477_1088899:34-nf] \"None is good but one, God the Father.\" The good, then, is the same as He who is. Over against good is evil or wickedness, and over against Him who is that which is not, whence it follows that evil and wickedness are that which is not. This, perhaps, is what has led some to affirm that the devil is not created by God. In respect that he is the devil he is not the work of God, but he who is the devil is a created being, and as there is no other creator but our God, he is a work of God. It is as if we should say that a murderer is not a work of God, while we may say that in respect he is a man, God made him. His being as a man he received from God; we do not assert that he received from God his being as a murderer. All, then, who have part in Him who is, and the saints have part in Him, may properly be called Beings; but those who have given up their part in the Being, by depriving themselves of Being, have become Not-beings. But we said when entering on this discussion, that Not-being and Nothing are synonymous, and hence those who are not beings are Nothing, and all evil is nothing, since it is Not-being, and thus since they are called Not-being came into existence without the Logos, not being numbered among the all things which were made through Him. Thus we have shown, so far as our powers admit, what are the \"all things\" which were made through the Logos, and what came into existence without Him, since at no time is it Being, and it is, therefore, called \"Nothing.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_32_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"119","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"74.

First, in the way of contemplation, when thought is made clear in truth without any mixture of falsehood; and then in the way of conduct, after the sound contemplation of what ought to be done, when action is produced which harmonizes with sound theory of conduct. And that we may the more clearly understand the text, \"Make straight the way of the Lord,\" it will be well to compare with it what is said in the Proverbs,[fn-67-P6790_1229135:67-nf] \"Depart not, either to the right hand or to the left.\" For he who deviates in either direction has given up keeping his path straight, and is no longer worthy of regard, since he has gone apart from the straightness of the journey, for \"the Lord[fn-67-P6791_1229394:68-nf] is righteous, and loves righteousness, and His face beholds straightness.\" Hence he who is the object of regard, and receives the benefit that comes from this oversight, says,[fn-67-P6792_1229586:69-nf] \"The light of Thy countenance was shown upon us, O Lord.\" Let us stand, then, as Jeremiah[fn-67-P6793_1229692:70-nf] exhorts, upon the ways, and let us see and ask after the ancient ways of the Lord, and let us see which is the good way, and walk in it. Thus did the Apostles stand and ask for the ancient ways of the Lord; they asked the Patriarchs and the Prophets, enquiring into their writings, and when they came to understand these writings they saw the good way, namely, Jesus Christ, who said, \"I am the way.\" and they walked in it. For it is a good way that leads the good man to the good father, the man who, from the good treasure of his heart, brings forth good things, and who is a good and faithful servant. This way is narrow, indeed, for the many cannot bear to walk in it and are lovers of their flesh; but it is also hard-pressed[fn-67-P6794_1230442:71-nf] by those who use violence[fn-67-P6795_1230532:72-nf] to walk in it, for it is not called afflicting, but afflicted.[fn-67-P6796_1230614:73-nf] For that way which is a living way, and feels the qualities of those who tread it, is pressed and afflicted, when he travels on it who has not taken off his shoes from off his feet.[fn-67-P6797_1230860:74-nf] nor truly realized that the place on which he stands. or indeed treads, is holy ground. And it will lead to Him who is the life, and who says, \"I am the life.\" For the Saviour, in whom all virtues are combined, has many aspects. To him who, though by no means near the end, is yet advancing, He is the way; to him who has put off all that is dead He is the life. He who travels on this way is told to take nothing with him on it, since it provides bread and all that is necessary for life, enemies are powerless on it, and he needs no staff, and since it is holy, he needs no shoes.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_45_scorpiace_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The earth brings forth, as if by suppuration, great evil from the diminutive scorpion.

And this is the meaning of the expression, that \"men have no excuse for their sin,\" viz., that, from the time the divine word or reason has begun to show them internally the difference between good and evil, they ought to avoid and guard against that which is wicked: \"For to him who knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.\"[fn-63-P6357_1167486:77-nf] Moreover, that all men are not without communion with God, is taught in the Gospel thus, by the Saviour's words: \"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation; neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! but the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-63-P6358_1167752:78-nf] But here we must see whether this does not bear the same meaning with the expression in Genesis: \"And He breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\"[fn-63-P6359_1167955:79-nf] For if this be understood as applying generally to all men, then all men have a share in God.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"ANF-04","text":"1.

But perhaps this question is asked, If it be the understanding which prays and sings with the spirit, and if it be the same which receives both perfection and salvation, how is it that Peter says, \"Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls? \"[fn-66-P6654_1346986:132-nf] If the soul neither prays nor sings with the spirit, how shall it hope for salvation? or when it attains to blessedness, shall it be no longer called a soul?[fn-66-P6655_1347164:133-nf] Let us see if perhaps an answer may be given in this way, that as the Saviour came to save what was lost, that which formerly was said to be lost is not lost when it is saved; so also, perhaps, this which is saved is called a soul, and when it has been placed in a state of salvation will receive a name from the Word that denotes its more perfect condition. But it appears to some that this also may be added, that as the thing which was lost undoubtedly existed before it was lost, at which time it was something else than destroyed, so also will be the case when it is no longer in a ruined condition. In like manner also, the soul which is said to have perished will appear to have been something at one time, when as yet it had not perished, and on that account would be termed soul, and being again freed from destruction, it may become a second time what it was before it perished, and be called a soul. But from the very signification of the name soul which the Greek word conveys, it has appeared to a few curious inquirers that a meaning of no small importance may be suggested. For in sacred language God is called a fire, as when Scripture says,\" Our God is a consuming fire.\"[fn-66-P6656_1349244:134-nf] Respecting the substance of the angels also it speaks as follows: \"Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a burning fire; \"[fn-66-P6657_1349400:135-nf] and in another place, \"The angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire in the bush.\"[fn-66-P6658_1349521:136-nf] We have, moreover, received a commandment to be \"fervent in spirit; \"[fn-66-P6659_1349610:137-nf] by which expression undoubtedly the Word of God is shown to be hot and fiery. The prophet Jeremiah also hears from Him, who gave him his answers, \"Behold, I have given My words into thy mouth a fire.\"[fn-66-P6660_1349832:138-nf] As God, then, is a fire, and the angels a flame of fire, and all the saints are fervent in spirit, so, on the contrary, those who have fallen away from the love of God are undoubtedly said to have cooled in their affection for Him, and to have become cold. For the Lord also says, that, \"because iniquity has abounded, the love of many will grow cold.\"[fn-66-P6661_1350277:139-nf] Nay, all things, whatever they are, which in holy Scripture are compared with the hostile power, the devil is said to be perpetually finding cold; and what is found to be colder than he? In the sea also the dragon is said to reign. For the prophet[fn-66-P6662_1350548:140-nf] intimates that the serpent and dragon, which certainly is referred to one of the wicked spirits, is also in the sea. And elsewhere the prophet says, \"I will draw out my holy sword upon the dragon the flying serpent, upon the dragon the crooked serpent, and will slay him.\"[fn-66-P6663_1350853:141-nf] And again he says: \"Even though they hide from my eyes, and descend into the depths of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.\"[fn-66-P6664_1351030:142-nf] In the book of Job also, he is said to be the king of all things in the waters.[fn-66-P6665_1351129:143-nf] The prophet[fn-66-P6666_1351168:144-nf] threatens that evils will be kindled by the north wind upon all who inhabit the earth. Now the north wind is described in holy Scripture as cold, according to the statement in the book of Wisdom, \"That cold north wind; \"[fn-66-P6667_1351408:145-nf] which same thing also must undoubtedly be understood of the devil. If, then, those things which are holy are named fire, and light, and fervent, while those which are of an opposite nature are said to be cold; and if the love of many is said to wax cold; we have to inquire whether perhaps the name soul, which in Greek is termed yukh/, be so termed from growing cold[fn-66-P6668_1351802:146-nf] out of a betterand more divine condition, and be thence derived, because it seems to have cooled from thatnatural and divine warmth, and therefore has been placed in its present position, and called by its present name. Finally, see if you caneasily find a place in holy Scripture where thesoul is properly mentioned in terms of praise: it frequently occurs, on the contrary, accompanied with expressions of censure, as in the passage, \"An evil soul ruins him who possesses it; \"[fn-66-P6669_1352309:147-nf] and, \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\"[fn-66-P6670_1352376:148-nf] For after it has been said, \"All souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine,\"[fn-66-P6671_1352521:149-nf] it seemed to follow that He would say, \"The soul that doeth righteousness, it shall be saved,\" and \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\" But now we see that He has associated with the soul what is censurable, and has been silent as to that which was deserving of praise. We have therefore to see if, perchance, as we have said is declared by the name itself, it was called yukh/, i.e., anima, because it has waxed cold from the fervour of just things,[fn-66-P6672_1353002:150-nf] and from participation in the divine fire, and yet has not lost the power of restoring itself to that condition of fervour in which it was at the beginning. Whence the prophet also appears to point out some such state of things by the words, \"Return, O my soul, unto thy rest.\"[fn-66-P6673_1353622:151-nf] From all which this appears to be made out, that the understanding, falling away from its status and dignity, was made or named soul; and that, if repaired and corrected, it returns to the condition of the understanding.[fn-66-P6674_1353863:152-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_37_book_i_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"2.

This is the eternal adjustment of the vision, which is able to see the eternal light, since like loves like; and that which is holy, loves that from which holiness proceeds, which has appropriately been termed light. \"Once ye were darkness, now are ye light in the Lord.\"[fn-33-P3386_1015287:56-nf] Hence I am of opinion man was called by the ancientsfw/j.[fn-33-P3387_1015361:57-nf] But he has not yet received, say they, the perfect gift. I also assent to this; but he is in the light, and the darkness comprehendeth him not. There is nothing intermediate between light and darkness. But the end is reserved till the resurrection of those who believe; and it is not the reception of some other thing, but the obtaining of the promise previously made. For we do not say that both take place together at the same time-both the arrival at the end, and the anticipation of that arrival. For eternity and time are not the same, neither is the attempt and the final result; but both have reference to the same thing, and one and the same person is concerned in both. Faith, so to speak, is the attempt generated in time; the final result is the attainment of the promise, secured for eternity. Now the Lord Himself has most clearly revealed the equality of salvation, when He said: \"For this is the will of my Father, that every one that seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, should have everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day.\"[fn-33-P3388_1016450:58-nf] As far as possible in this world, which is what he means by the last day, and which is preserved till the time that it shall end, we believe that we are made perfect. Wherefore He says, \"He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.\"[fn-33-P3389_1016708:59-nf] If, then, those who have believed have life, what remains beyond the possession of eternal life? Nothing is wanting to faith, as it is perfect and complete in itself. If aught is wanting to it, it is not wholly perfect. But faith is not lame in any respect; nor after our departure from this world does it make us who have believed, and received without distinction the earnest of future good, wait; but having in anticipation grasped by faith that which is future, after the resurrection we receive it as present, in order that that may be fulfilled which was spoken, \"Be it according to thy faith.\"[fn-33-P3390_1017328:60-nf] And where faith is, there is the promise; and the consummation of the promise is rest. So that in illumination what we receive is knowledge, and the end of knowledge is rest-the last thing conceived as the object of aspiration. As, then, inexperience comes to an end by experience, and perplexity by finding a clear outlet, so by illumination must darkness disappear. The darkness is ignorance, through which we fall into sins, purblind as to the truth. Knowledge, then, is the illumination we receive, which makes ignorance disappear, and endows us with clear vision. Further, the abandonment of what is bad is the adopting[fn-33-P3391_1017972:61-nf] of what is better. For what ignorance has bound ill, is by knowledge loosed well; those bonds are with all speed slackened by human faith and divine grace, our transgressions being taken away by one Poeonian[fn-33-P3392_1018257:62-nf] medicine, the baptism of the Word. We are washed from all our sins, and are no longer entangled in evil. This is the one grace of illumination, that our characters are not the same as before our washing. And since knowledge springs up with illumination, shedding its beams around the mind, the moment we hear, we who were untaught become disciples. Does this, I ask, take place on the advent of this instruction? You cannot tell the time. For instruction leads to faith, and faith with baptism is trained by the Holy Spirit. For that faith is the one universal salvation of humanity, and that there is the same equality before the righteous and loving God, and the same fellowship between Him and all, the apostle most clearly showed, speaking to the following effect: \"Before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed, so that the law became our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith; but after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.\"[fn-33-P3393_1019327:63-nf] Do you not hear that we are no longer under that law which was accompanied with fear, but under the Word, the master of free choice? Then he subjoined the utterance, clear of all partiality: \"For ye are all the children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-33-P3394_1020084:64-nf] There are not, then, in the same Word some \"illuminated (gnostics); and some animal (or natural) men; \"but all who have abandoned the desires of the flesh are equal and spiritual before the Lord. And again he writes in another place: \"For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free, and we have all drunk of one cup.\"[fn-33-P3395_1020475:65-nf] Nor were it absurd to employ the expressions of those who call the reminiscence of better things the filtration of the spirit, understanding by filtration the separation of what is baser, that results from the reminiscence of what is better. There follows of necessity, in him who has come to the recollection of what is better, repentance for what is worse. Accordingly, they confess that the spirit in repentance retraces its steps. In the same way, therefore, we also, repenting of our sins, renouncing our iniquities, purified by baptism, speed back to the eternal light, children to the Father. Jesus therefore, rejoicing in the spirit, said: \"I thank Thee, O Father, God of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes; \"[fn-33-P3396_1021288:66-nf] the Master and Teacher applying the name babes to us, who are readier to embrace salvation than the wise in the world, who, thinking themselves wise, are inflated with pride. And He exclaims in exultation and exceeding joy, as if lisping with the children, \"Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight.\"[fn-33-P3397_1021617:67-nf] Wherefore those things which have been concealed from the wise and prudent of this present world have been revealed to babes. Truly, then, are we the children of God, who have put aside the old man, and stripped off the garment of wickedness, and put on the immortality of Christ; that we may become a new, holy people by regeneration, and may keep the man undefiled. And a babe, as God's little one,[fn-33-P3398_1022035:68-nf] is cleansed from fornication and wickedness. With the greatest clearness the blessed Paul has solved for us this question in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, writing thus: \"Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit in malice be children, but in understanding be men.\"[fn-33-P3399_1022507:69-nf] And the expression, \"When I was a child, I thought as a child, I spoke as a child,\"[fn-34-P3400_1022612:70-nf] points out his mode of life according to the law, according to which, thinking childish things, he persecuted, and speaking childish things he blasphemed the Word, not as having yet attained to the simplicity of childhood, but as being in its folly; for the wordnh/pion has two meanings.[fn-34-P3401_1022993:71-nf] \"When I became a man,\" again Paul says, \"I put away childish things.\"[fn-34-P3402_1023129:72-nf] It is not incomplete size of stature, nor a definite measure of time, nor additional secret teachings in things that are manly and more perfect, that the apostle, who himself professes to be a preacher of childishness, alludes to when he sends it, as it were, into banishment; but he applies the name \"children\" to those who are under the law, who are terrified by fear as children are by bugbears; and \"men\" to us who are obedient to the Word and masters of ourselves, who have believed, and are saved by voluntary choice, and are rationally, not irrationally, frightened by terror. Of this the apostle himself shall testify, calling as he does the Jews heirs according to the first covenant, and us heirs according to promise: Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; but is under tutors and governors, till the time appointed by the father. So also we, when we were children, were in bondage under the rudiments of the world: but when the fulness of the time was came, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons \"[fn-34-P3403_1024335:73-nf] by Him. See how He has admitted those to be children who are under fear and sins; but has conferred manhood on those who are under faith, by calling them sons, in contradistinction from the children that are under the law: \"For thou art no more a servant,\" he says, \"but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.\"[fn-34-P3404_1024673:74-nf] What, then, is lacking to the son after inheritance? Wherefore the expression, \"When I was a child,\" may be elegantly expounded thus: that is, when I was a Jew (for he was a Hebrew by extraction) I thought as a child, when I followed the law; but after becoming a man, I no longer entertain the sentiments of a child, that is, of the law, but of a man, that is, of Christ, whom alone the Scripture calls man, as we have said before. \"I put away childish things.\" But the childhood which is in Christ is maturity, as compared with the law. Having reached this point, we must defend our childhood. And we have still to explain what is said by the apostle: \"I have fed you with milk (as children in Christ), not with meat; for ye were not able, neither yet are ye now able.\"[fn-34-P3405_1025462:75-nf] For it does not appear to me that the expression is to be taken in a Jewish sense; for I shall oppose to it also that Scripture, \"I will bring you into that good land which flows with milk and honey.\"[fn-34-P3406_1025683:76-nf] A very great difficulty arises in reference to the comparison of these Scriptures, when we consider. For if the infancy which is characterized by the milk is the beginning of faith in Christ, then it is disparaged as childish and imperfect. How is the rest that comes after the meat, the rest of the man who is perfect and endowed with knowledge, again distinguished by infant milk? Does not this, as explaining a parable, mean something like this, and is not the expression to be read somewhat to the following effect: \"I have fed you with milk in Christ; \"and after a slight stop, let us add, \"as children,\" that by separating the words in reading we may make out some such sense as this: I have instructed you in Christ with simple, true, and natural nourishment,-namely, that which is spiritual: for such is the nourishing substance of milk swelling out from breasts of love. So that the whole matter may be conceived thus: As nurses nourish new-born children on milk, so do I also by the Word, the milk of Christ, instilling into you spiritual nutriment.","title":"Book I","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":3,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_52_book_i","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Now hatred of evil attends the good man, in virtue of His being in nature good.

For we find it to be written that God is called Love, and yet from this the substance of God is not declared to be Love; and that He is called Light, while in this is not the substance of God. But the whole that is thus said of God is as much as can be said, so that reasonably also, when He is called a Spirit, it is not all that He is which is so called; but so that, while men's mind by understanding makes progress even to the Spirit itself, being already changed in spirit, it may conjecture God to be something even greater through the Spirit. For that which is, according to what it is, can neither be declared by human discourse, nor received by human ears, nor gathered by human perceptions. For if \"the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him, neither eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard, nor the heart of man, nor even his mind has perceived; \"[fn-101-P10147_3155564:37-nf] what and how great is He Himself who promises these things, in understanding which both the mind and nature of man have failed!

In which manner also, if, according to Moses, you should receive God to be fire, in saying that He is a creature, you will have declared what is ordained, you will not have taught who is its ordainer.

Some designated it `the isles of the blest, 'and others `the Elysian plain, 'so called because they were there to be delivered from their present evils. Thus Homer says: `But the gods shall send thee to the Elysian plain, on the borders of the earth, where they lead a most quiet life.'[fn-109-P10983_2954208:55-nf] Plato also, who believed in the immortality of the soul, distinctly gives the name `land' to the place where it is sent. `The extent of it,'[fn-109-P10984_2954371:56-nf] says he, `is immense, and we only occupy a small portion of it, from the Phasis to the Pillars of Hercules, where we dwell along the shores of the sea, as grasshoppers and frogs beside a marsh. But there are many other places inhabited in like manner by other men. For there are in different parts of the earth cavities, varying in form and in magnitude, into which run water, and clouds, and air. But that land which is pure lies in the pure region of heaven.'\" Celsus therefore supposes that what we say of a land which is much better and more excellent than this, has been borrowed from certain ancient writers whom he styles \"divine,\" and chiefly from Plato, who in his Phaedon discourses on the pure land lying in a pure heaven. But he does not see that Moses, who is much older than the Greek literature, introduces God as promising to those who lived according to His law the holy land, which is \"a good land and a large, a land flowing with milk and honey; \"[fn-109-P10985_2955366:57-nf] which promise is not to be understood to refer, as some suppose, to that part of the earth which we call Judea; for it, however good it may be, still forms part of the earth, which was originally cursed for the transgression of Adam.

And as all the earth has been cursed, it brings forth thorns and briers all the days of the life of those who in Adam were driven out of paradise; and in the sweat of his face every man eats bread until he returns to the ground from which he was taken. For the full exposition of all that is contained in this passage much might be said; but we have confined ourselves to these few words at present, which are intended to remove the idea, that what is said of the good land promised by God to the righteous, refers to the land of Judea.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":3,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_34_de_decretis_or_defence_of_the_nicene_definition","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"22.

But the sentiment of Truth[fn-60-P6034_2406000:187-nf] in this matter must not be hidden, but must have high utterance. For the Word of God was not made for us, but rather we for Him, and `in Him all things were created[fn-60-P6035_2406185:188-nf] .' Nor for that we were weak, was He strong and made by the Father alone, that He might frame us by means of Him as an instrument; perish the thought! it is not so. For though it had seemed good to God not to make things originate, still had the Word been no less with God, and the Father in Him. At the same time, things originate could not without the Word be brought to be; hence they were made through Him,-and reasonably. For since the Word is the Son of God by nature proper to His essence, and is from Him, and in Him[fn-60-P6036_2406729:189-nf] , as He said Himself, the creatures could not have come to be, except through Him. For as the light enlightens all things by its radiance, and without its radiance nothing would be illuminated, so also the Father, as by a hand[fn-60-P6037_2406984:190-nf] , in the Word wrought all things, and without Him makes nothing. For instance, God said, as Moses relates, `Let there be light,' and `Let the waters be gathered together,' and `let the dry land appear,' and `Let Us make man[fn-60-P6038_2407840:191-nf] ;' as also Holy David in the Psalm, `He spake and they were made; He commanded and they were created[fn-60-P6039_2407982:192-nf] .' And He spoke[fn-60-P6040_2408021:193-nf] , not that, as in the case of men, some under-worker might hear, and learning the will of Him who spoke might go away and do it; for this is what is proper to creatures, but it is unseemly so to think or speak of the Word. For the Word of God is Framer and Maker, and He is the Father's Will[fn-60-P6041_2408659:194-nf] . Hence it is that divine Scripture says not that one heard and answered, as to the manner or nature of the things which He wished made; but God only said, `Let it become,' and he adds, `And it became;' for what He thought good and counselled, that forthwith the Word began to do and to finish. For when God commands others, whether the Angels, or converses with Moses, or commands Abraham, then the hearer answers; and the one says, `Whereby shall I know[fn-60-P6042_2409708:195-nf] ?' and the other, `Send some one else[fn-60-P6043_2409765:196-nf] ;' and again, `If they ask me, what is His Name, what shall I say to them[fn-60-P6044_2409858:197-nf] ?' and the Angel said to Zacharias, `Thus saith the Lord[fn-60-P6045_2409939:198-nf] ;' and he asked the Lord, `O Lord of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have mercy on Jerusalem?' and waits to hear good words and comfortable. For each of these has the Mediator[fn-60-P6046_2410145:199-nf] Word, and the Wisdom of God which makes known the will of the Father. But when that Word Himself works and creates, then there is no questioning and answer, for the Father is in Him and the Word in the Father; but it suffices to will, and the work is done; so that the word `He said' is a token of the will for our sake, and `It was so,' denotes the work which is done through the Word and the Wisdom, in which Wisdom also is the Will of the Father. And `God said' is explained in `the Word,' for, he says, `Thou hast made all things in Wisdom;' and `By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made fast;' and `There is one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him[fn-60-P6047_2410844:200-nf] .'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":3,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"6.

But this is not so with things originate and creatures; for when the Father works, it is not that any Angel works, or any other creature; for none of these is an efficient cause[fn-66-P6625_2629546:111-nf] , but they are of things which come to be; and moreover being separate and divided from the only God, and other in nature, and being works, they can neither work what God works, nor, as I said before, when God gives grace, can they give grace with Him. Nor, on seeing an Angel would a man say that he had seen the Father; for Angels, as it is written, are `ministering spirits sent forth to minister[fn-66-P6626_2629971:112-nf] ,' and are heralds of gifts given by Him through the Word to those who receive them. And the Angel on his appearance, himself confesses that he has been sent by his Lord; as Gabriel confessed in the case of Zacharias, and also in the case of Mary, bearer of God[fn-66-P6627_2630252:113-nf] . And he who beholds a vision of Angels, knows that he has seen the Angel and not God. For Zacharias saw an Angel; and Isaiah saw the Lord. Manoah, the father of Samson, saw an Angel; but Moses beheld God. Gideon saw an Angel, but to Abraham appeared God. And neither he who saw God, beheld an Angel, nor he who saw an Angel, considered that he saw God; for greatly, or rather wholly, do things by nature originate differ from God the Creator.

So again to the son of Nun He spake by an Angel. But what God speaks, it is very plain He speaks through the Word, and not through another. And the Word, as being not separate from the Father, nor unlike and foreign to the Father's Essence, what He works, those are the Father's works, and His framing of all things is one with His; and what the Son gives, that is the Father's gift. And he who hath seen the Son, knows that, in seeing Him, he has seen, not Angel, nor one merely greater than Angels, nor in short any creature, but the Father Himself. And he who hears the Word, knows that he hears the Father; as he who is irradiated by the radiance, knows that he is enlightened by the sun.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":3,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_80_book_ii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"But passing over these things which cannot possibly be unfolded because there would be no limit to the telling of them, as the blessings which he gives are without stint, it is time for us to consult the Apostle Paul, the stoutest and clearest witness to Him, for he can tell us everything about God in the most trustworthy way because God always spoke from his breast. He then, the chosen teacher of the nations, who was sent to destroy the errors of Gentile superstition, bears his witness in the following way to the grace and coming of our Lord God: \"The grace,\" he says, \"of God and our Saviour appeared unto all men, instructing us that denying ungodliness and worldly desires we should live soberly and justly and godly in this world, looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.\"[fn-69-P6944_2505359:20-nf] He says that \"there appeared the grace of God our Saviour.\" Admirably does he use a word suited to show the arrival of a new grace and birth; for by saying \"there appeared,\" he indicated the approach of a new grace and birth, for thenceforward the gift of a new grace began to appear, from the moment when God appeared as born in the world. Thus by using the right word, and one exactly suitable, he shows the light of this new grace almost as if he pointed to it with his finger. For that is most properly said to appear, which is shown by sudden light manifesting it. Just as we read in the gospel that the star appeared to the wise men in the East:[fn-69-P6945_2506035:21-nf] and in Exodus: \"There appeared,\" he says, \"to Moses an angel in a flame of fire in the bush:\"[fn-69-P6946_2506148:22-nf] for in all these and in the case of other visions in the Holy Scripture, Scripture determined that this word in particular should be used, that it might speak of that as \"appearing,\" which shone forth with unwonted light. So then the Apostle also, well knowing the coming of the heavenly grace, which appeared at the approach of the holy nativity, indicated it by using a term applied to a bright appearance; expressly in order to say that it appeared, as it shone with the splendour of a new light. \"There appeared\" then \"the grace of God our Saviour.\" Surely you cannot raise any quibble about the ambiguity of the names in this place, so as to say that \"Christ\"is one and \"God\" another, or to divide \"the Saviour\" from the glory of His name, and separate \"the Lord\" from the Divinity? Lo, here the vessel[fn-69-P6947_2507005:23-nf] of God speaks from God, and testifies by the clearest statement that the grace of God appeared from Mary. And in order that you may not deny that God appeared from Mary, he at once adds the name of Saviour, on purpose that you may believe that He who is born of Mary is God, whom you cannot deny to have been born a Saviour, in accordance with this passage: \"For to you is born to-day a Saviour.\"[fn-69-P6948_2507424:24-nf] O excellent teacher of the Gentiles truly given by God to them, for he knew that this wild heretical folly would arise, which would turn to controversial uses the names of God, and would not hesitate to slander God from His own titles; and so just in order that the heretic might not separate the title of Saviour from the Divinity he put first the name of God, that the name of God standing first might claim as His all the names which followed, and that no one might imagine that in what followed Christ was spoken of as a mere man, as by the very first word used he had taught that He was God. \"Looking,\" says the same Apostle, \"for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.\" Certainly that teacher of divine wisdom saw that plain and simple teaching would not in itself be sufficient to meet the crafty wiles of the devil's cunning, unless he fortified the holy preaching of the faith with a protection of extreme care. And so although he had used the name of God the Saviour up above, he here adds \"Jesus Christ,\" in case you might think that the mere name of Saviour was not enough to indicate to you our Lord Jesus Christ, and might fail to understand that the God, whom you acknowledge as God the Saviour, is the same Jesus Christ. What then does he say? He says: \"Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.\" Nothing is here wanting as regards the titles of our Lord and you see here God, and the Saviour, and Jesus, and Christ. But when you see all these, you see that they all belong to God. For you have heard of Him as God, but as Saviour as well. You have heard of Him as God, but as Jesus as well. You have heard of Him as God, but as Christ as well. That which the Divinity has joined and united together cannot be separated by this diversity of titles; for whichever you may seek for of them, all, you will find it there. The Saviour is God, Jesus is God, Christ is God. In all of this which you hear, though the titles used are many, yet they belong to one Person in power. For whereas the Saviour is God, and Jesus is God, and Christ is God, it is easy to see that all these, though different appellations, are united as regards the Majesty. And when you hear quite plainly that one and the same Person is called God in each case, you can surely clearly see that in all these cases there is but one God spoken of. And so you cannot any longer seek to make out a distinction of power from the different names given to the Lord, or to make a difference of Person owing to variety of titles. You cannot say: Christ was born of Mary, but God was not; for an Apostle declares that God was. You cannot say that Jesus was born of Mary, but God was not; for an Apostle testifies that God was. You cannot say: the Saviour was born, but God was not; for an Apostle supports the fact that God was. There is no way of escape for you. Whichever of the titles of the Lord you may take, He is God, of whom you speak. You have nothing to say: nothing to assert: nothing to invent in your wicked falsehood. You can in impious un belief refuse to believe: you have nothing to deny in the matter of your blasphemy.","title":"Book II.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_62_discourse_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"1.

For the Word, being Son of the One God, is referred to Him of whom also He is; so that Father and Son are two, yet the Monad of the Godhead is indivisible and inseparable. And thus too we preserve One Beginning of Godhead and not two Beginnings, whence there is strictly a Monarchy. And of this very Beginning the Word is by nature Son, not as if another beginning, subsisting by Himself, nor having come into being externally to that Beginning, lest from that diversity a Dyarchy and Polyarchy should ensue; but of the one Beginning He is own Son, own Wisdom, own Word, existing from It. For, according to John, `in' that `Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,' for the Beginning was God; and since He is from It, therefore also `the Word was God.' And as there is one Beginning and therefore one God, so one is that Essence and Subsistence which indeed and truly and really is, and which said `I am that I am[fn-70-P7093_2821042:3-nf] ,' and not two, that there be not two Beginnings; and from the One, a Son in nature and truth, is Its own Word, Its Wisdom, Its Power, and inseparable from It. And as there is not another essence, lest there be two Beginnings, so the Word which is from that One Essence has no dissolution, nor is a sound significative, but is an essential Word and essential Wisdom, which is the true Son. For were He not essential, God will be speaking into the air[fn-70-P7094_2821511:4-nf] , and having a body, in nothing differently from men; but since He is not man, neither is His Word according to the infirmity of man[fn-70-P7095_2821662:5-nf] . For as the Beginning is one Essence, so Its Word is one, essential, and subsisting, and Its Wisdom.

For He must have been with Him from whom He came: andHe came from Him, from whom He said that He was sent. Whence it comes that when the Jews said to Him, \"Thou art not yet fifty years old and hast Thou seen Abraham?\" He replied in words that exactly suit His eternity and glory, saying, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham came into being, I am.\"[fn-72-P7230_2639550:27-nf] I ask then, whose saying do you think this is? Certainly it is Christ's without any doubt. And how could He who had been but recently born, say that He was before Abraham? Simply owing to the Word of God, with which He was entirely united, so that all might understand the closeness of the union of Christ and God: since whatever God said in Christ, that in its fulness the unity of the Divinity claimed for Himself. But conscious of His own eternity, He rightly then when in the body, replied to the Jews, with the very words which He had formerly spoken to Moses in the Spirit. For here He says, \"Before Abraham came into being, I am.\" But to Moses He says, \"I am that I am.\"[fn-72-P7231_2640248:28-nf] He certainly announced the eternity of His Divine nature with marvellous grandeur of language, for nothing can be spoken so worthily of God, as that He should be said ever to be. For \"to be\" admits of no beginning in the past or end in the future. And so this is very clearly spoken of the nature of the eternal God, as it exactly describes His eternity. And this the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, when He was speaking of Abraham, showed by the difference of terms used, saying, \"Before Abraham came into being I am.\" Of Abraham he said, \"Before he came into being:\" Of Himself, \"I am,\" for it belongs to things temporal to come into being: to be belongs to eternity. And so \"to come into being\" He assigns to human transitoriness: but \"to be\" to His own nature. And all this was found in Christ who, by virtue of the mystery of the manhood and Divinity joined together in Him who ever \"was,\" could say that He already \"was.\"","title":"Book V.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":3,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_43_tractate_xxxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"8. But look at this which is said by Christ the Lord: \"If ye believe not that I am, ye shall die in your sins.\" What is this, \"If ye believe not that I am?\" \"I am\" what? There is nothing added; and because He added nothing, He left much to be inferred. For He was expected to say what He was, and yet He said it not. What was He expected to say? Perhaps, \"If ye believe not that I am\" Christ; \"if ye believe not that I am\" the Son of God; \"if ye believe not that I am\" the Word of the Father: \"if ye believe not that I am\" the founder of the world; \"if ye believe not that I am\" the former and re-former, the creator and re-creator, the maker and re-maker of man;-\" if ye believe not that I am\" this, \"ye shall die in your sins.\" There is much implied in His only saying \"I am;\" for so also had God said to Moses, \"I am who am.\" Who can adequately express what that AM means? God by His angel sent His servant Moses to deliver His people out of Egypt (you have read and know what you now hear; but I recall it to your minds); He sent him trembling, self-excusing, but obedient. And while thus excusing himself, he said to God, whom he understood to be speaking in the person of the angel: If the people say to me, And who is the God that hath sent thee? what shall I say to them? And the Lord answered him, \"I am who am;\" and added, \"Thou shalt say to the children of Israel, He who is hath sent me to you.\" There also He says not, I am God; or, I am the framer of the world; or, I am the creator of all things; or, I am the multiplier of the very people to be delivered: but only this, \"I am who am;\" and, \"Thou shall say to the children of Israel, He who is.\" He added not, Who is your God, who is the God of your fathers; but said only this: \"He who is hath sent me to you.\" Perhaps it was too much even for Moses himself, as it is too much for us also, and much more so for us, to understand the meaning of such words, \"I am who am;\" and, \"He who is hath sent me to you.\" And supposing that Moses comprehended it, when would those to whom he was sent comprehend it? The Lord therefore put aside what man could not comprehend, and added what he could; for He said also besides, \"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\"[fn-16-P1646_1048922:9-nf] This thou canst comprehend; for \"I am who am,\" what mind can comprehend?","title":"Tractate XXXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":3,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_44_tractate_xxxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"8. I see I must speak more plainly. And, not to detain you long, let me treat only of this point to-day. When I have finished what, with God's help, I wish to say, my discourse shall close. I have said this, then, to enlist your attention. Every soul, as being a thing, is mutable; and although a great creature, yet a creature; though superior to the body, yet made. Every soul, then, since it is changeable-that is, sometimes believes, sometimes disbelieves; at one time wishes, at another time refuses; at one time is adulterous, at another chaste; now good, and again wicked, -is changeable. But God is that which is, and so has retained as His own peculiar name, \"I am who am.\"[fn-16-P1680_1070349:9-nf] Such also is the Son, when He says, \"If ye believe not that I am;\" and thereto pertains also, \"Who art thou? The Beginning\" (ver. 25). God therefore is unchangeable, the soul changeable. When the soul receives from God the elements of its goodness it becomes good by participation, just as by participation thine eye seeth. For it sees not when the light is withdrawn, while so long as it shares in the light it sees. Since then by participation the soul is made good, if it changes and becomes bad, the goodness remains that made it good. For there is a goodness of which it partook when good; and when it has turned to evil, that goodness continues entire. If the soul fall away and become evil, there is no lessening of goodness; if it return and become good, that goodness is not enlarged. Thine eye participates in this light, and thou seest. Is it shut? Then thou hast not diminished the light. Is it open? Thou hast not increased the light. By this illustration, brethren understand that if the soul is pious, there is piety with God, of which the soul is partaker; if the soul is chaste, there is chastity with God, of which it partakes; if it is good, there is goodness with God, of which it partakes; if it is true, there is truth with God, of which the soul is partaker. Whereof if the soul is no partaker, every man is false;[fn-16-P1681_1071704:10-nf] and if every man may be false, no man is true of himself.[fn-16-P1682_1071781:11-nf] But the true Father is true of Himself,[fn-16-P1683_1071834:12-nf] for He begat the Truth. It is one thing to say, That man is true, for he has taken in the truth: it is another, God is true, for He begat the Truth. See then how God is true,-not by participating in, but by generating the Truth. I see you have understood me, and am glad. Let this suffice you to-day. The rest, according as He gives it, we shall expound when the Lord pleases.

The Lord then, recognizing such in that crowd, said, \"When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [He].\" You know already what \"I am\" signifies; and we must not be continually repeating, lest so great a subject beget distaste. Recall that, \"I am who am,\" and \"He who is hath sent me,\"[fn-16-P1694_1075575:3-nf] and you will recognize the meaning of the words, \"Then shall ye know that I am.\" But both the Father is, and the Holy Spirit is. To the same is belongs the whole Trinity. But because the Lord spake as the Son, in order that, when He says, \"Then shall ye know that I am,\" there might be no chance of entrance for the error of the Sabellians, that is, of the Patripassians,-an error which I have charged you not to hold, but to beware of,-the error, I mean, of those who have said, The Father and Son are one and the same; two names, but one reality;-to guard them against that error, when the Lord said, \"Then shall ye know that I am,\" that He might not be understood as Himself the Father, He immediately added, \"And I do nothing of myself; but as my Father taught me, I speak these things.\" Already was the Sabellian beginning to rejoice over the discovery of a ground for his error; but immediately on showing himself as it were in the shade, he was confounded by the light of the following sentence. Thou thoughtest that He was the Father, because He said, \"I am.\" Hear now that He is the Son: \"And I do nothing of myself.\" What means this, \"I do nothing of myself\"? Of myself I am not. For the Son is God, of[fn-16-P1695_1076805:4-nf] the Father; but the Father is God, yet not of the Son. The Son is God of God, and the Father is God, but not of God.

But this they suppress, but make much of what was done by violence in Thrace[fn-78-P7847_3144382:11-nf] ; thus shewing that they are dissemblers of the Arian heresy, and aliens from the sound Faith. And again, if a man were to examine and compare the great synod itself, and those held by these people, he would discover the piety of the one and the folly of the others. They who assembled at Nicaea did so not after being deposed: and secondly, they confessed that the Son was of the Essence of the Father. But the others, after being deposed again and again, and once more at Ariminum itself, ventured to write that it ought not to be said that the Son had Essence or Subsistence. This enables us to see, brethren, that they of Nicaea breathe the spirit of Scripture, in that God says in Exodus[fn-78-P7848_3145099:12-nf] , `I am that I am,' and through Jeremiah, `Who is in His substance[fn-78-P7849_3145184:13-nf] and hath seen His word;' and just below, `if they had stood in My subsistence[fn-78-P7850_3145300:14-nf] and heard My words:' now subsistence is essence, and means nothing else but very being, which Jeremiah calls existence, in the words, `and they heard not the voice of existence[fn-78-P7851_3145500:15-nf] .' For subsistence, and essence, is existence: for it is, or in other words exists. This Paul also perceiving wrote to the Hebrews, `who being the brightness of his glory, and the express Image of his subsistence[fn-78-P7852_3145745:16-nf] .' But the others, who think they know the Scriptures and call themselves wise, and do not choose to speak of subsistence in God (for thus they wrote at Ariminum and at other synods of theirs), were surely with justice deposed, saying as they did, like the fool did in his heart[fn-78-P7853_3146041:17-nf] , `God is not.' And again the fathers taught at Nicaea that the Son and Word is not a creature, nor made, having read `all things were made through Him[fn-78-P7854_3146210:18-nf] ,' and `in Him were all things created, and consist[fn-78-P7855_3146278:19-nf] ;' while these men, Arians rather than Christians, in their other synods have ventured to call Him a creature, and one of the things that are made, things of which He Himself is the Artificer and Maker.
