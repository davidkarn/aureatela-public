The law prohibits the gods of the nations from being named,[fn-8-P832_333603:162-nf] not of course that we are not to pronounce their names, the speaking of which common intercourse extorts from us: for this must very frequently be said, \"You find him in the temple of Â¦sculapius; \"and, \"I live in Isis Street; \"and, \"He has been made priest of Jupiter; \"and much else after this manner, since even on men names of this kind are bestowed.

Well, we never find it expressed with the same precision, \"Thou shalt not enter circus or theatre, thou shalt not look on combat or show; \"as it is plainly laid down, \"Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not worship an idol; thou shalt not commit adultery or fraud.\"[fn-9-P907_359789:6-nf] But we find that that first word of David bears on this very sort of thing: \"Blessed,\" he says, \"is the man who has not gone into the assembly of the impious, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of scorners.\"[fn-9-P908_360031:7-nf] Though he seems to have predicted beforehand of that just man, that he took no part in the meetings and deliberations of the Jews, taking counsel about the slaying of our Lord, yet divine Scripture has ever far-reaching applications: after the immediate sense has been exhausted, in all directions it fortifies the practice of the religious life, so that here also you have an utterance which is not far from a plain interdicting of the shows. If he called those few Jews an assembly of the wicked, how much more will he so designate so vast a gathering of heathens! Are the heathens less impious, less sinners, less enemies of Christ, than the Jews were then? And see, too, how other things agree. For at the shows they also stand in the way. For they call the spaces between the seats going round the amphitheatre, and the passages which separate the people running down, ways. The place in the curve where the matrons sit is called a chair. Therefore, on the contrary, it holds, unblessed is he who has entered any council of wicked men, and has stood in any way of sinners, and has sat in any chair of scorners. We may understand a thing as spoken generally, even when it requires a certain special interpretation to be given to it. For some things spoken with a special reference contain in them general truth. When God admonishes the Israelites of their duty, or sharply reproves them, He has surely a reference to all men; when He threatens destruction to Egypt and Ethiopia, He surely pre-condemns every sinning nation, whatever. If, reasoning from species to genus, every nation that sins against them is an Egypt and Ethiopia; so also, reasoning from genus to species, with reference to the origin of shows, every show is an assembly of the wicked.","title":"The Shows, or De Spectaculis.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":20,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_09_book_v_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"158","folder":"ANF-05","text":"These are the statements which the patrons[fn-12-P1278_351242:217-nf] of the Sethian doctrines make, as far as it is possible to declare in a few words.

In order, therefore, that the human mind might be purged from falsities of this kind, Holy Scripture, which suits itself to babes has not avoided words drawn from any class of things really existing, through which, as by nourishment, our understanding might rise gradually to things divine and transcendent. For, in speaking of God, it has both used words taken from things corporeal, as when it says, \"Hide me under the shadow of Thy wings;\"[fn-1-P175_53734:2-nf] and it has borrowed many things from the spiritual creature, whereby to signify that which indeed is not so, but must needs so be said: as, for instance, \"I the Lord thy God am a jealous God;\"[fn-1-P176_53943:3-nf] and, \"It repenteth me that I have made man.\"[fn-1-P177_54002:4-nf] But it has drawn no words whatever, whereby to frame either figures of speech or enigmatic sayings, from things which do not exist at all. And hence it is that they who are shut out from the truth by that third kind of error are more mischievously and emptily vain than their fellows; in that they surmise respecting God, what can neither be found in Himself nora in ny creature. For divine Scripture is wont to frame, as it were, allurements for children from the things which are found in the creature; whereby, according to their measure, and as it were by steps, the affections of the weak may be moved to seek those things that are above, and to leave those things that are below. But the same Scripture rarely employs those things which are spoken properly of God, and are not found in any creature; as, for instance, that which was said to Moses, \"I am that I am;\" and, \"I Am hath sent me to you.\"[fn-1-P178_54922:5-nf] For since both body and soul also are said in some sense to be, Holy Scripture certainly would not so express itself unless it meant to be understood in some special sense of the term. So, too, that which the Apostle says, \"Who only hath immortality.\"[fn-1-P179_55190:6-nf] Since the soul also both is said to be, and is, in a certain manner immortal, Scripture would not say \"only hath,\" unless because true immortality is unchangeableness; which no creature can possess, since it belongs to the creator alone.[fn-1-P180_55447:7-nf] So also James says, \"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.\"[fn-1-P181_55833:8-nf] So also David, \"Thou, shall change them, and they shall be changed; but Thou art the same.\"[fn-1-P182_55940:9-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"25.

All these things, then, were wrought through the creature serving the Creator, and were presented in a suitable economy (dispensatio) to human senses; unless, perhaps, because it is said,\"And Moses drew near to the cloud where God was,\" carnal thoughts must needs suppose that the cloud was indeed seen by the people, but that within the cloud Moses with the eyes of the flesh saw the Son of God, whom doting heretics will have to be seen in His own substance. Forsooth, Moses may have seen Him with the eyes of the flesh, if not only the wisdom of God which is Christ, but even that of any man you please and howsoever wise, can be seen with the eyes of the flesh; or if, because it is written of the elders of Israel, that \"they saw the place where the God of Israel had stood,\" and that \"there was under His feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness,\"[fn-5-P583_216807:92-nf] therefore we are to believe that the word and wisdom of God in His own substance stood within the space of an earthly place, who indeed \"reacheth firmly from end to end, and sweetly ordereth all things;\"[fn-5-P584_217030:93-nf] and that the Word of God, by whom all things were made,[fn-5-P585_217106:94-nf] is in such wise changeable, as now to contract, now to expand Himself; (may the Lord cleanse the hearts of His faithful ones from such thoughts!)

Again, no widow of youthful age must quiet her qualms of conscience by the plea that he gives commandment that no widow is to be taken into the number under three-score years old.[fn-45-P4547_1235128:3235-nf] He does not by this arrangement urge unmarried girls or youthful widows to marry, seeing that even of the married he says: \"the time is short: it remaineth that they that have wives be as though they had none.\"[fn-45-P4548_1235361:3236-nf] No, he is speaking of widows who have relations able to support them, who have sons and grandsons to be responsible for their maintenance. The apostle commands these latter to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents and to relieve them adequately; that the church may not be charged, but may be free to relieve those that are widows indeed. \"Honour widows,\" he writes, \"that are widows indeed,\" that is, such as are desolate and have no relations to help them, who cannot labour with their hands, who are weakened by poverty and overcome by years, whose trust is in God and their only work prayer.[fn-45-P4549_1235993:3237-nf] From which it is easy to infer that the younger widows, unless they are excused by ill health, are either left to their own exertions or else are consigned to the care of their children or relations. The word `honour' in this passage implies either alms or a gift, as also in the verse immediately following: \"Let the elders ...be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.\"[fn-45-P4550_1236447:3238-nf] So also in the gospel when the Lord discusses that commandment of the Law which says: \"Honour thy father and thy mother,\"[fn-45-P4551_1236592:3239-nf] He declares that it is to be interpreted not of mere words which while offering an empty shew of regard may still leave a parent's wants unrelieved, but of the actual provision of the necessaries of life. The Lord commanded that poor parents should be supported by their children and that these should pay them back when old those benefits which they had themselves received in their childhood. The scribes and pharisees on the other hand taught the children to answer their parents by saying: \"It is Corban, that is to say, a gift[fn-45-P4552_1237146:3240-nf] which I have promised to the altar and engaged to present to the temple: it will relieve you as much there, as if I were to give it you directly to buy food.\"[fn-45-P4553_1237328:3241-nf] So it frequently happened that while father and mother were destitute their children were offering sacrifices for the priests and scribes to consume. If then the apostle compels poor widows-yet only those who are young and not broken down by sickness-to labour with their hands that the church, not charged with their maintenance, may be able to support such widows as are old, what plea can be urged by one who has abundance of this world's goods, both for her own wants and those of others, and who can make to herself friends of the mammon of unrighteousness able to receive her into everlasting habitations?[fn-45-P4554_1238016:3242-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":20,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1545","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3. All this may perhaps seem to you matter for jesting, seeing that you take so much pleasure in comedies and lyrics and mimes like those of Lentulus;[fn-55-P5580_1555736:3964-nf] although so blunted is your wit that I am not disposed to allow that you can understand even language so simple. You may treat the words of prophets with contempt, but Amos will still make answer to you: \"Thus saith the Lord, For three transgressions and for four shall I not turn away from him?\"[fn-55-P5581_1556116:3965-nf] For inasmuch as Damascus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, the Ammonites and the Moabites, the Jews also and the children of Israel, although God had often prophesied to them to turn and to repent, had refused to hear His voice, the Lord wishing to shew that He had most just cause for the wrath that he was going to bring upon them used the words already quoted, \"For three transgressions and for four shall I not turn away from them?\" It is wicked, God says, to harbour evil thoughts; yet I have allowed them to do so. It is still more wicked to carry them out; yet in My mercy and kindness I have permitted even this. But should the sinful thought have become the sinful deed? Should men in their pride have trampled thus on my tenderness? Nevertheless \"I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live;\"[fn-55-P5582_1556979:3966-nf] and as it is not they that are whole who need a physician but they that are sick,[fn-55-P5583_1557088:3967-nf] even after his sin I hold out a hand to the prostrate sinner and exhort him, polluted as he is in his own blood,[fn-55-P5584_1557222:3968-nf] to wash away his stains with tears of penitence. But if even then he shews himself unwilling to repent, and if, after he has suffered shipwreck, he refuses to clutch the plank which alone can save him, I am compelled at last to say: \"Thus saith the Lord, For three transgressions and for four shall I not turn away from him?\" For this \"turning away\" God accounts a punishment, inasmuch as the sinner is left to his own devices. It is thus that he visits the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation;[fn-55-P5585_1557783:3969-nf] not punishing those who sin immediately but pardoning their first offences and only passing sentence on them for their last. For if it were otherwise and if God were to stand forth on the moment as the avenger of iniquity, the church would lose many of its saints; and certainly would be deprived of the apostle Paul. The prophet Ezekiel, from whom we have quoted above, repeating God's words spoken to himself speaks thus: \"Open thy mouth and eat what I shall give thee. And behold,\" he says, \"an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; and he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and a song, and woe.\"[fn-55-P5586_1558496:3970-nf] The first of these three belongs to you if you prove willing, as a sinner, to repent of your sins. The second belongs to those who are holy, who are called upon to sing praises to God; for praise does not become a sinner's mouth. And the third belongs to persons like you who in despair have given themselves over to uncleanness, to fornication, to the belly, and to the lowest lusts; men who suppose that death ends all and that there is nothing beyond it; who say: \"When the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us.\"[fn-55-P5587_1559086:3971-nf] The book which the prophet eats is the whole series of the Scriptures, which in turn bewail the penitent, celebrate the righteous, and curse the desperate. For nothing is so displeasing to God as an impenitent heart. Impenitence is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness. For if one who ceases to sin is pardoned even after he has sinned, and if prayer has power to bend the judge; it follows that every impenitent sinner must provoke his judge to wrath. Thus despair is the one sin for which there is no remedy. By obstinate rejection of God's grace men turn His mercy into sternness and severity. Yet, that you may know that God does every day call sinners to repentance, hear Isaiah's Words: \"In that day,\" he says, \"did the Lord God of Hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.\" After these words filled with the recklessness of despair the Scripture goes on to say: \"And it was revealed in my ears by the Lord of Hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die.\"[fn-55-P5588_1560295:3972-nf] Only when they become dead to sin, will their sin be forgiven them.

Expel, therefore, from your hearts carnal thoughts, that you may be really under grace, that you may belong to the New Testament. Therefore is life eternal promised in the New Testament. Read the Old Testament, and see that the same things were enjoined upon a people yet carnal as upon us. For to worship one God is also enjoined upon us. \"Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain\" is also enjoined upon us, which is the second commandment. \"Observe the Sabbath-day\" is enjoined on us more than on them, because it is commanded to be spiritually observed. For the Jews observe the Sabbath in a servile manner, using it for luxuriousness and drunkenness. How much better would their women be employed in spinning wool than in dancing on that day in the balconies? God forbid, brethren, that we should call that an observance of the Sabbath. The Christian observes the Sabbath spiritually, abstaining from servile work. For what is it to abstain from servilework? From sin. And how do we prove it? Ask the Lord. \"Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.\"[fn-3-P335_89940:24-nf] Therefore is the spiritual observance of the Sabbath enjoined upon us. Now all those commandments are more enjoined on us, and are to be observed: \"Thou shall not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not bear false witness. Honor thy father and thy mother. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods. Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife.\"[fn-3-P336_90337:25-nf] Are not all these things enjoined upon us also?

Behold, the man is dead: was God dead who had rescued them from the land of Egypt? And when they had made to themselves the image of a calf, they offered it adoration, and said, \"These be thy gods, O Israel, which delivered thee out of the land of Egypt.\"[fn-3-P339_91537:28-nf] How soon forgetful of such manifest grace!

What the law of works enjoins by menace, that the law of faith secures by faith. The one says, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-14-P1416_692191:91-nf] the other says, \"When I perceived that nobody could be continent, except God gave it to him; and that this was the very point of wisdom, to know whose gift she was; I approached unto the Lord, and I besought Him.\"[fn-14-P1417_692422:92-nf] This indeed is the very wisdom which is called piety, in which is worshipped \"the Father of lights, from whom is every best giving and perfect gift.\"[fn-14-P1418_692594:93-nf] This worship, however, consists in the sacrifice of praise and giving of thanks, so that the worshipper of God boasts not in himself, but in Him.[fn-14-P1419_692757:94-nf] Accordingly, by the law of works, God says to us, Do what I command thee; but by the law of faith we say to God, Give me what Thou commandest. Now this is the reason why the law gives its command, - to admonish us what faith ought to do, that is, that he to whom the command is given, if he is as yet unable to perform it, may know what to ask for; but if he has at once the ability, and complies with the command, he ought also to be aware from whose gift the ability comes. \"For we have received not the spirit of this world,\" says again that most constant preacher of grace, \"but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.\"[fn-14-P1420_693454:95-nf] What, however, \"is the spirit of this world,\" but the spirit of pride? By it their foolish heart is darkened, who, although knowing God, glorified Him not as God, by giving Him thanks.[fn-14-P1421_693660:96-nf] Moreover, it is really by this same spirit that they too are deceived, who, while ignorant of the righteousness of God, and wishing to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted to God's righteousness.[fn-14-P1422_693890:97-nf] It appears to me, therefore, that he is much more \"a child of faith\" who has learned from what source to hope for what he has not yet, than he who attributes to himself whatever he has; although, no doubt, to both of these must be preferred the man who both has, and at the same time knows from whom he has it, if nevertheless he does not believe himself to be what he has not yet attained to. Let him not fall into the mistake of the Pharisee, who, while thanking God for what he possessed, yet failed to ask for any further gift, just as if he stood in, want of nothing for the increase or perfection of his righteousness.[fn-14-P1423_694531:98-nf] Now, having duly considered and weighed all these circumstances and testimonies, we conclude that a man is not justified by the precepts of a holy life, but by faith in Jesus Christ,-in a word, not by the law of works, but by the law of faith; not by the letter,but by the spirit; not by the merits of deeds, but by free grace.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"141","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The one was therefore old, because the other is new.

It is one thing to fail at present in attaining to the fulness of love, and another thing to be swayed by no lust. A man ought therefore to abstain from every unlawful desire, although he loves God now far less than it is possible to love Him when He becomes an object of sight; just as in matters connected with the bodily senses, the eye can receive no pleasure from any kind of darkness, although it may be unable to look with a firm sight amidst refulgent light. Only let us see to it that we so constitute the soul of man in this corruptible body,that, although it has not yet swallowed up and consumed the motions of earthly lust in that super-eminent perfection of the love of God, it nevertheless, in that inferior righteousness to which we have referred, gives no consent to the aforesaid lust for the purpose of effecting any unlawful thing.

(These things being so, it will be sin in the man who lives by faith ever to consent to an unlawful delight,-by committing not only frightful deeds and crimes, but even trifling faults; sinful, if he lend an ear to a word that ought not to be listened to, or a tongue to a phrase which shouldnot be uttered; sinful, if he entertains a thought in his heart in such a way as to wish that an evil pleasure were a lawful one, although known to be unlawful by the commandment,-for this amounts to a consent to sin, which would certainly be carried out in act, unless fear of punishment deterred.)[fn-18-P1845_805025:391-nf] Have such just men, while living by faith, no need to say: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors?\"[fn-18-P1846_805344:392-nf] And do they prove this to be wrong which is written, \"In Thy sight shall no man living be justified?\"[fn-18-P1847_805466:393-nf] and this: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-18-P1848_805581:394-nf] and, \"There is no manthat sinneth not;\"[fn-18-P1849_805641:395-nf] and again, \"There is not on the earth a righteous man, who doeth good and sinneth not\"[fn-18-P1850_805753:396-nf] (for both these statements are expressed in a general future sense,-\"sinneth not,\" \"will not sin,\"-not in the past time, \"has not sinned\")?-and all other places of this purport contained in the Holy Scripture? Since, however, these passages cannot possibly be false, it plainly follows, to my mind, that whatever be the quality or extent of the righteousness which we may definitely ascribe to the present life, there is not a man living in it who is absolutely free from all sin; and that it is necessary for every one to give, that it may be given to him;[fn-18-P1851_806335:397-nf] and to forgive, that it may be forgiven him;[fn-18-P1852_806404:398-nf] and whatever righteousness he has, not to presume that he has it of himself, but from the grace of God, who justifies him, and still to go on hungering and thirsting for righteousness[fn-18-P1853_806607:399-nf] from Him who is the living bread,[fn-18-P1854_806660:400-nf] and with whom is the fountain of life;[fn-18-P1855_806719:401-nf] who works in His saints, whilst labouring amidst temptation in this life, their justification in such manner that He may still have somewhat to impart to them liberally when they ask, and something mercifully to forgive them when they confess.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_09_book_ii_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"213","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"130.

For unless He had given it to all by no means would He have habitually permitted even proselytes out of the nations to have access to it. But-as is congruous with the goodness of God, and with His equity, as the Fashioner of mankind-He gave to all nations the selfsame law, which at definite and stated times He enjoined should be observed, when He willed, and through whom He willed, and as He willed. For in the beginning of the world He gave to Adam himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of the tree planted in the midst of paradise; but that, if they did contrariwise, by death they were to die.[fn-20-P2047_698574:16-nf] Which law had continued enough for them, had it been kept. For in this law given to Adam we recognise in embryo[fn-20-P2048_698720:17-nf] all the precepts which afterwards sprouted forth when given through Moses; that is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart and out of thy whole soul; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;[fn-20-P2049_698941:18-nf] Thou shalt not kill; Thou shall not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; False witness thou shall not utter; Honour thy father and mother; and, That which is another's, shall thou not covet. For the primordial law was given to Adam and Eve in paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of God. In short, if they had loved the Lord their God, they would not have contravened His precept; if they had habitually loved their neighbour-that is, themselves[fn-20-P2050_699548:19-nf] -they would not have believed the persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed murder upon themselves,[fn-20-P2051_699698:20-nf] by falling[fn-20-P2052_699740:21-nf] from immortality, by contravening God's precept; from theft also they would have abstained, if they had not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had been anxious to skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their God; nor would they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating devil, by believing him that they would be \"like God; \"and thus they would not have offended God either, as their Father, who had fashioned them from clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if they had not coveted another's, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit. Therefore, in this general and primordial law of God, the observance of which, in the case of the tree's fruit, He had sanctioned, we recognise enclosed all the precepts specially of the posterior Law, which germinated when disclosed at their proper times. For the subsequent superinduction of a law is the work of the same Being who had before premised a precept; since it is His province withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to form, righteous creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it? if He advances who begins? In short, before the Law of Moses,[fn-20-P2053_701005:22-nf] written in stone-tables, I contend that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood naturally, and by the fathers was habitually kept. For whence was Noah \"found righteous,\"[fn-20-P2054_701248:23-nf] if in his case the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was Abraham accounted \"a friend of God,\"[fn-20-P2055_701408:24-nf] if not on the ground of equity and righteousness, (in the observance) of a natural law? Whence was Melchizedek named \"priest of the most high God,\"[fn-20-P2056_701591:25-nf] if, before the priesthood of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer sacrifices to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from Egypt, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years. In fact, it was after Abraham's \"four hundred and thirty years\"[fn-20-P2057_702033:26-nf] that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses' Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as \"the law was given through Moses\"[fn-20-P2058_702739:27-nf] at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered \"friends of God.\" For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges?

And through this arises the question for us, what sabbath God willed us to keep? For the Scriptures point to a sabbath eternal and a sabbath temporal.

In short, so true is it that it is not in the exemption from work of the sabbath-that is, of the seventh day-that the celebration of this solemnity is to consist, that Joshua the son of Nun, at the time that he was reducing the city Jericho by war. stated that he had received from God a precept to order the People that priests should carry the ark of the testament of God seven days, making the circuit of the city; and thus, when the seventh day's circuit had been performed, the walls of the city would spontaneously fall.[fn-21-P2108_717201:69-nf] Which was so done; and when the space of the seventh day was finished, just as was predicted, down fell the walls of the city.

Whence the apostle withal judges, and that in a case of fornication,[fn-13-P1328_361909:41-nf] that \"such a man must be surrendered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh; \"[fn-13-P1329_362041:42-nf] chiding them likewise because \"brethren\" were not \"judged at the bar of the saints: \"[fn-13-P1330_362145:43-nf] for he goes on and says, \"To what (purpose is it) for me to judge those who are without? \"\"But you remit, in order that remission may be granted you by God.\" The sins which are (thus) cleansed are such as a man may have committed against his brother, not against God. We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

Only it must be by the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, and not merely by our freedom of will. He goes on to quote also this passage: \"This Job had so effectually read these Scriptures, that cause he worshipped God purely with a mind unmixed with offences: now such worship of God is the proper work of righteousness.\"[fn-22-P2292_948485:186-nf] It is what not what he had brought to perfection in this world,-much less what he had done or perfected without the grace of that Saviour whom he had actually foretold.[fn-22-P2293_948681:187-nf] For that man, indeed, abstains from every wicked work, who does not allow the sin which he has within him to have dominion over him; and who, whenever an unworthy thought stole over him, suffered it not to come to a head in actual deed. It is, however, one thing not to have sin, and another to refuse obedience to its desires. It is one thing to fulfil the command, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-22-P2294_949093:188-nf] and another thing, by an endeavour at any rateafter abstinence, to do that which is also written, \"Thou shalt not go after thy lusts.\"[fn-22-P2295_949247:189-nf] And yet one is quite aware that he can do nothing of all this without the Saviour's grace. It is to work righteousness, therefore, to fight in an internal struggle with the internal evil of concupiscence in the true worship of God; whilst to perfect it means to have no adversary at all. Now he who has to fight is still in danger, and is sometimes shaken, even if he is not overthrown; whereas he who has no enemy at all rejoices in perfect peace. He, moreover, is in the highest truth said to be without sin in whom no sin has an indwelling,-not he who, abstaining from evil deeds, uses such language as \"Now it is no longer I that do it, but the sin that dwelleth in me.\"[fn-22-P2296_949948:190-nf] ","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_13_book_viii_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"100","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"10 When therefore they were ordered to choose whether they would be released from molestation by touching the polluted sacrifice, and would receive from them the accursed freedom, or refusing to sacrifice, should be condemned to death, they did not hesitate, but went to death cheerfully.

But if it is impious to say this, we are driven to confess that every sin is an act, not a thing. If therefore it is an act, for this very reason, because it is an act, it can be avoided.\" Our reply is, that sin no doubt is called an act, and is such, not a thing. But likewise in the body, lameness for the same reason is an act, not a thing, since it is the foot itself, or the body, or the man who walks lame because of an injured foot, that is the thing; but still the man cannot avoid the lameness, unless his foot be cured. The same change may take place in the inward man, but it is by God's grace, through our Lord Jesus Christ. The defect itself which causes the lameness of the man is neither the foot, nor the body, nor the man, nor indeed the lameness itself; for there is of course no lameness when there is no walking, although there is nevertheless the defect which causes the lameness whenever there is an attempt to walk. Let him therefore ask, what name must be given to this defect,-would he have it called a thing, or an act, or rather a bad property[fn-24-P2421_989002:10-nf] in the thing, by which the deformed act comes into existence?

In two, if I mistake not: if either those things are done which are forbidden, or those things are not done which are commanded. Now, it is just as certain that all things which are forbidden are able to be avoided, as it is that all things which are commanded are able to be effected. For it is vain either to forbid or to enjoin that which cannot either be guarded against or accomplished. And how shall we deny the possibility of man's being without sin, when we are compelled to admit that he can as well avoid all those things which are forbidden, as do all those which are commanded?\" My answer is, that in the Holy Scriptures there are many divine precepts, to mention the whole of which would be too laborious; but the Lord, who on earth consummated and abridged[fn-24-P2457_997628:25-nf] His word, expressly declared that the law and the prophets hung on two commandments,[fn-24-P2458_997749:26-nf] that we might understand that whatever else has been enjoined on us by God ends in these two commandments, and must be referred to them: \"Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind;\"[fn-24-P2459_998008:27-nf] and \"Thou shall love thy neighbouras thyself.\"[fn-24-P2460_998076:28-nf] \"On these two commandments,\" says He, \"hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-24-P2461_998173:29-nf] Whatever, therefore, we are by God's law forbidden, and whatever we are bidden to do, we are forbidden and bidden with the direct object of fulfilling these two commandments. And perhaps the general prohibition is, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-24-P2462_998433:30-nf] and the general precept, \"Thou shall love.\"[fn-24-P2463_998494:31-nf] Accordingly the Apostle Paul, in a certain place, briefly embraced the two, expressing the prohibition in these words, \"Be not conformed to this world,\"[fn-24-P2464_998665:32-nf] and the command in these, \"But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.\"[fn-24-P2465_998763:33-nf] The former falls under the negative precept, not to covet; the latter under the positive one, to love. The one has reference to continence, the other to righteousness. The one enjoins avoidance of evil; the other, pursuit of good. By eschewing covetousness we put off the old man, and by showing love we put on the new. But no, man can be continent unless God endow him with the gift;[fn-24-P2466_999166:34-nf] nor is God's love shed abroad in our hearts by our own selves, but by the Holy Ghost that is given to us.[fn-24-P2467_999293:35-nf] This, however, takes place day after day in those who advance by willing, believing, and praying, and who, \"forgetting those things which are behind, reach forth unto those things which are before.\"[fn-24-P2468_999508:36-nf] For the reason why the law inculcates all these precepts is, that when a man has failed in fulfilling them, he may not be swollen with pride, and so exalt himself, but may in very weariness betake himself to grace. Thus the law fulfils its office as\" schoolmaster,\" so terrifying the man as \"to lead him to Christ,\" to give Him his love.[fn-24-P2469_999866:37-nf] ","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Furthermore, concerning these words of Job, \"My heart shall not reproach me in all my life,\"[fn-25-P2596_1031351:115-nf] we remark, that it is in this present life of ours, in which we live by faith, that our heart does not reproach us, if the same faith whereby we believe unto righteousness does not neglect to rebuke our sin. On this principle the apostle says: \"The good that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.\"[fn-25-P2597_1031693:116-nf] Now it is a good thing to avoid concupiscence, and this good the just man would, who lives by faith;[fn-25-P2598_1031815:117-nf] and still he does what he hates, because he has concupiscence, although \"he goes not after his lusts;\"[fn-25-P2599_1031937:118-nf] if he has done this, he has himself at that time really done it, so as to yield to, and acquiesce in, and obey the desire of sin. His heart then reproaches him, because it reproaches himself, and not his sin which dwelleth in him. But whensoever he suffers not sin to reign in his mortal body to obey it in the lusts thereof,[fn-26-P2600_1032289:119-nf] and yields not his members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,[fn-26-P2601_1032380:120-nf] sin no doubt is present in his members, but it does not reign, because its desires are not obeyed. Therefore, while he does that which he would not,- in other words, while he wishes not to lust, but still lusts,-he consents to the law that it is good:[fn-26-P2602_1032652:121-nf] for what the law would, that he also wishes; because it is his desire not to indulge concupiscence, and the law expressly says, \"Thou shalt not covet.\"[fn-26-P2603_1032825:122-nf] Now in that he wishes what the law also would have done, he no doubt consents to the law: but still he lusts, because he is not without sin; it is, however, no longer himself that does the thing, but the sin which dwells within him. Hence it is that \"his heart does not reproach him in all his life;\" that is, in his faith, because the just man lives by faith, so that his faith is his very life. He knows, to be sure, that in himself dwells nothing good,- even in his flesh, which is the dwelling-place of sin. By not consenting, however, to it, he lives by faith, wherewith he also calls upon God to help him in his contest against sin. Moreover, there is present to him to will that no sin at all should be in him, but then how to perfect this good is not present. It is not the mere \"doing\" of a good thing that is not present to him, but the \"perfecting\" of it. For in this, that he yields no consent, he does good; he does good again, in this, that he hates his own lust; he does good also, in this, that he does not cease to give alms; and in this, that he forgives the man who sins against him, he does good; and in this, that he asks forgiveness for his own trespasses,-sincerely avowing in his petition that he also forgives those who trespass against himself, and praying that he may not be led into temptation, but be delivered from evil,-he does good. But how to perfect the good is not present to him; it will be, however, in that final state, when the concupiscence which dwells in his members shall exist no more. His heart, therefore, does not reproach him, when it reproaches the sin which dwells in his members; nor can it reproach unbelief in him. Thus \"in all his life,\"-that is, in his faith,-he is neither reproached by his own heart, nor convinced of not being withoutsin. And Job himself acknowledges this concerning himself, when he says, \"Not one of mysins hath escaped Thee; Thou hast sealed upmy transgressions in a bag, and marked if I havedone iniquity unawares.\"[fn-26-P2604_1034840:123-nf] With regard, then, to the passages which he has adduced from the book of holy Job, we have shown to the best of our ability in what sense they ought to be taken. He, however, has failed to explain the meaning of the words which he has himself quoted from the same Job: \"Who then is pure from uncleanness? Not one; even if he be an infant of only one day upon the earth.\"[fn-26-P2605_1035235:124-nf] ","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_15_letter_i_a_letter_of_the_holy_presbyter_severus_to_his_sister_claudia_concerning_the_last_judgment_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Against these, from among the company of the saints, righteous Noah shall first proclaim, \"I, Lord, predicted that a deluge was about to. come on account of the sins of men, and afterthe deluge I set an example to the good in my own person; since I did not perish with the wicked who perished, that they might know both what was the salvation of the innocent, and what the punishment of sinners.\" After him, faithful Abraham will say in opposition to them, \"I, Lord, about the mid-time[fn-7-P702_284761:8-nf] of the age of the world, laid the foundation of the faith by which the human race should believe in thee; I was chosen as the father of the nations, that they might follow my example; I did not hesitate, Lord, to offer Isaac, while yet a youth, as a sacrifice to thee, that they might understand that there is nothing which ought not to be presented to the Lord, when they perceived that I did not spare even my only son: I left, Lord, my country, and my family, at thy command, that they also might have an example teaching them to leave the wickedness of the world and the age: I, Lord, was the first to recognize thee, though under a corporeal[fn-7-P703_285443:9-nf] form, nor did I hesitate to believe who it was that I beheld, although thou didst appear to me in a different form from thine own, that these might learn to judge, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.\" Him the blessed Moses will support in his pleadings, saying: \"I Lord, delivered the law to all these, at thy command, that those whom a free[fn-7-P704_285869:10-nf] faith did not influence, the spoken law at least might restrain: I said, 'Thou shalt not[fn-7-P705_285975:11-nf] commit adultery,' in order that I might prevent the licentiousness of fornication: I said, `Thou shalt love[fn-7-P706_286102:12-nf] thy neighbor,' that affection might abound; I said, `Thou shalt worship the Lord alone,'[fn-7-P707_286210:13-nf] in order that these might not sacrifice to idols, or allow temples to exist; I commanded that false witness should not be spoken, that I might shut the lips of these people against all falsehood.

Because \"many will come in My Name, saying, Behold, in Thy Name we have cast out devils; and I will say to them, I know you not. In this rejoice not, but rejoice because your Dances are written in heaven.\"[fn-68-P6845_2875512:32-nf] Ye cannot yet be there, yet notwithstanding ye are already written there.

Now, such a scheme as this must no doubt involve the proscription of marriage. Let us see, then, whether it be a just one: not as if we aimed at destroying the happiness of sanctity, as do certain Nicolaitans in their maintenance of lust and luxury, but as those who have come to the knowledge of sanctity, and pursue it and prefer it, without detriment, however, to marriage; not as if we superseded a bad thing by a good, but only a good thing by a better. For we do not reject marriage, but simply refrain from it.[fn-42-P4251_1385897:356-nf] Nor do we prescribe sanctity[fn-42-P4252_1385970:357-nf] as the rule, but only recommend it, observing it as a good, yea, even the better state, if each man uses it carefully[fn-42-P4253_1386127:358-nf] according to his ability; but at the same time earnestly vindicating marriage, whenever hostile attacks are made against it is a polluted thing, to the disparagement of the Creator. For He bestowed His blessing on matrimony also, as on an honourable estate, for the increase of the human race; as He did indeed on the whole of His creation,[fn-42-P4254_1386621:359-nf] for wholesome and good uses. Meats and drinks are not on this account to be condemned, because, when served up with too exquisite a daintiness, they conduce to gluttony; nor is raiment to be blamed, because, when too costlily adorned, it becomes inflated with vanity and pride. So, on the same principle, the estate of matrimony is not to be refused, because, when enjoyed without moderation, it is fanned into a voluptuous flame. There is a great difference between a cause and a fault,[fn-42-P4255_1387139:360-nf] between a state and its excess. Consequently it is not an institution of this nature that is to be blamed, but the extravagant use of it; according to the judgment of its founder Himself, who not only said, \"Be fruitful, and multiply,\"[fn-42-P4256_1387547:361-nf] but also, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" and, \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife; \"[fn-42-P4257_1387661:362-nf] and who threatened with death the unchaste, sacrilegious, and monstrous abomination both of adultery and unnatural sin with man and beast.[fn-42-P4258_1387822:363-nf] Now, if any limitation is set to marrying-such as the spiritual rule,[fn-42-P4259_1387918:364-nf] which prescribes but one marriage under the Christian obedience,[fn-42-P4260_1387997:365-nf] maintained by the authority of the Paraclete,[fn-42-P4261_1388160:366-nf] -it will be His prerogative to fix the limit Who had once been diffuse in His permission; His to gather, Who once scattered; His to cut down the tree, Who planted it; His to reap the harvest, Who sowed the seed; His to declare, \"It remaineth that they who have wives be as though they had none,\"[fn-42-P4262_1388545:367-nf] Who once said, \"Be fruitful, and multiply; \"His the end to Whom belonged the beginning. Nevertheless, the tree is not cut down as if it deserved blame; nor is the corn reaped, as if it were to be condemned,-but simply because their time is come. So likewise the state of matrimony does not require the hook and scythe of sanctity, as if it were evil; but as being ripe for its discharge, and in readiness for that sanctity which will in the long run bring it a plenteous crop by its reaping. For this leads me to remark of Marcion's god, that in reproaching marriage as an evil and unchaste thing, he is really prejudicing the cause of that very sanctity which he seems to serve. For he destroys the material on which it subsists; if there is to be no marriage, there is no sanctity. All proof of abstinence is lost when excess is impossible; for sundry things have thus their evidence in their contraries. Just as \"strength is made perfect in weakness,\"[fn-42-P4263_1389523:368-nf] so likewise is continence made manifest by the permission to marry. Who indeed will be called continent, if that be taken away which gives him the opportunity of pursuing a life of continence? What room for temperance in appetite does famine give? What repudiation of ambitious projects does poverty afford? What bridling of lust can the eunuch merit? To put a complete stop, however, to the sowing of the human race, may, for aught I know, be quite consistent for Marcion's most good and excellent god. For how could he desire the salvation of man, whom he forbids to be born, when he takes away that institution from which his birth arises? How will he find any one on whom to set the mark of his goodness, when he suffers him not to come into existence? How is it possible to love him whose origin he hates? Perhaps he is afraid of a redundant population, lest he should be weary in liberating so many; lest he should have to make many heretics; lest Marcionite parents should produce too many noble disciples of Marcion. The cruelty of Pharaoh, which slew its victims at their birth, will not prove to be more inhuman in comparison.[fn-42-P4264_1390682:369-nf] For while he destroyed lives, our heretic's god refuses to give them: the one removes from life, the other admits none to it. There is no difference in either as to their homicide-man is slain by both of them; by the former just after birth, by the latter as yet unborn. Thanks should we owe thee, thou god of our heretic, hadst thou only checked[fn-42-P4265_1391094:370-nf] the dispensation of the Creator in uniting male and female; for from such a union indeed has thy Marcion been born! Enough; however, of Marcion's god, who is shown to have absolutely no existence at all, both by our definitions[fn-42-P4266_1391460:371-nf] of the one only Godhead, and the condition of his attributes.[fn-42-P4267_1391712:372-nf] The whole course, however, of this little work aims directly at this conclusion. If, therefore, we seem to anybody to have achieved but little result as yet, let him reserve his expectations, until we examine the very Scripture which Marcion quotes.

You do not, however, consider the law of the Sabbath: they are human works, not divine, which it prohibits.[fn-46-P4603_1478583:268-nf] For it says, \"Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work.\" What work? Of course your own. The conclusion is, that from the Sabbath-day He removes those works which He had before enjoined for the six days, that is, your own works; in other words, human works of daily life. Now, the carrying around of the ark is evidently not an ordinary daily duty, nor yet a human one; but a rare and a sacred work, and, as being then ordered by the direct precept of God, a divine one.

Nor could there be any discussion about His annulling[fn-56-P5643_1725409:373-nf] the Sabbath, if He had a right[fn-56-P5644_1725463:374-nf] to annul it. Moreover, He would have the right, if He belonged to the rival god; nor would it cause surprise to any one that He did what it was right for Him to do. Men's astonishment therefore arose from their opinion that it was improper for Him to proclaim the Creator to be God and yet to impugn His Sabbath. Now, that we may decide these several points first, lest we should be renewing them at every turn to meet each argument of our adversary which rests on some novel institution[fn-56-P5645_1725967:375-nf] of Christ, let this stand as a settled point, that discussion concerning the novel character of each institution ensued on this account, because as nothing was as yet advanced by Christ touching any new deity, so discussion thereon was inadmissible; nor could it be retorted, that from the very novelty of each several institution another deity was clearly enough demonstrated by Christ, inasmuch as it was plain that novelty was not in itself a characteristic to be wondered at in Christ, because it had been foretold by the Creator. And it would have been, of course, but right that a new[fn-56-P5646_1726602:376-nf] god should first be expounded, and his discipline be introduced afterwards; because it Would be the god that would impart authority to the discipline, and not the discipline to the god; except that (to be sure) it has happened that Marcion acquired his very perverse opinions not from a master, but his master from his opinion! All other points respecting the Sabbath I thus rule. If Christ interfered with[fn-56-P5647_1727023:377-nf] the Sabbath, He simply acted after the Creator's example; inasmuch as in the siege of the city of Jericho the carrying around the walls of the ark of the covenant for eight days running, and therefore on a Sabbath-day, actually[fn-56-P5648_1727271:378-nf] annulled the Sabbath, by the Creator's command-according to the opinion of those who think this of Christ in this passage of St. Luke, in their ignorance that neither Christ nor the Creator violated the Sabbath, as we shall by and by show. And yet the Sabbath was actually then broken[fn-56-P5649_1727575:379-nf] by Joshua,[fn-56-P5650_1727617:380-nf] so that the present charge might be alleged also against Christ. But even if, as being not the Christ of the Jews, He displayed a hatred against the Jews' most solemn day, He was only professedly following[fn-56-P5651_1727841:381-nf] the Creator, as being His Christ, in this very hatred of the Sabbath; for He exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Your new moons and your Sabbaths my soul hateth.\"[fn-56-P5652_1728031:382-nf] Now, in whatever sense these words were spoken, we know that an abrupt defence must, in a subject of this sort, be used in answer to an abrupt challenge. I shall now transfer the discussion to the very matter in which the teaching of Christ seemed to annul the Sabbath. The disciples had been hungry; on that the Sabbath day they had plucked some ears and rubbed them in their hands; by thus preparing their food, they had violated the holy day. Christ excuses them, and became their accomplice in breaking the Sabbath. The Pharisees bring the charge against Him. Marcion sophistically interprets the stages of the controversy (if I may call in the aid of the truth of my Lord to ridicule his arts), both in the scriptural record and in Christ's purpose.[fn-56-P5653_1728805:383-nf] For from the Creator's Scripture, and from the purpose of Christ, there is derived a colourable precedent[fn-56-P5654_1729263:384-nf] -as from the example of David, when he went into the temple on the Sabbath, and provided food by boldly breaking up the shew-bread.[fn-56-P5655_1729417:385-nf] Even he remembered that this privilege (I mean the dispensation from fasting) was allowed to the Sabbath from the very beginning, when the Sabbath-day itself was instituted. For although the Creator had forbidden that the manna should be gathered for two days, He yet permitted it on the one occasion only of the day before the Sabbath, in order that the yesterday's provision of food might free from fasting the feast of the following Sabbath-day. Good reason, therefore, had the Lord for pursuing the same principle in the annulling of the Sabbath (since that is the word which men will use); good reason, too, for expressing the Creator's will,[fn-56-P5656_1730104:386-nf] when He bestowed the privilege of not fasting on the Sabbath-day. In short, He would have then and there[fn-56-P5657_1730226:387-nf] put an end to the Sabbath, nay, to the Creator Himself, if He had commanded His disciples to fast on the Sabbath-day, contrary to the intention[fn-56-P5658_1730389:388-nf] of the Scripture and of the Creator's will. But because He did not directly defend[fn-56-P5659_1730487:389-nf] His disciples, but excuses them; because He interposes human want, as if deprecating censure; because He maintains the honour of the Sabbath as a day which is to be free from gloom rather than from work;[fn-56-P5660_1730723:390-nf] because he puts David and his companions on a level with His own disciples in their fault and their extenuation; because He is pleased to endorse[fn-56-P5661_1730908:391-nf] the Creator's indulgence:[fn-56-P5662_1731004:392-nf] because He is Himself good according to His example-is He therefore alien from the Creator? Then the Pharisees watch whether He would heal on the Sabbath-day,[fn-56-P5663_1731205:393-nf] that they might accuse Him-surely as a violator of the Sabbath, not as the propounder of a new god; for perhaps I might be content with insisting on all occasions on this one point, that another Christ[fn-56-P5664_1731426:394-nf] is nowhere proclaimed. The Pharisees, however, were in utter error concerning the law of the Sabbath, not observing that its terms were conditional, when it enjoined rest from labour, making certain distinctions of labour. For when it says of the Sabbath-day, \"In it thou shalt not do any work of thine,\"[fn-56-P5665_1731774:395-nf] by the word thine[fn-56-P5666_1731811:396-nf] it restricts the prohibition to human work-which every one performs in his own employment or business-and not to divine work. Now the work of healing or preserving is not proper to man, but to God. So again, in the law it says, \"Thou shalt not do any manner of work in it,\"[fn-56-P5667_1732452:397-nf] except what is to be done for any soul,[fn-56-P5668_1732512:398-nf] that is to say, in the matter of delivering the soul;[fn-56-P5669_1732887:399-nf] because what is God's work may be done by human agency for the salvation of the soul. By God, however, would that be done which the man Christ was to do, for He was likewise God.[fn-56-P5670_1733113:400-nf] Wishing, therefore, to initiate them into this meaning of the law by the restoration of the withered hand, He requires, \"Is it lawful on the Sabbath-days to do good, or not? to save life, or to destroy it? \"[fn-56-P5671_1733368:401-nf] In order that He might, whilst allowing that amount of work which He was about to perform for a soul,[fn-56-P5672_1733489:402-nf] remind them what works the law of the Sabbath forbade-even human works; and what it enjoined-even divine works, which might be done for the benefit of any soul,[fn-56-P5673_1733684:403-nf] He was called \"Lord of the Sabbath,\"[fn-56-P5674_1733755:404-nf] because He maintained[fn-56-P5675_1733796:405-nf] the Sabbath as His own institution. Now, even if He had annulled the Sabbath, He would have had the right to do so,[fn-56-P5676_1733929:406-nf] as being its Lord, (and) still more as He who instituted it. But He did not utterly destroy it, although its Lord, in order that it might henceforth be plain that the Sabbath was not broken[fn-56-P5677_1734134:407-nf] by the Creator, even at the time when the ark was carried around Jericho. For that was really[fn-56-P5678_1734330:408-nf] God's work, which He commanded Himself, and which He had ordered for the sake of the lives of His servants when exposed to the perils of war. Now, although He has in a certain place expressed an aversion of Sabbaths, by calling them your Sabbaths,[fn-56-P5679_1734589:409-nf] reckoning them as men's Sabbaths, not His own, because they were celebrated without the fear of God by a people full of iniquities, and loving God \"with the lip, not the heart,\"[fn-56-P5680_1734790:410-nf] He has yet put His own Sabbaths (those, that is, which were kept according to His prescription) in a different position; for by the same prophet, in a later passage,[fn-56-P5681_1734978:411-nf] He declared them to be \"true, and delightful, and inviolable.\" Thus Christ did not at all rescind the Sabbath: He kept the law thereof, and both in the former case did a work which was beneficial to the life of His disciples, for He indulged them with the relief of food when they were hungry, and in the present instance cured the withered hand; in each case intimating by facts, \"I came not to destroy, the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-56-P5682_1735446:412-nf] although Marcion has gagged[fn-56-P5683_1735494:413-nf] His mouth by this word.[fn-56-P5684_1735536:414-nf] For even in the case before us He fulfilled the law, while interpreting its condition; moreover, He exhibits in a dear light the different kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts from the sacredness of the Sabbath[fn-56-P5685_1735925:415-nf] and while imparting to the Sabbath-day itself, which from the beginning had been consecrated by the benediction of the Father, an additional sanctity by His own beneficent action. For He furnished to this day divine safeguards,[fn-56-P5686_1736213:416-nf] -a course which[fn-56-P5687_1736247:417-nf] His adversary would have pursued for some other days, to avoid honouring the Creator's Sabbath, and restoring to the Sabbath the works which were proper for it. Since, in like manner, the prophet Elisha on this day restored to life the dead son of the Shunammite woman,[fn-56-P5688_1736576:418-nf] you see, O Pharisee, and you too, O Marcion, how that it was proper employment for the Creator's Sabbaths of old[fn-56-P5689_1736716:419-nf] to do good, to save life, not to destroy it; how that Christ introduced nothing new, which was not after the example,[fn-56-P5690_1736847:420-nf] the gentleness, the mercy, and the prediction also of the Creator. For in this very example He fulfils[fn-56-P5691_1736964:421-nf] the prophetic announcement of a specific healing: \"The weak hands are strengthened,\" as were also \"the feeble knees\"[fn-56-P5692_1737102:422-nf] in the sick of the palsy.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":20,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"100","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Who shall be invoked as the Lord of heaven, that does not first show Himself[fn-62-P6294_1870611:983-nf] to have been the maker thereof? For He says, \"I thank thee, (O Father, )and own Thee, Lord of heaven, because those things which had been hidden from the wise and prudent, Thou has revealed unto babes.\"[fn-62-P6295_1870833:984-nf] What things are these? And whose? And by whom hidden? And by whom revealed? If it was by Marcion's god that they were hidden and revealed, it was an extremely iniquitous proceeding;[fn-62-P6296_1871034:985-nf] for nothing at all had he ever produced[fn-62-P6297_1871095:986-nf] in which anything could have been hidden-no prophecies, no parables, no visions, no evidences[fn-62-P6298_1871209:987-nf] of things, or words, or names, obscured by allegories and figures, or cloudy enigmas, but he had concealed the greatness even of himself, which he was with all his might revealing by his Christ. Now in what respect had the wise and prudent done wrong,[fn-62-P6299_1871479:988-nf] that God should be hidden from them, when their wisdom and prudence had been insufficient to come to the knowledge of Him? No way had been provided by himself,[fn-63-P6300_1871659:989-nf] by any declaration of his works, or any vestiges whereby they might become[fn-63-P6301_1871771:990-nf] wise and prudent. However, if they had even failed in any duty towards a god whom they knew not, suppose him now at last to be known still they ought not to have found a jealous god in him who is introduced as unlike the Creator. Therefore, since he had neither provided any materials in which he could have hidden anything, nor had any offenders from whom he could have hidden himself: since, again, even if he had had any, he ought not to have hidden himself from them, he will not now be himself the revealer, who was not previously the concealer; so neither will any be the Lord of heaven nor the Father of Christ but He in whom all these attributes consistently meet.[fn-63-P6302_1872465:991-nf] For He conceals by His preparatory apparatus of prophetic obscurity, the understanding of which is open to faith (for \"if ye will not believe, ye shall not understand\"[fn-63-P6303_1872665:992-nf] ); and He had offenders in those wise and prudent ones who would not seek after God, although He was to be discovered in His so many and mighty works,[fn-63-P6304_1872836:993-nf] or who rashly philosophized about Him, and thereby furnished to heretics their arts;[fn-63-P6305_1872943:994-nf] and lastly, He is a jealous God. Accordingly,[fn-63-P6306_1873005:995-nf] that which Christ thanks God for doing, He long ago[fn-63-P6307_1873073:996-nf] announced by Isaiah: \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the prudent will I hide.\"[fn-63-P6308_1873198:997-nf] So in another passage He intimates both that He has concealed, and that He will also reveal: \"I will give unto them treasures that have been hidden, and secret ones will I discover to them.\"[fn-63-P6309_1873417:998-nf] And again: \"Who else shall scatter the tokens of ventriloquists,[fn-63-P6310_1873508:999-nf] and the devices of those who divine out of their own heart; turning wise men backward, and making their counsels foolish? \"[fn-63-P6311_1873679:1000-nf] Now, if He has designated His Christ as an enlightener of the Gentiles, saying, \"I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles; \"[fn-63-P6312_1873837:1001-nf] and if we understand these to be meant in the word babes[fn-63-P6313_1873929:1002-nf] -as having been once dwarfs in knowledge and infants in prudence, and even now also babes in their lowliness of faith-we shall of course more easily understand how He who had once hidden \"these things,\" and promised a revelation of them through Christ, was the same God as He who had now revealed them unto babes. Else, if it was Marcion's god who revealed the things which had been formerly hidden by the Creator, it follows[fn-63-P6314_1874376:1003-nf] that he did the Creator's work by setting forth His deeds.[fn-63-P6315_1874450:1004-nf] But he did it, say you, for His destruction, that he might refute them.[fn-63-P6316_1874552:1005-nf] Therefore he ought to have refuted them to those from whom the Creator had hidden them, even the wise and prudent. For if he had a kind intention in what he did, the gift of knowledge was due to those from whom the Creator had detained it, instead of the babes, to whom the Creator had grudged no gift. But after all, it is, I presume, the edification[fn-63-P6317_1874934:1006-nf] rather than the demolition[fn-63-P6318_1874986:1007-nf] of the law and the prophets which we have thus far found effected in Christ. \"All things,\" He says, \"are delivered unto me of my Father.\"[fn-63-P6319_1875148:1008-nf] You may believe Him, if He is the Christ of the Creator to whom all things belong; because the Creator has not delivered to a Son who is less than Himself all things, which He created by[fn-63-P6320_1875356:1009-nf] Him, that is to say, by His Word. If, on the contrary, he is the notorious stranger,[fn-63-P6321_1875455:1010-nf] what are the\" all things\" which have been delivered to him by the Father? Are they the Creator's? Then the things which the Father delivered to the Son are good. and the Creator is therefore good, since all His \"things\" are good; whereas he[fn-63-P6322_1875766:1011-nf] is no longer good who has invaded another's good (domains) to deliver it to his son, thus teaching robbery[fn-63-P6323_1875897:1012-nf] of another's goods. Surely he must be a most mendacious being, who had no other means of enriching his son than by helping himself to another's property! Or else,[fn-63-P6324_1876087:1013-nf] if nothing of the Creator's has been delivered to him by the Father, by what right[fn-63-P6325_1876187:1014-nf] does he claim for himself (authority over) man? Or again, if man has been delivered to him, and man alone, then man is not \"all things.\" But Scripture clearly says that a transfer of all things has been made to the Son. If, however, you should interpret this \"all\" of the whole human race, that is, all nations, then the delivery of even these to the Son is within the purpose of the Creator:[fn-63-P6326_1876600:1015-nf] \"I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession.\"[fn-63-P6327_1876735:1016-nf] If, indeed, he has some things of his own, the whole of which he might give to his son, along with the man of the Creator, then show some one thing of them all, as a sample, that I may believe; lest I should have as much reason not to believe that all things belong to him, of whom I see nothing, as I have ground for believing that even the things which I see not are His, to whom belongs the universe, which I see. But \"no man knoweth who the Father is, but the Son; and who the Son is, but the Father, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.\"[fn-63-P6328_1877301:1017-nf] And so it was an unknown god that Christ preached! And other heretics, too, prop themselves up by this passage; alleging in opposition to it that the Creator was known to all, both to lsrÂµl by familiar intercourse, and to the Gentiles by nature. Well, how is it He Himself testifies that He was not known to lsrÂµl? \"But Israel doth not know me, and my people doth not consider me; \"[fn-63-P6329_1877705:1018-nf] nor to the Gentiles: \"For, behold,\" says He, \"of the nations I have no man.\"[fn-63-P6330_1877802:1019-nf] Therefore He reckoned them \"as the drop of a bucket,\"[fn-63-P6331_1877993:1020-nf] while \"Sion He left as a look-out[fn-63-P6332_1878079:1021-nf] in a vineyard.\"[fn-63-P6333_1878114:1022-nf] See, then, whether there be not here a confirmation of the prophet's word, when he rebukes that ignorance of man toward God which continued to the days of the Son of man. For it was on this account that he inserted the clause that the Father is known by him to whom the Son has revealed Him, because it was even He who was announced as set by the Father to be a light to the Gentiles, who of course required to be enlightened concerning God, as well as to Israel, even by imparting to it a fuller knowledge of God. Arguments, therefore, will be of no use for belief in the rival god which may be suitable[fn-63-P6334_1878770:1023-nf] for the Creator, because it is only such as are unfit for the Creator which will be able to advance belief in His rival. If you look also into the next words, \"Blessed are the eyes which see the things which ye see, for I tell you that prophets have not seen the things which ye see,\"[fn-63-P6335_1879087:1024-nf] you will find that they follow from the sense above, that no man indeed had come to the knowledge of God as he ought to have done,[fn-63-P6336_1879242:1025-nf] since even the prophets had not seen the things which were being seen under Christ. Now if He had not been my Christ, He would not have made any mention of the prophets in this passage. For what was there to wonder at, if they had not seen the things of a god who had been unknown to them, and was only revealed a long time after them? What blessedness, however, could theirs have been, who were then seeing what others were naturally[fn-63-P6337_1879697:1026-nf] unable to see, since it was of things which they had never predicted that they had not obtained the sight;[fn-63-P6338_1879821:1027-nf] if it were not because they might justly[fn-63-P6339_1879890:1028-nf] have seen the things pertaining to their God, which they had even predicted, but which they at the same time[fn-63-P6340_1880015:1029-nf] had not seen? This, however, will be the blessedness of others, even of such as were seeing the things which others had only foretold. We shall by and by show, nay, we have already shown, that in Christ those things were seen which had been foretold, but yet had been hidden from the very prophets who foretold them, in order that they might be hidden also from the wise and the prudent. In the true Gospel, a certain doctor of the law comes to the Lord and asks, \"What shall I do to inherit eternal life? \"In the heretical gospel life only is mentioned, without the attribute eternal; so that the lawyer seems to have consulted Christ simply about the life which the Creator in the law promises to prolong,[fn-63-P6341_1880740:1030-nf] and the Lord to have therefore answered him according to the law, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,\"[fn-63-P6342_1880948:1031-nf] since the question was concerning the conditions of mere life. But the lawyer of course knew very well in what way the life which the law meant[fn-63-P6343_1881113:1032-nf] was to be obtained, so that his question could have had no relation to the life whose rules he was himself in the habit of teaching. But seeing that even the dead were now raised by Christ, and being himself excited to the hope of an eternal life by these examples of a restored[fn-63-P6344_1881410:1033-nf] one, he would lose no more time in merely looking on (at the wonderful things which had made him) so high in hope.[fn-63-P6345_1881544:1034-nf] He therefore consulted him about the attainment of eternal life. Accordingly, the Lord, being Himself the same,[fn-63-P6346_1881751:1035-nf] and introducing no new precept other than that which relates above all others[fn-63-P6347_1881849:1036-nf] to (man's) entire salvation, even including the present and the future life,[fn-63-P6348_1881950:1037-nf] places before him[fn-63-P6349_1881996:1038-nf] the very essence[fn-63-P6350_1882034:1039-nf] of the law-that he should in every possible way love the Lord his God. If, indeed, it were only about a lengthened life, such as is at the Creator's disposal, that he inquired and Christ answered, and not about the eternal life, which is at the disposal of Marcion's god, how is he to obtain the eternal one? Surely not in the same manner as the prolonged life. For in proportion to the difference of the reward must be supposed to be also the diversity of the services. Therefore your disciple, Marcion,[fn-63-P6351_1882555:1040-nf] will not obtain his eternal life in consequence of loving your God, in the same way as the man who loves the Creator will secure the lengthened life. But how happens it that, if He is to be loved who promises the prolonged I life, He is not much more to be loved who offers the eternal life? Therefore both one and the other life will be at the disposal of one and the same Lord; because one and the same discipline is to be followed[fn-63-P6352_1883019:1041-nf] for one and the other life. What the Creator teaches to be loved, that must He necessarily maintain[fn-63-P6353_1883138:1042-nf] also by Christ,[fn-63-P6354_1883173:1043-nf] for that rule holds good here, which prescribes that greater things ought to be believed of Him who has first lesser proofs to show, than of him for whom no preceding smaller presumptions have secured a claim to be believed in things of higher import.

The Manicheans, indeed, meant to assert this, and they endeavoured to steep in all sorts of evil the very nature of God itself, and not His creature, made out of nothing. For evil arose in nothing else than what was good-not, however, the supreme and unchangeable good which is God's nature, but that which was made out of nothing by the wisdom of God. This, then, is the reason why man is claimed for a divine work; for he would not be man unless he were made by the operation of God. But evil would not exist in infants, if evil had not been committed by the wilfulness of the first man, and original sin derived from a nature thus corrupted. It is not true, then, as he puts it, \"He is completely a Manichean who maintains original sin;\" but rather,he is completely a Pelagian who does not believe in original sin. For it is not simply from the time when the pestilent opinions of Manichaeus began to grow that in the Church of God infants about to be baptized were for the first time exorcised with exsufflation,-which ceremonial was intended to show that they were not removed into the kingdom of Christ without first being delivered from the power of darkness;[fn-43-P4349_1652384:110-nf] nor is it in the books of Manichaeus that we read how \"the Son of man come to seek and to save that which was lost,\"[fn-43-P4350_1652520:111-nf] or how \"by one man sin entered into the world,\"[fn-43-P4351_1652589:112-nf] with those other similar passages which we have quoted above; or how God \"visits the sins of the fathers upon the children;\"[fn-43-P4352_1652733:113-nf] or how it is written in the Psalm, \"I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me;\"[fn-43-P4353_1652852:114-nf] or again, how \"man was made like unto vanity: his days pass away like a shadow;\"[fn-43-P4354_1652951:115-nf] or again, \"behold, Thou hast made my days old, and my existence as nothing before Thee; nay, every man living is altogether vanity;\"[fn-43-P4355_1653105:116-nf] or how the apostle says, \"every creature was made subject to vanity;\"[fn-43-P4356_1653196:117-nf] or how it is written in the book of Ecclesiastes, \"vanity of vanities; all is vanity: what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?\"[fn-43-P4357_1653377:118-nf] and in the book of Ecclesiasticus, \"a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam from the day that they go out of their mother's womb to the day that they return to the mother of all things;\"[fn-43-P4358_1653585:119-nf] or how again the apostle writes, \"in Adam all die;\"[fn-43-P4359_1653659:120-nf] or how holy Job says, when speaking about his own sins, \"for man that is born of a woman is short-lived and full of wrath: as the flower of grass, so does he fall; and he departs like a shadow, nor shall he stay.

Not even one, even if his life should be but of one day upon the earth.\"[fn-43-P4360_1654101:121-nf] Now when he speaks of uncleanness here, the mere perusal of the passage is enough to show that he meant sin to be under-stood. It is plain from the words, of what he is speaking. The same phrase and sense occur in the prophet Zechariah, in the place where \"the filthy garments\" are removed from off the high priest, and it is said to him, \"I have taken away thy sins.\"[fn-43-P4361_1654491:122-nf] Well now, I rather think that all these passages, and others of like import, which point to the fact that man is born in sin and under the curse, are not to be read among the dark recesses of the Manicheans, but in the sunshine of catholic truth.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"166","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"120.

I regret still to have to contend about the law-after I have so often proved that its replacement (by the gospel)[fn-77-P7778_2219605:595-nf] affords no argument for another god, predicted as it was indeed in Christ, and in the Creator's own plans[fn-77-P7779_2219732:596-nf] ordained for His Christ. (But I must revert to that discussion) so far as (the apostle leads me, for) this very epistle looks very much as if it abrogated[fn-77-P7780_2219910:597-nf] the law. We have, however, often shown before now that God is declared by the apostle to be a Judge; and that in the Judge is implied an Avenger; area in the Avenger, the Creator. And so in the passage where he says: \"I am not ashamed of the gospel (of Christ): for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that beheveth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek; for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith,\"[fn-77-P7781_2220372:598-nf] he undoubtedly ascribes both the gospel and salvation to Him whom (in accordance with our heretic's own distinction) I have called the just God, not the good one. It is He who removes (men) from confidence in the law to faith in the gospel-that is to say,[fn-77-P7782_2220651:599-nf] His own law and His own gospel. When, again, he declares that \"the wrath (of God) is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,\"[fn-77-P7783_2220864:600-nf] (I ask) the wrath of what God? Of the Creator certainly. The truth, therefore, will be His, whose is also the wrath, which has to be revealed to avenge the truth. Likewise, when adding, \"We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth,\"[fn-77-P7784_2221131:601-nf] he both vindicated that wrath from which comes this judgment for the truth, and at the same time afforded another proof that the truth emanates from the same God whose wrath he attested, by witnessing to His judgment. Marcion's averment is quite a different matter, that[fn-77-P7785_2221421:602-nf] the Creator in anger avenges Himself on the truth of the rival god which had been detained in unrighteousness. But what serious gaps Marcion has made in this epistle especially, by withdrawing whole passages at his will, will be clear from the unmutilated text of our own copy.[fn-77-P7786_2221720:603-nf] It is enough for my purpose to accept in evidence of its truth what he has seen fit to leave unerased, strange instances as they are also of his negligence and blindness. If, then, God will judge the secrets of men-both of those who have sinned in the law, and of those who have sinned without law (inasmuch as they who know not the law yet do by nature the things contained in the law)[fn-77-P7787_2222134:604-nf] -surely the God who shall judge is He to whom belong both the law, and that nature which is the rule[fn-77-P7788_2222258:605-nf] to them who know not the law. But how will He conduct this judgment? \"According to my gospel,\" says (the apostle), \"by (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7789_2222457:606-nf] So that both the gospel and Christ must be His, to whom appertain the law and the nature which are to be vindicated by the gospel and Christ-even at that judgment of God which, as he previously said, was to be according to truth.[fn-77-P7790_2222707:607-nf] The wrath, therefore, which is to vindicate truth, can only be revealed from heaven by the God of wrath;[fn-77-P7791_2222831:608-nf] so that this sentence, which is quite in accordance with that previous one wherein the judgment is declared to be the Creator's,[fn-77-P7792_2222979:609-nf] cannot possibly be ascribed to another god who is not a judge, and is incapable of wrath. It is only consistent in Him amongst whose attributes are found the judgment and the wrath of which I am speaking, and to whom of necessity must also appertain the media whereby these attributes are to be carried into effect. even the gospel and Christ. Hence his invective against the transgressors of the law, who teach that men should not steal, and yet practise theft themselves.[fn-77-P7793_2223503:610-nf] (This invective he utters) in perfect homage[fn-77-P7794_2223568:611-nf] to the law of God, not as if he meant to ten sure the Creator Himself with having commanded[fn-77-P7795_2223676:612-nf] a fraud to be practised against the Egyptians to get their gold and silver at the very time when He was forbidding men to steal,[fn-77-P7796_2223825:613-nf] -adopting such methods as they are apt (shamelessly) to charge upon Him in other particulars also. Are we then to suppose[fn-77-P7797_2224006:614-nf] that the apostle abstained through fear from openly calumniating God, from whom notwithstanding He did not hesitate to withdraw men? Well, but he had gone so far in his censure of the Jews, as to point against them the denunciation of the prophet, \"Through you the name of God is blasphemed (among the Gentiles).\"[fn-77-P7798_2224347:615-nf] But how absurd, that he should himself blaspheme Him for blaspheming whom he upbraids them as evil-doers! He prefers even circumcision of heart to neglect of it in the flesh. Now it is quite within the purpose of the God of the law that circumcision should be that of the heart, not in the flesh; in the spirit, and not in the letter.[fn-77-P7799_2224703:616-nf] Since this is the circumcision recommended by Jeremiah: \"Circumcise (yourselves to the Lord, and take away) the foreskins of your heart; \"[fn-78-P7800_2224862:617-nf] and even of Moses: \"Circumcise, therefore, the hardness of your heart,\"[fn-78-P7801_2224953:618-nf] -the Spirit which circumcises the heart will proceed from Him who prescribed the letter also which clips[fn-78-P7802_2225086:619-nf] the flesh; and \"the Jew which is one inwardly\" will be a subject of the self-same God as he also is who is \"a Jew outwardly; \"[fn-78-P7803_2225228:620-nf] because the apostle would have preferred not to have mentioned a Jew at all, unless he were a servant of the God of the Jews. It was once[fn-78-P7804_2225386:621-nf] the law; now it is \"the righteousness of God which is by the faith of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-78-P7805_2225486:622-nf] What means this distinction? Has your god been subserving the interests of the Creator's dispensation, by affording time to Him and to His law? Is the \"Now\" in the hands of Him to whom belonged the \"Then\"? Surely, then, the law was His, whose is now the righteousness of God. It is a distinction of dispensations, not of gods. He enjoins those who are justified by faith in Christ and not by the law to have peace with God.[fn-78-P7806_2225935:623-nf] With what God? Him whose enemies we have never, in any dispensation,[fn-78-P7807_2227095:624-nf] been? Or Him against whom we have rebelled, both in relation to His written law and His law of nature? Now, as peace is only possible towards Him with whom there once was war, we shall be both justified by Him, and to Him also will belong the Christ, in whom we are justified by faith, and through whom alone God's[fn-78-P7808_2227426:625-nf] enemies can ever be reduced to peace. \"Moreover,\" says he, \"the law entered, that the offence might abound.\"[fn-78-P7809_2227548:626-nf] And wherefore this? \"In order,\" he says, \"that (where sin abounded), grace might much more abound.\"[fn-78-P7810_2227667:627-nf] Whose grace, if not of that God from whom also came the law? Unless it be, forsooth, that[fn-78-P7811_2227776:628-nf] the Creator intercalated His law for the mere purpose of[fn-78-P7812_2227871:629-nf] producing some employment for the grace of a rival god, an enemy to Himself (I had almost said, a god unknown to Him), \"that as sin had\" in His own dispensation[fn-78-P7813_2228048:630-nf] \"reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto (eternal) life by Jesus Christ,\"[fn-78-P7814_2228174:631-nf] His own antagonist! For this (I suppose it was, that) the law of the Creator had \"concluded all under sin,\"[fn-78-P7815_2228301:632-nf] and had brought in \"all the world as guilty (before God),\" and had \"stopped every mouth,\"[fn-78-P7816_2228412:633-nf] so that none could glory through it, in order that grace might be maintained to the glory of the Christ, not of the Creator, but of Marcion! I may here anticipate a remark about the substance of Christ, in the prospect of a question which will now turn up. For he says that \"we are dead to the law.\"[fn-78-P7817_2228733:634-nf] It may be contended that Christ's body is indeed a body, but not exactly[fn-78-P7818_2229130:635-nf] flesh. Now, whatever may be the substance, since he mentions \"the body of Christ,\"[fn-78-P7819_2229298:636-nf] whom he immediately after states to have been \"raised from the dead,\"[fn-78-P7820_2229381:637-nf] none other body can be understood than that of the flesh,[fn-78-P7821_2229459:638-nf] in respect of which the law was called (the law) of death.[fn-78-P7822_2229894:639-nf] But, behold, he bears testimony to the law, and excuses it on the ground of sin: \"What shall we say, therefore? Is the law sin? God forbid.\"[fn-78-P7823_2230110:640-nf] Fie on you, Marcion. \"God forbid!\" (See how) the apostle recoils from all impeachment of the law. I, however, have no acquaintance with sin except through the law.[fn-78-P7824_2230294:641-nf] But how high an encomium of the law (do we obtain) from this fact, that by it there comes to light the latent presence of sin![fn-78-P7825_2230560:642-nf] It was not the law, therefore, which led me astray, but \"sin, taking occasion by the commandment.\"[fn-78-P7826_2230776:643-nf] Why then do you, (O Marcion, ) impute to the God of the law what His apostle dares not impute even to the law itself? Nay, he adds a climax: \"The law is holy, and its commandment just and good.\"[fn-78-P7827_2230991:644-nf] Now if he thus reverences the Creator's law, I am at a loss to know how he can destroy the Creator Himself. Who can draw a distinction, and say that there are two gods, one just and the other good, when He ought to be believed to be both one and the other, whose commandment is both \"just and good? \"Then, again, when affirming the law to be \"spiritual\"[fn-78-P7828_2231366:645-nf] he thereby implies that it is prophetic, and that it is figurative.

Well, but he had gone so far in his censure of the Jews, as to point against them the denunciation of the prophet, \"Through you the name of God is blasphemed (among the Gentiles).\"[fn-77-P7798_2224347:615-nf] But how absurd, that he should himself blaspheme Him for blaspheming whom he upbraids them as evil-doers! He prefers even circumcision of heart to neglect of it in the flesh. Now it is quite within the purpose of the God of the law that circumcision should be that of the heart, not in the flesh; in the spirit, and not in the letter.[fn-77-P7799_2224703:616-nf] Since this is the circumcision recommended by Jeremiah: \"Circumcise (yourselves to the Lord, and take away) the foreskins of your heart; \"[fn-78-P7800_2224862:617-nf] and even of Moses: \"Circumcise, therefore, the hardness of your heart,\"[fn-78-P7801_2224953:618-nf] -the Spirit which circumcises the heart will proceed from Him who prescribed the letter also which clips[fn-78-P7802_2225086:619-nf] the flesh; and \"the Jew which is one inwardly\" will be a subject of the self-same God as he also is who is \"a Jew outwardly; \"[fn-78-P7803_2225228:620-nf] because the apostle would have preferred not to have mentioned a Jew at all, unless he were a servant of the God of the Jews. It was once[fn-78-P7804_2225386:621-nf] the law; now it is \"the righteousness of God which is by the faith of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-78-P7805_2225486:622-nf] What means this distinction? Has your god been subserving the interests of the Creator's dispensation, by affording time to Him and to His law? Is the \"Now\" in the hands of Him to whom belonged the \"Then\"? Surely, then, the law was His, whose is now the righteousness of God. It is a distinction of dispensations, not of gods. He enjoins those who are justified by faith in Christ and not by the law to have peace with God.[fn-78-P7806_2225935:623-nf] With what God? Him whose enemies we have never, in any dispensation,[fn-78-P7807_2227095:624-nf] been? Or Him against whom we have rebelled, both in relation to His written law and His law of nature? Now, as peace is only possible towards Him with whom there once was war, we shall be both justified by Him, and to Him also will belong the Christ, in whom we are justified by faith, and through whom alone God's[fn-78-P7808_2227426:625-nf] enemies can ever be reduced to peace. \"Moreover,\" says he, \"the law entered, that the offence might abound.\"[fn-78-P7809_2227548:626-nf] And wherefore this? \"In order,\" he says, \"that (where sin abounded), grace might much more abound.\"[fn-78-P7810_2227667:627-nf] Whose grace, if not of that God from whom also came the law? Unless it be, forsooth, that[fn-78-P7811_2227776:628-nf] the Creator intercalated His law for the mere purpose of[fn-78-P7812_2227871:629-nf] producing some employment for the grace of a rival god, an enemy to Himself (I had almost said, a god unknown to Him), \"that as sin had\" in His own dispensation[fn-78-P7813_2228048:630-nf] \"reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto (eternal) life by Jesus Christ,\"[fn-78-P7814_2228174:631-nf] His own antagonist! For this (I suppose it was, that) the law of the Creator had \"concluded all under sin,\"[fn-78-P7815_2228301:632-nf] and had brought in \"all the world as guilty (before God),\" and had \"stopped every mouth,\"[fn-78-P7816_2228412:633-nf] so that none could glory through it, in order that grace might be maintained to the glory of the Christ, not of the Creator, but of Marcion! I may here anticipate a remark about the substance of Christ, in the prospect of a question which will now turn up. For he says that \"we are dead to the law.\"[fn-78-P7817_2228733:634-nf] It may be contended that Christ's body is indeed a body, but not exactly[fn-78-P7818_2229130:635-nf] flesh. Now, whatever may be the substance, since he mentions \"the body of Christ,\"[fn-78-P7819_2229298:636-nf] whom he immediately after states to have been \"raised from the dead,\"[fn-78-P7820_2229381:637-nf] none other body can be understood than that of the flesh,[fn-78-P7821_2229459:638-nf] in respect of which the law was called (the law) of death.[fn-78-P7822_2229894:639-nf] But, behold, he bears testimony to the law, and excuses it on the ground of sin: \"What shall we say, therefore? Is the law sin? God forbid.\"[fn-78-P7823_2230110:640-nf] Fie on you, Marcion. \"God forbid!\" (See how) the apostle recoils from all impeachment of the law. I, however, have no acquaintance with sin except through the law.[fn-78-P7824_2230294:641-nf] But how high an encomium of the law (do we obtain) from this fact, that by it there comes to light the latent presence of sin![fn-78-P7825_2230560:642-nf] It was not the law, therefore, which led me astray, but \"sin, taking occasion by the commandment.\"[fn-78-P7826_2230776:643-nf] Why then do you, (O Marcion, ) impute to the God of the law what His apostle dares not impute even to the law itself? Nay, he adds a climax: \"The law is holy, and its commandment just and good.\"[fn-78-P7827_2230991:644-nf] Now if he thus reverences the Creator's law, I am at a loss to know how he can destroy the Creator Himself. Who can draw a distinction, and say that there are two gods, one just and the other good, when He ought to be believed to be both one and the other, whose commandment is both \"just and good? \"Then, again, when affirming the law to be \"spiritual\"[fn-78-P7828_2231366:645-nf] he thereby implies that it is prophetic, and that it is figurative. Now from even this circumstance I am bound to conclude that Christ was predicted by the law but figuratively, so that indeed He could not be recognised by all the Jews.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":20,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"ANF-03","text":"As our heretic is so fond of his pruning-knife, I do not wonder when syllables are expunged by his hand, seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises his effacing process. The apostle declares that to himself, \"less than the least of all saints, was the grace given\" of enlightening all men as to \"what was the fellowship of the mystery, which during the ages had been hid in God, who created all things.\"[fn-80-P8009_2279216:811-nf] The heretic erased the preposition in, and made the clause run thus: (\"what is the fellowship of the mystery) which hath for ages been hidden from the God who created all things.\"[fn-80-P8010_2279419:812-nf] The falsification, however, is flagrantly[fn-80-P8011_2280020:813-nf] absurd. For the apostle goes on to infer (from his own statement): \"in order that unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might become known through the church the manifold wisdom of God.\"[fn-80-P8012_2280238:814-nf] Whose principalities and powers does he mean? If the Creator's, how does it come to pass that such a God as He could have meant His wisdom to be displayed to the principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For surely no principalities could possibly have understood anything without their sovereign Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage, on the ground that He (as their chief) is Himself reckoned among these (principalities), then he would have plainly said that the mystery had been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had created all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was hidden from them, he must needs be understood[fn-80-P8013_2280952:815-nf] as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all things, from His principalities and powers. For \"who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? \"[fn-80-P8014_2281228:816-nf] Caught in this trap, the heretic probably changed the passage, with the view of saying that his god wished to make known to his principalities and powers the fellowship of his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of the Creator, who was a stranger to the superior god,[fn-80-P8015_2281603:817-nf] and far enough removed from him, when even his own servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator, however, the future was well known. Then why was not that also known to Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven, and on His earth? From this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has it)-\"hidden from the God who created all things\"-he ought then to have expressed the conclusion thus: \"in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him, and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the Creator was destined to share their knowledge.\" So palpable is the erasure in this passage, when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing. I, on my part, now wish to engage with you in a discussion on the allegorical expressions of the apostle. What figures of speech could the novel god have found in the prophets (fit for himself)? \"He led captivity captive,\" says the apostle.[fn-80-P8016_2282781:818-nf] With what arms? In what conflicts? From the devastation of what Country? From the overthrow of what city? What women, what children, what princes did the Conqueror throw into chains? For when by David Christ is sung as \"girded with His sword upon His thigh,\"[fn-80-P8017_2283078:819-nf] or by Isaiah as \"taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power of Damascus,\"[fn-80-P8018_2283176:820-nf] you make Him out to be[fn-80-P8019_2283220:821-nf] really and truly a warrior confest to the eye.[fn-80-P8020_2283284:822-nf] Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: \"Putting away lying,\" (says he, ) \"speak every man truth with his neighbour; \"[fn-80-P8021_2283742:823-nf] and again, using the very words in which the Psalm[fn-80-P8022_2283813:824-nf] expresses his meaning, (he says, ) \"Be ye angry, and sin not; \"[fn-80-P8023_2283895:825-nf] \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.\"[fn-80-P8024_2283958:826-nf] \"Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; \"[fn-80-P8025_2284039:827-nf] for (in the Psalm it is written, ) \"With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with the perverse thou shalt be perverse; \"[fn-80-P8026_2284180:828-nf] and, \"Thou shalt put away evil from among you.\"[fn-80-P8027_2284250:829-nf] Again, \"Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8028_2284432:830-nf] (The apostle says further: ) \"Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess,\"[fn-80-P8029_2284552:831-nf] -a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: \"Ye gave wine to my holy ones to drink.\"[fn-80-P8030_2284753:832-nf] This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest Aaron and his sons, \"when they went into the holy place.\"[fn-80-P8031_2284894:833-nf] The command, to \"sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns,\"[fn-80-P8032_2284970:834-nf] comes suitably from him who knew that those who \"drank wine with drums and psalteries\" were blamed by God.[fn-80-P8033_2285096:835-nf] Now, when I find to what God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that \"wives ought to be in subjection to their husbands: \"[fn-80-P8034_2285357:836-nf] what reason does he give for this? \"Because,\" says he, \"the husband is the head of the wife.\"[fn-80-P8035_2285474:837-nf] Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he says: \"even as Christ is the head of the Church; \"[fn-80-P8036_2285779:838-nf] and again, in like manner: \"He who loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.\"[fn-80-P8037_2285906:839-nf] You see how your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! \"No man,\" says the apostle, \"ever yet hated his own flesh\" (except, of course, Marcion alone), \"but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.\"[fn-80-P8038_2286251:840-nf] But you are the only man that hates his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.[fn-80-P8039_2286466:841-nf] Yea, Christ loved the flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,[fn-80-P8040_2286747:842-nf] to prove that the same God is (the God) of the man[fn-80-P8041_2286810:843-nf] and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.\"[fn-80-P8042_2287150:844-nf] In passing,[fn-80-P8043_2287185:845-nf] (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries[fn-80-P8044_2287293:846-nf] in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. \"But I am speaking,\" says he, \"of Christ and the Church.\"[fn-80-P8045_2287464:847-nf] This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion's opinion? The Creator could not possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he was bound rather to annihilate Him. \"Children should obey their parents.\"[fn-80-P8046_2287944:848-nf] Now, although Marcion has erased (the next clause), \"which is the first commandment with promise,\"[fn-80-P8047_2288062:849-nf] still the law says plainly, \"Honour thy father and thy mother.\"[fn-80-P8048_2288248:850-nf] Again, (the apostle writes: ) \"Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.\"[fn-80-P8049_2288371:851-nf] For you have heard how it was said to them of old time: \"Ye shall relate these things to your children; and your children in like manner to their children.\"[fn-80-P8050_2288547:852-nf] Of what use are two gods to me, when the discipline is but one? If there must be two, I mean to follow Him who was the first to teach the lesson. But as our struggle lies against \"the rulers of this world,\"[fn-80-P8051_2288771:853-nf] what a host of Creator Gods there must be![fn-80-P8052_2288834:854-nf] For why should I not insist upon this point here, that he ought to have mentioned but one \"ruler of this world,\" if he meant only the Creator to be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when in the preceding verse he bids us \"put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil,\"[fn-80-P8053_2289330:855-nf] does he not show that all the things which he mentions after the devil's name really belong to the devil-\"the principalities and the powers, and the tillers of the darkness of this world,\"[fn-80-P8054_2289539:856-nf] which we also ascribe to the devil's authority? Else, if \"the devil\" means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator's dispensation?[fn-80-P8055_2289700:857-nf] As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil. I want to know indeed by what perversion[fn-80-P8056_2290131:858-nf] the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator. Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god-conduct such as He experienced Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid (our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,[fn-80-P8057_2290426:859-nf] from any apprehension that they would become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But \"the spiritual wickedness\"[fn-80-P8058_2290609:860-nf] did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle's additional description, \"in heavenly places; \"[fn-80-P8059_2290757:861-nf] for the apostle was quite aware that \"spiritual wickedness\" had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by the daughters of men.[fn-80-P8060_2290934:862-nf] But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging[fn-80-P8061_2291240:863-nf] the Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in \"making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,\" owing to his liberty in preaching-and actually requested (the Ephesians) to pray to God that this \"open-mouthed utterance\" might be continued to him?[fn-80-P8062_2291718:864-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":20,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"28.

In connection also with our imitating God in refraining from taking revenge, and in loving even the wicked, there is a passage containing a full description of God in this character; for it is written: \"To Thee alone ever belongeth great strength, and who can withstand the power of Thine arm? For the whole world before Thee is as a little grain of the balance; yea, as a drop of the morning dew that falleth down upon the earth. But Thou hast mercy upon all, for Thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men, because of repentance. For Thou lovest all things that are, and abhorrest nothing which Thou hast made; for never wouldest Thou have made anything if Thou hadst hated it. And how could anything have endured, if it had not been Thy will? or been preserved, if not called by Thee? But Thou sparest all; for they are Thine, O Lord, Thou lover of souls. For Thy good Spirit is in all things; therefore chastenest Thou them by little and little that offend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance wherein they have offended, that learning their wickedness, they may believe in Thee, O Lord.\"[fn-19-P1900_1078570:62-nf] Christ exhorts us to imitate this long-suffering goodness of God, who maketh the sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust; that we may not be careful to revenge, but may do good to them that hate us, and so may be perfect, even as our Father in heaven is perfect.[fn-19-P1901_1078907:63-nf] From another passage in these ancient books we learn that, by not exacting the vengeance due to us, we obtain the remission of our own sins; and that by not forgiving the debts of others, we incur the danger of being refused forgiveness when we pray for the remission of our own debts: \"He that revengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and He will surely keep his sin in remembrance. Forgive thy neighbor the hurt that he hath done to thee; so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest. One man beareth hatred against another, and cloth he seek pardon of the Lord?

Now it is clear that that is called new which is not from everlasting, and on the contrary, that is called everlasting which is not new. He, then, who does not believe that the Only-begotten God is from everlasting of the Father does not deny that He is new, for that which is not everlasting is confessedly new; and that which is new is not God, according to the saying of Scripture, \"there shall not be in thee any new God[fn-26-P2612_1787017:2-nf] .\" Therefore he who says that the Son \"once was not[fn-26-P2613_1787105:3-nf] ,\" denies His Godhead. Again, He Who says \"thou shalt never worship a strange God[fn-26-P2614_1787302:4-nf] \" forbids us to worship another God; and the strange God is so called in contradistinction to our own God. Who, then, is our own God? Clearly, the true God. And who is the strange God? Surely, he who is alien from the nature of the true God. If, therefore, our own God is the true God, and if, as the heretics say, the Only-begotten God is not of the nature of the true God, He is a strange God, and not our God. But the Gospel says, the sheep \"will not follow a stranger[fn-26-P2615_1787792:5-nf] .\" He that says He is created will make Him alien from the nature of the true God. What then will they do, who say that He is created? Do they worship that same created being as God[fn-26-P2616_1787991:6-nf] , or do they not? For if they do not worship Him, they follow the Jews in denying the worship of Christ: and if they do worship Him, they are idolaters, for they worship one alien from the true God. But surely it is equally impious not to worship the Son, and to worship the strange God. We must then say that the Son is the true Son of the true Father, that we may both worship Him, and avoid condemnation as worshipping a strange God. But to those who quote from the Proverbs the passage, \"the Lord created me[fn-26-P2617_1788562:7-nf] ,\" and think that they hereby produce a strong argument that the Creator and Maker of all things was created, we must answer that the Only-begotten God was made for us many things. For He was the Word, and was made flesh; and He was God, and was made man; and He was without body, and was made a body; and besides, He was made \"sin,\" and \"a curse,\" and \"a stone,\" and \"an axe,\" and \"bread,\" and \"a lamb,\" and \"a way,\" and \"a door,\" and \"a rock,\" and many such things; not being by nature any of these, but being made these things for our sakes, by way of dispensation. As, therefore, being the Word, He was for our sakes made flesh, and as, being God, He was made man, so also, being the Creator, He was made for our sakes a creature; for the flesh is created. As, then, He said by the prophet, \"Thus saith the Lord, He that formed me from the womb to be His servant[fn-26-P2618_1789448:8-nf] ;\" so He said also by Solomon, \"The Lord created me as the beginning of His ways, for His works[fn-26-P2619_1789559:9-nf] .\" For all creation, as the Apostle says, is in servitude[fn-26-P2620_1789637:10-nf] . Therefore both He Who was formed in the Virgin's womb, according to the word of the prophet, is the servant, and not the Lord (that is to say, the man according to the flesh, in whom God was manifested), and also, in the other passage, He Who was created as the beginning of His ways is not God, but the man in whom God was manifested to us for the renewing again of the ruined way of man's salvation. So that, since we recognize two things in Christ, one Divine, the other human (the Divine by nature, but the human in the Incarnation), we accordingly claim for the Godhead that which is eternal, and that which is created we ascribe to His human nature. For as, according to the prophet, He was formed in the womb as a servant, so also, according to Solomon, He was manifested in the flesh by means of this servile creation. But when they say, \"if He was, He was not begotten, and if He was begotten He was not,\" let them learn that it is not fitting to ascribe to His Divine nature the attributes which belong to His fleshly origin[fn-26-P2621_1790745:11-nf] . For bodies which do not exist, are generated, and God makes those things to be which are not, but does not Himself come into being from that which is not. And for this reason also Paul calls Him \"the brightness of glory[fn-26-P2622_1791088:12-nf] ,\" that we may learn that as the light from the lamp is of the nature of that which sheds the brightness, and is united with it (for as soon as the lamp appears the light that comes from it shines out simultaneously), so in this place the Apostle would have us consider both that the Son is of the Father, and that the Father is never without the Son; for it is impossible that glory should be without radiance, as it is impossible that the lamp should be without brightness. But it is clear that as His being brightness is a testimony to His being in relation with the glory (for if the glory did not exist, the brightness shed from it would not exist), so, to say that the brightness \"once was not[fn-26-P2623_1791804:13-nf] \" is a declaration that the glory also was not, when the brightness was not; for it is impossible that the glory should be without the brightness. As therefore it is not possible to say in the case of the brightness, \"If it was, it did not come into being, and if it came into being it was not,\" so it is in vain to say this of the Son, seeing that the Son is the brightness. Let those also who speak of \"less\" and \"greater,\" in the case of the Father and the Son, learn from Paul not to measure things immeasurable. For the Apostle says that the Son is the express image of the Person of the Father[fn-26-P2624_1792464:14-nf] . It is clear then that however great the Person of the Father is, so great also is the express image of that Person; for it is not possible that the express image should be less than the Person contemplated in it. And this the great John also teaches when he says, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God[fn-26-P2625_1792804:15-nf] .\" For in saying that he was \"in the beginning\" and not \"after the beginning,\" he showed that the beginning was never without the Word; and in declaring that \"the Word was with God,\" he signified the absence of defect in the Son in relation to the Father; for the Word is contemplated as a whole together with the whole being of God. For if the Word were deficient in His own greatness so as not to be capable of relation with the whole being of God, we are compelled to suppose that that part of Godwhich extends beyond the Word is without the Word. But in fact the whole magnitude of the Word is contemplated together with the whole magnitude of God: and consequently in statements concerning the Divine nature, it is not admissible to speak of \"greater\" and \"less.\"","title":"On the Faith","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":20,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_35_on_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"6.

For, concerning false witness, which is set down in the ten commands of the Law, it can indeed in no wise be contended that love of truth may at heart be preserved, and false witness brought forth to him unto whom the witness is borne. For, when it is said to God only, then it is only in the heart that the truth is to be embraced: but when it is said to man, then must we with the mouth also of the body bring forth truth, because man is not an inspector of the heart. But then, touching the witness itself, it is not unreasonably asked, to whom one is a witness? For not to whomsoever we speak unto are we witnesses, but to them to whom it is expedient and due that they by our means should come to know or believe the truth; as is a judge, that he may not err in judging; or he who is taught in doctrine of religion, that he may not err in faith, or by very authority of the teacher waver in doubt. But when the person who interrogates thee or wishes to know aught from thee seeks that which concerneth him not, or which is not expedient for him tO know, he craveth not a witness, but a betrayer.

So then with this salvo, that to bear false witness is never lawful, the question is, whether it be lawful sometimes to tell a lie. Or if it be false witness to lie at all, it is to be seen whether it admit of compensation, to wit, that it be said for the sake of avoiding a greater sin: as that which is written, \"Honor father and mother,\"[fn-43-P4351_2097957:63-nf] under stress of a preferable duty is disregarded; whence the paying of the last honors of sepulture to a father, is forbidden to that man who by the Lord Himself is called to preach the kingdom of God.","title":"On Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_125_oration_concerning_simeon_and_anna","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"ANF-06","text":"For He who said, \"Honour thy father and thy mother,\"[fn-61-P6112_1875694:95-nf] will have most assuredly, as Himself willing to be proved by such proofs, kept inviolate that grace, and His own decree towards her who ministered to Him that nativity to which He voluntarily stooped, and will have glorified with a divine honour her whom He, as being without a father, even as she was without a husband, Himself has written down as mother.

He became also the Son of God, and was begotten when He proceeded forth from Him. Do you then, (you ask, ) grant that the Word is a certain substance, constructed by the Spirit and the communication of Wisdom? Certainly I do. But you will not allow Him to be really a substantive being, by having a substance of His own; in such a way that He may be regarded as an objective thing and a person, and so be able (as being constituted second to God the Father, ) to make two, the Father and the Son, God and the Word. For you will say, what is a word, but a voice and sound of the mouth, and (as the grammarians teach) air when struck against,[fn-104-P10472_2933938:74-nf] intelligible to the ear, but for the rest a sort of void, empty, and incorporeal thing. I, on the contrary, contend that nothing empty and void could have come forth from God, seeing that it is not put forth from that which is empty and void; nor could that possibly be devoid of substance which has proceeded from so great a substance, and has produced such mighty substances: for all things which were made through Him, He Himself (personally) made. How could it be, that He Himself is nothing, without whom nothing was made? How could He who is empty have made things which are solid, and He who is void have made things which are full, and He who is incorporeal have made things which have body? For although a thing may sometimes be made different from him by whom it is made, yet nothing can be made by that which is a void and empty thing. Is that Word of God, then, a void and empty thing, which is called the Son, who Himself is designated God? \"The Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-104-P10473_2934954:75-nf] It is written, \"Thou shalt not take God's name in vain.\"[fn-104-P10474_2935027:76-nf] This for certain is He \"who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\"[fn-104-P10475_2935144:77-nf] In what form of God? Of course he means in some form, not in none. For who will deny that God is a body, although \"God is a Spirit? \"[fn-104-P10476_2935296:78-nf] For Spirit has a bodily substance of its own kind, in its own form.[fn-104-P10477_2935382:79-nf] Now, even if invisible things, whatsoever they be, have both their substance and their form in God, whereby they are visible to God alone, how much more shall that which has been sent forth from His substance not be without substance! Whatever, therefore, was the substance of the Word that I designate a Person, I claim for it the name of Son; and while I recognize the Son, I assert His distinction as second to the Father.[fn-104-P10478_2936047:80-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":20,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Therefore, brethren, you ought by free will not do evil but do good; this, indeed, is the lesson taught us in the law of God, in the Holy Scriptures-both Old and New.

God forbid.\" He then adds the statement: \"Nay, I had not known sin but by the law;\"[fn-60-P6075_2357546:127-nf] which is of the same import as the passage above quoted: \"By the law is the knowledge of sin.\"[fn-60-P6076_2357665:128-nf] Then: \"For I had not known lust,\" he says, \"except the law had said, `Thou shalt not covet.'\"[fn-60-P6077_2357780:129-nf] But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. Wherefore the law is holy; and the commandment holy, just, and good. Was, then, that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me by that which is good,-in order that the sinner, or[fn-60-P6078_2358404:130-nf] the sin, might by the commandment become beyond measure.\"[fn-60-P6079_2358658:131-nf] And to the Galatians he writes: \"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, except through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.\"[fn-60-P6080_2358994:132-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":34,"source_paragraph":"119","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The Pelagians think that they know something great when they assert that \"God would not command what He knew could not be done by man.\" Who can be ignorant of this? But God commands some things which we cannot do, in order that we may know what we ought to ask of Him. For this is faith itself, which obtains by prayer what the law commands. He, indeed, who said, \"If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments,\" did in the same book of Ecclesiasticus afterwards say, \"Who shall give a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips, that I fall not suddenly thereby, and that my tongue destroy me not.\"[fn-61-P6145_2380484:167-nf] Now he had certainly heard and received these commandments: \"Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.\"[fn-61-P6146_2380632:168-nf] Forasmuch, then, as what he said is true: \"If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments,\" why does he want a watch to be given before his mouth, like him who says in the Psalm, \"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth \"?[fn-61-P6147_2380874:169-nf] Why is he not satisfied with God's commandment and his own will; since, if he has the will, he shall keep the commandments How many of God's commandments are directed against pride! He is quite aware of them; if he will, he may keep them. Why, therefore, does he shortly afterwards say, \"O God, Father and God of my life, give me not a proud look\"?[fn-61-P6148_2381243:170-nf] The law had long ago said to him, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-61-P6149_2381326:171-nf] let him then only will, and do what he is bidden, because, if he has the will, he shall keep the commandments. Why, therefore, does he afterwards say, \"Turn away from me concupiscence\"?[fn-61-P6150_2381531:172-nf] Against luxury, too, how many commandments has God enjoined! Let a man observe them; because, if he will, he may keep the commandments.

It is certain that it is we that will when we will, but it is He who makes us will what is good, of whom it is said (as he has just now expressed it), \"The will is prepared by the Lord.\"[fn-61-P6152_2382471:174-nf] Of the same Lord it is said, \"The steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and his way doth He will.\"[fn-61-P6153_2382595:175-nf] Of the same Lord again it is said, \"It is God who worketh inyou, even to will!\"[fn-61-P6154_2382698:176-nf] It is certain that it is we that act when we act; but it is He who makes us act, by applying efficacious powers to our will, who has said, \"I will make you to walk in my statutes, and to observe my judgments, and to do them.\"[fn-61-P6155_2382945:177-nf] When he says, \"I will make you . . . to do them,\" what else does He say in fact than, \"I will take away from you your heart of stone,\"[fn-61-P6156_2383104:178-nf] from which used to arise your inability to act, \"and I will give you a heart of flesh,\"[fn-61-P6157_2383228:179-nf] in order that you may act? And what does this promise amount to but this: I will remove your hard heart, out of which you did not act, and I will give you an obedient heart, out of which you shall act? It is He who causes us to act, to whom the human suppliant says, \"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth.\"[fn-61-P6158_2383559:180-nf] That is to say: Make or enable me, O Lord, to set a watch before my mouth,-a benefit which he had already obtained from God who thus described its influence: \"I set a watch upon my mouth.\"[fn-61-P6159_2383768:181-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_35_oration_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"3.

The (question of the)divine warrant goes first-whether God has willed and also commanded ought of the kind, so that they who assert that it is not good are not plied with arguments for thinking it profitable save when they have been subdued.[fn-109-P10979_3086835:14-nf] It is proper that heretics be driven[fn-109-P10980_3086934:15-nf] to duty, not enticed. Obstinacy must be conquered, not coaxed. And, certainly, that will be pronounced beforehand quite good enough, which will be shown to have been instituted and also enjoined by God. Let the Gospels wait a little, while I set forth their root the Law, while I ascertain the will of God from those writings from which I recall to mind Himself also: \"I am,\" says He, \"God, thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt. Thou shalt have no other gods besides me. Thou shalt not make unto thee a likeness of those things which are in heaven, and which are in the earth beneath, and which are in the sea under the earth. Thou shalt not worship them, nor serve them. For I am the Lord thy God.\"[fn-109-P10981_3087687:16-nf] Likewise in the same book of Exodus: \"Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. Ye shall not make unto you gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.\"[fn-109-P10982_3087895:17-nf] To the following effect also, in Deuteronomy: \"Hear, O Israel; The Lord thy God is one: and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy might, and with all thy soul.\"[fn-109-P10983_3088116:18-nf] And again: \"Neither do thou forget the Lord thy God, who brought thee forth from the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve Him only, and cleave to Him, and swear by His name. Ye shall not go after strange gods, and the gods of the nations which are round about you, because the Lord thy God is also a jealous God among you, and lest His anger should be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.\"[fn-109-P10984_3088609:19-nf] But setting before them blessings and curses, He also says: \"Blessings shall be yours, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, whatsoever I command you this day, and do not wander from the way which I have commanded you, to go and serve other gods whom ye know not.\"[fn-109-P10985_3088905:20-nf] And as to rooting them out in every way: \"Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations, which ye shall possess by inheritance, served their gods, upon mountains and hills, and under shady trees. Ye shall overthrow all their altars, ye shall overturn and break in pieces their pillars, and cut down their groves, and burn with fire the graven images of the gods themselves, and destroy the names of them out of that place.\"[fn-109-P10986_3089362:21-nf] He further urges, when they (the Israelites) had entered the land of promise, and driven out its nations: \"Take heed to thy self, that thou do not follow them after they be driven out from before thee, that thou do not inquire after their gods, saying, As the nations serve their gods, so let me do likewise.\"[fn-109-P10987_3089694:22-nf] But also says He: \"If there arise among you a prophet himself, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and it come to pass, and he say, Let us go and serve other gods, whom ye know not, do not hearken to the words of that prophet or dreamer, for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye fear God with all your heart and with all your soul. After the Lord your God ye shall go, and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and obey His voice, and serve Him, and cleave unto Him.

Thine eye shall not spare him, neither shalt thou pity, neither shalt thou preserve him; thou shall certainly inform upon him. Thine hand shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hand of thy people; and ye shall stone him, and he shall die, seeing he has sought to turn thee away from the Lord thy God.\"[fn-109-P10990_3091220:25-nf] He adds likewise concerning cities, that if it appeared that one of these had, through the advice of unrighteous men, passed over to other gods, all its inhabitants should be slain, and everything belonging to it become accursed, and all the spoil of it be gathered together into all its places of egress, and be, even with all the people, burned with fire in all its streets in the sight of the Lord God; and, says He, \"it shall not be for dwelling in for ever: it shall not be built again any more, and there shall cleave to thy hands nought of its accursed plunder, that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger.\"[fn-109-P10991_3091867:26-nf] He has, from His abhorrence of idols, framed a series of curses too: \"Cursed be the man who maketh a graven or a molten image, an abomination, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place.\"[fn-109-P10992_3092106:27-nf] But in Leviticus He says: \"Go not ye after idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the Lord your God.\"[fn-109-P10993_3092239:28-nf] And in other passages: \"The children of Israel are my household servants; these are they whom I led forth from the land of Egypt:[fn-109-P10994_3092387:29-nf] I am the Lord your God. Ye shall not make you idols fashioned by the hand, neither rear you up a graven image. Nor shall ye set up a remarkable stone in your land (to worship it): I am the Lord your God.\"[fn-109-P10995_3092746:30-nf] These words indeed were first spoken by the Lord by the lips of Moses, being applicable certainly to whomsoever the Lord God of Israel may lead forth in like manner from the Egypt of a most superstitious world, and from the abode of human slavery. But from the mouth of every prophet in succession, sound forth also utterances of the same God, augmenting the same law of His by a renewal of the same commands, and in the first place announcing no other duty in so special a manner as the being on guard against all making and worshipping of idols; as when by the mouth of David He says: \"The gods of the nations are silver and gold: they have eyes, and see not; they have ears, and hear not; they have a nose, and smell not; a mouth, and they speak not; hands, and they handle not; feet and they walk not.

They lost the first\ncommandment-that in which He warned them saying:-I am the Lord your God, Who brought you up from\nthe land of Egypt.[fn-39-P3993_1329872:49-nf] And when they had\nlost this first commandment, also the nine which are after it they could not keep, because on the\nfirst depend the nine. For it was an impossibility that while worshipping Baal, they should keep the\nnine commandments. For they lost the first commandment, like that woman who lost one drachma from the\nten. So the Prophet cried unto them:-Light you a lamp and seek ye the Lord.[fn-39-P3994_1330283:50-nf] And furthermore the Prophet Isaiah also\nsaid:-Seek ye the Lord and when ye shall have found Him, call upon Him; and when He is near let\nthe sinner abandon his way and the wicked man his thought.[fn-39-P3995_1330495:51-nf] For that lamp shone and they did not by it seek\nthe Lord their God. And its light shone in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it. And\nthe lamp was set up on the lamp-stand and those who were in the house did not see its light. And what\nthen means this, that the lamp was set up on the lamp-stand? Clearly His being raised up upon the\ncross. And by this all the house was made dark over them. For when they crucified Him, the light was\ndarkened from them, and shone amongst the Gentiles, because that from the time of the sixth hour (of\nthe day) on which they crucified Him even unto the ninth hour there was darkness in all the land of\nIsrael. And the sun set in midday and the land was darkened in the shining daytime, as is written n\nZechariah the Prophet:-It shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, I will cause the sun to\nset in midday, and will make dark the land in the shining daytime.[fn-39-P3996_1331428:52-nf] ","title":"Letter of an Inquirer.","author":"Aphrahat"},{"chapter":20,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_50_exhortation_to_the_heathen","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"380","folder":"ANF-02","text":"For what, think you, O men, is the Hermes of Typho, and that of Andocides, and that of Amyetus? Is it not evident to all that they are stones, as is the veritable Hermes himself? As the Halo is not a god, and as the Iris is not a god, but are states of the atmosphere and of the clouds; and as, likewise, a day is not a god, nor a year, nor time, which is made up of these, so neither is sun nor moon, by which each of those mentioned above is determined. Who, then, in his right senses, can imagine Correction, and Punishment, and Justice, and Retribution to be gods? For neither the Furies, nor the Fates, nor Destiny are gods, since neither Government, nor Glory, nor Wealth are gods, which last [as Plutus] painters represent as blind. But if you deify Modesty, and Love, and Venus, let these be followed by Infamy, and Passion, and Beauty, and Intercourse. Therefore Sleep and Death cannot reasonably any more be regarded as twin deities, being merely changes which take place naturally in living creatures; no more will you with propriety call Fortune, or Destiny, or the Fates goddesses. And if Strife and Battle be not gods, no more are ArÃªs and Enyo. Still further, if the lightnings, and thunderbolts, and rains are not gods, how can fire and water be gods? how can shooting stars and comets, which are produced by atmospheric changes? He who calls Fortune a god, let him also so call Action. If, then, none of these, nor of the images formed by human hands, and destitute of feeling, is held to be a God, while a providence exercised about us is evidently the result of a divine power,[fn-32-P3204_942177:136-nf] it remains only to acknowledge this, that He alone who is truly God, only truly is and subsists. But those who are insensible to this are like men who have drunk mandrake or some other drug. May God grant that you may at length awake from this slumber, and know God; and that neither Gold, nor Stone, nor Tree, nor Action, nor Suffering, nor Disease, nor Fear, may appear in your eyes as a god. For there are, in sooth, \"on the fruitful earth thrice ten thousand\" demons, not immortal, nor indeed mortal; for they are not endowed with sensation, so as to render them capable of death, but only things of wood and stone, that hold despotic sway over men insulting and violating life through the force of custom. \"The earth is the Lord's,\" it is said, \"and the fulness thereof.\"[fn-32-P3205_943378:137-nf] Then why darest thou, while luxuriating in the bounties of the Lord, to ignore the Sovereign Ruler? \"Leave my earth,\" the Lord will say to thee. \"Touch not the water which I bestow. Partake not of the fruits of the earth produced by my husbandry\" Give to God recompense for your sustenance; acknowledge thy Master. Thou art God's creature. What belongs to Him, how can it with justice be alienated? For that which is alienated, being deprived of the properties that belonged to it, is also deprived of truth. For, after the fashion of Niobe, or, to express myself more mystically, like the Hebrew woman called by the ancients Lot's wife, are ye not turned into a state of insensibility? This woman we have heard, was turned into stone for her love of Sodore. And those who are godless, addicted to impiety, hard-hearted and foolish are Sodomites. Believe that these utterances are addressed to you from God. For think not that stones, and stocks, and birds, and serpents are sacred things, and men are not; but, on the contrary, regard men as truly sacred,[fn-32-P3206_944473:138-nf] and take beasts and stones for what they are. For there are miserable wretches of human kind, who consider that God utters His voice by the raven and the jackdaw, but says nothing by man; and honour the raven as a messenger of God. But the man of God, who croaks not, nor chatters, but speaks rationally and instructs lovingly, alas, they persecute; and while he is inviting them to cultivate righteousness, they try inhumanly to slay him, neither welcoming the grace which, comes from above, nor fearing the penalty. For they believe not God, nor understand His power, whose love to man is ineffable; and His hatred of evil is inconceivable. His anger augments punishment against sin; His love bestows blessings on repentance. It is the height of wretchedness to be deprived of the help which comes from God. Hence this blindness of eyes and dulness of hearing are more grievous than other inflictions of the evil one; for the one deprives them of heavenly vision, the other robs them of divine instruction. But ye, thus maimed as respects the truth, blind in mind, deaf in understanding, are not grieved, are not pained, have had no desire to see heaven and the Maker of heaven, nor, by fixing your choice on salvation, have sought to hear the Creator of the universe, and to learn of Him; for no hindrance stands in the way of him who is bent on the knowledge of God. Neither childlessness, nor poverty, nor obscurity, nor want, can hinder him who eagerly strives after the knowledge of God; nor does any one who has conquered[fn-32-P3207_946125:139-nf] by brass or iron the true wisdom for himself choose to exchange it, for it is vastly preferred to everything else. Christ is able to save in every place. For he that is fired with ardour and admiration for righteousness, being the lover of One who needs nothing, needs himself but little, having treasured up his bliss in nothing but himself and God, where is neither moth,[fn-32-P3208_946659:140-nf] robber, nor pirate, but the eternal Giver of good. With justice, then, have you been compared to those serpents who shut their ears against the charmers. For \"their mind,\" says the Scripture, \"is like the serpent, like the deaf adder, which stoppeth her ear, and will not hear the voice of the charmers.\"[fn-32-P3209_946988:141-nf] But allow yourselves to feel the influence of the charming strains of sanctity, and receive that mild word of ours, and reject the deadly poison, that it may be granted to you to divest yourselves as much as possible of destruction, as they[fn-32-P3210_947371:142-nf] have been divested of old age. Hear me, and do not stop your ears; do not block up the avenues of hearing, but lay to heart what is said. Excellent is the medicine of immortality! Stop at length your grovelling reptile motions.[fn-32-P3211_947654:143-nf] \"For the enemies of the Lord,\" says Scripture, \"shall lick the dust.\"[fn-32-P3212_947866:144-nf] Raise your eyes from earth to the skies, look up to heaven, admire the sight, cease watching with outstretched head the heel of the righteous, and hindering the way of truth. Be wise and harmless. Perchance the Lord will endow you with the wing of simplicity (for He has resolved to give wings to those that are earth-born), that you may leave your holes and dwell in heaven. Only let us with our whole heart repent, that we may be able with our whole heart to contain God. \"Trust in Him, all ye assembled people; pour out all your hearts before Him.\"[fn-32-P3213_948438:145-nf] He says to those that have newly abandoned wickedness, \"He pities them, and fills them with righteousness.\" Believe Him who is man and God; believe, O man. Believe, O man, the living God, who suffered and is adored. Believe, ye slaves,[fn-32-P3214_948694:146-nf] Him who died; believe, all ye of human kind, Him who alone is God of all men. Believe, and receive salvation as your reward. Seek God, and your soul shall live. He who seeks God is busying himself about his own salvation. Hast thou found God?-then thou hast life. Let us then seek, in order that we may live. The reward of seeking is life with God. \"Let all who seek Thee be glad and rejoice in Thee; and let them say continually, God be magnified.\"[fn-32-P3215_949221:147-nf] A noble hymn of God is an immortal man, established in righteousness, in whom the oracles of truth are engraved. For where but in a soul that is wise can you write truth? where love? where reverence? where meekness? Those who have had these divine characters impressed on them, ought, I think, to regard wisdom as a fair port whence to embark, to whatever lot in life they turn; and likewise to deem it the calm haven of salvation: wisdom, by which those who have betaken themselves to the Father, have proved good fathers to their children; and good parents to their sons, those who have known the Son; and good husbands to their wives, those who remember the Bridegroom; and good masters to their servants,[fn-32-P3216_949950:148-nf] those who have been redeemed from utter slavery. Oh, happier far the beasts than men involved in error! who live in ignorance as you, but do not counterfeit the truth. There are no tribes of flatterers among them. Fishes have no superstition: the birds worship not a single image; only they look with admiration on heaven, since, deprived as they are of reason, they are unable to know God. So are you not ashamed for living through so many periods of life in impiety, making yourselves more irrational than irrational creatures? You were boys, then striplings, then youths, then men, but never as yet were you good. If you have respect for old age, be wise, now that you have reached life's sunset; and albeit at the close of life, acquire the knowledge of God, that the end of life may to you prove the beginning of salvation. You have become old in superstition; as young, enter on the practice of piety. God regards you as innocent children. Let, then, the Athenian follow the laws of Solon, and the Argive those of Phoroneus, and the Spartan those of Lycurgus: but if thou enrol thyself as one of God's people, heaven is thy country, God thy lawgiver. And what are the laws? \"Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not seduce boys; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt love the Lord thy God.\"[fn-32-P3217_951387:149-nf] And the complements of these are those laws. of reason and words of sanctity which are inscribed on men's hearts: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; to him who strikes thee on the cheek, present also the other; \"[fn-32-P3218_951643:150-nf] \"thou shalt not lust, for by lust alone thou hast committed adultery.\"[fn-32-P3219_951734:151-nf] How much better, therefore, is it for men from the beginning not to wish to desire things forbidden, than to obtain their desires! But ye are not able to endure the austerity of salvation; but as we delight in sweet' things, and prize them higher for the agreeableness of the pleasure they yield, while, on the other hand, those bitter things which are distasteful to the palate are curative and healing, and the harshness of medicines strengthens people of weak stomach, thus custom pleases and, tickles; but custom pushes into the abyss, while truth conducts to heaven. Harsh it is at first, but a good nurse of youth; and it is at once the decorous place where the household maids and matrons dwell together, and the sage council-chamber. Nor is it difficult to approach, or impossible to attain, but is very near us in our very homes; as Moses, endowed with all wisdom, says, while referring to it, it has its abode in three departments of our constitution-in the hands, the mouth, and the heart: a meet emblem this of truth, which is embraced by these three things in all-will, action, speech. And be not afraid lest the multitude of pleasing objects which rise before you withdraw you from wisdom. You yourself will spontaneously surmount the frivolousness of custom, as boys when they have become men throw aside their toys. For with a celerity unsurpassable, and a benevolence to which we have ready access, the divine power, casting its radiance on the earth, hath filled the universe with the seed of salvation. For it was not without divine care that so great a work was accomplished in so brief a space by the Lord, who, though despised as to appearance, was in reality adored, the expiator of sin, the Saviour, the clement, the Divine Word, He that is truly most manifest Deity, He that is made equal to the Lord of the universe; because He was His Son, and the Word was in God, not disbelieved in by all when He was first preached, nor altogether unknown when, assuming the character of man, and fashioning Himself in flesh, He enacted the drama of human salvation: for He was a true champion and a fellow-champion with the creature. And being communicated most speedily to men, having dawned from His Father's counsel quicker than the sun, with the most perfect ease He made God shine on us. Whence He was and what He was, He showed by what He taught and exhibited, manifesting Himself as the Herald of the Covenant, the Reconciler, our Saviour, the Word, the Fount of life, the Giver of peace, diffused over the whole face of the earth; by whom, so to speak, the universe has already become an ocean of blessings.[fn-32-P3220_954384:152-nf] ","title":"Exhortation to the Heathen","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":20,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_50_exhortation_to_the_heathen","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"380","folder":"ANF-02","text":"For what, think you, O men, is the Hermes of Typho, and that of Andocides, and that of Amyetus?

Atque hac quidem de causa videtur esse nominatum pudendum, quod hac corporis parte magis, quam qualibet alia, cum pudore utendum sit; natura enim sicut alimentis, ita etiam legitimis nuptiis, quantum convenit, utile est, et decet, nobis uti permisit: permisit autem appetere liberorum procreationem.

Eis quidem certe, qui divini muneris in producendo opificio sunt participes, semen non est abjiciendum, neque injuria afficiendum, neque tanquam si cornibus semen mandes seminandum est. Hic ipse ergo Moyses cum ipsis quoque prohibet uxoribus congredi, si forte eas detineant purgationes menstruae. Non enim purgamento corporis genitale semen, et quod mox homo futurum est, polluere est aequum, nec sordido materiae profluvio, et, quae expurgantur, inquinamentis inundare ac obruere; semen autem generationis degenerat, ineptumque redditur, simatricis sulcis privetur. Neque vero ullum unquam induxit veterum Hebraeorum coeuntem cum sua uxore praegnante. Sola enim voluptas, si quis ea etiam utatur in conjugio, est praeter leges, et injusta, eta ratione aliena. Rursus autem Moyses abducit viros a praegnantibus, quousque pepererint. Revera enim matrix sub vesica quidem collocata, super intestinum autem, quod rectum appellatur, posita, extendit collum inter humeros in vesica; et os colli, in quod venit semen, impletum occluditur, illa autem rursus inanis redditur, cum partu purgata fuerit: fructu autem deposito, deinde semen suscipit. Neque vero nobis turpe est ad auditorum utilitatem nominare partes, in quibus fit fetus conceptio, quae quidem Deum fabricari non puduit. Matrix itaque sitiens filiorum procreationem, semen suscipit, probrosumque et vituperandum negat coitum, post sationem ore clauso omnino jam libidinem excludens. Ejus autem appetitiones, quae prius in amicis versabantur complexibus, intro conversae, in procreatione sobolis occupatae, operantur una cum Opifice.

Lucius of Castra Galbae has brought forward a proof from the gospel, in the words of the Lord, \"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savor, that which is salted from it shall be good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men;\" just as though we maintained that men when cast out were of any profit for the salvation either of themselves or of any one else. But those also who, though seeming to be within, are yet of such a kind, not only are without spiritually, but will in the end be separated in the body also. For all such are for nothing. But it does not therefore follow that the sacrament of baptism which is in them is nothing. For even in the very men who are cast out, if they return to their senses and come back, the salvation which had departed from them returns; but the baptism does not return, because it never had departed. And in what the Lord says, \"Go therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,\" He did not permit any to baptize except the good, inasmuch as He did not say to the bad, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.\"[fn-39-P3943_2148632:52-nf] How then do the wicked baptize within, who cannot remit sins?

Yet the baptism Of Christ should be acknowledged in both, and held invalid in none, whether before they are converted, though then it profit them nothing, or after they are converted, that so it may profit them, as he says, \"Since they themselves, by withdrawing when they have lost their savor from the Church, which is one, have become contrary to it, let that be done which is written, `The houses of those that are opposed to the law must need be cleansed.' And it therefore follows,\" he goes on to say, \"that those who have been polluted by being baptized by men opposed to Christ should first be cleansed, and only then baptized.\" What then? Are thieves and murderers not contrary to the law, which says, \"Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal?\"[fn-39-P3945_2150028:54-nf] \"They must therefore needs be cleansed.\" Who will deny it? And yet not only those who are baptized by such within the Church, but also those who, being such themselves, are baptized without being changed in heart, are nevertheless exempt from further baptism when they are so changed. So great is the force of the sacrament of mere baptism, that though we allow that a man who has been baptized and continues to lead an evil life requires to be cleansed, we yet forbid him to be any more baptized.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_60_book_v_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"ANF-04","text":"He next proceeds to make the following statement about the Jews:-\"The first point relating to the Jews which is fitted to excite wonder, is that they should worship the heaven and the angels who dwell therein, and yet pass by and neglect its most venerable and powerful parts, as the sun, the moon, and the other heavenly bodies, both fixed stars and planets, as if it were possible that 'the whole' could be God, and yet its parts not divine; or (as if it were reasonable) to treat with the greatest respect those who are said to appear to such as are in darkness somewhere, blinded by some crooked sorcery, or dreaming dreams through the influence of shadowy spectres,[fn-98-P9808_2556970:13-nf] while those who prophesy so clearly and strikingly to all men, by means of whom rain, and heat, and clouds, and thunder (to which they offer worship), and lightnings, and fruits, and all kinds of productiveness, are brought about,-by means of whom God is revealed to them,-the most prominent heralds among those beings that are above,-those that are truly heavenly angels,-are to be regarded as of no account!\" In making these statements, Celsus appears to have fallen into confusion, and to have penned them from false ideas of things which he did not understand; for it is patent to all who investigate the practices of the Jews, and compare them with those of the Christians, that the Jews who follow the law, which, speaking in the person of God, says, \"Thou shall have no other gods before Me: thou shalt not make unto thee an image, nor a likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth; thou shall not bow down to them, nor serve them,\"[fn-98-P9809_2558154:14-nf] worship nothing else than the Supreme God, who made the heavens, and all things besides. Now it is evident that those who live according to the law, and worship the Maker of heaven, will not worship the heaven at the same time with God. Moreover, no one who obeys the law of Moses will bow down to the angels who are in heaven; and, in like manner, as they do not bow down to sun, moon, and stars, the host of heaven, they refrain from doing obeisance to heaven and its angels, obeying the law which declares: \"Lest thou lift up thine eyes to heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations.\"[fn-98-P9810_2558925:15-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":20,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_61_book_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Qui autem a Carpocrate descendunt et Epiphane, censent oportere uxores esse communes; a quibus contra nomen Christi maximum emanavit probruin.

For their form is adapted to the capacity of man's understanding, and will appear earthly to carnal people, and divine to spiritual ones, so that those to whom it formerly appeared to be involved in thick clouds, cannot apprehend its subtleties nor endure its light. But to make this which we are aiming at somewhat clearer by an instance, it will be enough to produce a single passage of the law, by which we can prove that all the heavenly commands as well are applied to men in accordance with the measure of our state. For it is written in the law: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\"[fn-55-P5514_1975759:32-nf] This is rightly observed according to the simple meaning of the letter, by a man who is still in bondage tofoul passions. But by one who has alreadyforsaken these dirty acts and impure affections, it must be observed in the spirit, so that he may forsake not only the worship of idols but also all heathen superstitions and the observance of auguries and omens and all signs and days and times, or at any rate that he be not entangled in the conjectures of words and names which destroy the simplicity of our faith. For by fornication of this kind we read that Jerusalem was defiled, as she committed adultery \"on every high hill and under every green tree,\"[fn-55-P5515_1976437:33-nf] whom also the Lord rebuked by the prophet, saying: \"Let now the astrologers stand and save thee, they that gazed at the stars and counted the months, that from them they might tell the things that shall come to thee,\"[fn-55-P5516_1976673:34-nf] of which fornication elsewhere also the Lord says in rebuking them: \"The spirit of fornication deceived them, and they went a whoring from their God.\"[fn-55-P5517_1976845:35-nf] But one who has forsaken both these kinds of fornication, will have a third kind to avoid, which is contained in the superstitions of the law and of Judaism; of which the Apostle says: \"Ye observe days and months and times and years;\" and again: Touch not, taste not, handle not.\"[fn-55-P5518_1977144:36-nf] And there is no doubt that this is said of the superstitions of the law, into which one who has fallen has certainly gone a whoring from Christ, and is not worthy to hear this from the Apostle: \"For I have espoused you to one husband, to exhibit you as a chaste virgin to Christ.\"[fn-55-P5519_1977456:37-nf] But this that follows will be directed to him by the words of the same Apostle: \"But I am afraid lest as the serpent by his cunning deceived Eve, so your minds should be corrupted and fall from the simplicity which is in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-55-P5520_1977711:38-nf] But if one has escaped the uncleanness even of this fornication there will still be a fourth, which is committed by adulterous intercourse with heretical teaching.

Now you need to be reminded whence this discourse arose, by reason of what precedes this passage, where the Lord had cured a certain man among those who were lying in the five porches of that pool of Solomon, and to whom He had said, \"Take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.\" But this He had done on the Sabbath; and hence the Jews, being troubled, were falsely accusing Him as a destroyer and transgressor of the law. He then said to them, \"My Father worketh even until now, and I work.\"[fn-10-P1042_620104:1-nf] For they, taking the observance of the Sabbath in a carnal sense, fancied that God had, as it were, slept after the labor of framing the world even to this day; and that therefore He had sanctified that day, from which He began to rest as from labor. Now, to our fathers of old there was ordained a sacrament of the Sabbath,[fn-10-P1043_620444:2-nf] which we Christians observe spiritually, in abstaining from every servile work, that is, from every sin (for the Lord saith, \"Every one that committeth sin is the servant of sin\"), and in having rest in our heart, that is, spiritual tranquillity. And although in this life we strive after this rests yet not until we have departed this life shall we attain to that perfect rest. But the reason why God is said to have rested is, that He made no creature after all was finished. Moreover, the Scripture called it rest, to admonish us that after good works we shall rest. For thus we have it written in Genesis, \"And God made all things very good, and God rested on the seventh day,\" in order that thou, O man, considering that God Himself is said to have rested after good works, shouldest not expect rest for thyself, until after thou hast wrought good works; and even as God after He made man in His own image and likeness, and in him finished all His works very good, rested on the seventh day, so mayest thou also not expect rest to thyself, except thou return to that likeness in which thou wast made, which likeness thou hast lost by sinning. For, in reality, God cannot be said to have toiled, who \"said, and they were done.\" Who is there that, after such facility of work, desires to rest as if after labor? If He commanded and some one resisted Him, if He commanded and it was not done, and labored that it might be done, then justly He should be said to have rested after labor. But when in that same book of Genesis we read, \"God said, Let there be light, and there was light; God said, Let there be a firmament, and the firmament was made,[fn-10-P1044_622109:3-nf] and all the rest were made immediately at His word: to which also the psalm testifies, saying, \"He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created,\"[fn-10-P1045_622293:4-nf] -how could He require rest after the world was made, as if to enjoy leisure after toil, He who in commanding never toiled? Consequently these sayings are mystical, and are laid down in this wise that we may be looking for rest after this life, provided we have done good works. Accordingly, the Lord, restraining the impudence and refuting the error of the Jews, and showing them that they did not think rightly of God, says to them, when they were offended at His working men's healing on the Sabbath, \"My Father worketh until now, and I work:\" do not therefore suppose that my Father so rested on the Sabbath, that thenceforth He doth not work; but even as He now worketh, so I also work. But as the Father without toil, so too the Son without toil. God \"said, and they were done;\" Christ said to the impotent man, \"Take up thy bed, and go unto thy house,\" and it was done.","title":"Tractate XX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_35_tractate_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. \"I have done one work, and ye all marvel.\" And immediately He subjoined: \"Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision.\" It was well done that ye received circumcision from Moses. \"Not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers;\" since it was Abraham that first received circumcision from the Lord.[fn-14-P1414_890593:4-nf] \"And ye circumcise on the Sabbath-day.\" Moses has convicted you: ye have received in the law to circumcise on the eighth day; ye have received in the law to cease from labor on the seventh day;[fn-14-P1415_890805:5-nf] if the eighth day from the child's birth fall on the seventh day of the week, what will ye do Will ye abstain from work to keep the Sabbath, or will ye circumcise to fulfill the sacrament of the eighth day?

Does anger rise? Yield not up thy tongue to anger for the purpose of evil-speaking; yield not up thy hand or foot to anger for the purpose of striking. That irrational anger would not rise, were there no sin in the members. But take away its ruling power; let it have no weapons wherewith to fight against thee. Then also it will learn not to rise, when it begins to find the lack of weapons. \"Yield not your members as weapons of unrighteousness unto sin,\" else will ye be entirely captive, and there will be no room to say, \"With the mind I serve the law of God.\" For if the mind keep possession of the weapons, the members are not roused to the service of raging sin. Let the inward ruler keep possession of the citadel, because it stands there under a greater ruler, and is certain of assistance. Let it bridle anger; let it restrain evil desire. There is within something that needs bridling, that needs restraining, that needs to be kept in command. And what did that righteous man wish, who with the mind was serving the law of God, but that there should be a complete deliverance from that which needed to be bridled? And this ought every one to be striving after who is aiming at perfection, that lust itself also, no longer receiving the obedience of the members, may every day be lessened in the advancing pilgrim. \"To will,\" he says, \"is present with me; but not so, how to perfect that which is good.\"[fn-17-P1767_1119643:32-nf] Has he said, To do good is not present with me?

He labored only to bridle lust, to refuse consent to lust, and not to yield his members to its service. \"To perfect,\" then, he says, \"that which is good is not present with me.\" I cannot fulfill the commandment, \"Thou shalt not lust.\" What then is needed? To fulfill this: \"Go not after thy lusts.\"[fn-17-P1769_1120548:34-nf] Do this meanwhile so long as unlawful lusts are present in thy flesh; \"Go not after thy lusts.\" Abide in the service of God, in the liberty of Christ.
