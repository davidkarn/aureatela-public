And also through the Prophet Ezekiel, the Resurrection of the dead was manifestly shown,\nwhen God brought him forth to the valley and showed him many bones, and made him pass by them round\nabout them, and said to him:-Son of Man, will these bones live? And Ezekiel said to\nHim:[fn-43-P4362_1452149:30-nf] -Thou knowest, O Lord of\nlords. And the Lord said to him:-Prophesy, O Son Man, over these bones; prophesy and say to\nthe dry bones, Hear the word of the Lord of lords. And when he had caused them to hear those\nwords, there was a shaking and a noise, and the bones were gathered together, even those that were\ncrushed into pieces and broken. And when the Prophet saw them, he was astonished, for they came\ntogether from all sides, and each bone received its fellow, and each joint approached its\nfellow-joint, and they ordered themselves, one on another. And their dryness was made moist, and the\njoints were united by the ligatures, and the blood grew warm in the arteries, and skin was stretched\nover the flesh, and hair grew up according to its nature. But they lay prostrate and there was no\nbreath in them Then again He commanded the Prophet, and said to him:-Prophesy unto the spirit and\nsay to it, Come, O spirit, from the four winds, and breathe upon these slain men that they may\nlive. And when he caused them to hear this second word, the spirit entered into them, and they\nrevived and stood up upon their feet, a very great host.","title":"Letter of an Inquirer.","author":"Aphrahat"},{"chapter":37,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_46_oration_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XVIII. You say, Things of one essence are counted together, but those which are not con-substantial are reckoned one by one. Where did you get this from? From what teachers of dogma or mythology? Do you not know that every number expresses the quantity of what is included under it, and not the nature of the things? But I am so old fashioned, or perhaps I should say so unlearned, as to use the word Three of that number of things, even if they are of a different nature, and to use One and One and One in a different way of so many units, even if they are united in essence, looking not so much at the things themselves as at the quantity of the things in respect of which the enumeration is made. But since you hold so very close to the letter (although you are contending against the letter), pray take your demonstrations from this source. There are in the Book of Proverbs three things which go well, a lion, a goat, and a cock; and to these is added a fourth;-a King making a speech before the people,[fn-46-P4654_1483635:28-nf] to pass over the other sets of four which are there counted up, although things of various natures. And I find in Moses two Cherubim[fn-46-P4655_1483796:29-nf] counted singly. But now, in your technology, could either the former things be called three, when they differ so greatly in their nature, or the latter be treated as units when they are so closely connected and of one nature? For if I were to speak of God and Mammon, as two masters, reckoned under one head, when they are so very different from each other, I should probably be still more laughed at for such a connumeration.","title":"Oration XXXII.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"}]
