{"verses":["And the Lord said to Moses:  Yet one plague more will I bring upon\nPharao and Egypt, and after that he shall let you go, and thrust you\nout.","Therefore thou shalt tell all the people, that every man ask of\nhis friend, and every woman of her neighbour, vessels of silver and of\ngold.","And the Lord will give favour to his people in the sight of the\nEgyptians.  And Moses was a very great man in the land of Egypt, in the\nsight of Pharao's servants, and of all the people.","And he said:  Thus saith the Lord:  At midnight I will enter into\nEgypt:","And every firstborn in the land of the Egyptians shall die, from\nthe firstborn of Pharao who sitteth on his throne, even to the\nfirstborn of the handmaid that is at the mill, and all the firstborn of\nbeasts.","And there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as\nneither hath been before, nor shall be hereafter.","But with all the children of Israel there shall not a dog make\nthe least noise, from man even to beast; that you may know how\nwonderful a difference the Lord maketh between the Egyptians and\nIsrael.","And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and shall\nworship me, saying:  Go forth thou, and all the people that is under\nthee:  after that we will go out.","And he went out from Pharao exceeding angry.  But the Lord said to\nMoses:  Pharao will not hear you, that many signs may be done in the\nland of Egypt.","And Moses and Aaron did all the wonders that are written, before\nPharao.  And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, neither did he let the\nchildren of Israel go out of his land."]}
