{"verses":["And the Lord said to Moses:  Go in to Pharao; for I have hardened\nhis heart, and the heart of his servants:  that I may work these my\nsigns in him,","And thou mayst tell in the ears of thy sons, and of thy\ngrandsons, how often I have plagued the Egyptians, and wrought my signs\namongst them:  and you may know that I am the Lord.","Therefore Moses and Aaron went in to Pharao, and said to him:\nThus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews:  How long refusest thou to\nsubmit to me?  let my people go, to sacrifice to me.","But if thou resist, and wilt not let them go, behold I will bring\nin to-morrow the locusts into thy coasts;","To cover the face of the earth, that nothing thereof may appear,\nbut that which the hail hath left may be eaten:  for they shall feed\nupon all the trees that spring in the fields.","And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of thy servants,\nand of all the Egyptians:  such a number as thy fathers have not seen,\nnor thy grandfathers, from the time they were first upon the earth,\nuntil this present day.  And he turned himself away, and went forth from\nPharao.","And Pharao's servants said to him:  How long shall we endure this\nscandal?  Iet the men go to sacrifice to the Lord their God.
