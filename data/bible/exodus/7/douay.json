{"verses":["And the Lord said to Moses:  Behold, I have appointed thee the god\nof Pharao; and Aaron, thy brother, shall be thy prophet.","Thou shalt speak to him all that I command thee; and he shall\nspeak to Pharao, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.","But I shall harden his heart, and shall multiply my signs and\nwonders in the land of Egypt.","And he will not hear you:  and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and\nwill bring forth my army and my people, the children of Israel, out of\nthe land of Egypt, by very great judgments.","And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, who have\nstretched forth my hand upon Egypt, and have brought forth the children\nof Israel out of the midst of them.","And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded; so did they.","And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three, when they\nspoke to Pharao.","And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron:","When Pharao shall say to you, Shew signs; thou shalt say to Aaron:\nTake thy rod, and cast it down before Pharao, and it shall be turned\ninto a serpent.","So Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharao, and did as the Lord had\ncommanded.  And Aaron took the rod before Pharao and his servants, and\nit was turned into a serpent.","And Pharao called the wise men and the magicians; and they also\nby Egyptian enchantments and certain secrets, did in like manner.","And they every one cast down their rods, and they were turned\ninto serpents:  but Aaron's rod devoured their rods.","And Pharao's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them,\nas the Lord had commanded.","And the Lord said to Moses:  Pharao's heart is hardened, he will\nnot let the people go.","Go to him in the morning, behold he will go out to the waters:\nand thou shalt stand to meet him on the ' bank of the river:  and thou\nshalt take in thy hand the rod that was turned into a serpent.","And thou shalt say to him:  The Lord God of the Hebrews sent me to\nthee, saying:  Let my people go to sacrifice to me in the desert:  and\nhitherto thou wouldst not hear.","Thus therefore saith the Lord:  In this thou shalt know that I am\nthe Lord:  behold I will strike with the rod, that is in my hand, the\nwater of the river, and it shall be turned into blood.","The Lord also said to Moses:  Say to Aaron, Take thy rod; and\nstretch forth thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, and upon their rivers,\nand streams and pools, and all the ponds of waters, that they may be\nturned into blood:  and let blood be in all the land of Egypt, both in\nvessels of wood and of stone.","And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded:  and lifting up\nthe rod, he struck the water of the river before Pharao and his\nservants:  and it was turned into blood.","And the fishes that were in the river died; and the river\ncorrupted, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river,\nand there was blood in all the land of Egypt.","And the magicians of the Egyptians with their enchantments did in\nlike manner; and Pharao's heart was hardened, neither did he hear them,\nas the Lord had commanded.","And he turned himself away, and went into his house, neither did\nhe set his heart to it this time also.","And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to\ndrink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.","And seven days were fully ended, after that the Lord struck the\nriver."]}
