{"verses":["And the people seeing that Moses delayed to come down from the\nmount, gathering together against Aaron, said:  Arise, make us gods,\nthat may go before us:  For as to this Moses, the man that brought us\nout of the land of Egypt, we know not what has befallen him.","And Aaron said to them:  Take the golden earrings from the ears of\nyour wives, and your sons and daughters, and bring them to me.","And the people did what he had commanded, bringing the earrings\nto Aaron.","And when he had received them, he fashioned them by founders'\nwork, and made of them a molten calf.  And they said:  These are thy\ngods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.","And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it, and made\nproclamation by a crier's voice, saying To morrow is the solemnity of\nthe Lord.","And rising in the morning, they offered holocausts, and peace\nvictims, and the people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to\nplay.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:  Go, get thee down:  thy\npeople, which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, hath sinned.","They have quickly strayed from the way which thou didst shew\nthem:  and they have made to themselves a molten calf, and have adored\nit, and sacrificing victims to it, have said:  These are thy gods, O\nIsrael, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.","And again the Lord said to Moses:  I see that this people is\nstiffnecked:","Let me alone, that my wrath may be kindled against them, and\nthat I may destroy them, and I will make of thee a great nation.","But Moses besought the Lord his God, saying:  Why, O Lord, is thy\nindignation enkindled against thy people, whom thou hast brought out of\nthe land of Egypt, with great power, and with a mighty hand?","Let not the Egyptians say, I beseech thee:  He craftily brought\nthem out, that he might kill them in the mountains, and destroy them\nfrom the earth:  let thy anger cease, and be appeased upon the\nwickedness of thy people.","Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou\nsworest by thy own self, saying:  I will multiply your seed as the stars\nof heaven:  and this whole land that I have spoken of, I will give to\nyour seed, and you shall possess it for ever:","And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which he had\nspoken against his people.","And Moses returned from the mount, carrying the two tables of\nthe testimony in his hand, written on both sides,","And made by the work of God; the writing also of God was graven\nin the tables.","And Josue hearing the noise of the people shouting, said to\nMoses:  The noise of battle is heard in the camp.","But he answered:  It is not the cry of men encouraging to fight,\nnor the shout of men compelling to flee:  but I hear the voice of\nsingers.","And when he came nigh to the camp, he saw the calf, and the\ndances:  and being very angry, he threw the tables out of his hand, and\nbroke them at the foot of the mount:","And laying hold of the calf which they had made, he burnt it,\nand beat it to powder, which he strewed into water, and gave thereof to\nthe children of Israel to drink.","And he said to Aaron:  What has this people done to thee, that\nthou shouldst bring upon them a most heinous sin?","And he answered him:  Let not my lord be offended; for thou\nknowest this people, that they are prone to evil.","They said to me:  make us gods, that may go before us; for as to\nthis Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not\nwhat is befallen him.","And I said to them:  Which of you hath any gold?  and they took\nand brought it to me; and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came\nout.","And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had\nstripped them by occasion of the shame of the filth, and had set them\nnaked among their enemies)","Then standing in the gate of the camp, he said:  If any man be on\nthe Lord's side, let him join with me.  And all the sons of Levi\ngathered themselves together unto him:","And he said to them:  Thus saith the Lord God of Israel:  Put\nevery man his sword upon his thigh:  go, and return from gate to gate\nthrough the midst of the camp, and let every man kill his brother, and\nfriend, and neighbour.","And the sons of Levi did according to the words of Moses, and\nthere were slain that day about three and twenty thousand men.","And Moses said:  You have consecrated your hands this day to the\nLord, every man in his son and in his brother, that a blessing may be\ngiven to you.","And when the next day was come, Moses spoke to the people:  You\nhave sinned a very great sin:  I will go up to the Lord, if by any means\nI may be able to entreat him for your crime.","And returning to the Lord, he said:  I beseech thee:  this people\nhath sinned a heinous sin, and they have made to themselves gods of\ngold:  either forgive them this trespass,","Or if thou do not, strike me out of the book that thou hast\nwritten.","And the Lord answered him:  He that hath sinned against me, him\nwill I strike out of my book:","But go thou, and lead this people whither I have told thee:  my\nangel shall go before thee.  And I in the day of revenge will visit this\nsin also of theirs.","The Lord therefore struck the people for the guilt, on occasion\nof the calf which Aaron had made."]}
