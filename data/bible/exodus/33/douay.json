{"verses":["And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:  Go, get thee up from this\nplace, thou and thy people which thou hast brought out of the land of\nEgypt, into the land concerning which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and\nJacob, saying:  To thy seed I will give it:","And I will send an angel before thee, that I may cast out the\nChanaanite, and the Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and\nthe Hevite, and the Jebusite,","That thou mayst enter into the land that floweth with milk and\nhoney.  For I will not go up with thee, because thou art a stiffnecked\npeople; lest I destroy thee in the way.","And the people hearing these very bad tidings, mourned:  and no\nman put on his ornaments according to custom.","And the Lord said to Moses:  Say to the children of Israel:  Thou\nart a stiffnecked people, once I shall come up in the midst of thee,\nand shall destroy thee.  Now presently lay aside thy ornaments, that I\nmay know what to do to thee.","So the children of Israel laid aside their ornaments by Mount\nHoreb.","Moses also taking the tabernacle, pitched it without the camp\nafar off, and called the name thereof, The tabernacle of the covenant.\nAnd all the people, that had any question, went forth to the tabernacle\nof the covenant, without the camp.","And when Moses went forth to the tabernacle, all the people rose\nup, and every one stood in the door of his pavilion, and they beheld\nthe back of Moses, till he went into the tabernacle.","And when he was gone into the tabernacle of the covenant, the\npillar of the cloud came down, and stood at the door, and he spoke with\nMoses.","And all saw that the pillar of the cloud stood at the door of\nthe tabernacle.  And they stood and worshipped at the doors of their\ntent.","And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man is wont to\nspeak to his friend.  And when he returned into the camp, his servant\nJosue, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from the tabernacle.","And Moses said to the Lord:  Thou commandest me to lead forth\nthis people; and thou dost not let me know whom thou wilt send with me,\nespecially whereas thou hast said:  I know thee by name, and thou hast\nfound favour in my sight.","If therefore I have found favour in thy sight, shew me thy face,\nthat I may know thee, and may find grace before thy eyes:  look upon thy\npeople this nation.","And the Lord said:  My face shall go before thee, and I will give\nthee rest.","And Moses said:  If thou thyself dost not go before, bring us not\nout of this place.","For how shall we be able to know, I and thy people, that we have\nfound grace in thy sight, unless thou walk with us, that we may be\nglorified by all people that dwell upon the earth?","And the Lord said to Moses:  This word also, which thou hast\nspoken, will I do; for thou hast found grace before me, and thee I have\nknown by name.","And he said:  Shew me thy glory.","He answered:  I will shew thee all good, and I will proclaim in\nthe name of the Lord before thee:  and I will have mercy on whom I will,\nand I will be merciful to whom it shall please me.","And again he said:  Thou canst not see my face:  for man shall not\nsee me, and live.","And again he said:  Behold there is a place with me, and thou\nshalt stand upon the rock.","And when my glory shall pass, I will set thee in a hole of the\nrock, and protect thee with my righthand till I pass:","And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts:\nbut my face thou canst not see."]}
