The law prohibits the gods of the nations from being named,[fn-8-P832_333603:162-nf] not of course that we are not to pronounce their names, the speaking of which common intercourse extorts from us: for this must very frequently be said, \"You find him in the temple of ¦sculapius; \"and, \"I live in Isis Street; \"and, \"He has been made priest of Jupiter; \"and much else after this manner, since even on men names of this kind are bestowed.

And now that I am about to institute a comparison between virginity and marriage, I beseech my readers not to suppose that in praising virginity I have in the least disparaged marriage, and separated the saints of the Old Testament from those of the New, that is to say, those who had wives and those who altogether refrained from the embraces of women: I rather think that in accordance with the difference in time and circumstance one rule applied to the former, another to us upon whom the ends of the world have come.

I must not linger over Moses when my purpose is at full speed to lightly touch on each topic and to sketch the outline of a proper knowledge of my subject. I will pass to Joshua the son of Nun, who was previously called Ause, or better, as in the Hebrew, Osee, that is, Saviour. For he,[fn-62-P6272_1917721:118-nf] according to the epistle of Jude, saved the people of Israel and led them forth out of Egypt, and brought them into the land of promise. As soon as this Joshua[fn-62-P6273_1918303:119-nf] reached the Jordan, the waters of marriage, which had ever flowed in the land, dried up and stood in one heap; and the whole people, barefooted and on dry ground, crossed over, and came to Gilgal, and there was a second time circumcised. If we take this literally, it cannot possibly stand. For if we had two foreskins, or if another could grow after the first was cut off, there would be room for speaking of a second circumcision. But the meaning is that Joshua circumcised the people who had crossed the desert, with the Gospel knife, and he circumcised them with a stone knife, that what in the case of Moses' son was prefigured in a few might under Joshua be fulfilled in all. Moreover, the very foreskins were heaped together and buried, and covered with earth, and the fact that the reproach of Egypt was taken away, and the name of the place, Gilgal, which is by interpretation[fn-62-P6274_1919208:120-nf] revelation, show that while the people wandered in the desert uncircumcised their eyes were blinded. Let us see what follows. After this Gospel circumcision and the consecration of twelve stones at the place of revelation, the Passover was immediately celebrated, a lamb was slain for them, and they ate the food of the Holy Land. Joshua went forth, and was met by the Prince of the host, sword in hand, that is either to shew that he was ready to fight for the circumcised people, or to sever the tie of marriage. And in the same way that Moses was commanded, so was he:[fn-62-P6275_1919866:121-nf] \"loose thy shoe, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\" For if the armed host of the Lord was represented by the trumpets of the priests, we may see in Jericho a type of the overthrow of the world by the preaching of the Gospel.

This we first assert to have been a figure of the future. For, because Jesus Christ was to introduce the second people (which is composed of us nations, lingering deserted in the world[fn-22-P2287_757601:164-nf] aforetime) into the land of promise, \"flowing with milk and honey\"[fn-22-P2288_757983:165-nf] (that is, into the possession of eternal life, than which nought is sweeter); and this had to come about, not through Moses (that is, not through the Law's discipline), but through Joshua (that is, through the new law's grace), after our circumcision with \"a knife of rock\"[fn-22-P2289_758306:166-nf] (that is, with Christ's precepts, for Christ is in many ways and figures predicted as a rock[fn-22-P2290_758584:167-nf] ); therefore the man who was being prepared to act as images of this sacrament was inaugurated under the figure of the Lord's name, even so as to be named Jesus.[fn-22-P2291_758781:168-nf] For He who ever spake to Moses was the Son of God Himself; who, too, was always seen.[fn-22-P2292_758888:169-nf] For God the Father none ever saw, and lived.[fn-22-P2293_758961:170-nf] And accordingly it is agreed that the Son of God Himself spake to Moses, and said to the people, \"Behold, I send mine angel before thy\"-that is, the people's-\"face, to guard thee on the march, and to introduce thee into the land which I have prepared thee: attend to him, and be not disobedient to him; for he hath not escaped[fn-22-P2294_759360:171-nf] thy notice, since my name is upon him.\"[fn-22-P2295_759553:172-nf] For Joshua was to introduce the people into the land of promise, not Moses. Now He called him an \"angel,\" on account of the magnitude of the mighty deeds which he was to achieve (which mighty deeds Joshua the son of Nun did, and you yourselves read), and on account of his office of prophet announcing (to wit) the divine will; just as withal the Spirit, speaking in the person of the Father, calls the forerunner of Christ, John, a future \"angel,\" through the prophet: \"Behold, I send mine angel before Thy\"-that is, Christ's-\"face, who shall prepare Thy way before Thee.\"[fn-22-P2296_760153:173-nf] Nor is it a novel practice to the Holy Spirit to call those \"angels\" whom God has appointed as ministers of His power. For the same John is called not merely an \"angel\" of Christ, but withal a \"lamp\" shining before Christ: for David predicts, \"I have prepared the lamp for my Christ; \"[fn-22-P2297_760504:174-nf] and him Christ Himself, coming \"to fulfil the prophets,\"[fn-22-P2298_760606:175-nf] called so to the Jews. \"He was,\" He says, \"the burning and shining lamp; \"[fn-22-P2299_760754:176-nf] as being he who not merely \"prepared His ways in the desert,\"[fn-23-P2300_760874:177-nf] but withal, by pointing out \"the Lamb of God,\"[fn-23-P2301_760983:178-nf] illumined the minds of men by his heralding, so that they understood Him to be that Lamb whom Moses was wont to announce as destined to suffer.

For although we, who have by God's grace attained to the understanding of His mysteries, acknowledge that this name also was destined for Christ, yet, for all that, the fact was not known to the Jews, from whom wisdom was taken away. To this day, in short, it is Christ that they are looking for, not Jesus; and they interpret Elias to be Christ rather than Jesus. He, therefore, who came also in a name in which Christ was not expected, might have come only in that name which was solely anticipated for Him.[fn-50-P5036_1586670:222-nf] But since he has mixed up the two,[fn-50-P5037_1586729:223-nf] the expected one and the unexpected, his twofold project is defeated. For if he be Christ for the very purpose of insinuating himself as the Creator's, then Jesus opposes him, because Jesus was not looked for in the Christ of the Creator; or if he be Jesus, in order that he might pass as belonging to the other (God), then Christ hinders him, because Christ was not expected to belong to any other than the Creator.

This, then, we first observe, was a figure of Him who was to come. For inasmuch as Jesus Christ was to introduce a new generation[fn-50-P5040_1587776:226-nf] (because we are born in the wilderness of this world) into the promised land which flows with milk and honey, that is, into the possession of eternal life, than which nothing can be sweeter; inasmuch, too, as this was to be brought about not by Moses, that is to say, not by the discipline of the law, but by Joshua, by the grace of the gospel, our circumcision being effected by a knife of stone, that is, (by the circumcision) of Christ, for Christ is a rock (or stone), therefore that great man,[fn-50-P5041_1588301:227-nf] who was ordained as a type of this mystery, was actually consecrated with the figure of the Lord's own name, being called Joshua. This name Christ Himself even then testified to be His own, when He talked with Moses. For who was it that talked with him, but the Spirit of the Creator, which is Christ? When He therefore spake this commandment to the people, \"Behold, I send my angel before thy face, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the land which I have prepared for thee; attend to him, and obey his voice and do not provoke him; for he has not shunned you,[fn-50-P5042_1588888:228-nf] since my name is upon him,\"[fn-50-P5043_1588973:229-nf] He called him an angel indeed, because of the greatness of the powers which he was to exercise, and because of his prophetic office,[fn-50-P5044_1589132:230-nf] while announcing the will of God; but Joshua also (Jesus), because it was a type[fn-50-P5045_1589239:231-nf] of His own future name. Often[fn-50-P5046_1589289:232-nf] did He confirm that name of His which He had thus conferred upon (His servant); because it was not the name of angel, nor Oshea, but Joshua (Jesus), which He had commanded him to bear as his usual appellation for the time to come.

Let the Jews say what prophet is meant in this promise of God to Moses: \"I will raise up unto them a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee.\" Many prophets appeared after Moses; but one in particular is here pointed out. The Jews will perhaps naturally think of the successor of Moses, who led into the promised land the people that Moses had brought out of Egypt. Having this successor of Moses in his mind, he may perhaps laugh at me for asking to what prophet the words of the promise refer, since it is recorded who followed Moses in ruling and leading the people. When he has laughed at my ignorance, as Faustus supposes him to do, I will still continue my inquiries, and will desire my laughing opponent to give me a serious answer to the question why Moses changed the name of this successor, who was preferred to himself as the leader of the people into the promised land, to show that the law given by Moses not to save, but to convince the sinner, cannot lead us into heaven, but only the grace and truth which are by Jesus Christ. This successor was called Osea, and Moses gave him the name of Jesus. Why . then did he give him this name when he sent him from the valley of Pharan into the land into which he was to lead the people?[fn-17-P1707_953869:33-nf] The true Jesus says, \"If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself.\"[fn-17-P1708_954004:34-nf] I will ask the Jew if the prophet does not show the prophetical meaning of these things when he says, \"God shall come from Africa, and the Holy One from Pharan.\" Does this not mean that the holy God would come with the name of him whocame from Africa by Pharan, that is, with the name of Jesus? Then, again, it is the Word of God Himself who speaks when He promises to provide this successor to Moses, speaking of him as an angel,-a name commonly given in Scripture to those carrying any message. The words are: \"Behold I send my angel before thy face, to preserve thee in the way, and to bring thee into the land which I have sworn to give thee. Take heed unto him, and obey, and beware of unbelief in him; for he will not take anything from thee wrongfully, for my name is in him.\"[fn-17-P1709_954806:35-nf] Consider these words. Let the Jew, not to speak of the Manichaean, say what other angel he can find in Scripture to whom these words apply, but this leader who was to bring the people into the land of promise. Then let him inquire who it was that succeeded Moses, and brought in the people. He will find that it was Jesus, and that this was not his name at first, but after his name was changed. It follows that He who said, \"My name is in him,\" is the true Jesus, the leader who brings His people into the inheritance of eternal life, according to the New Testament, of which the Old was a figure.

Thus, therefore, Christ also-that is, the image of God, and the Son of God-is looked upon by men, inasmuch as He could be seen. And thus the weakness and imperfection of the human destiny is nourished, led up, and educated by Him; so that, being accustomed to look upon the Son, it may one day be able to see God the Father Himself also as He is, that it may not be stricken by His sudden and intolerable brightness, and be hindered from being able to see God the Father, whom it has always desired.[fn-102-P10282_3215614:137-nf] Wherefore it is the Son who is seen; but the Son of God is the Word of God: and the Word of God was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and this is Christ. What in the world is the reason that we should hesitate to call Him God, who in so many ways is acknowledged to be proved God? And if, moreover, the angel meets with Hagar, Sarah's maid, driven from her home as well as turned away, near the fountain of water in the way to Shur; asks and learns the reason of her flight, and after that offers her advice that she should humble herself; and, moreover, gives her the hope of the name of mother, and pledges and promises that from her womb there should be a numerous seed, and that she should have Ishmael to be born from her; and with other things unfolds the place of his habitation, and describes his mode oflife; yet Scripture sets forth this angel as both Lord and God-for He would not have promised the blessing of seed unless the angel had also been God. Let them ask what the heretics can make of this present passage. Was that the Father that was seen by Hagar or not? For He is declared to be God. But far be it from us to call God the Father an angel, lest He should be subordinate to another whose angel He would be. But they will say that it was an angel. How then shall He be God if He was an angel? Since this name is nowhere conceded to angels, except that on either side the truth compels us into this opinion, that we ought to understand it to have been God the Son, who, because He is of God, is rightly called God, because He is the Son of God. But, because He is subjected[fn-102-P10283_3217306:138-nf] to the Father, and the Announcer of the Father's will, He is declared to be the Angel of Great Counsel.[fn-102-P10284_3217548:139-nf] Therefore, although this passage neither is suited to the person of the Father, lest He should be called an angel, nor to the person of an angel, lest he should be called God; yet it is suited to the person of Christ that He should be both God because He is the Son of God, and should be an angel because He is the Announcer of the Father's mind. And the heretics ought to understand that they are setting themselves against the Scriptures, in that, while they say that they believe Christ to have been also an angel, they are unwilling to declare Him to have been also God, when they read in the Old Testament that He often came to visit the human race. To this, moreover, Moses added the instance of God seen of Abraham at the oak of Mature, when he was sitting at the opening of his tent at noon-day. And nevertheless, although he had beheld three men, note that he called one of them Lord; and when he had washed their feet, he offers them bread baked on the ashes, with butter and abundance of milk itself, and urges them that, being detained as guests, they should eat. And after I this he hears also that he should be a father, and learns that Sarah his wife should bring forth a son by him; and acknowledges concerning the destruction of the people of Sodom, what they deserve to suffer; and learns that God had come down on account of the cry of Sodom. in which place, if they will have it that the Father was seen at that time to have been received with hospitality in company with two angels, the heretics have believed the Father to be visible. But if an angel, although of the three angels one is called Lord, why, although it is not usual, is an angel called God? Unless because, in order that His proper invisibility may be restored to the Father, and the proper inferiority[fn-102-P10285_3219497:140-nf] be remitted to the angel, it was only God the Son, who also is God, who was seen by Abraham, and was believed to have been received with hospitality. For He anticipated sacramentally what He was hereafter to become. He was made a guest of Abraham, being about to be among the sons of Abraham. And his children's feet, by way of proving what He was, He washed; returning in the children the claim of hospitality which formerly the Father had put out to interest to Him. Whence also, that there might be no doubt but that it was He who was the guest of Abraham on the destruction of the people of Sodom, it is declared: \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrha fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven.\"[fn-102-P10286_3220353:141-nf] For thus also said the prophet in the person of God: \"I have overthrown you, as the Lord overturned Sodom and Gomorrha.\"[fn-102-P10287_3220496:142-nf] Therefore the Lord overturned Sodom, that is, God overturned Sodom; but in the overturning of Sodom, the Lord rained fire from the Lord. And this Lord was the God seen by Abraham; and this God was the guest of Abraham, certainly seen because He was also touched. But although the Father, being invisible, was assuredly not at that time seen, He who was accustomed to be touched and seen was seen and received to hospitality. But this the Son of God, \"The Lord rained from the Lord upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire.\" And this is the Word of God. And the Word of God was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and this is Christ. It was not the Father, then, who was a guest with Abraham, but Christ. Nor was it the Father who was seen then, but the Son; and Christ was seen. Rightly, therefore, Christ is both Lord and God, who was not otherwise seen by Abraham, except that as God the Word He was begotten of God the Father before Abraham himself. Moreover, says the Scripture, the same Angel and God visits and consoles the same Hagar when driven with her son from the dwelling of Abraham. For when in the desert she had exposed the infant, because the water had fallen short from the pitcher; and when the lad had cried out, and she had lifted up her weeping and lamentation, \"God heard,\" says the Scripture, \"the voice of the lad from the place where he was.\"[fn-102-P10288_3221883:143-nf] Having told that it was God who heard the voice of the infant, it adds: \"And the angel of the Lord called Hagar herself out of heaven,\" saying that that was an angel[fn-102-P10289_3222076:144-nf] whom it had called God, and pronouncing Him to be Lord whom it had set forth as an angel; which Angel and God moreover promises to Hagar herself greater consolations, in saying, \"Fear not; for I have heard the voice of the lad from the place where he was. Arise, take up the lad, and hold him; for I will make of him a great nation.\"[fn-102-P10290_3222446:145-nf] Why does this angel, if angel only, claim to himself this right of saying, I will make of him a great nation, since assuredly this kind of power belongs to God, and cannot belong to an angel? Whence also He is confirmed to be God, since He is able to do this; because, by way of proving this very point, it is immediately added by the Scripture: \"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of running water; and she went and filled the bottle from the well, and gave to the lad: and God was with the lad.\"[fn-102-P10291_3222975:146-nf] If, then, this God was with the Lord, who opened the eyes of Hagar that she might see the well of running water, and might draw the water on account of the urgent need of the lad's thirst, and this God who calls her from heaven is called an angel when, in previously hearing the voice of the lad crying, He was rather God; is not understood to be other than angel, in like manner as He was God also. And since this cannot be applicable or fitting to the Father, who is God only, but may be applicable to Christ, who is declared to be not only God, but angel also,[fn-102-P10292_3223561:147-nf] it manifestly appears that it was not the Father who thus spoke to Hagar, but rather Christ, since He is God; and to Him also is applied the name of angel, since He became the \"angel of great counsel.\"[fn-102-P10293_3223792:148-nf] And He is the angel, in that He declares the bosom of the Father, as John sets forth. For if John himself says, that He Himself who sets forth the bosom of the Father, as the Word, became flesh in order to declare the bosom of the Father, assuredly Christ is not only man, but angel also; and not only angel, but He is shown by the Scriptures to be God also. And this is believed to be the case by us; so that, if we will not consent to apprehend that it was Christ who then spoke to Hagar, we must either make an angel God, or we must reckon God the Father Almighty among the angels.[fn-102-P10294_3224402:149-nf] ","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":23,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And lest this should occur to the injury of human eyes, the darkness is broken up and scattered by degrees; and the rising of that luminary, mounting by small and unperceived increments, gently accustoms men's eyes to bear its full orb by the gentle increase of its rays.

And this is believed to be the case by us; so that, if we will not consent to apprehend that it was Christ who then spoke to Hagar, we must either make an angel God, or we must reckon God the Father Almighty among the angels.[fn-102-P10294_3224402:149-nf] ","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":23,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_54_book_iii_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"ANF-02","text":"But those who impose on the women, spend the day with them, telling them silly amatory stories, and wearing out body and soul with their false acts and words. \"Thou shalt not be with many,\" it is said, \"for evil, nor give thyself to a multitude; \"[fn-43-P4341_1340590:44-nf] for wisdom shows itself among few, but disorder in a multitude.

Wherefore also to Peter Christ saith, \"If thou lovest Me, feed My sheep.\" (John xxi. 16.) For he who loveth Christ loveth also His flock. And Moses too did He then set over the people of the Jews, when he had shown a kindly feeling towards them. And David in this way came to be king, having been first seen to be affectionately-minded towards them; so much indeed, though yet young, did he grieve for the people, as to risk his life for them, when he killed that barbarian. But if he said, \"What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine?\" (1 Sam. xix. 5; ib. xvii. 26) he said it not in order to demand a reward, but out of a wish to have confidence placed in himself, and to have the battle with him delivered to his charge. And therefore, when he came to the king after the victory, he said nothing of these things. And Samuel too was very affectionate; whence it was that he said, \"But God forbid that I should sin in ceasing to pray unto the Lord for you.\" (1 Sam. xii. 23.) In like way Paul also, or rather not in like way, but even in a far greater degree, burned towards all his subjects twn arxomenwn). Wherefore he made his disciples of such affection towards himself, that he said, \"If were possible, ye would have pulled out your eyes and given them to me.\" (Gal. iv. 15.) On this ground too it is, that God charges the teachers of the Jews above all things with this, saying, \"Oh shepherds of Israel, do shepherds feed themselves? do they not feed the flock?\" (Ezek. xxxiv. 2, 3.) But they did the reverse. For he says, \"Ye eat the milk, and clothe you with the wool, and ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the flock.\" And Christ, in bringing out the rule for the fittest Pastor, said, \"The good shepherd layeth down his life for his sheep.\" (John x. 11.) This David did also, both on sundry other occasions, and also when that fearful wrath from above came down upon the whole people. For while all were being slain he said, \"I the shepherd[fn-33-P3313_3061578:7-nf] have sinned, I the shepherd have done amiss, and these the flock what have they done?\" (2 Sam. xxiv. 17.) And so in the choice of those punishments also, he chose not famine, nor flight before enemies, but the pestilence sent by God, whereby he hoped to place all the others in safety, but that he should himself in preference to all the rest be carried off. But since this was not so, he bewails, and says, \"On me be Thy Hand:\" or if this be not enough, \"on my father's house\" also. \"For I,\" he says, \"the shepherd have sinned.\" As though he had said, that if they also sinned, I was the person who should suffer the vengeance, as I corrected them not. But since the sin is mine also, it is I who deserve to suffer the vengeance. For wishing to increase the crime he used the name of \"Shepherd.\" Thus then he stayed the wrath, thus he got the sentence revoked! So great is the power of confession. \"For the righteous is his own accuser first.[fn-33-P3314_3062599:8-nf] So great is the concern and sympathy of a good Pastor. For his bowels were writhed at their falling, as when one's own children are killed. And on this ground he begged that the wrath might come upon himself. And in the beginning of the slaughter he would have done this, unless he had seen it advancing and expected that it would come to himself. When therefore he saw that this did not happen, but that the calamity was raging among them, he no longer forebore, but was touched more than for Amnon his first-born. For then he did not ask for death, but now he begs to fall in preference to the others. Such ought a ruler to be and to grieve rather at the calamities of others than his own.[fn-33-P3315_3063454:9-nf] Some such thing he suffered in his son's case likewise, that you might see that he did not love his son more than his subjects, and yet the youth was unchaste, and an ill-user of his father (patraloiaj), and still he said, \"Would that I might have died for thee!\" (2 Sam. xviii. 33.) What sayest thou, thou blessed one, thou meekest of all men? Thy son was set upon killing thee, and compassed thee about with ills unnumbered. And when he had been removed, and the trophy was raised. dost thou then pray to be slain? Yea, he says, for it is not for me that the army has been victorious, but I am warred against more violently than before, and my bowels are now more torn than before. These however were all thoughtful for those committed to their charge, butthe blessed Abraham concerned himself much even for those that were not entrusted to him, and so much so as even to throw himself amongst alarming dangers. For when he did what he did, not for his nephew only, but for the people of Sodom also, he did not leave driving those Persians before him until he had set them all free: and yet he might have departed after he had taken him, yet he did not choose it. For he had the like concern for all, and this he showed likewise by his subsequent conduct. When then it was not a host of barbarians that was on the point of laying siege to them, but the wrath of God that was plucking their cities up from the foundations, and it was no longer the time for arms, and battle, and array, but for supplication; so great was the zeal he showed for them, as, if he himself had been on the point of perishing. For this reason he comes once, twice, thrice, aye and many times to God, and finds a refuge (i. e. an excuse) in his nature by saying, \"I am dust and ashes\" (Gen. xviii. 27): and since he saw that they were traitors to themselves, he begs that they may be saved for others. Wherefore also God said, \"I will hide not from Abraham My servant that thing which I am about to do\" (ib. 17), that we might learn how loving to man the righteous is. And he would not have left off beseeching, unless God had left off first (so he takes v. 33). And he seems indeed to be praying for the just, but is doing the whole for them. For the souls of the Saints are very gentle and, loving unto man, both in regard to their own, and to strangers. And even to the unreasoning creatures they extend their gentleness. Wherefore also a certain wise man said, \"The righteous pitieth the souls of his cattle.\"[fn-33-P3316_3066086:10-nf] But if he doth those of cattle, how much more those of men. But since I have mentioned cattle, let us just consider the shepherds of the sheep who are in the Cappadocian land, and what they suffer inkind and degree in their guardianship of unreasoning creatures. They often stay for three days together buried down under the snows. And those in Libya are said to undergo no less hardships than these, ranging about for whole months through that wilderness, dreary as it is, and filled with the direst wild beasts (qhria may include serpents). Now if for unreasonable things there be so much zeal, what defense are we to set up, who are entrusted with reasonable souls, and yet slumber on in this deep sleep? For is it right to be at rest, and in quiet, and not to be running about everywhere, and giving one's self up to endless deaths in behalf of these sheep? Or know ye not the dignity of this flock Was it not for this that thy Master took endless pains, and afterwards poured forth His blood? And dost thou seek for rest? Now what can be worse than these Shepherds? Dost thou not perceive, that there stand round about these sheep wolves much more fierce and savage than those of this world? Dost thou not think with thyself, what a soul he ought to have who is to take in hand this office? Now men that lead the populace, if they have but common matters to deliberate on, add days to nights in watching. And we that are struggling in heaven's behalf sleep even in the daytime. And who is now to deliver us from the punishment for these things? For if the body were to be cut in pieces, if to undergo ten thousand deaths, ought one not to run to it as to a feast? And let not the shepherds only, but the sheep also hear this; that they may make the shepherds the more active minded, that they may the more encourage their good-will: I do not mean by anything else but by yielding all compliance and obedience. Thus Paul also bade them, saying, \"Obey them which have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls as they that must give account.\" (Heb. xiii. 17.) And when he says, \"watch,\" he means thousands of labors, cares and dangers. For the good Shepherd, who is such as Christ wisheth for, is contending, before countless witnesses. For He died once for him; but this man ten thousand times for the flock, if, that is, he be such a shepherd as he ought to be; for such an one can die every day. (See on Rom. viii. 36. p. 456.) And therefore do ye, as being acquainted with what the labor is, coöperate with them, with prayers, with zeal, with readiness, with affection, that both we may have to boast of you, and you of us. For on this ground He entrusted this to the chief[fn-33-P3317_3068888:11-nf] of the Apostles, who also loved Him more than the rest; after first asking him if He was loved by him, that thou mayest learn that this before other things, is held as a proof of love to Him. For this requireth a vigorous soul. This I have said of the best shepherds; not of myself and those of our days, but of any one that may be such as Paul was, such as Peter, such as Moses. These then let us imitate, both the rulers of us and the ruled. For the ruled may be in the place of a shepherd to his family, to his friends, to his servants, to his wife, to his children: and if we so order our affairs we shall attain to all manner of good things. Which God grant that we may all attain unto, by the grace and love toward man, etc.","title":"Homily XXIX.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":23,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_72_letter_i_for_329_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"2. And, on this account, the blessed Paul, urging us to note this season, wrote, saying, `Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation[fn-88-P8802_3235588:9-nf] .' At set seasons also He called the children of Israel to the Levitical feasts by Moses, saying, `Three times in a year ye shall keep a feast to Me[fn-88-P8803_3235755:10-nf] ' (one of which, my beloved, is that now at hand), the trumpets of the priests sounding and urging its observance; as the holy Psalmist commanded, saying, `Blow with the trumpet in the new moon, on the [solemn] day of your feast[fn-88-P8804_3236006:11-nf] .' Since this sentence enjoins upon us to blow both on the new moons, and on the solemn[fn-88-P8805_3236127:12-nf] days, He hath made a solemn day of that in which the light of the moon is perfected in the full; which was then a type, as is this of the trumpets. At one time, as has been said, they called to the feasts; at another time to fasting and to war. And this was not done without solemnity, nor by chance, but this sound of the trumpets was appointed, so that every man should come to that which was proclaimed. And this ought to be learned not merely from me, but from the divine Scriptures, when God was revealed to Moses, and said, as it is written in the book of Numbers; `And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Make to thee two trumpets; of silver shalt thou make them, and they shall be for thee to call the congregation[fn-88-P8806_3236884:13-nf] ;'-very properly for those who here love Him. So that we may know that these things had reference to the time of Moses-yea, were to be observed so long as the shadow lasted, the whole being appointed for use, `till the time of reformation[fn-88-P8807_3237150:14-nf] .' `For' (said He) `if ye shall go out to battle in your land against your enemies that rise up against you[fn-88-P8808_3237276:15-nf] ' (for such things as these refer to the land, and no further), `then ye shall proclaim with the trumpets, and shall be remembered before the Lord, and be delivered from your enemies.' Not only in wars did they blow the trumpet, but under the law, there was a festal trumpet also. Hear him again, going on to say, `And in the day of your gladness, and in your feasts, and your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets[fn-88-P8809_3237713:16-nf] .' And let no man think it a light and contemptible matter, if he hear the law command respecting trumpets; it is a wonderful and fearful thing. For beyond any other voice or instrument, the trumpet is awakening and terrible; so Israel received instruction by these means, because he was then but a child. But in order that the proclamation should not be thought merely human, being superhuman, its sounds resembled those which were uttered when they trembled before the mount[fn-88-P8810_3238206:17-nf] ; and they were reminded of the law that was then given them, and kept it.","title":"Letter I.

If the number of those who judged concerning them last year be reckoned with the presbyters and deacons, then there were more present to the judgment and hearing than are those very same persons who now seem to be associated with Fortunatus. For you ought to know, dearest brother, that after he was made a pseudo-bishop by the heretics, he was at once deserted by almost all. For those to whom in past time delusions were offered, and deceitful words were given, to the effect that they were to return to the Church together; after they saw that a false bishop was made there, learned that they had been fooled and deceived, and are daily returning and knocking at the door of the Church; while we, meanwhile, by whom account is to be given to the Lord, are anxiously weighing and carefully examining who ought to be received and admitted into the Church. For some are either hindered by their crimes to such a degree, or they are so obstinately and firmly opposed by their brethren, that they cannot be received at all except with offence and risk to a great many, For neither must some putridities be so collected and brought together, that the parts which are sound and whole should be injured; nor is that pastor serviceable or wise who so mingles the diseased and affected sheep with his flock as to contaminate the whole flock with the infection of the clinging evil. (Do not pay attention to their number.[fn-57-P5769_1794324:56-nf] For one who fears God is better than a thousand impious sons, as the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying, \"O son, do not delight in ungodly sons, though they multiply to thee, except the fear of the Lord be with them.\"[fn-57-P5770_1794785:57-nf] ) Oh, if you could, dearest brother, be with us here when those evil and perverse men return from schism, you would see what labour is mine to persuade patience to our brethren, that they should calm their grief of mind, and consent to receive and heal the wicked. For as they rejoice and are glad when those who are endurable and less guilty return, so, on the other hand, they murmur and are dissatisfied as often as the incorrigible and violent, and those who are contaminated either by adulteries or by sacrifices, and who, in addition to this, are proud besides, so return to the Church, as to corrupt the good dispositions within it. Scarcely do I persuade the people; nay, I extort it from them, that they should suffer such to be admitted. And the grief of the fraternity is made the more just, from the fact that one and another who, notwithstanding the opposition and contradiction of the people, have been received by my facility, have proved worse than they had been before, and have not been able to keep the faith of their repentance, because they had not come with true repentance.","title":"Epistle LIV.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":23,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_77_part_i_the_acts_of_pilate","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"111","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Annas says: Take them away from one another, and let us see whether their account agrees.
