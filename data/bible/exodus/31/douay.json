And I have put wisdom in the heart of\nevery skilful man, that they may make all things which I have commanded\nthee,","The tabernacle of the covenant, and the ark of the testimony, and\nthe propitiatory, that is over it, and all the vessels of the\ntabernacle,","And the table and the vessels thereof, the most pure candlestick\nwith the vessels thereof, and the altars of incense,","And of holocaust, and all their vessels, the laver with its foot,","The holy vestments in the ministry for Aaron the priest, and for\nhis sons, that they may execute their office, about the sacred things:","The oil of unction, and the incense of spices in the sanctuary,\nall things which I have commanded thee, shall they make.","And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:","Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:  See\nthat you keep my sabbath; because it is a sign between me and you in\nyour generations that you may know that I am the Lord, who sanctify\nyou.","keep you my sabbath:  for it is holy unto you:  he that shall\nprofane it, shall be put to death:  he that shall do any work in it, his\nsoul shall perish out of the midst of his people.","Six days shall you do work:  in the seventh day is the sabbath,\nthe rest holy to the Lord.  Every one that shall do any work on this\nday, shall die.","Let the children of Israel keep the sabbath, and celebrate it in\ntheir generations.
