{"verses":["These are the names of the children of Israel, that went into\nEgypt with Jacob:  they went in every man with his household:","Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Juda,","Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin,","Dan, and Nephthali, Gad and Aser.","And all the souls that came out of Jacob's thigh, were seventy:\nbut Joseph was in Egypt.","After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation,","The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes,\nand growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.","In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not\nJoseph:","And he said to his people:  Behold the people of the children of\nIsrael are numerous and stronger than we.","Come let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply:  and if any\nwar shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome\nus, depart out of the land.","Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them\nwith burdens:  and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom,\nand Ramesses.","But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied\nand increased.","And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and afflicted\nthem and mocked them:","And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay and\nbrick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they were overcharged\nin the works of the earth.","And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews:  of\nwhom one was called Sephora, the other Phua,","Commanding them:  When you shall do the office of midwives to the\nHebrew women, and the time of delivery is come:  if it be a man child,\nkill it:  if a woman, keep it alive.","But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt\nhad commanded, but saved the men children.","They answered:  The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women:\nfor they themselves are skilful in the office of a midwife; and they\nare delivered before we come to them.","Therefore God dealt well with the midwives:  and the people\nmultiplied and grew exceedingly strong.","And because the midwives feared God, he built them houses.","Pharao therefore charged all his people, saying:  Whatsoever shall\nbe born of the male sex, ye shall cast into the river:  whatsoever of\nthe female, ye shall save alive."]}
