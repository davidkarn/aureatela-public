I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.","And they said:  The God of the Hebrews hath called us, to go three\ndays' journey into the wilderness, and to sacrifice to the Lord our\nGod; lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon us.","The king of Egypt said to them:  Why do you Moses and Aaron draw\noff the people from their works?  Get you gone to your burdens.","And Pharao said:  The people of the land are numerous; you see that\nthe multitude is increased; how much more if you give them rest from\ntheir works?","Therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of the works,\nand the task-masters of the people, saying:","You shall give straw no more to the people to make brick, as\nbefore; but let them go and gather straw.","And you shall lay upon them the task of bricks, which they did\nbefore; neither shall you diminish any thing thereof, for they are\nidle, and therefore they cry.  saying:  Let us go and sacrifice to our\nGod.","Let them be oppressed with works, and let them fulfil them; that\nthey may not regard lying words.","And the overseers of the works, and the taskmasters, went out and\nsaid to the people:  Thus saith Pharao:  I allow you no straw;","Go, and gather it where you can find it; neither shall any thing\nof your work be diminished.","And the people was scattered through all the land of Egypt to\ngather straw.","And the overseers of the works pressed them, saying:  Fulfil your\nwork every day, as before ye were wont to do, when straw was given you.","And they that were over the works of the children of Israel, were\nscourged by Pharao's taskmasters, saying:  Why have you not made up the\ntask of bricks, both yesterday and to day, as before?","And the officers of the children of Israel came, and cried out to\nPharao, saying:  Why dealest thou so with thy servants?","Straw is not given us, and bricks are required of us as before;\nbehold we, thy servants, are beaten with whips, and thy people is\nunjustly dealt withal.","And he said:  You are idle, and therefore you say:  Let us go and\nsacrifice to the Lord.","And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in\nevil case, because it was said to them:  There shall not a whit be\ndiminished of the bricks for every day.","And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood over against them as they\ncame out from Pharao:","And they said to them:  The Lord see and judge, because you have,\nmade our savour to stink before Pharao and his servants, and you have\ngiven him a sword, to kill us.","And Moses returned to the Lord, and said:  Lord, why hast thou\nafflicted this people?  wherefore hast thou sent me?","For since the time that I went in to Pharao to speak in thy name,\nhe hath afflicted thy people:  and thou hast not delivered them."]}
