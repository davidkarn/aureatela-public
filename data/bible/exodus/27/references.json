Some mothers when they have vowed a daughter to virginity clothe her in sombre garments, wrap her up in a dark cloak, and let her have neither linen nor gold ornaments. They wisely refuse to accustom her to what she will afterwards have to lay aside. Others act on the opposite principle. \"What is the use,\" say they, \"of keeping such things from her? Will she not see them with others? Women are fond of finery and many whose chastity is beyond question dress not for men but for themselves Give her what she asks for, but shew her that those are most praised who ask for nothing. It is better that she should enjoy things to the full and so learn to despise them than that from not having them she should wish to have them.\" \"This,\" they continue, \"was the plan which the Lord adopted with the children of Israel. When they longed for the fleshpots of Egypt He sent them flights of quails and allowed them to gorge themselves until they were sick.[fn-50-P5029_1383060:3585-nf] Those who have once lived worldly lives more readily forego the pleasures of sense than such as from their youth up have known nothing of desire.\" For while the former-so they argue-trample on what they know, the latter are attracted by what is to them unknown. While the former penitently shun the insidious advances which pleasure makes, the latter coquet with the allurements of sense and fancying them to be as sweet as honey find them to be deadly poison. They quote the passage which says that \"the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb;\"[fn-50-P5030_1383662:3586-nf] which is sweet indeed in the eater's mouth but is afterwards found more bitter than gall.[fn-50-P5031_1383773:3587-nf] This they argue, is the reason that neither honey nor wax is offered in the sacrifices of the Lord,[fn-50-P5032_1383905:3588-nf] and that oil the product of the bitter olive is burned in His temple.[fn-50-P5033_1383997:3589-nf] Moreover it is with bitter herbs that the passover is eaten,[fn-50-P5034_1384082:3590-nf] and \"with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.\"[fn-50-P5035_1384159:3591-nf] He that receives these shall suffer persecution in the world. Wherefore the prophet symbolically sings: \"I sat alone because I was filled with bitterness.\"[fn-50-P5036_1384337:3592-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":27,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_30_5_five_books_in_reply_to_marcion_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1324","folder":"ANF-04","text":"215 Thereto; that, with peace[fn-49-P4935_769734:265-nf] granted, flesh might bloom","title":"5.
