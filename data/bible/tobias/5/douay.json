{"verses":["Then Tobias answered his father, and said:  I will do all things,\nfather, which thou hast commanded me.","But how I shall get this money, I cannot tell; he knoweth not me,\nand I know not him:  what token shall I give him?  nor did I ever know\nthe way which leadeth thither.","Then his father answered him, and said:  I have a note of his hand\nwith me, which when thou shalt shew him, he will presently pay it.","But go now, and seek thee out some faithful man, to go with thee\nfor his hire:  that thou mayst receive it, while I yet live.","Then Tobias going forth, found a beautiful young man, standing\ngirded, and as it were ready to walk.","And not knowing that he was an angel of God, he saluted him, and\nsaid:  From whence art thou, good young man?","But he answered:  Of the children of Israel.  And Tobias said to\nhim:  Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the country of the Medes?","And he answered:  I know it:  and I have often walked through all\nthe ways thereof, and I have abode with Gabelus our brother, who\ndwelleth at Rages a city of the Medes, which is situate in the mount of\nEcbatana.","And Tobias said to him:  Stay for me, I beseech thee, till I tell\nthese same things to my father.","Then Tobias going in told all these things to his father.  Upon\nwhich his father being in admiration, desired that he would come in\nunto him.","So going in he saluted him, and said:  Joy be to thee always.","And Tobias said:  What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in\ndarkness and see not the light of heaven?","And the young man said to him:  Be of good courage, thy cure from\nGod is at hand.","And Tobias said to him:  Canst thou conduct my son to Gabelus at\nRages, a city of the Medes?  and when thou shalt return, I will pay thee\nthy hire.","And the angel said to him:  I will conduct him thither, and bring\nhim back to thee.","And Tobias said to him:  I pray thee, tell me, of what family, or\nwhat tribe art thou?","And Raphael the angel answered:  Dost thou seek the family of him\nthou hirest, or the hired servant himself to go with thy son?","But lest I should make thee uneasy, I am Azarias the son of the\ngreat Ananias.","And Tobias answered:  Thou art of a great family.  But I pray thee\nbe not angry that I desired to know thy family.","And the angel said to him:  I will lead thy son safe, and bring\nhim to thee again safe.","And Tobias answering, said:  May you have a good journey, and God\nbe with you in your way, and his angel accompany you.","Then all things being ready, that were to be carried in their\njourney, Tobias bade his father and his mother farewell, and they set\nout both together.","And when they were departed, his mother began to weep, and to\nsay:  Thou hast taken the staff of our old age, and sent him away from\nus.","I wish the money for which thou hast sent him, had never been.","For our poverty was sufficient for us, that we might account it\nas riches, that we saw our son.","And Tobias said to her:  Weep not, our son will arrive thither\nsafe, and will return safe to us, and thy eyes shall see him.","For I believe that the good angel of God doth accompany him, and\ndoth order all things well that are done about him, so that he shall\nreturn to us with joy.","At these words his mother ceased weeping, and held her peace."]}
