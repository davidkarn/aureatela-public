{"verses":["Thou shalt not sacrifice to the Lord thy God a sheep, or an ox,\nwherein there is blemish, or any fault:  for that is an abomination to\nthe Lord thy God.","When there shall be found among you within any of thy gates,\nwhich the Lord thy God shall give thee, man or woman that do evil in\nthe sight of the Lord thy God, and transgress his covenant,","So as to go and serve strange gods, and adore them, the sun and\nthe moon, and all the host of heaven, which I have not commanded:","And this is told thee, and hearing it thou hast inquired\ndiligently, and found it to be true, and that the abomination is\ncommitted in Israel:","Thou shalt bring forth the man or the woman, who have committed\nthat most wicked thing, to the gates of thy city, and they shall be\nstoned.","By the mouth of two or three witnesses shall he die that is to be\nslain.  Let no man be put to death, when only one beareth witness\nagainst him.","The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him,\nand afterwards the hands of the rest of the people:  that thou mayst\ntake away the evil out of the midst of thee.","If thou perceive that there be among you a hard and doubtful\nmatter in judgment between blood and blood, cause and cause, leprosy\nand leprosy:  and thou see that the words of the judges within thy gates\ndo vary:  arise, and go up to the place, which the Lord thy God shall\nchoose.","And thou shalt come to the priests of the Levitical race, and to\nthe judge, that shall be at that time:  and thou shalt ask of them, and\nthey shall shew thee the truth of the judgment.","And thou shalt do whatsoever they shall say, that preside in the\nplace, which the Lord shall choose, and what they shall teach thee,","According to his law; and thou shalt follow their sentence:\nneither shalt thou decline to the right hand nor to the left hand.","But he that will be proud, and refuse to obey the commandment of\nthe priest, who ministereth at that time to the Lord thy God, and the\ndecree of the judge, that man shall die, and thou shalt take away the\nevil from Israel:","And all the people hearing it shall fear, that no one afterwards\nswell with pride.","When thou art come into the land, which the Lord thy God will\ngive thee, and possessest it, and shalt say:  I will set a king over me,\nas all nations have that are round about:","Thou shalt set him whom the Lord thy God shall choose out of the\nnumber of thy brethren.
