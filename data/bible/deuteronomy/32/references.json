The law prohibits the gods of the nations from being named,[fn-8-P832_333603:162-nf] not of course that we are not to pronounce their names, the speaking of which common intercourse extorts from us: for this must very frequently be said, \"You find him in the temple of Â¦sculapius; \"and, \"I live in Isis Street; \"and, \"He has been made priest of Jupiter; \"and much else after this manner, since even on men names of this kind are bestowed.

But it says, \"Make not mention of the name of other gods, neither be it heard from thy mouth.\"[fn-8-P833_334295:163-nf] The precept it gives is this, that we do not call them gods.

I do not adduce these instances because I have anything in me from which you either can or will learn a lesson, but to show you that your zeal and eagerness to learn-even though you cannot rely on help from me-are in themselves worthy of praise. A mind willing to learn deserves commendation even when it has no teacher. What is of importance to me is not what you find but what you seek to find. Wax is soft and easy to mould even where the hands of craftsman and modeller are wanting to work it. It is already potentially all that it can be made. The apostle Paul learned the Law of Moses and the prophets at the feet of Gamaliel and was glad that he had done so, for armed with this spiritual armour, he was able to say boldly \"the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds;\" armed with these we war \"casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; and being in a readiness to revenge all disobedience.\"[fn-20-P2014_502088:1412-nf] He writes to Timothy who had been trained in the holy writings from a child exhorting him to study them diligently[fn-20-P2015_502227:1413-nf] and not to neglect the gift which was given him with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.[fn-20-P2016_502367:1414-nf] To Titus he gives commandment that among a bishop's other virtues (which he briefly describes) he should be careful to seek a knowledge of the scriptures: A bishop, he says, must hold fast \"the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.\"[fn-20-P2017_502708:1415-nf] In fact want of education in a clergyman[fn-20-P2018_502769:1416-nf] prevents him from doing good to any one but himself and much as the virtue of his life may build up Christ's church, he does it an injury as great by failing to resist those who are trying to pull it down. The prophet Haggai says-or rather the Lord says it by the mouth of Haggai-\"Ask now the priests concerning the law.\"[fn-20-P2019_503119:1417-nf] For such is the important function of the priesthood to give answers to those who question them concerning the law. And in Deuteronomy we read \"Ask thy father and he will shew thee; thy elders and they will tell thee.\"[fn-20-P2020_503360:1418-nf] Also in the one hundred and nineteenth psalm \"thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.\" David too, in the description of the righteous man whom he compares to the tree of life in paradise, amongst his other excellences speaks of this, \"His delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.\"[fn-20-P2021_503730:1419-nf] In the close of his most solemn vision Daniel declares that \"the righteous shall shine as the stars; and the wise, that is the learned, as the firmament.\"[fn-20-P2022_503904:1420-nf] You can see, therefore, how great is the difference between righteous ignorance and instructed righteousness. Those who have the first are compared with the stars, those who have the second with the heavens. Yet, according to the exact sense of the Hebrew, both statements may be understood of the learned, for it is to be read in this way:-\"They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.\" Why is the apostle Paul called a chosen vessel?[fn-20-P2023_504456:1421-nf] Assuredly because he is a repertory of the Law and of the holy scriptures. The learned teaching of our Lord strikes the Pharisees dumb with amazement, and they are filled with astonishment to find that Peter and John know the Law although they have not learned letters. For to these the Holy Ghost immediately suggested what comes to others by daily study and meditation; and, as it is written,[fn-20-P2024_504873:1422-nf] they were \"taught of God.\" The Saviour had only accomplished his twelfth year when the scene in the temple took place;[fn-20-P2025_505017:1423-nf] but when he interrogated the elders concerning the Law His wise questions conveyed rather than sought information.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":32,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_10_book_ii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"4.

When the latter had obtained an evident advantage over his rival, Fritigernes had recourse to the Romans, and implored their assistance against his adversary. This was reported to the Emperor Valens, and he ordered the troops which were garrisoned in Thrace to assist those barbarians who had appealed to him against their more powerful countrymen; and by means of this subsidy they won a complete victory over Athanaric beyond the Danube, totally routing the enemy. This became the occasion for the conversion of many of the barbarians to the Christian religion:[fn-14-P1484_651328:102-nf] for Fritigernes, to express his sense of the obligation the emperor had conferred upon him, embraced the religion of his benefactor, and urged those who were under his authority to do the same.

Ulfilas, their bishop at that time, invented the Gothic letters,[fn-14-P1485_651919:103-nf] and translating the Sacred Scriptures into their own language, undertook to instruct these barbarians in the Divine oracles. And as Ulfilas did not re strict his labors to the subjects of Fritigernes, but extended them to those who acknowledged the sway of Athanaric also, Athanaric regarding this as a violation of the privileges of the religion of his ancestors, subjected those who professed Christianity to severe punishments; so that many of the Arian Goths of that period became martyrs.

We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated.

Whence the apostle withal judges, and that in a case of fornication,[fn-13-P1328_361909:41-nf] that \"such a man must be surrendered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh; \"[fn-13-P1329_362041:42-nf] chiding them likewise because \"brethren\" were not \"judged at the bar of the saints: \"[fn-13-P1330_362145:43-nf] for he goes on and says, \"To what (purpose is it) for me to judge those who are without? \"\"But you remit, in order that remission may be granted you by God.\" The sins which are (thus) cleansed are such as a man may have committed against his brother, not against God. We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

Moses for forty days and forty nights fasted on Mount Sinai, and showed even then that man does not live on bread alone, but on every word of God. He says to the Lord, \"the people is full and maketh idols.\" Moses with empty stomach received the law written with the finger of God. The people that ate and drank and rose up to play fashioned a golden calf, and preferred an Egyptian ox to the majesty of the Lord. The toil of so many days perished through the fulness of a single hour. Moses boldly broke the tables: for he knew that drunkards cannot hear the word of God.[fn-67-P6742_2130843:133-nf] \"The beloved grew thick, waxed fat, and became sleek: he kicked and forsook the Lord which made him, and departed from the God of his salvation.\" Hence also it is enjoined in the same Book of Deuteronomy:[fn-67-P6743_2131154:134-nf] \"Beware, lest when thou hast eaten and drunk, and hast built goodly houses, and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and gold is multiplied, then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.\" In short the people ate and their heart grew thick, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart: so the people well fed and fat-fleshed could not bear the countenance of Moses who fasted, for, to correctly render the Hebrew, it was[fn-67-P6744_2131689:135-nf] furnished with horns through his converse with God. And it was not, as some think, to show that there is no difference between virginity and marriage, but to assert his sympathy with severe fasting, that our Lord and Saviour when he was transfigured on the Mount revealed Moses and Elias with Himself in glory. Although Moses and Elias were properly types of the Law and the Prophets, as is clearly witnessed by the Gospel:[fn-67-P6745_2132373:136-nf] \"They spake of his departure which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.\" For the passion of our Lord is declared not by virginity or marriage, but by the Law and the Prophets. If, however, any persons contentiously maintain that by Moses is signified marriage, by Elias virginity, let me tell them briefly that Moses died and was buried, but Elias was carried off in a chariot of fire and entered on immortality before he approached death. But the second writing of the tables could not be effected without fasting. What was lost by drunkenness was regained by abstinence, a proof that by fasting we can return to paradise, whence, though fulness, we have been expelled. In[fn-67-P6746_2133071:137-nf] Exodus we read that the battle was fought against Amalek while Moses prayed, and the whole people fasted until the evening.[fn-67-P6747_2133215:138-nf] Joshua, the son of Nun, bade sun and moon stand still, and the victorious army prolonged its fast for more than a day.[fn-67-P6748_2133354:139-nf] Saul, as it is written in the first book of Kings, pronounced a curse on him who ate bread before the evening, and until he had avenged himself upon his enemies. So none of his people tasted any food. And all they of the land took food. And so binding was a solemn fast once it was proclaimed to the Lord, that Jonathan, to whom the victory was due, was taken by lot, and[fn-67-P6749_2133964:140-nf] could not escape the charge of sinning in ignorance, and his father's hand was raised against him, and the prayers of the people scarce availed to save him.[fn-67-P6750_2134144:141-nf] Elijah after the preparation of a forty days fast saw God on Mount Horeb, and heard from Him the words, \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\" There is much more familiarity in this than in the \"Where art thou, Adam?\" of Genesis. The latter was intended to excite the fears of one who had fed and was lost; the former was affectionately addressed to a fasting servant.[fn-67-P6751_2134533:142-nf] When the people were assembled in Mizpeh, Samuel proclaimed a fast, and so strengthened them, and thus made them prevail against the enemy.[fn-67-P6752_2134695:143-nf] The attack of the Assyrians was repulsed, and the might of Sennacherib utterly crushed, by the tears and sackcloth of King Hezekiah, and by his humbling himself with fasting. So also the city of Nineveh by fasting excited compassion and turned aside the threatening wrath of the Lord. And[fn-67-P6753_2135006:144-nf] Sodom and Gomorrha might have appeased it, had they been willing to repent, and through the aid of fasting gain for themselves tears of repentance.[fn-67-P6754_2135180:145-nf] Ahab, the most impious of kings, by fasting and wearing sackcloth, succeeded in escaping the sentence of God, and in deferring the overthrow of his house to the days of his posterity.[fn-67-P6755_2135391:146-nf] Hannah, the wife of Elkanah, by fasting won the gift of a son.[fn-67-P6756_2135489:147-nf] At Babylon the magicians came into peril, every interpreter of dreams, soothsayer, and diviner was slain. Daniel and the three youths gained a good report by fasting, and although they were fed on pulse, they were fairer and wiser than they who ate the flesh from the king's table. Then it is written that Daniel fasted for three weeks; he ate no pleasant bread; flesh and wine entered not his mouth; he was not anointed with oil; and the angel came to him saying,[fn-67-P6757_2135981:148-nf] \"Daniel, thou art worthy of compassion.\" He who in the eyes of God was worthy of compassion, afterwards was an object of terror to the lions in their den. How fair a thing is that which propitiates God, tames lions, terrifies demons!Habakkuk (although we do not find this in the Hebrew Scriptures[fn-67-P6758_2136344:149-nf] ) was sent to him with the reaper's meal, for by a week's abstinence he had merited so distinguished a server. David, when his son was in danger after his adultery, made confession in ashes and with fasting.[fn-67-P6759_2136618:150-nf] He tells us that he ate ashes like bread, and mingled his drink with weeping.[fn-67-P6760_2136715:151-nf] And that his knees became weak through fasting. Yet he had certainly heard from Nathan the words,[fn-67-P6761_2136833:152-nf] \"The Lord also hath put away thy sin.\" Samson and Samuel drank neither wine nor strong drink, for they were children of promise, and conceived in abstinence and fasting.[fn-67-P6762_2137026:153-nf] Aaron and the other priests when about to enter the temple, refrained from all intoxicating drink for fear they should die. Whence we learn that they die who minister in the Church without sobriety. And hence it is a reproach against Israel:[fn-67-P6763_2137286:154-nf] \"Ye gave my Nazarites wine to drink.\" Jonadab, the son of Rechab, commanded his sons to drink no wine for ever. And when Jeremiah offered them wine to drink, and they of their own accord refused it, the Lord spake by the prophet, saying:[fn-67-P6764_2137544:155-nf] \"Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.\" On the[fn-67-P6765_2137714:156-nf] threshold of the Gospel appears Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, the wife of one husband, and a woman who was always fasting. Long-continued chastity and persistent fasting welcomed a Virgin Lord. His forerunner and herald, John, fed on locusts and wild honey, not on flesh; and the hermits of the desert and the monks in their cells, at first used the same sustenance. But the Lord Himself consecrated His baptism by a forty days' fast, and He taught us that the more violent devils[fn-67-P6766_2138219:157-nf] cannot be overcome, except by prayer and fasting.[fn-67-P6767_2138561:158-nf] Cornelius the centurion was found worthy through alms-giving and frequent fasts to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit before baptism.[fn-67-P6768_2138714:159-nf] The Apostle Paul, after speaking of hunger and thirst, and his other labours, perils from robbers, shipwrecks, loneliness, enumerates frequent fasts. And he[fn-67-P6769_2138893:160-nf] advises his disciple Timothy, who had a weak stomach, and was subject to many infirmities, to drink wine in moderation: \"Drink no longer water,\" he says. The fact that he bids him no longer drink water shows that he had previously drunk water.

And thus this passage of prophecy, taken with its whole context, clearly describe, as God both Him Whom we serve for the new name's sake, and Him through Whom the new name is blessed upon earth. It tells us Who it is that is blessed as true God, and Who is sworn by as true God. And this is the confession of faith made, in the fulness of time, by the Church in loyal devotion to Christ her Lord. We can see how exactly the words of prophecy conform to the truth, by their refraining from the insertion of that pronoun of the second person. Had the words been Thee, the true God, then they might have been interpreted as spoken to another. The true God can refer to none but the Speaker. The passage, taken by itself, shews to Whom it refers; the preceding words, taken in connexion with it, declare Who the Speaker is Who makes this confession of God. They are these:-I have appeared openly to them that asked not for Me, and, I have been found of them that sought Me not. I said, Here am I, unto a nation that called not an My name. I have spread out My hands all the day to an unbelieving and gainsaying people[fn-13-P1364_844100:21-nf] . Could a dishonest attempt to suppress the truth be more completely exposed, or the Speaker be more distinctly revealed as true God, than here? Who, I demand, was it that appeared to them that asked not for Him, and was found of them that sought Him not? What nation is it that formerly called not on His name? Who is it that spread out His hands all the day to an unbelieving and gainsaying people?

Conclude for yourself, Who it is that makes Himself manifest to them that knew Him not; Who, though one people is His own, becomes the possession of strangers; Who it is that spreads out His hands before an unbelieving and gainsaying people, nailing to the cross the writing of the former sentence against us[fn-13-P1366_845069:23-nf] . For the same Spirit in the prophet, whom we are considering, proceeds thus in the course of this one prophecy, which is connected in argument as well as continous in utterance:-But My servants shall be called by a new name, which shall be blessed upon earth, and they shall bless the true God, and they that swear upon the earth shall swear by the trite God.","title":"Book V","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":32,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_12_book_v","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"36.

As to this I know not who can doubt, unless it be persons with frivolous and frigid faith, which seizes upon those who with trembling assemble together in the church. For you say, seeing we assemble without order, and assemble at the same time, and flock in large numbers to the church, the heathen are led to make inquiry about us, and we are alarmed lest we awaken their anxieties. Do ye not know that God is Lord of all? And if it is God's will, then you shall suffer persecution; but if it is not, the heathen will be still. Believe it most surely, if indeed you believe in that God without whose will not even the sparrow, a penny can buy, falls to the ground.[fn-19-P1949_578206:16-nf] But we, I think, are better than many sparrows.","title":"IX.

For it is written thus:[fn-51-P5148_1550533:16-nf] \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the Lord; he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried, all the days of his separation.\" And this means, that he who has devoted and offered himself to the Lord shall not take of the fruits of the plant of evil, because of its natural tendency to produce intoxication and distraction of mind. For we perceive from the Scriptures two kinds of vines which were separate from each other, and were unlike. For the one is productive of immortality and righteousness; but the other of madness and insanity. The sober and joy-producing vine, from whose instructions, as from branches, there joyfully hang down clusters of graces, distilling love, is our Lord Jesus, who says expressly to the apostles,[fn-51-P5149_1551597:17-nf] \"I am the true vine, ye are the branches; and my Father is the husbandman.\" But the wild and death-bearing vine is the devil, who drops down fury and poison and wrath, as Moses relates, writing concerning him,[fn-51-P5150_1551831:18-nf] \"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter: their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.\" The inhabitants of Sodom having gathered grapes from this, were goaded on to an unnatural and fruitless desire for males. Hence, also, in the time of Noah, men having given themselves tip to drunkenness, sank down into unbelief, and, being overwhelmed by the deluge, were drowned. And Cain, too, having drawn from this, stained his fratricidal hands, and defiled the earth with the blood of his own family. Hence, too, the heathen, becoming intoxicated, sharpen their passions for murderous battles; for man is not so much excited, nor goes so far astray through wine, as from anger and wrath. A man does not become intoxicated and go astray through wine, in the same way as he does from sorrow, or from love, or from incontinence. And therefore it is ordered that a virgin shall not taste of this vine, so that she may be sober and watchful from the cares of life, and may kindle the shining torch of the light of righteousness for the Word. \"Take heed to yourselves,\" says the Lord,[fn-51-P5151_1553041:19-nf] \"lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon yon unawares, as a snare.\"","title":"Discourse V.-Thallousa.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":32,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_18_lecture_xiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"13.

For this reason we declare the maintenance of their doctrine as to the non-existence at some time of Him Who truly is, to be a denial and rejection of His true Godhead; and this on the ground that, on the one hand, He Who showed Himself to Moses by the light speaks of Himself as being, when He says, \"I am He that is[fn-18-P1819_1059094:4-nf] ,\" while on the other, Isaiah (being made, so to say, the instrument of Him Who spoke in him) says in the person of Him that is, \"I am the first, and hereafter am I[fn-18-P1820_1059276:5-nf] ,\" so that hereby, whichever way we consider it, we conceive eternity in God. And so, too, the word that was spoken to Manoah shows the fact that the Divinity is not comprehensible by the significance of His name, because, when Manoah asks to know His name, that, when the promise has come actually to pass, he may by name glorify his benefactor, He says to him, \"Why askest thou this? It also is wonderful[fn-18-P1821_1059752:6-nf] \"; so that by this we learn that there is one name significant of the Divine Nature-the wonder, namely, that arises unspeakably in our hearts concerning It. So, too, great David, in his discourses with himself, proclaims the same truth, in the sense that all the creation was brought into being by God, while He alone exists always in the same manner, and abides for ever, where he says, \"But Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail[fn-18-P1822_1060224:7-nf] .\" When we hear these sayings, and others like them, from men inspired by God, let us leave all that is not from eternity to the worship of idolaters, as a new thing alien from the true Godhead. For that which now is, and formerly was not, is clearly new and not eternal, and to have regard to any new object of worship is called by Moses the service of demons, when he says, \"They sacrificed to devils and not to God, to gods whom their fathers knew not; new gods were they that came newly up[fn-18-P1823_1060734:8-nf] .\" If then everything that is new in worship is a service of demons, and is alien from the true Godhead, and if what is now, but was not always, is new and not eternal, we who have regard to that which is, necessarily reckon those who contemplate non-existence as attaching to Him Who is, and who say that \"He once was not,\" among the worshippers of idols. For we may also see that the great John, when declaring in his own preaching the Only-begotten God, guards his own statement in every way, so that the conception of non-existence shall find no access to Him Who is. For he says[fn-18-P1824_1061377:9-nf] that He \"was in the beginning,\" and \"was with God,\" and \"was God,\" and was light, and life, and truth, and all good things at all times, and never at any time failed to be anything that is excellent, Who is the fulness of all good, and is in the bosom of the Father. If then Moses lays down as a law for us some such mark of true Godhead as this, that we know nothing else of God but this one thing, that He is (for to this point the words, \"I am He that is[fn-18-P1825_1061854:10-nf] \"); while Isaiah in his preaching declares aloud the absolute infinity of Him Who is, defining the existence of God as having no regard to beginning or to end (for He Who says \"I am the first, and hereafter am I,\" places no limit to His eternity in either direction, so that neither, if we look to the beginning, do we find any point marked since which He is, and beyond which He was not, nor, if 'we turn our thought to the future, can we cut short by any boundary the eternal progress of Him Who is),-and if the prophet David forbids us to worship any new and strange God[fn-18-P1826_1062447:11-nf] (both of which are involved in the heretical doctrine; \"newness\" is clearly indicated in that which is not eternal, and \"strangeness\" is alienation from the Nature of the very God),-if, I say, these things are so, we declare all the sophistical fabrication about the non-existence at some time of Him Who truly is, to be nothing else than a departure from Christianity, and a turning to idolatry. For when the Evangelist, in his discourse concerning the Nature of God, separates at all points non-existence from Him Who is, and, by his constant repetition of the word \"was,\" carefully destroys the suspicion of non-existence, and calls Him the Only-begotten God, the Word of God, the Son of God, equal with God, and all such names, we have this judgment fixed and settled in us, that if the Only-begotten Son is God, we must believe that He Who is believed to be God is eternal. And indeed He is verily God, and assuredly is eternal, and is never at any time found to be non-existent. For God, as we have often said, if He now is, also assuredly always was, and if He once was not, neither does He now exist at all. But since even the enemies of the truth confess that the Son is and continually abides the Only-begotten God, we say this, that, being in the Father, He is not in Him in one respect only, but He is in Him altogether, in respect of all that the Father is conceived to be. As, then, being in the incorruptibility of the Father, He is incorruptible, good in His goodness, powerful in His might, and, as being in each of these attributes of special excellence which are conceived of the Father, He is that particular thing, so, also, being in His eternity, He is assuredly eternal. Now the eternity of the Father is marked by His never having taken His being from nonexistence, and never terminating His being in non-existence. He, therefore, Who hath all things that are the Father's[fn-18-P1827_1064368:12-nf] , and is contemplated in all the glory of the Father, even as, being in the endlessness of the Father, He has no end, so, being in the unoriginateness of the Father, has, as the Apostle says, \"no beginning of days[fn-18-P1828_1064604:13-nf] ,\" but at once is \"of the Father,\" and is regarded in the eternity of the Father:and in this respect, more especially, is seen the complete absence of divergence in the Likeness, as compared with Him Whose Likeness He is. And herein is His saying found true which tells us, \"He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-18-P1829_1064939:14-nf] .\" Moreover, it is in this way that those words of the Apostle, that the Son is \"the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His Person[fn-18-P1830_1065106:15-nf] ,\" are best understood to have an excellent and close application. For the Apostle conveys to those hearers who are unable, by the contemplation of purely intellectual objects, to elevate their thought to the height of the knowledge of God, a sort of notion of the truth, by means of things apparent to sense. For as the body of the sun is expressly imaged by the whole disc that surrounds it, and he who looks on the sun argues, by means of what he sees, the existence of the whole solid substratum, so, he says, the majesty of the Father is expressly imaged in the greatness of the power of the Son, that the one may be believed to be as great as the other is known to be: and again, as the radiance of light sheds its brilliancy from the whole of the sun's disc (for in the disc one part is not radiant, and the rest dim), so all that glory which the Father is, sheds its brilliancy from its whole extent by means of the brightness that comes from it, that is, by the true Light; and as the ray is of the sun (for there would be no ray if the sun were not), yet the sun is never conceived as existing by itself without the ray of brightness that is shed from it, so the Apostle delivering to us the continuity and eternity of that existence which the Only-begotten has of the Father, calls the Son \"the brightness of His glory.\"","title":"Book VIII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":32,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_26_the_first_epistle_of_clement_to_the_corinthians","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"73","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Every kind of honour and happiness[fn-53-P5306_759706:14-nf] was bestowed upon you, and then was fulfilled that which is written, \"My beloved did eat and drink, and was enlarged and became fat, and kicked.\"[fn-53-P5307_759883:15-nf] Hence flowed emulation and envy, strife and sedition, persecution and disorder, war and captivity.

As for the burdensome sacrifices also, and the troublesome scrupulousness of their ceremonies[fn-45-P4554_1467162:228-nf] and oblations, no one should blame them, as if God specially required them for Himself: for He plainly asks, \"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? \"and, \"Who hath required them at your hand? \"[fn-45-P4555_1467400:229-nf] But he should see herein a careful provision[fn-45-P4556_1467468:230-nf] on God's part, which showed His wish to bind to His own religion a people who were prone to idolatry and transgression by that kind of services wherein consisted the superstition of that period; that He might call them away therefrom, while requesting it to be performed to Himself, as if He desired that no sin should be committed in making idols.","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_22_book_xi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Let us now go on to the next stage in his argument:-\" ... the Only-begotten Himself ascribing to the Father the title due of right to Him alone. For He Who has taught us that the appellation `good' belongs to Him alone Who is the cause of His own[fn-20-P2013_1210871:1-nf] goodness and of all goodness, and is so at all times, and Who refers to Him all good that has ever come into being, would be slow to appropriate to Himself the authority over all things that have come into being, and the title of `the Existent.'\"Well, so long as he concealed his blasphemy under some kind of veil, and strove to entangle his deluded hearers unawares in the mazes of his dialectic, I thought it necessary to watch his unfair and clandestine dealings, and as far as possible to lay bare in my argument the lurking mischief. But now that he has stripped his falsehood of every mask that could disguise it, and publishes his profanity aloud in categorical terms, I think it superfluous to undergo useless labour in bringing logical modes of confutation to bear upon those who make no secret of their impiety. For what further means could we discover to demonstrate their malignity so efficacious as that which they themselves show us in their writings ready to our hand? He says that the Father alone is worthy of the title of \"good,\" that to Him alone such a name is due, on the plea that even the Son Himself agrees that goodness belongs to Him alone. Our accuser has pleaded our cause for us: for perhaps in my former statements I was thought by my readers to show a certain wanton insolence when I endeavoured to demonstrate that the fighters against Christ made Him out to be alien from the goodness of the Father. But I think it has now been proved by the confession of our opponents that in bringing such a charge against them we were not acting unfairly. For he who says that the title of \"good\" belongs of right to the Father only, and that such an address befits Him alone, publishes abroad, by thus disclosing his real meaning, the villainy which he had previously wrapped up in disguise. He says that the title of \"good\" befits the Father only. Does he mean the title with the signification which belongs to the expression, or the title detached from its proper meaning? If on the one side he merely ascribes to the Father the title of \"good\" in a special sense, he is to be pitied for his irrationality in allowing to the Father merely the sound of an empty name. But if he thinks that the conception expressed by the term \"good\" belongs to God the Father only, he is to be abominated for his impiety, reviving as he does the plague of the Manichaaen heresy in his own opinions. For as health and disease, even so goodness and badness exist on terms of mutual destruction, so that the absence of the one is the presence of the other. If then he says that goodness belongs to the Father only, he cuts off these from every conceivable object in existence except the Father, so that, along with all, the Only-begotten God is shut out from good. For as he who affirms that man alone is capable of laughter implies thereby that no other animal shares this property, so he who asserts that good is in the Father alone separates all things from that property. If then, as Eunomius declares, the Father alone has by right the title of \"good,\" such a term will not be properly applied to anything else. But every impulse of the will either operates in accordance with good, or tends to the contrary. For to be inclined neither one way nor the other, but to remain in a state of equipoise, is the property of creatures inanimate or insensible. If the Father alone is good, having goodness not as a thing acquired, but in His nature, and if the Son, as heresy will have it, does not share in the nature of the Father, then he who does not share the good essence of the Father is of course at the same time excluded also from part and lot in the title of \"good.\" But he who has no claim either to the nature or to the name of \"good\"-what he is assuredly not unknown, even though I forbear the blasphemous expression. For it is plain to all that the object for which Eunomius is so eager is to import into the conception of the Son a suspicion of that which is evil and opposite to good. For what kind of name belongs to him who is not good is manifest to every one who has a share of reason. As he who is not brave is cowardly, as he who is not just is unjust, and as he who is not wise is foolish, so he who is not good clearly has as his own the opposite name, and it is to this that the enemy of Christ wishes to press the conception of the Only-begotten, becoming thereby to the Church another Manes or Bardesanes. These are the sayings in regard of which we say that our utterance would be no more effective than silence. For were one to say countless things, and to arouse all possible arguments, one could not say anything so damaging of our opponents as what is openly and undisguisedly proclaimed by themselves. For what more bitter charge could one invent against them for malice than that of denying that He is good \"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God[fn-20-P2014_1215910:2-nf] ,\" but yet condescended to the low estate of human nature, and did so solely for the love of man? In return for what, tell me, \"do ye thus requite the Lord[fn-20-P2015_1216086:3-nf] ?\" (for I will borrow the language of Moses to the Israelites); is He not good, Who when thou wast soulless dust invested thee with Godlike beauty, and raised thee up as an image of His own power endowed with soul? Is He not good, Who for thy sake took on Him the form of a servant, and for the joy set before Him[fn-20-P2016_1216419:4-nf] did not shrink from bearing the sufferings due to thy sin, and gave Himself a ransom for thy death, and became for our sakes a curse and sin?","title":"Book XI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":32,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_30_5_five_books_in_reply_to_marcion_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1212","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Sprinkled, by speaking.[fn-47-P4785_760290:227-nf] words of presage, those","title":"5.

For if he had read the divine Scripture, he would have known that the title of the Son has also been bestowed by our bountiful Lord on many.

To encourage a belief of this Gospel he has actually[fn-52-P5238_1638178:4-nf] devised for it a sort of dower,[fn-52-P5239_1638227:5-nf] in a work composed of contrary statements set in opposition, thence entitled Antitheses, and compiled with a view to such a severance of the law from the gospel as should divide the Deity into two, nay, diverse, gods-one for each Instrument, or Testament[fn-52-P5240_1638500:6-nf] as it is more usual to call it; that by such means he might also patronize[fn-52-P5241_1638600:7-nf] belief in \"the Gospel according to the Antitheses.\" These, however, I would have attacked in special combat, hand to hand; that is to say, I would have encountered singly the several devices Of the Pontic heretic, if it were not much more convenient to refute them in and with that very gospel to which they contribute their support. Although it is so easy to meet them at once with a peremptory demurrer,[fn-52-P5242_1639025:8-nf] yet, in order that I may both make them admissible in argument, and account them valid expressions of opinion, and even contend that they make for our side, that so there may be all the redder shame for the blindness of their author, we have now drawn out some antitheses of our own in opposition to Marcion.And indeed[fn-52-P5243_1639576:9-nf] I do allow that one order did run its course in the old dispensation under the Creator,[fn-52-P5244_1639680:10-nf] and that another is on its way in the new under Christ. I do not deny that there is a difference in the language of their documents, in their precepts of virtue, and in their teachings of the law; but yet all this diversity is consistent with one and the same God, even Him by whom it was arranged and also foretold. Long ago[fn-52-P5245_1640028:11-nf] did Isaiah declare that \"out of Sion should go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem\"[fn-52-P5246_1640142:12-nf] -some other law, that is, and another word. In short, says he, \"He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; \"[fn-52-P5247_1640289:13-nf] meaning not those of the Jewish people only, but of the nations which are judged by the new law of the gospel and the new word of the apostles, and are amongst themselves rebuked of their old error as soon as they have believed. And as the result of this, \"they beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears (which are a kind of hunting instruments) into pruning-hooks; \"[fn-52-P5248_1640686:14-nf] that is to say, minds, which once were fierce and cruel, are changed by them into good dispositions productive of good fruit. And again: \"Hearken unto me, hearken unto me, my people, and ye kings, give ear unto me; for a law shall proceed from me, and my judgment for a light to the nations; \"[fn-52-P5249_1640997:15-nf] wherefore He had determined and decreed that the nations also were to be enlightened by the law and the word of the gospel. This will be that law which (according to David also) is unblameable, because \"perfect, converting the soul\"[fn-52-P5250_1641270:16-nf] from idols unto God. This likewise will be the word concerning which the same Isaiah says, \"For the Lord will make a decisive word in the land.\"[fn-52-P5251_1641432:17-nf] Because the New Testament is compendiously short,[fn-52-P5252_1641554:18-nf] and freed from the minute and perplexing[fn-52-P5253_1641614:19-nf] burdens of the law. But why enlarge, when the Creator by the same prophet foretells the renovation more manifestly and clearly than the light itself? \"Remember not the former things, neither consider the things of old\" (the old things have passed away, and new things are arising). \"Behold, I will do new things, which shall now spring forth.\"[fn-52-P5254_1641975:20-nf] So by Jeremiah: \"Break up for yourselves new pastures,[fn-52-P5255_1642055:21-nf] and sow not among thorns, and circumcise yourselves in the foreskin of your heart.\"[fn-52-P5256_1642186:22-nf] And in another passage: \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Jacob, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I arrested their dispensation, in order to bring them out of the land of Egypt.\"[fn-52-P5257_1642532:23-nf] He thus shows that the ancient covenant is temporary only, when He indicates its change; also when He promises that it shall be followed by an eternal one. For by Isaiah He says: \"Hear me, and ye shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,\" adding \"the sure mercies of David,\"[fn-52-P5258_1642871:24-nf] in order that He might show that that covenant was to run its course in Christ. That He was of the family of David, according to the genealogy of Mary,[fn-52-P5259_1643040:25-nf] He declared in a figurative way even by the rod which was to proceed out of the stem of Jesse.[fn-52-P5260_1643581:26-nf] Forasmuch then as he said, that from the Creator there would come other laws, and other words, and new dispensations of covenants, indicating also that the very sacrifices were to receive higher offices, and that amongst all nations, by Malachi when he says: \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, neither will I accept your sacrifices at your hands. For from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place a sacrifice is offered unto my name, even a pure offering\"[fn-52-P5261_1644145:27-nf] -meaning simple prayer from a pure conscience,-it is of necessity that every change which comes as the result of innovation, introduces a diversity in those things of which the change is made, from which diversity arises also a contrariety. For as there is nothing, after it has undergone a change, which does not become different, so there is nothing different which is not contrary.[fn-52-P5262_1644551:28-nf] Of that very thing, therefore, there will be predicated a contrariety in consequence of its diversity, to which there accrued a change of condition after an innovation. He who brought about the change, the same instituted the diversity also; He who foretold the innovation, the same announced beforehand the contrariety likewise. Why, in your interpretation, do you impute a difference in the state of things to a difference of powers? Why do you wrest to the Creator's prejudice those examples from which you draw your antitheses, when you may recognise them all in His sensations and affections? \"I will wound,\" He says, \"and I will heal; \"\"I will kill,\" He says again, \"and I will make alive\"[fn-52-P5263_1645272:29-nf] -even the same \"who createth evil and maketh peace; \"[fn-52-P5264_1645349:30-nf] from which you are used even to censure Him with the imputation of fickleness and inconstancy, as if He forbade what He commanded, and commanded what He forbade. Why, then, have you not reckoned up the Antitheses also which occur in the natural works of the Creator, who is for ever contrary to Himself? You have not been able, unless I am misinformed, to recognise the fact,[fn-52-P5265_1645743:31-nf] that the world, at all events,[fn-52-P5266_1645791:32-nf] even amongst your people of Pontus, is made up of a diversity of elements which are hostile to one another.[fn-52-P5267_1645912:33-nf] It was therefore your bounden duty first to have determined that the god of the light was one being, and the god of darkness was another, in such wise that you might have been able to have distinctly asserted one of them to be the god of the law and the other the god of the gospel. It is, however, the settled conviction already[fn-52-P5268_1646266:34-nf] of my mind from manifest proofs, that, as His works and plans[fn-52-P5269_1646352:35-nf] exist in the way of Antitheses, so also by the same rule exist the mysteries of His religion.[fn-52-P5270_1646474:36-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":35,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"But I say unto you which hear\" (displaying here that old injunction, of the Creator: \"Speak to the ears of those who lend them to you\"[fn-58-P5837_1767307:554-nf] ), \"Love your enemies, and bless[fn-58-P5838_1767389:555-nf] those which hate you, and pray for them which calumniate you.\"[fn-58-P5839_1767528:556-nf] These commands the Creator included in one precept by His prophet Isaiah: \"Say, Ye are our brethren, to those who hate you.\"[fn-58-P5840_1767737:557-nf] For if they who are our enemies, and hate us, and speak evil of us, and calumniate us, are to be called our brethren, surely He did in effect bid us bless them that hate us, and pray for them who calumniate us, when He instructed us to reckon them as brethren. Well, but Christ plainly teaches a new kind of patience,[fn-58-P5841_1768076:558-nf] when He actually prohibits the reprisals which the Creator permitted in requiring \"an eye for an eye,[fn-58-P5842_1768296:559-nf] and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-58-P5843_1768491:560-nf] and bids us, on the contrary, \"to him who smiteth us on the one cheek, to offer the other also, and to give up our coat to him that taketh away our cloak.\"[fn-58-P5844_1768667:561-nf] No doubt these are supplementary additions by Christ, but they are quite in keeping with the teaching of the Creator.

When by Zechariah He commanded, \"Let none of you imagine evil against his brother,\"[fn-58-P5847_1769047:564-nf] He did not expressly include his neighbour; but then in another passage He says, \"Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour.\"[fn-58-P5848_1769219:565-nf] He who counselled that an injury should be forgotten, was still more likely to counsel the patient endurance of it. But then, when He said, \"Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,\"[fn-58-P5849_1769421:566-nf] He thereby teaches that patience calmly waits for the infliction of vengeance. Therefore, inasmuch as it is incredible[fn-58-P5850_1769599:567-nf] that the same (God) should seem to require \"a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye,\" in return for an injury, who forbids not only all reprisals, but even a revengeful thought or recollection of an injury, in so far does it become plain to us in what sense He required \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,\"-not, indeed, for the purpose of permitting the repetition of the injury by retaliating it, which it virtually prohibited when it forbade vengeance; but for the purpose of restraining the injury in the first instance, which it had forbidden on pain of retaliation or reciprocity;[fn-58-P5851_1770219:568-nf] so that every man, in view of the permission to inflict a second (or retaliatory) injury, might abstain from the commission of the first (or provocative) wrong. For He knows how much more easy it is to repress violence by the prospect of retaliation, than by the promise of (indefinite) vengeance. Both results, however, it was necessary to provide, in consideration of the nature and the faith of men, that the man who believed in God might expect vengeance from God, while he who had no faith (to restrain him) might fear the laws which prescribed retaliation.[fn-58-P5852_1770808:569-nf] This purpose[fn-58-P5853_1770881:570-nf] of the law, which it was difficult to understand, Christ, as the Lord of the Sabbath and of the law, and of all the dispensations of the Father, both revealed and made intelligible,[fn-58-P5854_1771082:571-nf] when He commanded that \"the other cheek should be offered (to the smiter),\" in order that He might the more effectually extinguish all reprisals of an injury, which the law had wished to prevent by the method of retaliation, (and) which most certainly revelation[fn-58-P5855_1771407:572-nf] had manifestly restricted, both by prohibiting the memory of the wrong, and referring the vengeance thereof to God. Thus, whatever (new provision) Christ introduced, He did it not in opposition to the law, but rather in furtherance of it, without at all impairing the prescription[fn-58-P5856_1771707:573-nf] of the Creator. If, therefore,[fn-58-P5857_1771773:574-nf] one looks carefully[fn-58-P5858_1771809:575-nf] into the very grounds for which patience is enjoined (and that to such a full and complete extent), one finds that it cannot stand if it is not the precept of the Creator, who promises vengeance, who presents Himself as the judge (in the case). If it were not so,[fn-58-P5859_1772143:576-nf] -if so vast a weight of patience-which is to refrain from giving blow for blow; which is to offer the other cheek; which is not only not to return railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing; and which, so far from keeping the coat, is to give up the cloak also-is laid upon me by one who means not to help me,-(then all I can say is, ) he has taught me patience to no purpose,[fn-58-P5860_1772541:577-nf] because he shows me no reward to his precept-I mean no fruit of such patience. There is revenge which he ought to have permitted me to take, if he meant not to inflict it himself; if he did not give me that permission, then he should himself have inflicted it;[fn-58-P5861_1772820:578-nf] since it is for the interest of discipline itself that an injury should be avenged. For by the fear of vengeance all iniquity is curbed. But if licence is allowed to it without discrimination,[fn-58-P5862_1773057:579-nf] it will get the mastery-it will put out (a man's) both eyes; it will knock out[fn-58-P5863_1773151:580-nf] every tooth in the safety of its impunity. This, however, is (the principle) of your good and simply beneficent god-to do a wrong to patience, to open the door to violence, to leave the righteous undefended, and the wicked unrestrained! \"Give to every one that asketh of thee\"[fn-58-P5864_1773447:581-nf] -to the indigent of course, or rather to the indigent more especially, although to the affluent likewise. But in order that no man may be indigent, you have in Deuteronomy a provision commanded by the Creator to the creditor.[fn-58-P5865_1773693:582-nf] \"There shall not be in thine hand an indigent man; so that the Lord thy God shall bless thee with blessings,\"[fn-58-P5866_1773818:583-nf] -thee meaning the creditor to whom it was owing that the man was not indigent. But more than this. To one who does not ask, He bids a gift to be given. \"Let there be, not,\" He says, \"a poor man in thine hand; \"in other words, see that there be not, so far as thy will can prevent;[fn-58-P5867_1774143:584-nf] by which command, too, He all the more strongly by inference requires[fn-58-P5868_1774239:585-nf] men to give to him that asks, as in the following words also: \"If there be among you a poor man of thy brethren, thou shalt not turn away thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother. But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him as much as he wanteth,\"[fn-58-P5869_1774549:586-nf] Loans are not usually given, except to such as ask for them. On this subject of lending,[fn-58-P5870_1774661:587-nf] however, more hereafter.[fn-58-P5871_1774704:588-nf] Now, should any one wish to argue that the Creator's precepts extended only to a man's brethren, but Christ's to all that ask, so as to make the latter a new and different precept, (I have to reply) that one rule only can be made out of those principles, which show the law of the Creator to be repeated in Christ.[fn-58-P5872_1775054:589-nf] For that is not a different thing which Christ enjoined to be done towards all men, from that which the Creator prescribed in favour of a man's brethren. For although that is a greater charity, which is shown to strangers, it is yet not preferable to that[fn-58-P5873_1775413:590-nf] which was previously due to one's neighbours. For what man will be able to bestow the love (which proceeds from knowledge of character,[fn-58-P5874_1775566:591-nf] upon strangers? Since, however, the second step[fn-58-P5875_1776029:592-nf] in charity is towards strangers, while the first is towards one's neighbours, the second step will belong to him to whom the first also belongs, more fitly than the second will belong to him who owned no first.[fn-58-P5876_1776255:593-nf] Accordingly, the Creator, when following the course of nature, taught in the first instance kindness to neighbours,[fn-58-P5877_1776404:594-nf] intending afterwards to enjoin it towards strangers; and when following the method of His dispensation, He limited charity first to the Jews, but afterwards extended it to the whole race of mankind. So long, therefore, as the mystery of His government[fn-58-P5878_1776676:595-nf] was confined to Israel, He properly commanded that pity should be shown only to a man's brethren; but when Christ had given to Him \"the Gentiles for His heritage, and the ends of the earth for His possession,\" then began to be accomplished what was said by Hosea: \"Ye are not my people, who were my people; ye have not obtained mercy, who once obtained mercy\"[fn-58-P5879_1777057:596-nf] -that is, the (Jewish) nation. Thenceforth Christ extended to all men the law of His Father's compassion, excepting none from His mercy, as He omitted none in His invitation. So that, whatever was the ampler scope of His teaching, He received it all in His heritage of the nations. \"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.\"[fn-58-P5880_1777469:597-nf] In this command is no doubt implied its counterpart: \"And as ye would not that men should do to you, so should ye also not do to them likewise.\" Now, if this were the teaching of the new and previously unknown and not yet fully proclaimed deity, who had favoured me with no instruction beforehand, whereby I might first learn what I ought to choose or to refuse for myself, and to do to others what I would wish done to myself, not doing to them what I should be unwilling to have done to myself, it would certainly be nothing else than the chance-medley of my own sentiments[fn-58-P5881_1778065:598-nf] which he would have left to me, binding me to no proper rule of wish or action, in order that I might do to others what I would like for myself, or refrain from doing to others what I should dislike to have done to myself. For he has not, in fact, defined what I ought to wish or not to wish for myself as well as for others, so that I shape my conduct[fn-58-P5882_1778455:599-nf] according to the law of my own will, and have it in my power[fn-58-P5883_1778537:600-nf] not to render[fn-58-P5884_1778566:601-nf] to another what I would like to have rendered to myself-love, obedience, consolation, protection, and such like blessings; and in like manner to do to another what I should be unwilling to have done to myself-violence, wrong, insult, deceit, and evils of like sort. Indeed, the heathen who have not been instructed by God act on this incongruous liberty of the will and the conduct.[fn-58-P5885_1778967:602-nf] For although good and evil are severally known by nature, yet life is not thereby spent[fn-58-P5886_1779119:603-nf] under the discipline of God, which alone at last teaches men the proper liberty of their will and action in faith, asin the fear of God. The god of Marcion, therefore, although specially revealed, was, in spite of his revelation, unable to publish any summary of the precept in question, which had hitherto been so confined,[fn-58-P5887_1779463:604-nf] and obscure, and dark, and admitting of no ready interpretation, except according to my own arbitrary thought,[fn-58-P5888_1779591:605-nf] because he had provided no previous discrimination in the matter of such a precept. This, however, was not the case with my God[fn-58-P5889_1779744:606-nf] for He always and everywhere enjoined that the poor, and the orphan, and the widow should be protected, assisted, refreshed; thus by Isaiah He says: \"Deal thy bread to the hungry, and them that are houseless bring into thine house; when thou seest the naked, cover him.\"[fn-58-P5890_1780054:607-nf] By Ezekiel also He thus describes the just man: \"His bread will he give to the hungry, and the naked will he cover with a garment.\"[fn-58-P5891_1780208:608-nf] That teaching was even then a sufficient inducement to me to do to others what I would that they should do unto me. Accordingly, when He uttered such denunciations as, \"Thou shalt do no murder; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness,\" He taught me to refrain from doing to others what I should be unwilling to have done to myself; and therefore the precept developed in the Gospel will belong to Him alone, who anciently drew it up, and gave it distinctive point, and arranged it after the decision of His own teaching, and has now reduced it, suitably to its importance,[fn-58-P5892_1780852:609-nf] to a compendious formula, because (as it was predicted in another passage) the Lord-that is, Christ\" was to make (or utter) a concise word on earth.\"[fn-58-P5893_1781017:610-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":35,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"But I say unto you which hear\" (displaying here that old injunction, of the Creator: \"Speak to the ears of those who lend them to you\"[fn-58-P5837_1767307:554-nf] ), \"Love your enemies, and bless[fn-58-P5838_1767389:555-nf] those which hate you, and pray for them which calumniate you.\"[fn-58-P5839_1767528:556-nf] These commands the Creator included in one precept by His prophet Isaiah: \"Say, Ye are our brethren, to those who hate you.\"[fn-58-P5840_1767737:557-nf] For if they who are our enemies, and hate us, and speak evil of us, and calumniate us, are to be called our brethren, surely He did in effect bid us bless them that hate us, and pray for them who calumniate us, when He instructed us to reckon them as brethren. Well, but Christ plainly teaches a new kind of patience,[fn-58-P5841_1768076:558-nf] when He actually prohibits the reprisals which the Creator permitted in requiring \"an eye for an eye,[fn-58-P5842_1768296:559-nf] and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-58-P5843_1768491:560-nf] and bids us, on the contrary, \"to him who smiteth us on the one cheek, to offer the other also, and to give up our coat to him that taketh away our cloak.\"[fn-58-P5844_1768667:561-nf] No doubt these are supplementary additions by Christ, but they are quite in keeping with the teaching of the Creator. And therefore this question must at once be determined,[fn-58-P5845_1768861:562-nf] Whether the discipline of patience be enjoined by[fn-58-P5846_1768936:563-nf] the Creator? When by Zechariah He commanded, \"Let none of you imagine evil against his brother,\"[fn-58-P5847_1769047:564-nf] He did not expressly include his neighbour; but then in another passage He says, \"Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour.\"[fn-58-P5848_1769219:565-nf] He who counselled that an injury should be forgotten, was still more likely to counsel the patient endurance of it. But then, when He said, \"Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,\"[fn-58-P5849_1769421:566-nf] He thereby teaches that patience calmly waits for the infliction of vengeance. Therefore, inasmuch as it is incredible[fn-58-P5850_1769599:567-nf] that the same (God) should seem to require \"a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye,\" in return for an injury, who forbids not only all reprisals, but even a revengeful thought or recollection of an injury, in so far does it become plain to us in what sense He required \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,\"-not, indeed, for the purpose of permitting the repetition of the injury by retaliating it, which it virtually prohibited when it forbade vengeance; but for the purpose of restraining the injury in the first instance, which it had forbidden on pain of retaliation or reciprocity;[fn-58-P5851_1770219:568-nf] so that every man, in view of the permission to inflict a second (or retaliatory) injury, might abstain from the commission of the first (or provocative) wrong. For He knows how much more easy it is to repress violence by the prospect of retaliation, than by the promise of (indefinite) vengeance. Both results, however, it was necessary to provide, in consideration of the nature and the faith of men, that the man who believed in God might expect vengeance from God, while he who had no faith (to restrain him) might fear the laws which prescribed retaliation.[fn-58-P5852_1770808:569-nf] This purpose[fn-58-P5853_1770881:570-nf] of the law, which it was difficult to understand, Christ, as the Lord of the Sabbath and of the law, and of all the dispensations of the Father, both revealed and made intelligible,[fn-58-P5854_1771082:571-nf] when He commanded that \"the other cheek should be offered (to the smiter),\" in order that He might the more effectually extinguish all reprisals of an injury, which the law had wished to prevent by the method of retaliation, (and) which most certainly revelation[fn-58-P5855_1771407:572-nf] had manifestly restricted, both by prohibiting the memory of the wrong, and referring the vengeance thereof to God. Thus, whatever (new provision) Christ introduced, He did it not in opposition to the law, but rather in furtherance of it, without at all impairing the prescription[fn-58-P5856_1771707:573-nf] of the Creator. If, therefore,[fn-58-P5857_1771773:574-nf] one looks carefully[fn-58-P5858_1771809:575-nf] into the very grounds for which patience is enjoined (and that to such a full and complete extent), one finds that it cannot stand if it is not the precept of the Creator, who promises vengeance, who presents Himself as the judge (in the case). If it were not so,[fn-58-P5859_1772143:576-nf] -if so vast a weight of patience-which is to refrain from giving blow for blow; which is to offer the other cheek; which is not only not to return railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing; and which, so far from keeping the coat, is to give up the cloak also-is laid upon me by one who means not to help me,-(then all I can say is, ) he has taught me patience to no purpose,[fn-58-P5860_1772541:577-nf] because he shows me no reward to his precept-I mean no fruit of such patience. There is revenge which he ought to have permitted me to take, if he meant not to inflict it himself; if he did not give me that permission, then he should himself have inflicted it;[fn-58-P5861_1772820:578-nf] since it is for the interest of discipline itself that an injury should be avenged. For by the fear of vengeance all iniquity is curbed. But if licence is allowed to it without discrimination,[fn-58-P5862_1773057:579-nf] it will get the mastery-it will put out (a man's) both eyes; it will knock out[fn-58-P5863_1773151:580-nf] every tooth in the safety of its impunity.

Now, since Christ forbids the recompense to be expected now, but promises it \"at the resurrection,\" this is the very plan[fn-65-P6574_1932643:1245-nf] of the Creator, who dislikes those who love gifts and follow after reward. Consider also to which deity[fn-65-P6575_1932763:1246-nf] is better suited the parable of him who issued invitations: \"A certain man made a great supper, and bade many.\"[fn-65-P6576_1932895:1247-nf] The preparation for the supper is no doubt a figure of the abundant provision[fn-65-P6577_1932996:1248-nf] of eternal life. I first remark, that strangers, and persons unconnected by ties of relationship, are not usually invited to a supper; but that members of the household and family are more frequently the favoured guests. To the Creator, then, it belonged to give the invitation, to whom also appertained those who were to be invited-whether considered as men, through their descent from Adam, or as Jews, by reason of their fathers; not to him who possessed no claim to them either by nature or prerogative. My next remark is,[fn-65-P6578_1933545:1249-nf] if He issues the invitations who has prepared the supper, then, in this sense the supper is the Creator's, who sent to warn the guests. These had been indeed previously invited by the fathers, but were to be admonished by the prophets. It certainly is not the feast of him who never sent a messenger to warn-who never did a thing before towards issuing an invitation, but came down himself on a sudden-only then[fn-65-P6579_1933974:1250-nf] beginning to be known, when already[fn-65-P6580_1934036:1251-nf] giving his invitation; only then inviting, when already compelling to his banquet; appointing one and the same hour both for the supper and the invitation. But when invited, they excuse themselves.[fn-65-P6581_1934260:1252-nf] And fairly enough, if the invitation came from the other god, because it was so sudden; if, however, the excuse was not a fair one, then the invitation was not a sudden one. Now, if the invitation was not a sudden one, it must have been given by the Creator-even by Him of old time, whose call they had at last refused. They first refused it when they said to Aaron, \"Make us gods, which shall go before us; \"[fn-65-P6582_1934693:1253-nf] and again, afterwards, when \"they heard indeed with the ear, but did not understand\"[fn-65-P6583_1934801:1254-nf] their calling of God. In a manner most germane[fn-65-P6584_1934870:1255-nf] to this parable, He said by Jeremiah: \"Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and ye shall walk in all my ways, which I have commanded you.\"[fn-65-P6585_1935064:1256-nf] This is the invitation of God. \"But,\" says He, \"they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear.\"[fn-65-P6586_1935180:1257-nf] This is the refusal of the people. \"They departed, and walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart.\"[fn-65-P6587_1935316:1258-nf] \"I have bought a field-and I have bought some oxen-and I have married a wife.\"[fn-65-P6588_1935416:1259-nf] And still He urges them: \"I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early even before day-light.\"[fn-65-P6589_1935556:1260-nf] The Holy Spirit is here meant, the admonisher of the guests. \"Yet my people hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck.\"[fn-65-P6590_1935768:1261-nf] This was reported to the Master of the family. Then He was moved (He did well to be moved; for, as Marcion denies emotion to his god, He must be therefore my God), and commanded them to invite out of \"the streets and lanes of the city.\"[fn-65-P6591_1936028:1262-nf] Let us see whether this is not the same in purport as His words by Jeremiah: \"Have I been a wilderness to the house of Israel, or a land left uncultivated? \"[fn-65-P6592_1936209:1263-nf] That is to say: \"Then have I none whom I may call to me; have I no place whence I may bring them? \"\"Since my people have said, We will come no more unto thee.\"[fn-65-P6593_1936391:1264-nf] Therefore He sent out to call others, but from the same city.[fn-65-P6594_1936475:1265-nf] My third remark is this,[fn-65-P6595_1936523:1266-nf] that although the place abounded with people, He yet commanded that they gather men from the highways and the hedges. In other words, we are now gathered out of the Gentile strangers; with that jealous resentment, no doubt, which He expressed in Deuteronomy: \"I will hide my face from them, and I will show them what shall happen in the last days[fn-65-P6596_1936888:1267-nf] (how that others shall possess their place); for they are a froward generation, children in whom is no faith.

(Now, I ask, ) after going through all this course of the Creator's dispensation and prophecies, what there is in it which can possibly be assigned to him who has done all his work at one hasty stroke,[fn-66-P6602_1937966:1273-nf] and possesses neither the Creator's[fn-66-P6603_1938018:1274-nf] course nor His dispensation in harmony with the parable? Or, again in what will consist his first invitation,[fn-66-P6604_1938413:1275-nf] and what his admonition[fn-66-P6605_1938475:1276-nf] at the second stage? Some at first would surely decline; others afterwards must have accepted.\"[fn-66-P6606_1938615:1277-nf] But now he comes to invite both parties promiscuously out of the city,[fn-66-P6607_1938802:1278-nf] out of the hedges,[fn-66-P6608_1938840:1279-nf] contrary to the drift[fn-66-P6609_1938885:1280-nf] of the parable. It is impossible for him now to condemn as scorners of his invitation[fn-66-P6610_1938990:1281-nf] those whom he has never yet invited, and whom he is approaching with so much earnestness. If, however, he condemns them beforehand as about to reject his call, then beforehand he also predicts[fn-66-P6611_1939205:1282-nf] the election of the Gentiles in their stead. Certainly[fn-66-P6612_1939280:1283-nf] he means to come the second time for the very purpose of preaching to the heathen. But even if he does mean to come again, I imagine it will not be with the intention of any longer inviting guests, but of giving to them their places. Meanwhile, you who interpret the call to this supper as an invitation to a heavenly banquet of spiritual satiety and pleasure, must remember that the earthly promises also of wine and oil and corn, and even of the city, are equally employed by the Creator as figures of spiritual things.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_07_anf07_30_commentary_on_the_apocalypse_of_the_blessed_john","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"108","folder":"ANF-07","text":"\"Which are bound in the great river Euphrates.\"] By the corners of the earth, or the four winds across the river Euphrates, are meant four nations, because to every nation is sent an angel; as said the law, \"He determined them by the number of the angels of God,\"[fn-46-P4687_1785921:44-nf] until the number of the saints should be filled up.

But neither are they less to be blamed who think that the Son was a creation, and decided that the Lord was made just as one of those things which really were made; whereas the divine declarations testify that He was begotten, as is fitting and proper, but not that He was created or made. It is therefore not a trifling, but a very great impiety, to say that the Lord was in any wise made with hands. For if the Son was made, there was a time when He was not; but He always was, if, as He Himself declares,[fn-48-P4819_1825946:3-nf] He is undoubtedly in the Father. And if Christ is the Word, the Wisdom, and the Power,-for the divine writings tell us that Christ is these, as ye yourselves know,-assuredly these are powers of God. Wherefore, if the Son was made, there was a time when these were not in existence;[fn-48-P4820_1826282:4-nf] and thus there was a time when God was without these things, which is utterly absurd. But why should I discourse at greater length to you about these matters, since ye are men filled with the Spirit, and especially understanding what absurd results follow from the opinion which asserts that the Son was made? The leaders of this view seem to me to have given very little heed to these things, and for that reason to have strayed absolutely, by explaining the passage otherwise than as the divine and prophetic Scripture demands. \"The Lord created me the beginning of His ways.\"[fn-48-P4821_1826930:5-nf] For, as ye know, there is more than one signification of the word \"created; \"and in this place \"created\" is the same as \"set over\" the works made by Himself-made, I say, by the Son Himself. But this \"created\" is not to be understood in the same manner as \"made.\" For to make and to create are different from one another. \"Is not He Himself thy Father, that hath possessed thee and created thee? \"[fn-48-P4822_1827346:6-nf] says Moses in the great song of Deuteronomy.

It is then not competent to him to ascribe any quality to his god, whom indeed he only promulged by the fact of such an ascription; for only if it were previously evident that his god had an existence, could he be permitted to ascribe an attribute to him. The ascribed attribute is only an accident; but accidents[fn-76-P7677_2197234:500-nf] are preceded by the statement of the thing itself of which they are predicated, especially when another claims the attribute which is ascribed to him who has not been previously shown to exist. Our denial of his existence will be all the more peremptory, because of the fact that the attribute which is alleged in proof of it belongs to that God who has been already revealed. Therefore \"the New Testament\" will appertain to none other than Him who promised it-if not \"its letter, yet its spirit; \"[fn-76-P7678_2197775:501-nf] and herein will lie its newness. Indeed, He who had engraved its letter in stones is the same as He who had said of its spirit, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.\"[fn-76-P7679_2197972:502-nf] Even if \"the letter killeth, yet the Spirit giveth life; \"[fn-76-P7680_2198051:503-nf] and both belong to Him who says: \"I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.\"[fn-76-P7681_2198156:504-nf] We have already made good the Creator's claim to this twofold character of judgment and goodness[fn-76-P7682_2198277:505-nf] -\"killing in the letter\" through the law, and \"quickening in the Spirit\" through the Gospel. Now these attributes, however different they be, cannot possibly make two gods; for they have already (in the prevenient dispensation of the Old Testament) been found to meet in One.[fn-76-P7683_2198601:506-nf] He alludes to Moses' veil, covered with which \"his face could not be stedfastly seen by the children of Israel.\"[fn-76-P7684_2198755:507-nf] Since he did this to maintain the superiority of the glory of the New Testament, which is permanent in its glory, over that of the Old, \"which was to be done away,\"[fn-76-P7685_2198946:508-nf] this fact gives support to my belief which exalts the Gospel above the law and you must look well to it that it does not even more than this. For only there is superiority possible where was previously the thing over which superiority can be affirmed. But then he says, \"But their minds were blinded\"[fn-76-P7686_2199272:509-nf] -of the world; certainly not the Creator's mind, but the minds of the people which are in the world.[fn-76-P7687_2199416:510-nf] Of Israel he says, Even unto this day the same veil is upon their heart; \"[fn-76-P7688_2199659:511-nf] showing that the veil which was on the face of Moses was a figure of the veil which is on the heart of the nation still; because even now Moses is not seen by them in heart, just as he was not then seen by them in eye. But what concern has Paul with the veil which still obscures Moses from their view, if the Christ of the Creator, whom Moses predicted, is not yet come? How are the hearts of the Jews represented as still covered and veiled, if the predictions of Moses relating to Christ, in whom it was their duty to believe through him, are as yet unfulfilled? What had the apostle of a strange Christ to complain of, if the Jews failed in understanding the mysterious announcements of their own God, unless the veil which was upon their hearts had reference to that blindness which concealed from their eyes the Christ of Moses? Then, again, the words which follow, But when it shall turn to the Lord, the evil shall be taken away,\"[fn-76-P7689_2200621:512-nf] properly refer to the Jew, over whose gaze Moses' veil is spread, to the effect that, when he is turned to the faith of Christ, he will understand how Moses spoke of Christ. But how shall the veil of the Creator be taken away by the Christ of another god, whose mysteries the Creator could not possibly have veiled-unknown mysteries, as they were of an unknown god? So he says that \"we now with open face\" (meaning the candour of the heart, which in the Jews had been covered with a veil), \"beholding Christ, are changed into the same image, from that glory\" (wherewith Moses was transfigured as by the glory of the Lord) \"to another glory.\"[fn-76-P7690_2201286:513-nf] By thus setting forth the glory which illumined the person of Moses from his interview with God, and the veil which concealed the same from the infirmity of the people, and by superinducing thereupon the revelation and the glory of the Spirit in the person of Christ-\"even as,\" to use his words, \"by the Spirit of the Lord\"[fn-76-P7691_2201633:514-nf] -he testifies that the whole Mosaic system[fn-76-P7692_2201897:515-nf] was a figure of Christ, of whom the Jews indeed were ignorant, but who is known to us Christians. We are quite aware that some passages are open to ambiguity, from the way in which they are read, or else from their punctuation, when there is room for these two causes of ambiguity. The latter method has been adopted by Marcion, by reading the passage which follows, \"in whom the God of this world,\"[fn-76-P7693_2202325:516-nf] as if it described the Creator as the God of this world, in order that he may, by these words, imply that there is another God for the other world. We, however, say that the passage ought to be punctuated with a comma after God, to this effect: \"In whom God hath blinded the eyes of the unbelievers of this world.\"[fn-76-P7694_2202661:517-nf] \"In whom\" means the Jewish unbelievers, from some of whom the gospel is still hidden under Moses' veil. Now it is these whom God had threatened for \"loving Him indeed with the lip, whilst their heart was far from Him,\"[fn-76-P7695_2203650:518-nf] in these angry words: \"Ye shall hear with your ears, and not understand; and see with your eyes, but not perceive; \"[fn-76-P7696_2203789:519-nf] and, \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand; \"[fn-76-P7697_2203881:520-nf] and again, \"I will take away the wisdom of their wise men, and bring to nought[fn-76-P7698_2203987:521-nf] the understanding of their prudent ones.\" But these words, of course, He did not pronounce against them for concealing the gospel of the unknown God. At any rate, if there is a God of this world,[fn-76-P7699_2204217:522-nf] He blinds the heart of the unbelievers of this world, because they have not of their own accord recognised His Christ, who ought to be understood from His Scriptures.[fn-77-P7700_2204457:523-nf] Content with my advantage, I can willingly refrain from noticing to any greater length[fn-77-P7701_2204617:524-nf] this point of ambiguous punctuation, so as not to give my adversary any advantage,[fn-77-P7702_2204753:525-nf] indeed, I might have wholly omitted the discussion. A simpler answer I shall find ready to hand in interpreting \"the god of this world\" of the devil, who once said, as the prophet describes him: \"I will be like the Most High; I will exalt my throne in the clouds.\"[fn-77-P7703_2205190:526-nf] The whole superstition, indeed, of this world has got into his hands,[fn-77-P7704_2205281:527-nf] so that he blinds effectually the hearts of unbelievers, and of none more than the apostate Marcion's. Now he did not observe how much this clause of the sentence made against him: \"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to (give) the light of the knowledge (of His glory) in the face of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7705_2205660:528-nf] Now who was it that said; \"Let there be light? \"[fn-77-P7706_2205730:529-nf] And who was it that said to Christ concerning giving light to the world: \"I have set Thee as a light to the Gentiles\"[fn-77-P7707_2205866:530-nf] -to them, that is, \"who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death? \"[fn-77-P7708_2205989:531-nf] (None else, surely, than He), to whom the Spirit in the Psalm answers, in His foresight of the future, saying, \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, hath been displayed upon us.\"[fn-77-P7709_2206205:532-nf] Now the countenance (or person[fn-77-P7710_2206262:533-nf] ) of the Lord here is Christ. Wherefore the apostle said above: Christ, who is the image of God.\"[fn-77-P7711_2206409:534-nf] Since Christ, then, is the person of the Creator, who said, \"Let there be light,\" it follows that Christ and the apostles, and the gospel, and the veil, and Moses-nay, the whole of the dispensations-belong to the God who is the Creator of this world, according to the testimony of the clause (above adverted to), and certainly not to him who never said, \"Let there be light.\" I here pass over discussion about another epistle, which we hold to have been written to the Ephesians, but the heretics to the Laodiceans. In it he tells[fn-77-P7712_2206961:535-nf] them to remember, that at the time when they were Gentiles they were without Christ, aliens from (the commonwealth of) Israel, without intercourse, without the covenants and any hope of promise, nay, without God, even in his own world,[fn-77-P7713_2207209:536-nf] as the Creator thereof. Since therefore he said, that the Gentiles were without God, whilst their god was the devil, not the Creator, it is clear that he must be understood to be the lord of this world, whom the Gentiles received as their god-not the Creator, of whom they were in ignorance. But how does it happen, that \"the treasure which we have in these earthen vessels of ours\"[fn-77-P7714_2207612:537-nf] should not be regarded as belonging to the God who owns the vessels? Now since God's glory is, that so great a treasure is contained in earthen vessels, and since these earthen vessels are of the Creator's make, it follows that the glory is the Creator's; nay, since these vessels of His smack so much of the excellency of the power of God, that power itself must be His also! Indeed, all these things have been consigned to the said \"earthen vessels\" for the very purpose that His excellence might be manifested forth. Henceforth, then, the rival god will have no claim to the glory, and consequently none to the power. Rather, dishonour and weakness will accrue to him, because the earthen vessels with which he had nothing to do have received all the excellency! Well, then, if it be in these very earthen vessels that he tells us we have to endure so great sufferings,[fn-77-P7715_2208506:538-nf] in which we bear about with us the very dying of God,[fn-77-P7716_2208584:539-nf] (Marcion's) god is really ungrateful and unjust, if he does not mean to restore this same I substance of ours at the resurrection, wherein so much has been endured in loyalty to him, in which Christ's very death is borne about, wherein too the excellency of his power is treasured.[fn-77-P7717_2209030:540-nf] For he gives prominence to the statement, \"That the life also of Christ may be manifested in our body,\"[fn-77-P7718_2209156:541-nf] as a contrast to the preceding, that His death is borne about in our body. Now of what life of Christ does he here speak? Of that which we are now living? Then how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the things which are seen and are temporal, but to those which are not seen and are eternal[fn-77-P7719_2209494:542-nf] -in other words, not to the present, but to the future? But if it be of the future life of Christ that he speaks, intimating that it is to be made manifest in our body,[fn-77-P7720_2209688:543-nf] then he has clearly predicted the resurrection of the flesh.[fn-77-P7721_2209771:544-nf] He says, too, that \"our outward man perishes,\"[fn-77-P7722_2209840:545-nf] not meaning by an eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in reference to which he previously said, \"For which cause we will not faint.\"[fn-77-P7723_2210021:546-nf] Now, when he adds of \"the inward man\" also, that it \"is renewed day by day,\" he demonstrates both issues here-the wasting away of the body by the wear and tear[fn-77-P7724_2210203:547-nf] of its trials, and the renewal of the soul[fn-77-P7725_2210264:548-nf] by its contemplation of the promises.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":25,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If the Father \"sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,\"[fn-78-P7832_2232206:646-nf] it must not therefore be said that the flesh which He seemed to have was but a phantom. For he in a previous verse ascribed sin to the flesh, and made it out to be \"the law of sin dwelling in his members,\" and \"warring against the law of the mind.\"[fn-78-P7833_2232476:647-nf] On this account, therefore, (does he mean to say that) the Son was sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, that He might redeem this sinful flesh by a like substance, even a fleshly one, which bare a resemblance to sinful flesh, although it was itself free from sin. Now this will be the very perfection of divine power to effect the salvation (of man) in a nature like his own,[fn-78-P7834_2232890:648-nf] For it would be no great matter if the Spirit of God remedied the flesh; but when a flesh, which is the very copy[fn-78-P7835_2233017:649-nf] of the sinning substance-itself flesh also-only without sin, (effects the remedy, then doubtless it is a great thing). The likeness, therefore, will have reference to the quality[fn-78-P7836_2233215:650-nf] of the sinfulness, and not to any falsity[fn-78-P7837_2233273:651-nf] of the substance. Because he would not have added the attribute \"sinful,\"[fn-78-P7838_2233365:652-nf] if he meant the \"likeness\" to be so predicated of the substance as to deny the verity thereof; in that case he would only have used the word \"flesh,\" and omitted the \"sinful.\" But inasmuch as he has put the two together, and said \"sinful flesh,\" (or \"flesh of sin,\")[fn-78-P7839_2234360:653-nf] he has both affirmed the substance, that is, the flesh and referred the likeness to the fault of the substance, that is, to its sin. But even suppose[fn-78-P7840_2234533:654-nf] that the likeness was predicated of the substance, the truth of the said substance will not be thereby denied. Why then call the true substance like? Because it is indeed true, only not of a seed of like condition[fn-78-P7841_2234765:655-nf] with our own; but true still, as being of a nature[fn-78-P7842_2234831:656-nf] not really unlike ours.[fn-78-P7843_2235083:657-nf] And again, in contrary things there is no likeness. Thus the likeness of flesh would not be called spirit, because flesh is not susceptible of any likeness to spirit; but it would be called phantom, if it seemed to be that which it really was not. It is, however, called likeness, since it is what it seems to be. Now it is (what it seems to be), because it is on a par with the other thing (with which it is compared).[fn-78-P7844_2236221:658-nf] But a phantom, which is merely such and nothing else,[fn-78-P7845_2236304:659-nf] is not a likeness. The apostle, however, himself here comes to our aid; for, while explaining in what sense he would not have us \"live in the flesh,\" although in the flesh-even by not living in the works of the flesh[fn-78-P7846_2236549:660-nf] -he shows that when he wrote the words, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\"[fn-78-P7847_2236670:661-nf] it was not with the view of condemning the substance (of the flesh), but the works thereof; and because it is possible for these not to be committed by us whilst we are still in the flesh, they will therefore be properly chargeable,[fn-78-P7848_2236925:662-nf] not on the substance of the flesh, but on its conduct. Likewise, if \"the body indeed is dead because of sin\" (from which statement we see that not the death of the soul is meant, but that of the body), \"but the spirit is life because of righteousness,\"[fn-78-P7849_2237246:663-nf] it follows that this life accrues to that which incurred death because of sin, that is, as we have just seen, the body. Now the body[fn-78-P7850_2237401:664-nf] is only restored to him who had lost it; so that the resurrection of the dead implies the resurrection of their bodies. He accordingly subjoins: \"He that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies.\"[fn-78-P7851_2237664:665-nf] In these words he both affirmed the resurrection of the flesh (without which nothing can rightly be called[fn-78-P7852_2237793:666-nf] body, nor can anything be properly regarded as mortal), and proved the bodily substance of Christ; inasmuch as our own mortal bodies will be quickened in precisely the same way as He was raised; and that was in no other way than in the body. I have here a very wide gulf of expunged Scripture to leap across;[fn-78-P7853_2238217:667-nf] however, I alight on the place where the apostle bears record of Israel \"that they have a zeal of God\"-their own God, of course-\"but not according to knowledge. For,\" says he, \"being ignorant of (the righteousness of) God, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God; for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"[fn-78-P7854_2239212:668-nf] Hereupon we shall be confronted with an argument of the heretic, that the Jews were ignorant of the superior God,[fn-78-P7855_2239346:669-nf] since, in opposition to him, they set up their own righteousness-that is, the righteousness of their law-not receiving Christ, the end (or finisher) of the law. But how then is it that he bears testimony to their zeal for their own God, if it is not in respect of the same God that he upbraids them for their ignorance? They were affected indeed with zeal for God, but it was not an intelligent zeal: they were, in fact, ignorant of Him, because they were ignorant of His dispensations by Christ, who was to bring about the consummation of the law; and in this way did they maintain their own righteousness in opposition to Him. But so does the Creator Himself testify to their ignorance concerning Him: \"Israel hath not known me; my people have not understood me; \"[fn-78-P7856_2240172:670-nf] and as to their preferring the establishment of their own righteousness, (the Creator again describes them as) \"teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; \"[fn-78-P7857_2240352:671-nf] moreover, as \"having gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ\"[fn-78-P7858_2240472:672-nf] -from ignorance of Him, of course. Now nothing can be expounded of another god which is applicable to the Creator; otherwise the apostle would not have been just in reproaching the Jews with ignorance in respect of a god of whom they knew nothing. For where had been their sin, if they only maintained the righteousness of their own God against one of whom they were ignorant? But he exclaims: \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God; how unsearchable also are His ways!\"[fn-78-P7859_2240971:673-nf] Whence this outburst of feeling? Surely from the recollection of the Scriptures, which he had been previously turning over, as well as from his contemplation of the mysteries which he had been setting forth above, in relation to the faith of Christ coming from the law.[fn-78-P7860_2241261:674-nf] If Marcion had an object in his erasures,[fn-78-P7861_2241433:675-nf] why does his apostle utter such an exclamation, because his god has no riches for him to contemplate? So poor and indigent was he, that he created nothing, predicted nothing-in short, possessed nothing; for it was into the world of another God that he descended. The truth is, the Creator's resources and riches, which once had been hidden, were now disclosed. For so had He promised: \"I will give to them treasures which have been hidden, and which men have not seen will I open to them.\"[fn-78-P7862_2242257:676-nf] Hence, then, came the exclamation, \"O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God!\" For His treasures were now opening out. This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of (the apostle's own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of the prophet: \"Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? \"[fn-78-P7863_2242679:677-nf] Now, (Marcion, ) since you have expunged so much from the Scriptures, why did you retain these words, as if they too were not the Creator's words? But come now, let us see without mistake[fn-78-P7864_2242954:678-nf] the precepts of your new god: \"Abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.\"[fn-78-P7865_2243072:679-nf] Well, is the precept different in the Creator's teaching? \"Take away the evil from you, depart from it, and be doing good.\"[fn-78-P7866_2243216:680-nf] Then again: \"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.\"[fn-78-P7867_2243309:681-nf] Now is not this of the same import as: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self? \"[fn-78-P7868_2243415:682-nf] (Again, your apostle says: ) \"Rejoicing in hope; \"[fn-78-P7869_2243487:683-nf] that is, of God. So says the Creator's Psalmist: \"It is better to hope in the Lord, than to hope even in princes.\"[fn-78-P7870_2243623:684-nf] \"Patient in tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7871_2243671:685-nf] You have (this in) the Psalm: \"The Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation.\"[fn-78-P7872_2243770:686-nf] \"Bless, and curse not,\"[fn-78-P7873_2243812:687-nf] (says your apostle.) But what better teacher of this will you find than Him who created all things, and blessed them? \"Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.\"[fn-78-P7874_2244046:688-nf] For against such a disposition Isaiah pronounces a woe.[fn-78-P7875_2244123:689-nf] \"Recompense to no man evil for evil.\"[fn-78-P7876_2244180:690-nf] (Like unto which is the Creator's precept: ) \"Thou shalt not remember thy brother's evil against thee.\"[fn-78-P7877_2244305:691-nf] (Again: ) \"Avenge not yourselves; \"[fn-78-P7878_2244366:692-nf] for it is written, \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\"[fn-78-P7879_2244457:693-nf] \"Live peaceably with all men.\"[fn-78-P7880_2244538:694-nf] The retaliation of the law, therefore, permitted not retribution for an injury; it rather repressed any attempt thereat by the fear of a recompense. Very properly, then, did he sum up the entire teaching of the Creator in this precept of His: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\"[fn-78-P7881_2244846:695-nf] Now, if this is the recapitulation of the law from the very law itself, I am at a loss to know who is the God of the law. I fear He must be Marcion's god (after all).[fn-78-P7882_2245034:696-nf] If also the gospel of Christ is fulfilled in this same precept, but not the Creator's Christ, what is the use of our contending any longer whether Christ did or did not say, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it? \"[fn-78-P7883_2245389:697-nf] In vain has (our man of) Pontus laboured to deny this statement.[fn-78-P7884_2245474:698-nf] If the gospel has not fulfilled the law, then all I can say is,[fn-78-P7885_2245698:699-nf] the law has fulfilled the gospel. But it is well that in a later verse he threatens us with \"the judgment-seat of Christ,\"-the Judge, of course, and the Avenger, and therefore the Creator's (Christ). This Creator, too, however much he may preach up another god, he certainly sets forth for us as a Being to be served,[fn-78-P7886_2246029:700-nf] if he holds Him thus up as an object to be feared.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Exodus the people said to Aaron: \"Arise and make us gods which shall go before us: because as for this man Moses, who brought us out of Egypt, we know not what has become of him.\"[fn-79-P7946_2665443:6-nf] In the same place also Moses says to the Lord: \"O Lord, I pray thee, this people have sinned! a great sin.

He now points out by this word \"He,\" the Word who is God, and gathers up into a fourth proposition the three which went before, \"In the beginning was the Word,\" \"The Word was with God,\" and \"The Word was God.\" Now he says, He, this (Word) was in the beginning with God. The term beginning may be taken of the beginning of the world, so that we may learn from what is said that the Word was older than the things which were made from the beginning. For if \"in the beginning God created heaven and earth,\" but \"He\" was in the beginning, then the Logos is manifestly older than those things which were made at the beginning, older not only than the firmament and the dry land, but than the heavens and earth. Now some one might ask, and not unreasonably, why it is not said, \"In the beginning was the Word of God, and the Word of God was with God, and the Word of God was God.\" But he who asked such a question could be shown to be taking for granted that there are a plurality of logoi, differing perhaps from each other in kind, one being the word of God, another perhaps the word of angels, a third of men, and so on with the other logoi. Now, if this were so with the Logos, the case would be the same with wisdom and with righteousness. But it would be absurd that there should be a number of things equally to be called \"The Word; \"and the same would apply to wisdom and to righteousness. We shall be driven to confess that we ought not to look for a plurality of logoi, or of wisdom, or of righteousness, if we look at the case of truth. Any one will confess that there is only one truth; it could never be said in this case that there is one truth of God, and another of the angels, and another of man,-it lies ill the nature of things that the truth about anything is one. Now, if truth be one, it is clear that the preparation of it and its demonstration, which is wisdom, must in reason be conceived as one, since what is regarded as wisdom cannot justly claim that title where truth, which is one, is absent from its grasp. But if truth is one and wisdom one, then Reason (Logos) also, which announces truth and makes truth simple and manifest to those who are fitted to receive it, will be one. This we say, by no means denying that truth and wisdom and reason are of God, but we wish to indicate the purpose of the omission in this passage of the words \"of God,\" and of the form of the statement, \"In the beginning the Logos was with God.\" The same John in the Apocalypse gives Him His name with the addition \"of God,\" where he says:[fn-64-P6442_1063492:10-nf] \"And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and He that sat thereon called Faithful and True; and in righteousness doth He judge and make war. And His eyes are as a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems, and He hath a name written which no one knoweth but He Himself. And He is arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood, and His name is called[fn-64-P6443_1063877:11-nf] Word of God. And His armies in heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in pure fine linen. And out of His mouth proceedeth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations, and He shall rule them with a rod of iron, and He treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God. And He hath on His garment and on His thigh a name written: King of kings, and Lord of lords.\" In this passage Logos is necessarily spoken of absolutely without the article, and also with the addition Logos of God; had the first not been the case (i.e., had the article been given) we might have been led to take up the meaning wrongly,[fn-64-P6444_1064567:12-nf] and so to depart from the truth about the Logos. For if it had been called simply Logos, and had not been said to be the Logos of God, then we would not be clearly informed that the Logos is the Logos of God. And, again, had it been called Logos of God but not said to be Logos absolutely, then we might imagine many logoi, according to the constitution of each of the rational beings which exist; then we might assume a number of logoi properly so called. Again, in his description in the Apocalypse of the Logos of God, the Apostle and Evangelist (and the Apocalypse entitles him to be styled a prophet, too) says he saw the Word of God in the opened heaven, and that He was riding on a white horse. Now we must consider what he means to convey when he speaks of heaven being opened and of the white horse, and of the Word of God riding on the white horse, and also what is meant by saying that the Word of God is Faithful and True, and that in righteousness He judges and makes war. All this will greatly advance our study on the subject of the Word of God. Now I conceive heaven to have been shut against the ungodly, and those who bear the image of the earthly, and to have been opened to the righteous and those adorned with the image of the heavenly. For to the former, being below and still dwelling in the flesh, the better things are closed, since they cannot understand them and have neither power nor will to see their beauty, looking down as they do and not striving to look up. But to the excellent, or those who have their commonwealth in heaven,[fn-64-P6445_1066168:13-nf] he opens, with the key of David, the things in heavenly places and discloses them to their view, and makes all clear to them by riding on his horse. These words also have their meaning; the horse is white because it is the nature of higher knowledge (gnw=sij) to be clear and white and full of light. And on the white horse sits He who is called Faithful, seated more firmly, and so to speak more royally, on words which cannot be set aside, words which run sharply and more swiftly than any horse, and overhear in their rushing course every so-called word that simulates the Word, and every so-called truth that simulates the Truth. He who sits on the white horse is called Faithful, not because of the faith He cherishes, but of that which He inspires, because He is worthy of faith. Now the Lord Jehovah, according to Moses,[fn-64-P6446_1067019:14-nf] is Faithful and True. He is true also in respect of His relation to shadow, type, and image; for such is the Word who is in the opened heaven, for He is not on earth as He is in heaven; on earth He is made flesh and speaks through shadow, type, and image. The multitude, therefore, of those who are reputed to believe are disciples of the shadow of the Word, not of the true Word of God which is in the opened heaven. Hence Jeremiah says,[fn-64-P6447_1067479:15-nf] \"The Spirit of our face is Christ the Lord, of whom we said, In His shadow shall we live among the nations.\" Thus the Word of God who is called Faithful is also called True, and ill righteousness He judges and makes war; since He has received from God the faculty of judging in very righteousness and very judgment, and of apportioning its due to every existing creature. For none of those who have some portion of righteousness and of the faculty of judgment can receive on his soul such copies and impressions of righteousness and judgment as to come short in no point of absolute righteousness and absolute justice, just as no painter of a picture can communicate to the representation all the qualities of the original. This, I conceive, is the reason why David says,[fn-64-P6448_1068269:16-nf] \"Before Thee shall no living being be justified.\" He does not say, no man, or no angel, but no living being, since even if any being partakes of life and has altogether put off mortality, not even then can it be justified in comparison of Thee, who art, as it were, Life itself. Nor is it possible that one who partakes of life and is therefore called living, should become life itself, or that one who partakes of righteousness and, therefore, is called righteous should become equal to righteousness itself. Now it is the function of the Word of God, not only to judge in righteousness, but also to make war in righteousness, that by making war on His enemies by reason and righteousness, so that what is irrational and wicked is destroyed,[fn-64-P6449_1069032:17-nf] He may dwell in the soul of him who, for his salvation, so to speak, has become captive to Christ, and may justify that soul and cast out from her all adversaries. We shall, however, obtain a better view of this war which the Word carries on if we remember that He is an ambassador for the truth. while there is another who pretends to be the Word and is not, and one who calls herself the truth and is not, but a lie. Then the Word, arming Himself against the lie, slays it with the breath of His mouth and brings it to naught by the manifestation of His coming.[fn-64-P6450_1069633:18-nf] And consider whether these words of the Apostle to the Thessalonians may be understood in an intellectual sense. For what is that which is destroyed by the breath of the mouth of Christ, Christ being the Word and Truth and Wisdom, but the lie? And what is that which is brought to naught by the manifestation of Christ's coming, Christ being conceived as wisdom and reason, what but that which announces itself as wisdom, when in reality it is one of those things with which God deals as the Apostle describes,[fn-64-P6451_1070166:19-nf] \"He taketh the wise, those who are not wise with the true wisdom, in their own craftiness\"? To what he says of the rider on the white horse, John adds the wonderful statement: \"His eyes are like a flame of fire.\" For as the flame of fire is bright and illuminating, but at the same thee fiery and destructive of material things, so, if I may so say, are the eyes of the Logos with which He sees, and every one who has part in Him; they have not only the inherent quality of laying hold of the things of the mind, but also that of consuming and putting away those conceptions which are more material and gross, since whatever is in any way false flees from the directness and lightness of truth. It is in a very natural order that after speaking of Him who judges in righteousness and makes war in accordance with His righteous judgments, and then after His warring of His giving light, the writer goes on to say, \"On His head are many diadems.\" For had the lie been one, and of one form only, against which the True and Faithful Word contended, and for conquering which. He was crowned, then one crown alone would naturally have been given Him for the victory. As it is, however, as the lies are many which profess the truth and for warring against which the Word is crowned, the diadems are many which surround the head of the conqueror of them all. As He has overcome every revolting power many diadems mark His victory. Then after the diadems He is said to have a name written which no one knows but He Himself. For there are some things which are known to the Word alone; for the beings which come into existence after Him have a poorer nature than His, and none of them is able to behold all that He apprehends. And perhaps it is the case that only those who have part in that Word know the things which are kept from the knowledge of those who do not partake of Him. Now, in John's vision, the Word of God as He rides on the white horse is not naked: He is clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood, for the Word who was made flesh and therefore died is surrounded with marks of the fact that His blood was poured out upon the earth, when the soldier pierced His side. For of that passion, even should it be our lot some day to come to that highest and supreme contemplation of the Logos, we shall not lose all memory, nor shall we forget the truth that our admission was brought about by His sojourning in our body. This Word of God is followed by the heavenly armies one and all; they follow the Word as their leader, and imitate Him in all things, and chiefly in having mounted, they also, white horses. To him that understands, this secret is open. And as sorrow and grief and wailing fled away at the end of things, so also, I suppose, did obscurity and doubt, all the mysteries of God's wisdom being precisely and clearly opened. Look also at the white horses of the followers of the Word and at the white and pure linen with which they were clothed. As linen comes out of the earth, may not those linen garments stand for the dialects on the earth in which those voices are clothed which make clear announcements of things? We have dealt at some length with the statements found in the Apocalypse about the Word of God; it is important for us to know clearly about Him.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":32,"verse":39,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"ANF-03","text":"To recapitulate, then: Shall that very flesh, which the Divine Creator formed with His own hands in the image of God; which He animated with His own afflatus, after the likeness of His own vital vigour; which He set over all the works of His hand, to dwell amongst, to enjoy, and to rule them; which He clothed with His sacraments and His instructions; whose purity He loves, whose mortifications He approves; whose sufferings for Himself He deems precious;-(shall that flesh, I say), so often brought near to God, not rise again?

To the flesh, therefore, applies everything which is declared respecting the blood, for without the flesh there cannot be blood. The flesh will be raised up in order that the blood may be punished.

Now it is the flesh which is killed by death; the flesh, therefore, will be revived by the resurrection. Surely if killing means taking away life from the flesh, and its opposite, reviving, amounts to restoring life to the flesh, it must needs be that the flesh rise again, to which the life, which has been taken away by killing, has to be restored by vivification.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_33_oration_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"94","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"90.

Moreover, a presumptuous confidence in baptism introduces all kind of vicious delay and tergiversation with regard to repentance; for, feeling sure of undoubted pardon of their sins, men meanwhile steal the intervening time, and make it for themselves into a holiday-time[fn-113-P11330_3212277:48-nf] for sinning, rather than a time for learning not to sin. Further, how inconsistent is it to expect pardon of sins (to be granted) to a repentance which they have not fulfilled! This is to hold out your hand for merchandise, but not produce the price. For repentance is the price at which the Lord has determined to award pardon: He proposes the redemption[fn-113-P11331_3212703:49-nf] of release from penalty at this compensating exchange of repentance. If, then, sellers first examine the coin with which they make their bargains, to see whether it be cut, or scraped, or adulterated,[fn-113-P11332_3212927:50-nf] we believe likewise that the Lord, when about to make us the grant of so costly merchandise, even of eternal life, first institutes a probation of our repentance. \"But meanwhile let us defer the reality of our repentance: it will then, I suppose, be clear that we are amended when we are absolved.\"[fn-113-P11333_3213259:51-nf] By no means; (but our amendment should be manifested) while, pardon being in abeyance, there is still a prospect of penalty; while the penitent does not yet merit-so far as merit we can-his liberation; while God is threatening, not while He is forgiving. For what slave, after his position has been changed by reception of freedom, charges himself with his (past) thefts and desertions? What soldier, after his discharge, makes satisfaction for his (former) brands? A sinner is bound to bemoan himself before receiving pardon, because the time of repentance is coincident with that of peril and of fear. Not that I deny that the divine benefit-the putting away of sins, I mean-is in every way sure to such as are on the point of entering the (baptismal) water; but what we have to labour for is, that it may be granted us to attain that blessing. For who will grant to you, a man of so faithless repentance, one single sprinkling of any water whatever? To approach it by stealth, indeed, and to get the minister appointed over this business misled by your asseverations, is easy; but God takes foresight for His own treasure, and suffers not the unworthy to steal a march upon it. What, in fact, does He say? \"Nothing hid which shall not be revealed.\"[fn-113-P11334_3214534:52-nf] Draw whatever (veil of) darkness you please over your deeds, \"God is light.\"[fn-113-P11335_3214631:53-nf] But some think as if God were under a necessity of bestowing even on the unworthy, what He has engaged (to give); and they turn His liberality into slavery. But if it is of necessity that God grants us the symbol of death,[fn-113-P11336_3214872:54-nf] then He does so unwilling. But who permits a gift to be permanently retained which he has granted unwillingly? For do not many afterward fall out of (grace)? is not this gift taken away from many? These, no doubt, are they who do steal a march upon (the treasure), who, after approaching to the faith of repentance, set up on the sands a house doomed to ruin. Let no one, then, flatter himself on the ground of being assigned to the \"recruit-classes\" of learners, as if on that account he have a licence even now to sin. As soon as you \"know the Lord,[fn-113-P11337_3215496:55-nf] you should fear Him; as soon as you have gazed on Him, you should reverence Him. But what difference does your \"knowing\" Him make, while you rest in the same practises as in days bygone, when you knew Him not? What, moreover, is it which distinguishes you from a perfected[fn-113-P11338_3215821:56-nf] servant of God? Is there one Christ for the baptized, another for the learners? Have they some different hope or reward? some different dread of judgment? some different necessity for repentance? That baptismal washing is a sealing of faith, which faith is begun and is commended by the faith of repentance. We are not washed in order that we may cease sinning, but because we have ceased, since in heart we have been bathed[fn-113-P11339_3216269:57-nf] already. For the first baptism of a learner is this, a perfect fear;[fn-113-P11340_3216382:58-nf] thenceforward, in so far as you have understanding of the Lord faith is sound, the conscience having once for all embraced repentance. Otherwise, if it is (only) after the baptismal waters that we cease sinning, it is of necessity, not of free-will, that we put on innocence. Who, then, is pro-eminent in goodness? he who is not allowed, or he whom it displeases, to be evil? he who is bidden, or he whose pleasure it is, to be free from crime? Let us, then, neither keep our hands from theft unless the hardness of bars withstand us, nor refrain our eyes from the concupiscence of fornication unless we be withdrawn by guardians of our persons, if no one who has surrendered himself to the Lord is to cease sinning unless he be bound thereto by baptism. But if any entertain this sentiment, I know not whether he, after baptism, do not feel more sadness to think that he has ceased from sinning, than gladness that he hath escaped from it. And so it is becoming that learners desire baptism, but do not hastily receive it: for he who desires it, honours it; he who hastily receives it, disdains it: in the one appears modesty, in the other arrogance; the former satisfies, the latter neglects it; the former covets to merit it, but the latter promises it to himself as a due return; the former takes, the latter usurps it. Whom would you judge worthier, except one who is more amended? whom more amended, except one who is more timid, and on that account has fulfilled the duty of true repentance? for he has feared to continue still in sin, lest he should not merit the reception of baptism. But the hasty receiver, inasmuch as he promised it himself (as his due), being forsooth secure (of obtaining it), could not fear: thus he fulfilled not repentance either, because he lacked the instrumental agent of repentance, that is, fear.[fn-113-P11341_3218238:59-nf] Hasty reception is the portion of irreverence; it inflates the seeker, it despises the Giver. And thus it sometimes deceives,[fn-113-P11342_3218376:60-nf] for it promises to itself the gift before it be due; whereby He who is to furnish the gift is ever offended.","title":"On Repentance.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"265","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"Moreover, you were commanded to abstain from certain kinds of food, in order that you might keep God before your eyes while you ate and drank, seeing that you were prone and very ready to depart from His knowledge, as Moses also affirms: `The people ate and drank, and rose up to play.'[fn-42-P4226_840804:47-nf] And again: `Jacob ate, and was satisfied, and waxed fat; and he who was beloved kicked: he waxed fat, he grew thick, he was enlarged, and he forsook God who had made him.'[fn-42-P4227_840995:48-nf] For it was told you by Moses in the book of Genesis, that God granted to Noah, being a just man, to eat of every animal, but not of flesh with the blood, which is dead.\"[fn-42-P4228_841187:49-nf] And as he was ready to say, \"as the green herbs,\" I anticipated him: \"Why do you not receive this statement, `as the green herbs, 'in the sense in which it was given by God, to wit, that just as God has granted the herbs for sustenance to man, even so has He given the animals for the diet of flesh?

Noah, moreover, was the father of Abraham, and in fact of all men; and others were the progenitors of others. What larger measure of grace, then, did Christ bestow on Abraham? This, namely, that He called him with His voice by the like calling, telling him to quit the land wherein he dwelt. And He has called all of us by that voice, and we have left already the way of living in which we used to spend our days, passing our time in evil after the fashions of the other inhabitants of the earth; and along with Abraham we shall inherit the holy land, when we shall receive the inheritance for an endless eternity, being children of Abraham through the like faith.

I might well reply as I have done even if it were a question of a promise made with full consciousness. But this is a new and shameless thing; he throws in my teeth a mere dream. How am I to answer? I have no time for thinking of anything outside my own sphere. I wish that I were not prevented from reading even the Holy Scriptures by the throngs that beset this place, and the gathering of Christians from all parts of the world. Still, when a man makes a dream into a crime, I can quote to him the words of the Prophets, who say that we are not to believe dreams; for even to dream of adultery does not condemn us to hell, and to dream of the crown of martyrdom does not raise us to heaven. Often I have seen myself in dreams dead and placed in the grave: often I have flown over the earth and been carried as if swimming through the air, over mountains and seas. My accuser might, therefore, demand that I should cease to live, or that I should have wings on my shoulders, because my mind has often been mocked in sleep by vague fancies of this kind. How many people are rich while asleep and wake to find themselves beggars! or are drinking water to cool their thirst, and wake up with their throats parched and burning! You exact from me the fulfilment of a promise given in a dream. I will meet you with a truer and closer question: Have you done all that you promised in your baptism? Have you or I fulfilled all that the profession of a monk demands? I beg you, think whether you are not looking at the mote in my eye through the beam in your own. I say this against my will; it is by sorrow that my reluctant tongue is forced into words. As to you, it is not enough for you to make up charges about my waking deeds, but you must accuse me for my dreams. You have such an interest in my actions that you must discuss what I have said or done in my sleep. I will not dwell on the way in which, in your zeal to speak against me, you have besmirched your own profession, and have done all you can by word and deed for the dishonouring of the whole body of Christians. But I give you fair warning, and will repeat it again and again. You are attacking a creature who has horns: and, if it were not that I lay to heart the words of the Apostle[fn-91-P9194_2471053:68-nf] \"The evil speakers[fn-91-P9195_2471092:69-nf] shall not inherit the kingdom of God,\" and[fn-91-P9196_2471160:70-nf] \"By hating one another you have been consumed one of another,\" I would make you feel what a vast discord you have stirred up after a slight and pretended reconciliation. What advantage is it to you to heap up slanders against me both among friends and strangers? Is it because I am not an Origenist, and do not believe that I sinned in heaven, that I am accused as a sinner upon earth? And was the result of our renewal of friendship to be, that I was not to speak against heretics for fear that my notice of them should be taken for an assault upon you? So long as I did not refuse to be belauded by you, you followed me as a master, you called me friend and brother, and acknowledged me as a catholic in every respect. But when I asked to be spared your praises, and judged myself unworthy to have such a great man for my trumpeter, you immediately ran your pen through what you had written, and began to abuse all that you had praised before, and to pour forth from the same mouth both sweet and bitter words. I wish you could understand what self-repression I am exerting in not suiting my words to the boiling heat of my breast; and how I pray, like the Psalmist:[fn-91-P9197_2472347:71-nf] \"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep the door of my lips. Incline not my heart to the words of malice;\" and, as he says elsewhere:[fn-91-P9198_2472516:72-nf] \"While the wicked stood before me I was dumb and was humbled and kept silence even from good words;\" and again:[fn-91-P9199_2472661:73-nf] \"I became as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs.\" But for me the Lord the Avenger will reply, as he says through the Prophet:[fn-92-P9200_2472832:74-nf] \"Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord\": and in another place:[fn-92-P9201_2472927:75-nf] \"Thou satest and spakest against thy brother, and hast slandered thy mother's son.

And he changes the words in the expression, \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me,\" and does not give what follows immediately after, which manifests at once the ready obedience of Jesus to His Father, and His greatness of mind, and which runs thus: \"Nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-81-P8144_2013807:72-nf] Nay, even the cheerful obedience of Jesus to the will of His Father in those things which He was condemned to suffer, exhibited in the declaration, \"If this cup cannot pass from Me except I drink it, Thy will be done,\" he pretends not to have observed, acting here like those wicked individuals who listen to the Holy Scriptures in a malignant spirit, and \"who talk wickedness with lofty head.\" For they appear to have heard the declaration, \"I kill,\"[fn-81-P8145_2014280:73-nf] and they often make it to us a subject of reproach; but the words, \"I will make alive,\" they do not remember,-the whole sentence showing that those who live amid public wickedness, and who work wickedly, are put to death by God, and that a better life is infused into them instead, even one which God will give to those who have died to sin. And so also these men have heard the words, \"I will smite; \"but they do not see these, \"and I will heal,\" which are like the words of a physician, who cuts bodies asunder, and inflicts severe wounds, in order to extract from them substances that are injurious and prejudicial to health, and who does not terminate his work with pains and lacerations, but by his treatment restores the body to that state of soundness which he has in view. Moreover, they have not heard the whole of the announcement, \"For He maketh sore, and again bindeth up; \"but only this part, \"He maketh sore.\" So in like manner acts this Jew of Celsus who quotes the words, \"O Father, would that this cup might pass from Me; \"but who does not add what follows, and which exhibits the firmness of Jesus, and His preparedness for suffering.

For, as with regard to these ignorant persons, the legislators, according to their ideas of utility, caused them to be surrounded with appropriate guidance and laws, so God, legislating through Jesus Christ for men in all parts of the world, brings: to Himself even those who are not wise in the way in which it is possible for such persons to be brought to a better life. And God, well knowing this, as we have already shown in the preceding pages, says in the books of Moses \"They have moved Me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked Me to anger with their idols: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.\"[fn-89-P8928_2283599:224-nf] And Paul also, knowing this, said, \"But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise,\"[fn-89-P8929_2283738:225-nf] calling, in a general way, wise all who appear to have made advances in knowledge, but have fallen into an atheistic polytheism, since \"professing themselves to be wise they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.\"[fn-89-P8930_2284102:226-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":32,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_58_book_iv_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"ANF-04","text":"And it is not matter of surprise that in certain generations there have existed prophets who, in the reception of divine influence,[fn-90-P9030_2319892:26-nf] surpassed, by means of their stronger and more powerful (religious) life, other prophets who were their contemporaries, and others also who lived before and after them.

Therefore, as I have already said, He caused man (human nature) to cleave to and to become, one with God. For unless man had overcome the enemy of man, the enemy would not have been legitimately vanquished. And again: unless it had been God who had freely given salvation, we could never have possessed it securely. And unless man had been joined to God, he could never have become a partaker of incorruptibility. For it was incumbent upon the Mediator between God and men, by His relationship to both, to bring both to friendship and concord, and present man to God, while He revealed God to man.[fn-77-P7777_2124713:353-nf] For, in what way could we be partaken of the adoption of sons, unless we had received from Him through the Son that fellowship which refers to Himself, unless His Word, having been made flesh, had entered into communion with us? Wherefore also He passed through every stage of life, restoring to all communion with God. Those, therefore, who assert that He appeared putatively, and was neither born in the flesh nor truly made man, are as yet under the old condemnation, holding out patronage to sin; for, by their showing, death has not been vanquished, which \"reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression.\"[fn-77-P7778_2125602:354-nf] But the law coming, which was given by Moses, and testifying of sin that it is a sinner, did truly take away his (death's) kingdom, showing that he was no king, but a robber; and it revealed him as a murderer. It laid, however, a weighty burden upon man, who had sin in himself, showing that he was liable to death. For as the law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out in relief, but did not destroy it. For sin had no dominion over the spirit, but over man. For it behoved Him who was to destroy sin, and redeem man under the power of death, that He should Himself be made that very same thing which he was, that is, man; who had been drawn by sin into bondage, but was held by death, so that sin should be destroyed by man, and man should go forth from death. For as by the disobedience of the one man who was originally moulded from virgin soil, the many were made sinners,[fn-77-P7779_2126507:355-nf] and forfeited life; so was it necessary that, by the obedience of one man, who was originally born from a virgin, many should be justified and receive salvation. Thus, then, was the Word of God made man, as also Moses says: \"God, true are His works.\"[fn-77-P7780_2126777:356-nf] But if, not having been made flesh, He did appear as if flesh, His work was not a true one.

And this self-sufficiency the apostle himself teaches, not only by his letters but by his acts and deeds, ought to be shunned with all possible care, as he says that he went up to Jerusalem solely for this reason; viz., to communicate in a private and informal conference with his co-apostles and those who were before him that Gospel which he preached to the Gentiles, the grace of the Holy Spirit accompanying him with powerful signs and wonders: as he says \"And I communicated with them the Gospel which I preach among the Gentiles lest perhaps I had run or should run in vain.\"[fn-37-P3735_1399852:35-nf] Who then is so self-sufficient and blind as to dare to trust in his own judgment and discretion when the chosen vessel confesses that he had need of conference with his fellow apostles.

The history of barbarian nations, moreover, and especially that of Egypt, contains some such allusions to the division of the so-called Egyptian homes, when it states that Athena, who obtained Sais by lot, is the same who also has possession of Attica. And the learned among the Egyptians can enumerate innumerable instances of this kind, although I do not know whether they include the Jews and their country in this division. And now, so far as testimonies outside the word God bearing on this point are concerned, enough have been adduced for the present. We say, moreover, that our prophet of God and His genuine servant Moses, in his song in the book of Deuteronomy, makes a statement regarding the portioning out of the earth in the following terms: \"When the Most High divided the nations, when He dispersed the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the people according to the number of the angels of God; and the portion was His people Jacob, and Israel the cord of His inheritance.\"[fn-99-P9968_2612390:104-nf] And regarding the distribution of the nations, the same Moses, in his work entitled Genesis, thus expresses himself in the style of a historical narrative: \"And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech; and it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.\"[fn-99-P9969_2612767:105-nf] A little further on he continues: \"And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men had built.

Go to, let Us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. And the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city and the tower. Therefore is the name of it called Confusion;[fn-99-P9970_2613392:106-nf] because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.\"[fn-99-P9971_2613559:107-nf] In the treatise of Solomon, moreover, on \"Wisdom,\" and on the events at the time of the confusion of languages, when the division of the earth took place, we find the following regarding Wisdom: \"Moreover, the nations in their wicked conspiracy being confounded, she found out the righteous, and preserved him blameless unto God, and kept him strong in his tender compassion towards his son.\"[fn-99-P9972_2613977:108-nf] But on these subjects much, and that of a mystical kind, might be said; in keeping with which is the following: \"It is good to keep close the secret of a king,\"[fn-99-P9973_2614169:109-nf] -in order that the doctrine of the entrance of souls into bodies (not, however, that of the transmigration from one body into another) may not be thrown before the common understanding, nor what is holy given to the dogs, nor pearls be cast before swine.

I am told that some among you who are catechists and teachers of the Divine Word, take the lead in this tenet, who are diametrically opposed, so to speak, to Sabellius's opinions; for he blasphemously says that the Son is the Father, and the Father the Son, but they in some sort preach three Gods, as dividing the sacred Monad into three subsistences foreign to each other and utterly separate. For it must needs be that with the God of the Universe, the Divine Word is united, and the Holy Ghost must repose[fn-34-P3430_1367654:185-nf] and habitate in God; thus in one as in a summit, I mean the God of the Universe, must the Divine Triad[fn-34-P3431_1367778:186-nf] be gathered up and brought together. For it is the doctrine of the presumptuous Marcion, to sever and divide the Divine Monarchy into three origins,-a devil's teaching, not that of Christ's true disciples and lovers of the Saviour's lessons, For they know well that a Triad is preached by divine Scripture, but that neither Old Testament nor New preaches three Gods. Equally must one censure those who hold the: Son to be a work, and consider that the Lord has come into being, as one of things which really came to be; whereas the divine oracles witness to a generation suitable to Him and becoming, but not to any fashioning or making. A blasphemy then is it, not ordinary, but even the highest, to say that the Lord is in any sort a handiwork. For if He came to be Son, once He was not; but He was always, if (that is) He be in the Father, as He says Himself, and if the Christ be Word and Wisdom and Power (which, as ye know, divine Scripture says), and these attributes be powers of God. If then the Son came into being, once these attributes were not; consequently there was a time, when God was without them; which is most absurd. And why say more on these points to you, men full of the Spirit and well aware of the absurdities which come to view from saying that the Son is a work?

For the sense of `He created,' as ye know, is not one, for we must understand `He created' in this place, as `He set over the works made by Him,' that is, `made by the Son Himself.' And `He created' here must not be taken for `made,' for creating differs from making. `Is not He thy Father that hath bought thee? hath He not made thee and created thee[fn-34-P3433_1371382:188-nf] ?'says Moses in his great song in Deuteronomy.

Whence was Paul himself, who was first called Saul? That is, first proud, afterwards humble? For when he was Saul, his name was derived from Saul: now Saul was a proud king; and in his reign he persecuted the humble David.[fn-42-P4237_1806856:6-nf] So when he who was afterwards Paul,[fn-42-P4238_1806913:7-nf] was Saul, he was proud, at that time a persecutor of the innocent, at that time a waster of the Church. For he had received letters from the chief priests (burning as he was with zeal for the synagogue, and persecuting the Christian name), that he might show up whatever Christians he should find, to be punished.[fn-42-P4239_1807243:8-nf] While he is on his way, while he is breathing out slaughter, while he is thirsting for blood, he is thrown to the ground by the voice of Christ from heaven the persecutor, he is raised up the preacher. In him was fulfilled that which is written in the Prophet, \"I will wound and I will heal.\"[fn-42-P4240_1807556:9-nf] For that only in man cloth God wound, which lifteth itself up against God.

He gives pain, it is true; but he only gives pain, that he may bring the patient on to health. He gives pain; but if he did not, he would do no good. Christ then by one word laid Saul low, and raised up Paul; that is, He laid low the proud, and raised up the humble. For what was the reason of his change of name, that whereas he was afore called Saul, he chose afterwards to be called Paul; but that he acknowledged in himself that the name of Saul when he was a persecutor, had been a name of pride? He chose therefore a humble name; to be called Paul, that is, the least. For Paul is, \"the least.\" Paul is nothing else but little. And now glorying in this name, and giving us a lesson[fn-42-P4242_1808447:11-nf] of humility, he says, \"I am the least of the Apostles.\"[fn-42-P4243_1808520:12-nf] Whence then, whence was he, but of the people of the Jews?

Often for their probation, sometimes for their improvement, and in some cases because their sins deserve it. For their probation indeed, as we read that the blessed Abraham and Job and many of the saints endured countless tribulations; or this which is said to the people in Deuteronomy by Moses: \"And thou shalt remember all the way through which the Lord thy God hath brought thee for forty years through the desert, to afflict thee and to prove thee, and that the things that were in thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldst keep His Commandments or no:\"[fn-43-P4327_1597865:37-nf] and this which we find in the Psalms: \"I proved thee at the waters of strife.\"[fn-43-P4328_1597964:38-nf] To Job also: \"Thinkest thou that I have spoken for any other cause than that thou mightest be seen to be righteous?\"[fn-43-P4329_1598108:39-nf] But for improvement, when God chastens his righteous ones for some small and venial sins, or to raise them to a higher state of purity, and delivers them over to various trials, that He may purge away all their unclean thoughts, and, to use the prophet's word, the \"dross,\" which he sees to have collected in their secret parts, and may thus transmit them like pure gold, to the judgment to come, as He allows nothing to remain in them for the fire of judgment to discover when hereafter it searches them with penal torments according to this saying: \"Many are the tribulations of the righteous.\"[fn-43-P4330_1598728:40-nf] And: \"My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord, neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by Him. For whom the Lord loveth He chastiseth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. For what son is there whom the father doth not correct? But if ye are without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.\"[fn-43-P4331_1599108:41-nf] And in the Apocalypse: \"Those whom I love, I reprove and chasten.\"[fn-43-P4332_1599195:42-nf] To whom under the figure of Jerusalem the following words are spoken by Jeremiah, in the person of God: \"For I will utterly consume all the nations among which I scattered thee: but I will not utterly consume thee: but I will chastise thee in judgment, that thou mayest not seem to thyself innocent.\"[fn-43-P4333_1599515:43-nf] And for this life-giving cleansing David prays when he says: \"Prove me, O Lord, and try me; turn my reins and my heart.\"[fn-43-P4334_1599655:44-nf] Isaiah also, well knowing the value of this trial, says \"O Lord, correct us but with judgment: not in Thine anger.\"[fn-43-P4335_1599796:45-nf] And again: \"I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, for thou wast angry with me: Thy wrath is turned away, and Thou hast comforted me.\"[fn-43-P4336_1599985:46-nf] But as a punishment for sins, the blows of trial are inflicted, as where the Lord threatens that He will send plagues upon the people of Israel: \"I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground:\"[fn-43-P4337_1600247:47-nf] and \"In vain have I struck your children: they have not received correction.\"[fn-43-P4338_1600347:48-nf] In the Psalms also: \"Many are the scourges of the sinners:\"[fn-43-P4339_1600425:49-nf] and in the gospel: \"Behold thou art made whole: now sin no more, lest a worse thing happen unto thee.\"[fn-43-P4340_1600556:50-nf] We find, it is true, a fourth way also in which we know on the authority of Scripture that some sufferings are brought upon us simply for the manifestation of the glory of God and His works, according to these words of the gospel: \"Neither did this man sin nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him:\"[fn-43-P4341_1600905:51-nf] and again: \"This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God that the Son of God may be glorified by it.\"[fn-43-P4342_1601040:52-nf] There are also other sorts of vengeance, with which some who have overpassed the bounds of wickedness are smitten in this life, as we read that Dathan and Abiram or Korah were punished, or above all, those of whom the Apostle speaks: \"Wherefore God gave them up to vile passions and a reprobate mind:\"[fn-43-P4343_1601362:53-nf] and this must be counted worse than all other punishments. For of these the Psalmist says: \"They are not in the labours of men; neither shall they be scourged like other men.\"[fn-43-P4344_1601559:54-nf] For theyare not worthy of being healed by the visitation of the Lord which gives life, and by plagues in this world, as \"in despair they have given themselves over to lasciviousness, unto the working of all error unto uncleanness,\"[fn-43-P4345_1601820:55-nf] and as by hardening their hearts, and by growing accustomed and used to sin they have got beyond cleansing in this brief life and punishment in the present world: men, who are thus reproved by the holy word of the prophet: \"I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet you returned not to Me, saith the Lord,\"[fn-43-P4346_1602225:56-nf] and Jeremiah: \"I have killed and destroyed thy people, and yet they are not returned from their ways.\"[fn-43-P4347_1602346:57-nf] And again: \"Thou hast smitten them and they have not grieved: Thou hast bruised them and they refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than the rock, they have refused to return.\"[fn-43-P4348_1602567:58-nf] And the prophet seeing that all the remedies of this life will have been applied in vain for their healing, and already as it were despairing of their life, declares: \"The bellows have failed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are not consumed. Call them reprobate silver, for the Lord hath rejected them.\"[fn-43-P4349_1602924:59-nf] And the Lord thus laments that to no purpose has He applied this salutary cleansing by fire to those who are hardened in their sins, in the person of Jerusalem crusted all over with the rust of her sins, when He says: \"set it empty upon burning coals, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may be melted; and let the filth of it be melted in the midst thereof. Great pains have been taken, and the great rust thereof is not gone out, no not even by fire. Thy uncleanness is execrable: because I desired to cleanse thee, and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness.\"[fn-43-P4350_1603518:60-nf] Wherefore like a skilful physician, who has tried all saving cures, and sees there is no remedy left which can be applied to their disease, the Lord is in a manner overcome by their iniquities and is obliged to desist from that kindly chastisement of His, and so denounces them saying: \"I will no longer be angry with thee, and thy jealousy has departed from thee.\"[fn-43-P4351_1603908:61-nf] But of others, whose heart has not grown hard by continuance in sin, and who do not stand in need of that most severe and (if I may so call it) caustic remedy, but for whose salvation the instruction of the life-giving word is suffi- cient-of them it is said: \"I will improve them by hearing of their suffering.\"[fn-43-P4352_1604242:62-nf] We are well aware that there are other reasons also of the punishment and vengeance whichis inflicted on those who have sinned grievously-not to expiate their crimes, nor wipeout the deserts of their sins, but that the living may be put in fear and amend their lives. And these we plainly see were inflicted on Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and Baasha the son of Ahiah, and Ahab and Jezebel, when the Divine reproof thus declares: \"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will cut down thy posterity, and will kill of Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and the last in Israel. And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahiah: for that which thou hast done to provoke Me to anger, and for making Israel to sin. The dogs also shall eat Jezebel in the field of Jezreel. If Ahab die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field the birds of the air shall eat him,\"[fn-43-P4353_1605220:63-nf] and this which is threatened as the greatest threat of all: \"Thy dead body shall not be brought to the sepulchre of thy fathers.\"[fn-43-P4354_1605375:64-nf] It was not that this short and momentary punishment would suffice to purge away the blasphemous inventions of him who first made the golden calves and led to the lasting sin of the people, and their wicked separation from the Lord,-or the countless and disgraceful profanities of those others, but it was that by their example the fear of those punishments which they dreaded might fall on others also, who, as they thought little of the future or even disbelieved in it altogether, would only be moved by consideration of things present; and that owing to this proof of His severity they might acknowledge that there is no lack of care for the affairs of men, and for their daily doings, in the majesty of God on high, and so through that which they greatly feared might the more clearly See in God the rewarder of all their deeds. We find, it is true, that even for lighter faults some men have received the same sentence of death in this world, as that with which those men were punished who, as we said before, were the authors of a blasphemous falling away: as happened in the case of the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath,[fn-43-P4355_1606532:65-nf] and in that of Ananias and Sapphira, who through the sin of unbelief kept back some portion of their goods: not that the guilt of their sins was equal, but because they were the firstfound out in a new kind of transgression, and so it was right that as they had given to others an example of sin, so also they should give them an example of punishment and of fear, that anyone, who should attempt to copy them, might know that (even if his punishment were postponed in this life) he would be punished in the same way that they were at the trial of the judgment hereafter. And, since in our desire to run through the different kinds of trials and punishments we seem to have wandered somewhat from our subject, on which we were saying that the perfect man will always remain steadfast in either kind of trial, now let us return to it once more.","title":"VI.

And so when these and such like faults which are also visible to the eyes of men, are entirely removed and cut off, and when such a purification and cleansing, as we spoke of, has first taken place, which is brought about by pure simplicity and innocence, then first there must be laid the secure foundations of a deep humility, which may be able to support a tower that shall reach the sky; and next the spiritual structure of the virtues must be built up upon them, and the soul kept free from all conversation and from roving thoughts that thus it may by little and little begin to rise to the contemplation of God and to spiritual insight.

Wherefore what we want to find ourselves like while we are praying, that we ought to prepare ourselves to be before the time for prayer.

For unless our mind is strengthened by the power of His protection Who says in the gospel \"the kingdom of God is within you,\"[fn-61-P6111_2175480:23-nf] in vain do we fancy that we can defeat the plots of our airy foe by the aid of men who are living with us, or that we can avoid them by distance of place, or exclude them by the protection of walls. For though none of these things was wanting to Saint Paphnutius yet the tempter did not fail to find a way of access against him to attack him; nor did the encircling walls, or the solitude of the desert or the merits of all those saints in the congregation repulse that most foul spirit. But because the holy servant of God had fixed the hope of his heart not on those external things but on Him Who is the judge of all secrets, he could not be moved even by the machinations of such an assault as that. On the other hand did not the man whom envy had hurried into so grievous a sin enjoy the benefit of solitude and the protection of a retired dwelling, and intercourse with the blessed Abbot and Presbyter Isidore and other saints? And yet because the storm raised by the devil found him upon the sand, it not only drove in his house but actually overturned it. We need not then seek for our peace in externals, nor fancy that another person's patience can be of any use to the faults of our impatience. For just as \"the kingdom of God is within you,\" so \"a man's foes are they of his own household.\"[fn-61-P6112_2176806:24-nf] For no one is more my enemy than my own heart which is truly the one of my household closest to me. And therefore if we are careful, we cannot possibly be injured by intestine enemies. For where those of our own household are not opposed to us, there also the kingdom of God is secured in peace of heart. For if you diligently investigate the matter, I cannot be injured by any man however spiteful, if I do not fight against myself with warlike heart. But if I am injured, the fault is not owing to the other's attack, but to my own impatience. For as strong and solid food is good for a man in good health, so it is bad for a sick one. But it cannot hurt the man who takes it, unless the weakness of its recipient gives it its power to hurt. If then any similar temptation ever arises among brethren, we need never be shaken out of the even tenor of our ways and give an opening to the blasphemous snarls of men living in the world, nor wonder that some bad and detestable men have secretly found their way into the number of the saints, because so long as we are trodden down and trampled in the threshing floor of this world, the chaff which is destined for eternal fire is quite sure to be mingled with the choicest of the wheat. Finally if we bear in mind that Satan was chosen among the angels, and Judas among the apostles, and Nicholas the author of a detestable heresy among the deacons, it will be no wonder that the basest of men are found among the ranks of the saints. For although some maintain that this Nicholas was not the same man who was chosen for the work of the ministry by the Apostles,[fn-61-P6113_2178439:25-nf] nevertheless they cannot deny that he was of the number of the disciples, all of whom were clearly of such a character and so perfect as those few whom we can now with difficulty discover in the coenobia. Let us then bring forward not the fall of the above-mentioned brother, who fell in the desert with so grievous a collapse, nor that horrible stain which he afterwards wiped out by the copious tears of his penitence, but the example of the blessed Paphnutius; and let us not be destroyed by the ruin of the former, whose ingrained sin of envy was increased and made worse by his affected piety, but let us imitate with all our might the humility of the latter, which in his case was no sudden production of the quiet of the desert, but had been gained among men, and was consummated and perfected by solitude. However you should know that the evil of envy is harder to be cured than other faults, for I should almost say that a man whom it has once tainted with the mischief of its poison is without a remedy. For it is the plague of which it is figuratively said by the prophet: \"Behold I will send among you serpents, basilisks, against which there is no charm: and they shall bite you.\"[fn-61-P6114_2180237:26-nf] Rightly then are the stings of envy compared by the prophet to the deadly poison of basilisks, as by it the first author of all poisons and their chief perished and died. For he slew himself before him of whom he was envious, and destroyed himself before that he poured forth the poison of death against man: for \"by the envy of the devil death entered into the world: they therefore who are on his side follow him.\"[fn-61-P6115_2180674:27-nf] For just as he who was the first to be corrupted by the plague of that evil, admitted no remedy of penitence, nor any healing plaster, so those also who have given themselves up to be smitten by the same pricks, exclude all the aid of the sacred charmer, because as they are tormented not by the faults but by the prosperity of those of whom they are jealous, they are ashamed to display the real truth and look out for some external unnecessary and trifling causes of offence: and of these, because they are altogether false, vain is the hope of cure, while the deadly poison which they will not produce is lurking in their veins. Of which the wisest of men has fitly said: \"If a serpent bite without hissing, there is no supply for the charmer.\"[fn-61-P6116_2181444:28-nf] For those are silent bites, to which alone the medicine of the wise is no succour. For that evil is so far incurable that it is made worse by attentions, it is increased by services, is irritated by presents, because as the same Solomon says: \"envy endures nothing.\"[fn-61-P6117_2181728:29-nf] For just in proportion as another has made progress in humble submission or in the virtue of patience or in the merit of munificence, so is a man excited by worse pricks of envy, because he desires nothing less than the ruin or death of the man whom he envies. Lastly no submission on the part of their harmless brother could soften the envy of the eleven patriarchs, so that Scripture relates of them: \"But his brothers envied him because his father loved him, and they could not speak peaceably unto him\"[fn-61-P6118_2182256:30-nf] until their jealousy, which would not listen to any entreaties on the part of their obedient and submissive brother, desired his death, and would scarcely be satisfied with the sin of selling a brother. It is plain then thatenvy is worse than all faults, and harder to get rid of, as it is inflamed by those remedies by which the others are destroyed. For, for example, a man who is grieved by a loss that has been caused to him, is healed by a liberal compensation: one who is sore owing to a wrong done to him, is appeased by humble satisfaction being made. What can you do with one who is the more offended by the very fact that he sees you humbler and kinder, who is not aroused to anger by any greed which can be appeased by a bribe; or by any injurious attack or love of vengeance, which is overcome by obsequious services; but is only irritated by another's success and happiness? But who is there who in order to satisfy one who envies him, would wish to fall from his good fortune, or to lose his prosperity or to be involved in some calamity? Wherefore we must constantly implore the divine aid, to which nothing is impossible, in order that the serpent may not by a single bite of this evil destroy whatever is flourishing in us, and animated as it were by the life and quickening power of the Holy Ghost. For the other poisons of serpents, i.e., carnal sins and faults, in which human frailty is easily entangled and from which it is as easily purified, show some traces of their wounds in the flesh, whereby although the earthly body is most dangerously inflamed, yet if any charmer well skilled in divine incantations applies a cure and antidote or the remedy of words of salvation, the poisonous evil does not reach to the everlasting death of the soul. But the poison of envy as if emitted by the basilisk, destroys the very life of religion and faith, even before the wound is perceived in the body. For he does not raise himself up against men, but, in his blasphemy, against God, who carps at nothing in his brother except his felicity, and so blames no fault of man, but simply the judgment of God. This then is that \"root of bitterness springing up\"[fn-61-P6119_2184449:31-nf] which raises itself to heaven and tends to reproaching the very Author Who bestows good things on man. Nor shall anyone be disturbed because God threatens to send \"serpents, basilisks,\"[fn-61-P6120_2184654:32-nf] to bite those by whose crimes He is offended. For although it is certain that God cannot be the author of envy, yet it is fair and worthy of the divine judgment that, while good gifts are bestowed on the humble and refused to the proud and reprobate, those who, as the Apostle says, deserve to be given over \"to a reprobate mind,\"[fn-61-P6121_2185005:33-nf] should be smitten and consumed by envy sent as it were by Him, according to this passage: \"They have provoked me to jealousy by them that are no gods: and I will provoke them to jealousy by them that are no nation.\"[fn-61-P6122_2185238:34-nf] ","title":"XVIII.

It is plain then from the above that the Scriptures declare the Son's eternity; it is equally plain from what follows that the Arian phrases `He was not,' and `before' and `when,' are in the same Scriptures predicated of creatures. Moses, for instance, in his account of the generation of our system, says, `And every plant of the field, before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground[fn-53-P5372_2105783:84-nf] .' And in Deuteronomy, `When the Most High divided to the nations[fn-53-P5373_2105866:85-nf] .'

And concerning Jeremiah He says,`Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee[fn-53-P5377_2106565:89-nf] .'

Thus it appears that the phrases `once was not,' and `before it came to be,' and `when,' and the like, belong to things originate and creatures, which come out of nothing, but are alien to the Word. But if such terms are used in Scripture of things originate, but `ever' of the Word, it follows, O ye enemies of God, that the Son did not come out of nothing, nor is in the number of originated things at all, but is the Father's Image and Word eternal, never having not been, but being ever, as the, eternal Radiance[fn-53-P5380_2107455:92-nf] of a Light which is eternal. Why imagine then times before the Son? or wherefore blaspheme the Word as after times, by whom even the ages were made? for how did time or age at all subsist when the Word, as you say, had not appeared, `through' whom `all things have been made and without' whom `not one thing was made[fn-53-P5381_2107798:93-nf] ?' Or why, when you mean time, do you not plainly say, `a time was when the Word was not?' But while you drop the word `time' to deceive the simple, you do not at all conceal your own feeling, nor, even if you did, could you escape discovery.

For since he had said, \"I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge,\" and that \"being ignorant of God's righteousness, they submitted not themselves\" to it: he next shows, that for this ignorance itself they were punishable before God. This he does not say indeed so, but he makes it good by carrying on his discourse in the way of question, and so convicting them more clearly, by framing the whole passage out of objections and answers. But look further back. The Prophet, saith he, said, \"Whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved.\" Now somebody might say perhaps, \"But how could they call upon Him Whom they had not believed? Then there is a question from him after the objection; And why did they not believe? Then an objection again. A person certainly may say, And how could they believe, since they had not heard? Yet hear they did, he implies. Then another objection again. \"And how could they hear without a preacher?\" Then an answer again. Yet preach they did, and there were many sent forth for this very purpose. And whence does it appear that these are those persons sent? Then he brings the prophet in next, who says, \"How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!\" (Is. iii. 7.) You see how by the kind of preaching he points out the preachers. For there was nothing else that these men went about telling everywhere, but those unspeakable good things, and the peace made by God with men.

For since he had said, \"I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge,\" and that \"being ignorant of God's righteousness, they submitted not themselves\" to it: he next shows, that for this ignorance itself they were punishable before God. This he does not say indeed so, but he makes it good by carrying on his discourse in the way of question, and so convicting them more clearly, by framing the whole passage out of objections and answers. But look further back. The Prophet, saith he, said, \"Whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved.\" Now somebody might say perhaps, \"But how could they call upon Him Whom they had not believed? Then there is a question from him after the objection; And why did they not believe? Then an objection again. A person certainly may say, And how could they believe, since they had not heard? Yet hear they did, he implies. Then another objection again. \"And how could they hear without a preacher?\" Then an answer again. Yet preach they did, and there were many sent forth for this very purpose. And whence does it appear that these are those persons sent? Then he brings the prophet in next, who says, \"How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!\" (Is. iii. 7.) You see how by the kind of preaching he points out the preachers. For there was nothing else that these men went about telling everywhere, but those unspeakable good things, and the peace made by God with men. And so by disbelieving, it is not we, he implies, whom you disbelieve, but Isaiah the prophet, who spake many years ago, that we were to be sent, and to preach, and to say what we do say.

For consider how grave an error it is, to call God's Word a work. Solomon says in one place in Ecclesiastes, that `God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil[fn-58-P5845_2327855:39-nf] .' If then the Word be a work, do you mean that He as well as others will be brought into judgment? and what room is there for judgment, when the Judge is on trial? who will give to the just their blessing, who to the unworthy their punishment, the Lord, as you must suppose, standing on trial with the rest? by what law shall He, the Lawgiver, Himself be judged? These things are proper to the works, to be on trial, to be blessed and to be punished by the Son. Now then fear the Judge, and let Solomon's words convince you. For if God shall bring the works one and all into judgment, but the Son is not in the number of things put on trial, but rather is Himself the Judge of works one and all, is not the proof clearer than the sun, that the Son is not a work but the Father's Word, in whom all the works both come to be and come into judgment? Further, if the expression, `Who was faithful,' is a difficulty to them, from the thought that `faithful' is used of Him as of others, as if He exercises faith and so receives the reward of faith, they must proceed at this rate to find fault with Moses for saying, `God faithful and true[fn-58-P5846_2329013:40-nf] ,' and with St. Paul for writing, `God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able[fn-58-P5847_2329200:41-nf] .' But when the saints spoke thus, they were not thinking of God in a human way, but they acknowledged two senses of the word `faithful' in Scripture, first `believing,' then `trustworthy,' of which the former belongs to man, the latter to God.

Accordingly the words, `Who is faithful to Him that made Him,' implies no parallel with others, nor means that by having faith He became well-pleasing; but that, being Son of the True God, He too is faithful, and ought to be believed in all He says and does, Himself remaining unalterable and not changed[fn-58-P5851_2330229:45-nf] in His human Economy and fleshly presence.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":32,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"6.

Now the so-called gods of the Greeks, unworthy the name, are faithful neither in their essence nor in their promises; for the same are not everywhere, nay, the local deities come to nought in course of time, and undergo a natural dissolution; wherefore the Word cries out against them, that `faith is not strong in them,' but they are `waters that fail,' and `there is no faith in them.' But the God of all, being one really and indeed and true, is faithful, who is ever the same, and says, `See now, that I, even I am He,' and I `change not[fn-58-P5865_2342446:55-nf] ;' and therefore His Son is `faithful,' being ever the same and unchanging, deceiving neither in His essence nor in His promise;-as again says the Apostle writing to the Thessalonians, `Faithful is He who calleth you, who also will do it[fn-58-P5866_2342780:56-nf] ;' for in doing what He promises, `He is faithful to His words.'

For if, while He is not Son, we are sons, God is our Father and not His. How then does He appropriate the name instead, saying, `My Father,' and `I from the Father[fn-72-P7205_2864416:88-nf] ?' for if He be common Father of all, He is not His Father only, nor did He alone come out from the Father. But he says, that He is sometimes called our Father also, because He has Himself become partaker in our flesh. For on this account the Word has become flesh, that, since the Word is Son, therefore, because of the Son dwelling in us[fn-72-P7206_2864787:89-nf] , He may be called our Father also; for `He sent forth,' says Scripture, `the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father[fn-72-P7207_2864944:90-nf] .' Therefore the Son in us, calling upon His own Father, causes Him to be named our Father also. Surely in whose hearts the Son is not, of them neither can God be called Father. But if because of the Word the Man is called Son, it follows necessarily, since the ancients[fn-72-P7208_2865232:91-nf] are called sons even before the Incarnation, that the Word is Son even before His sojourn among us; for `I begat sons,' saith Scripture; and in the time of Noah, `When the sons of God saw,' and in the Song, `Is not He thy Father[fn-72-P7209_2865479:92-nf] ?' Therefore there was also that True Son, for whose sake they too were sons.

Get out then, and wriggle out of this if you can-whoever you are-you who rage with vapid mouth and a spirit of blasphemy, and think that there is no difference at all between Adam and Christ; and you who deny that He was God before His birth of the Virgin, show clearly how you can prove that He was not God before His body came into existence. For lo, an Apostle says that the people were saved out of the land of Egypt by Jesus: and that Christ was tempted by unbelievers in the wilderness: andthat our fathers, i.e., the patriarchs and prophets, were saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Deny it if you can. I shall not be surprised if you manage to deny what we all read, as you have already denied what we all believe. Know then that even then it was Christ in God who led the people out of Egypt, and it was Christ in God who was tempted by the people who tempted, and it was Christ in God who saved all the righteous men by His lavish grace: for through the oneness of the mystery (of the Incarnation) the terms God and Christ so pass into each other, that whatever God did, that we may say that Christ did; and whatever afterwards Christ bore, we may say that God bore. And so when the prophet said, \"There shall no new God be in thee, neither shalt thou worship any other God,\"[fn-72-P7240_2644109:33-nf] he announced it with the same meaning and in the same spirit as that with which the Apostle said that Christ was the leader of the people of Israel out of Egypt; to show that He who was born of the Virgin as man, was even through the unity of the mystery still in God. Otherwise, unless we believe this, we must either believe with the heretics that Christ is not God, or against the teaching of the prophet hold that He is a new God. But may it be far from the Catholic people of God, to seem either to differ from the prophet or to agree with heretics: or perchance the people who should be blessed may be involved in a curse, and be charged with putting their hope in man. For whoever declares that the Lord Jesus Christ was at His birth a mere man, is doubly liable to the curse, whether he believes in Him or not. For if he believes, \"Cursed is he who puts his hope in man.\"[fn-72-P7241_2645008:34-nf] But if he does not believe, none theless is he still cursed, because though not believing in man, he still has altogether deniedGod.","title":"Book V.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":32,"verse":43,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_92_homily_xxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"But what he means is this.

Inasmuch, therefore, as my knowledge is most fully in accordance with the law, I rightly declared that there are many gods, of whom one is more eminent than the rest, and incomprehensible, even He who is God of gods. But that there are many gods, the law itself informs me. For, in the first place, it says this in the passage where one in the figure of a serpent speaks to Eve, the first woman, `On the day ye eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, ye shall be as gods, '[fn-17-P1774_484436:32-nf] that is, as those who made man; and after they have tasted of the tree, God Himself testifies, saying to the rest of the gods, `Behold, Adam is become as one of us; '[fn-17-P1775_484621:33-nf] thus, therefore, it is manifest that there were many gods engaged in the making of man.

There are also many other testimonies which might be adduced from the law, not only obscure, but plain, by which it is taught that there are many gods.[fn-17-P1781_485452:39-nf] One of these was chosen by lot, that he might be the god of the Jews.

Now it is within the power of every unrighteous than to repent and be saved; and every righteous man may nave to undergo punishment for sins committed at the end of his career. Moreover, these two leaders are the swift hands of God, eager to anticipate Him so as to accomplish His will.
