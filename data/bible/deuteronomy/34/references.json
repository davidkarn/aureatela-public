Now that I have received a letter from you, if I do not answer it I shall be guilty of pride, and if I do I shall be guilty of rashness. For the matters concerning which you ask my opinion are such that they cannot either be spoken of or listened to without profanity. You tell me that Vigilantius (whose very name Wakeful is a contradiction: he ought rather to be described as Sleepy) has again opened his fetid lips and is pouring forth a torrent of filthy venom upon the relics of the holy martyrs; and that he calls us who cherish them ashmongers and idolaters who pay homage to dead men's bones. Unhappy wretch! to be wept over by all Christian men, who sees not that in speaking thus he makes himself one with the Samaritans and the Jews who hold dead bodies unclean and regard as defiled even vessels which have been in the same house with them, following the letter that killeth and not the spirit that giveth life.[fn-42-P4200_1133030:3017-nf] We, it is true, refuse to worship or adore, I say not the relics of the martyrs, but even the sun and moon, the angels and archangels, the Cherubim and Seraphim and \"every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which is to come.\"[fn-42-P4201_1133302:3018-nf] For we may not serve the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.[fn-42-P4202_1133407:3019-nf] Still we honour the relics of the martyrs, that we may adore Him whose martyrs they are. We honour the servants that their honour may be reflected upon their Lord who Himself says:-\"he that receiveth you receiveth me.\"[fn-42-P4203_1133648:3020-nf] I ask Vigilantius, Are the relics of Peter and of Paul unclean? Was the body of Moses unclean, of which we are told (according to the correct Hebrew text) that it was buried by the Lord Himself?[fn-42-P4204_1133868:3021-nf] And do we, every time that we enter the basilicas of apostles and prophets and martyrs, pay homage to the shrines of idols? Are the tapers which burn before their tombs only the tokens of idolatry? I will go farther still and ask a question which will make this theory recoil upon the head of its inventor and which will either kill or cure that frenzied brain of his, so that simple souls shall be no more subverted by his sacrilegious reasonings. Let him answer me this, Was the Lord's body unclean when it was placed in the sepulchre? And did the angels clothed in white raiment merely watch over a corpse dead and defiled, that ages afterwards this sleepy fellow might indulge in dreams and vomit forth his filthy surfeit, so as, like the persecutor Julian, either to destroy the basilicas of the saints or to convert them into heathen temples?","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":34,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_08_the_perpetual_virginity_of_blessed_mary","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"7. The word of God says in Genesis,[fn-60-P6027_1787677:20-nf] \"And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem, and lost them until this day.\" Likewise at the end of Deuteronomy,[fn-60-P6028_1787937:21-nf] \"So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And he buried him in the valley, in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.\" We must certainly understand by this day the time of the composition of the history, whether you prefer the view that Moses was the author of the Pentateuch or that Ezra re-edited it. In either case I make no objection. The question now is whether the words unto this day are to be referred to the time of publishing or writing the books, and if so it is for him to show, now that so many years have rolled away since that day, that either the idols hidden beneath the oak have been found, or the grave of Moses discovered; for he obstinately maintains that what does not happen so long as the point of time indicated by until and unto has not been attained, begins to be when that point has been reached. He would do well to pay heed to the idiom of Holy Scripture, and understand with us, (it was here he stuck in the mud) that some things which might seem ambiguous if not expressed are plainly intimated, while others are left to the exercise of our intellect. For if, while the event was still fresh in memory and men were living who had seen Moses, it was possible for his grave to be unknown, much more may this be the case after the lapse of so many ages. And in the same way must we interpret what we are told concerning Joseph. The Evangelist pointed out a circumstance which might have given rise to some scandal, namely, that Mary was not known by her husband until she was delivered, and he did so that we might be the more certain that she from whom Joseph refrained while there was room to doubt the import of the vision was not known after her delivery.","title":"The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary","author":false},{"chapter":34,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_17_vi_on_monogamy_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-04","text":"These accordingly, I suppose, are they in whom my origin is counted.

But it is now time for us to raise the standard of Joshua's chastity. It is written that Moses had a wife. Now Moses is interpreted both by our Lord and by the Apostle to mean the law:[fn-62-P6279_1921028:124-nf] \"They have Moses and the prophets.\" And[fn-62-P6280_1921092:125-nf] \"Death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression.\" And no one doubts that in both passages Moses signifies the law. We read that Moses, that is the law, had a wife: shew me then in the same way that Joshua the son of Nun had either wife or children, and if you can do so, I will confess that I am beaten. He certainly received the fairest spot in the division of the land of Judah, and died, not in the twenties, which are ever unlucky in Scripture-by them are reckoned the years of[fn-62-P6281_1921661:126-nf] Jacob's service,[fn-62-P6282_1921700:127-nf] the price of Joseph, and[fn-62-P6283_1921749:128-nf] sundry presents which Esau who was fond of them received-but in the[fn-62-P6284_1921840:129-nf] tens, whose praises we have often sung; and he was buried in[fn-62-P6285_1921961:130-nf] Thamnath Sare, that is, most perfect sovereignty, or among those of a new covering, to signify the crowds of virgins, covered by the Saviour's aid on Mount Ephraim, that is, the fruitful mountain; on the north of the Mountain of Gaash, which is, being interpreted, disturbance: for[fn-62-P6286_1922757:131-nf] \"Mount Sion is on the sides of the north, the city of the Great King,\" is ever exposed to hatred, and in every trial says[fn-62-P6287_1922955:132-nf] \"But my feet had well nigh slipped.\" The book which bears the name of Joshua ends with his burial. Again in the book of Judges we read of him as though he had risen and come to life again, and by way of summary his works are extolled. We read too[fn-62-P6288_1923224:133-nf] \"So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance, that they might possess the land.\" And \"Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua,\" and so on. There immediately follows: \"And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.\" Moses, moreover, only saw the land of promise; he could not enter: and[fn-62-P6289_1923605:134-nf] \"he died in the land of Moab, and the Lord buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.\" Let us compare the burial of the two: Moses died in the land of Moab, Joshua in the land of Judaea. The former was buried in a valley over against the house of Phogor, which is, being interpreted, reproach (for the Hebrew Phogor corresponds to Priapus[fn-62-P6290_1924044:135-nf] ); the latter in Mount Ephraim on the north of Mount Gaash. And in the simple expressions of the sacred Scriptures there is always a more subtle meaning. The Jews gloried in children and child-bearing; and the barren woman, who had not offspring in Israel, was accursed; but blessed was he whose seed was in Sion, and his family in Jerusalem; and part of the highest blessing was,[fn-62-P6291_1924564:136-nf] \"Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thy house, thy children like olive plants, round about thy table.\" Therefore his grave is described as placed in a valley over against the house of an idol which was in a special sense consecrated to lust. But we who fight under Joshua our leader, even to the present day know not where Moses was buried. For we despise Phogor, and all his shame, knowing that they who are in the flesh cannot please God. And the Lord before the flood had said[fn-62-P6292_1925097:137-nf] \"My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh.\" Wherefore, when Moses died, the people of Israel mourned for him; but Joshua like one on his way to victory was unmourned.

I know not.

And immediately he gave up his precious soul with much honour, in the month of October, on the twenty-eighth.

So then we must confess that the dead indeed do not know what is doing here, but while it is\nin doing here: afterwards, however, they hear it from those who from hence go to them at their death;\nnot indeed every thing, but what things those are allowed to make known who are suffered also to\nremember these things; and which it is meet for those to hear, whom they inform of the same. It may\nbe also, that from the Angels, who are present in the things which are doing here, the dead do hear\nsomewhat, which for each one of them to hear He judgeth right to Whom all things are subject.

But let any one who so listeth still refuse his assent, and declare that what John asserts is true enough, that the Lord said not that that disciple dieth not, and yet that this is the meaning of such words as He is here recorded to have used; and further assert that the Apostle John is still living, and maintain that he is sleeping rather than lying dead in his tomb at Ephesus. Let him employ as an argument the current report that there the earth is in sensible commotion, and presents a kind of heaving appearance, and assert whether it be steadfastly or obstinately that this is occasioned by his breathing. For we cannot fail to have some who so believe, if there is no want of those also who affirm that Moses is alive; because it is written that his sepulchre could not be found,[fn-38-P3898_2149035:3-nf] and that he appeared with the Lord on the mountain along with Elias,[fn-38-P3899_2149123:4-nf] of whom we read that he did not die, but was translated.[fn-39-P3900_2149198:5-nf] As if Moses' body could not have been hid somewhere in such a way as that its position should altogether escape discovery by men, and be raised up therefrom by divine power at the time when Elias and he were seen with Christ just as at the time of Christ's passion many bodies of the saints arose, and after His resurrection appeared, according to Scripture, to many in the holy city.[fn-39-P3901_2149602:6-nf] But still, as I began to say, if some deny the death of Moses, whom Scripture itself, in the very passage where we read that his sepulchre could nowhere be found, explicitly declares to have died; how much more may occasion be taken from these words where the Lord says, \"Thus do I wish him to stay till I come,\" to believe that John is sleeping, but still alive, beneath the ground? Of whom we have also the tradition (which is found in certain apocryphal scriptures), that he was present, in good health, when he ordered a sepulchre to be made for him; and that, when it was dug and prepared with all possible care, he laid himself down there as in a bed, and became immediately defunct: yet as those think who so understand these words of the Lord, not really defunct, but only lying like one in such a condition; and, while accounted dead, was actually buried when asleep, and that he will so remain till the coming of Christ, making known meanwhile the fact of his life by the bubbling up of the dust, which is believed to be forced by the breath of the sleeper to ascend from the depths to the surface of the grave. I think it quite superfluous to contend with such an opinion. For those may see for themselves who know the locality whether the ground there does or suffers what is said regarding it, because, in truth, we too have heard of it from those who are not altogether unreliable witnesses.","title":"Tractate CXXIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":34,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":51,"source_paragraph":"355","folder":"ANF-01","text":"To this I replied, \"Do you not think that the same thing happened in the case of Joshua the son of Nave (Nun), who succeeded to the command of the people after Moses, when Moses was commanded to lay his hands on Joshua, and God said to him, `I will take of the spirit which is in thee, and put it on him?

And also when the time came that Moses should sleep with his fathers, he was grieved and\ndistressed, and he sought of his Lord and entreated that he might pass over to the land of promise.\nAnd why, my beloved, was the righteous Moses grieved because he did not enter into the land of\npromise? Clearly, because he wished to go and be buried with his fathers, and not be buried in the\nland of his adversaries, in the land of Moab. For the Moabites hired Balaam the son of Beor to curse\nIsrael. Therefore Moses wished not to be buried in that land, test the Moabites should come and take\nvengeance on him by taking up and casting forth the bones of that righteous man. And the Lord\nperformed an act of grace towards Moses. For He brought him forth to Mount Nebo, and showed him all\nthe land, making it pass before him. And as Moses gazed upon all the land, and gazed upon the\nmountain of the Jebusites where the Tabernacle was to dwell, he was grieved and wept when he saw the\ntomb in Hebron where his fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were buried, that he should not be buried\nwith them, nor his bones cast upon their bones, that he might rise along with them in the\nResurrection. But when he had seen all the land, his Lord encouraged him and said to him, \"I myself\nwill bury thee and hide thee, and none shall know thy tomb.\" So Moses died according to the word\nof the mouth of the Lord, and He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab over against Beth-Peor,\nwhere Israel had sinned, and no man has known his sepulchre unto this day.[fn-43-P4352_1448543:23-nf] Two goodly benefits did his Lord accomplish for\nMoses in not making known his tomb to the children of Israel. He rejoiced that his adversaries should\nnot know it, and cast forth his bones from his tomb; and in the second place, that the children of\nhis people should not know it, and make his tomb a place of worship, for he was accounted as God in\nthe eyes of the children of his people.
