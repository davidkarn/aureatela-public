Circumcise yourselves to the Lord your God, and take away the foreskins of your heart, lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it.\" Also Moses himself says:[fn-14-P1443_600547:226-nf] \"In the last days the Lord shall circumcise thine heart to love the Lord thy God.\" Also Jesus[fn-14-P1444_600662:227-nf] the son of Nun, his successor, said: \"And the Lord said unto Jesus, Make thee knives of flint very sharp, and sit and circumcise the children of Israel the second time.\" He said that this second circumcision would be not of the flesh, as the first was, which the Jews practise even now, but of the heart and spirit, which was delivered by Christ, who was the true Jesus. For the prophet does not say, \"And the Lord said unto me,\" but \"unto Jesus,\" that he might show that God was not speaking of him, but of Christ, to whom God was then speaking. For that Jesus represented[fn-14-P1445_601273:228-nf] Christ: for when he was at first called Auses,[fn-14-P1446_601385:229-nf] Moses, foreseeing the future, ordered that he should be called Jesus; that since he had been chosen as the leader of the warfare against Amalek, who was the enemy of the children of Israel, he might both subdue the adversary by the emblem[fn-14-P1447_601953:230-nf] of the name, and lead the people into the land of promise. And for this reason he was also successor to Moses, to show that the new law given by Christ Jesus was about to succeed to the old law which was given by Moses. For that circumcision of the flesh is plainly irrational; since, if God had so willed it, He might so have formed man from the beginning, that he should be without a foreskin. But it was a figure of this second circumcision, signifying that the breast is to be laid bare; that is, that we ought to live with an open and simple heart, since that part of the body which is circumcised has a kind of resemblance to the heart, and is to be treated with reverence. On this account God ordered that it should be laid bare, that by this argument He might admonish us not to have our breast hidden[fn-14-P1448_602929:231-nf] in obscurity; that is, not to veil any shameful deed within the secrets of conscience. This is the circumcision of the heart of which the prophets speak, which God transferred from the mortal flesh to the soul, which alone is about to endure. For being desirous of promoting our life and salvation in accordance with His own goodness, in that circumcision He hath set before us repentance, that if we lay open our hearts,-that is if we confess our sins and make satisfaction to God,-we shall obtain pardon, which is denied to those who are obstinate and conceal their faults, by Him who regards not the outward appearance, as man does, but the innermost secrets of the heart.[fn-14-P1449_603727:232-nf] ","title":"Book IV.

In Deuteronomy: `The Lord thy God will again turn and rejoice over thee for good, as He rejoiced over thy fathers, if ye shall hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to keep His commandments, and His ordinances, and His judgments, written in the book of this law; if thou turn to the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and With all thy soul. For this command, which I give thee this day, is not grievous, neither is it far from thee: it is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who will ascend into heaven, and obtain it for us, that we may hear and do it? neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who will cross over the sea, and obtain it for us, that we may hear and do it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thine heart, and in thine hands to do it.'[fn-25-P2559_1023542:94-nf] In the Gospel likewise the Lord says: `Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.

For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.'[fn-25-P2560_1023843:95-nf] So also in the Epistle of Saint John it is written: `This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous.'\"[fn-25-P2561_1024015:96-nf] On hearing these testimonies out of the law, and the gospel, and the epistles, let us be built up unto that grace which those persons do not understand, who, \"being ignorant of God's righteousness, and wishing to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.\"[fn-25-P2562_1024343:97-nf] For, if they understand not the passage of Deuteronomy in the sense that the Apostle Paul quoted it,-that \"with the heart men believe unto righteousness, and with their mouth make confession unto salvation;\"[fn-25-P2563_1024567:98-nf] since \"the that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick,\"[fn-25-P2564_1024656:99-nf] -they certainly ought (by that very passage of the Apostle John which he quoted last to this effect: \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not grievous\"[fn-25-P2565_1024873:100-nf] ) to be admonished that God's commandment is not grievous to the love of God, which is shed abroad in our hearts only by the Holy Ghost, not by the determination of man's will by attributing to which more than they ought, they are ignorant of God's righteousness.

But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.'[fn-27-P2721_1063523:204-nf] Likewise, in Deuteronomy: `Life and death hath He set before thee, and good and evil: . . . choose thou life, that thou mayest live.'[fn-27-P2722_1063680:205-nf] So in the book of Solomon: `God from the beginning made man, and left him in the hand of His counsel; and He added for him commandments and precepts: if thou wilt-to perform acceptable faithfulness for the time to come, they shall save thee.

Not that the result is without our will, but that our will does not accomplish the result, unless it receive the divine assistance.

But there is demanded from us an unwavering certainty. The Apostle expounding the whole secret of the Scripture passes on, Thy word is nigh, in thy mouth and in thy heart[fn-21-P2151_1382054:125-nf] . The words of our confession must not be tardy or deliberately vague: there must be no interval between heart and lips, lest what ought to be the confession of true reverence become a subterfuge of infidelity. The word must be near us, and within us; no delay between the heart and the lips; a faith of conviction as well as of words. Heart and lips must be in harmony, and reveal in thought and utterance a religion which does not waver. Here too, as before, the Apostle adds the explanation of the Prophet's words, That is the word of Faith, which we preach; because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath raised Him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Piety consists in rejecting doubt, righteousness in believing, salvation in confessing. Trifle not with ambiguities, be not stirred up to vain babblings, do not debate in any way the powers of God, or impose limits upon His might, cease searching again and again for the causes of unsearchable mysteries: confess rather that Jesus is the Lord, and believe that God raised Him from the dead; herein is salvation. What folly is it to depreciate the nature and character of Christ, when this alone is salvation, to know that He is the Lord. Again, what an error of human vanity to quarrel about His resurrection, when it is enough for eternal life to believe that God raised Him up. In simplicity then is faith, in faith righteousness, and in confession true godliness. For God does not call us to the blessed life through arduous investigations. He does not tempt us with the varied arts of rhetoric. The way to eternally is plain and easy; believe that Jesus was raised from the dead by God and confess that He is the Lord. Let no one therefore wrest into an occasion for impiety, what was said because of our ignorance. It had to be proved to us, that Jesus Christ died, that we might live in Him.","title":"Book X","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":30,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"79","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"In the like manner,\" says He,[fn-57-P5781_1754811:501-nf] \"did their fathers unto the prophets.\" What a turncoat[fn-57-P5782_1754886:502-nf] is Marcion's Christ! Now the destroyer, now the advocate of the prophets! He destroyed them as their rival, by converting their disciples; he took up their cause as their friend, by stigmatizing[fn-57-P5783_1755146:503-nf] their persecutors. But,[fn-57-P5784_1755189:504-nf] in as far as the defence of the prophets could not be consistent in the Christ of Marcion, who came to destroy them; in so far is it becoming to the Creator's Christ that He should stigmatize those who persecuted the prophets, for He in all things accomplished their predictions. Again, it is more characteristic of the Creator to upbraid sons with their fathers' sins, than it is of that god who chastizes no man for even his own misdeeds. But you will say, He cannot be regarded as defending the prophets simply because He wished to affirm the iniquity of the Jews for their impious dealings with their own prophets. Well, then, in this case,[fn-57-P5785_1755848:505-nf] no sin ought to have been charged against the Jews: they were rather deserving of praise and approbation when they maltreated[fn-57-P5786_1755986:506-nf] those whom the absolutely good god of Marcion, after so long a time, bestirred himself[fn-57-P5787_1756162:507-nf] to destroy. I suppose, however, that by this time he bad ceased to be the absolutely good god;[fn-57-P5788_1756275:508-nf] he had now sojourned a considerable while even with the Creator, and was no longer (like) the god of Epicurus[fn-57-P5789_1756406:509-nf] purely and simply. For see how he condescends[fn-57-P5790_1756520:510-nf] to curse, and proves himself capable of taking offence and feeling anger! He actually pronounces a woe! But a doubt is raised against us as to the import of this word, as if it carried with it less the sense of a curse than of an admonition. Where, however, is the difference, since even an admonition is not given without the sting of a threat, especially when it is embittered with a woe? Moreover, both admonition and threatening will be the resources of him[fn-57-P5791_1756998:511-nf] who knows how to feel angry, For no one will forbid the doing of a thing with an admonition or a threat, except him who will inflict punishment for the doing of it. No one would inflict punishment, except him who was susceptible of anger. Others, again, admit that the word implies a curse; but they will have it that Christ pronounced the woe, not as if it were His own genuine feeling, but because the woe is from the Creator, and He wanted to set forth to them the severity of the Creator in order that He might the more commend His own long-suffering[fn-57-P5792_1757572:512-nf] in His beatitudes Just as if it were not competent to the Creator, in the pre-eminence of both His attributes as the good God and Judge, that, as He had made clemency[fn-57-P5793_1757760:513-nf] the preamble of His benediction so He should place severity in the sequel of His curses; thus fully developing His discipline in both directions, both in following out the blessing and in providing against the curse.[fn-57-P5794_1757998:514-nf] He had already said of old, \"Behold, I have set before you blessing and cursing.\"[fn-57-P5795_1758118:515-nf] Which statement was really a presage of[fn-57-P5796_1758180:516-nf] this temper of the gospel. Besides, what sort of being is that who, to insinuate a belief in his own goodness, invidiously contrasted[fn-57-P5797_1758337:517-nf] with it the Creator's severity? Of little worth is the recommendation which has for its prop the defamation of another. And yet by thus setting forth the severity of the Creator, he, in fact, affirmed Him to be an object of fear.[fn-57-P5798_1758584:518-nf] Now if He be an object of fear, He is of course more worthy of being obeyed than slighted; and thus Marcion's Christ begins to teach favourably to the Creator's interests.[fn-57-P5799_1758773:519-nf] Then, on the admission above mentioned, since the woe which has regard to the rich is the Creator's, it follows that it is not Christ, but the Creator, who is angry with the rich; while Christ approves of[fn-58-P5800_1759002:520-nf] the incentives of the rich[fn-58-P5801_1759049:521-nf] -I mean, their pride, their pomp,[fn-58-P5802_1759106:522-nf] their love of the world, and their contempt of God, owing to which they deserve the woe of the Creator. But how happens it that the reprobation of the rich does not proceed from the same God who had just before expressed approbation of the poor? There is nobody but reprobates the opposite of that which he has approved. If, therefore, there be imputed to the Creator the woe pronounced against the rich, there must be claimed for Him also the promise of the blessing upon the poor; and thus the entire work of the Creator devolves on Christ.-If to Marcion's god there be ascribed the blessing of the poor, he must also have imputed to him the malediction of the rich; and thus will he become the Creator's equal,[fn-58-P5803_1759836:523-nf] both good and judicial; nor will there be left any room for that distinction whereby two gods are made; and when this distinction is removed, there will remain the verity which pronounces the Creator to be the one only God. Since, therefore, \"woe\" is a word indicative of malediction, or of some unusually austere[fn-58-P5804_1760177:524-nf] exclamation; and since it is by Christ uttered against the rich, I shall have to show that the Creator is also a despiser[fn-58-P5805_1760319:525-nf] of the rich, as I have shown Him to be the defender[fn-58-P5806_1760392:526-nf] of the poor, in order that I may prove Christ to be on the Creator's side in this matter, even when He enriched Solomon.[fn-58-P5807_1760533:527-nf] But with respect to this man, since, when a choice was left to him, he preferred asking for what he knew to be well-pleasing to God-even wisdom-he further merited the attainment of the riches, which he did not prefer. The endowing of a man indeed with riches, is not an incongruity to God, for by the help of riches even rich men are comforted and assisted; moreover, by them many a work of justice and charity is carried out. But yet there are serious faults[fn-58-P5808_1761019:528-nf] which accompany riches; and it is because of these that woes are denounced on the rich, even in the Gospel. \"Ye have received,\" says He, \"your consolation; \"[fn-58-P5809_1761191:529-nf] that is, of course, from their riches, in the pomps and vanities of the world which these purchase for them. Accordingly, in Deuteronomy, Moses says: \"Lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, as well as thy silver and thy gold, thine heart be then lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.\"[fn-58-P5810_1761634:530-nf] in similar terms, when king Hezekiah became proud of his treasures, and gloried in them rather than in God before those who had come on an embassy from Babylon,[fn-58-P5811_1761821:531-nf] (the Creator) breaks forth[fn-58-P5812_1761884:532-nf] against him by the mouth of Isaiah: \"Behold, the days come when all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store, shall be carried to Babylon.\"[fn-58-P5813_1762072:533-nf] So by Jeremiah likewise did He say: \"Let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth even glory in the Lord.\"[fn-58-P5814_1762223:534-nf] Similarly against the daughters of Sion does He inveigh by Isaiah, when they were haughty through their pomp and the abundance of their riches,[fn-58-P5815_1762391:535-nf] just as in another passage He utters His threats against the proud and noble: \"Hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth, and down to it shall descend the illustrious, and the great, and the rich (this shall be Christ's `woe to the rich'); and man[fn-58-P5816_1762670:536-nf] shall be humbled,\" even he that exalts himself with riches; \"and the mighty man[fn-58-P5817_1762784:537-nf] shall be dishonoured,\" even he who is mighty from his wealth.[fn-58-P5818_1762858:538-nf] Concerning whom He says again: \"Behold, the Lord of hosts shall confound the pompous together with their strength: those that are lifted up shall be hewn down, and such as are lofty shall fall by the sword.\"[fn-58-P5819_1763085:539-nf] And who are these but the rich? Because they have indeed received their consolation, glory, and honour and a lofty position from their wealth. In Psalms 48 He also turns off our care from these and says: \"Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, and when his glory is increased: for when he shall die, he shall carry nothing away; nor shall his glory descend along with him.\"[fn-58-P5820_1763481:540-nf] So also in Psalms 61: \"Do not desire riches; and if they do yield you their lustre,[fn-58-P5821_1763590:541-nf] do not set your heart upon them.\"[fn-58-P5822_1763641:542-nf] Lastly, this very same woe is pronounced of old by Amos against the rich, who also abounded in delights. \"Woe unto them,\" says he, \"who sleep upon beds of ivory, and deliciously stretch themselves upon their couches; who eat the kids from the flocks of the goats, and sucking calves from the flocks of the heifers, while they chant to the sound of the viol; as if they thought they should continue long, and were not fleeting; who drink their refined wines, and anoint themselves with the costliest ointments.\"[fn-58-P5823_1764173:543-nf] Therefore, even if I could do nothing else than show that the Creator dissuades men from riches, without at the same time first condemning the rich, in the very same terms in which Christ also did, no one could doubt that, from the same authority, there was added a commination against the rich in that woe of Christ, from whom also had first proceeded the dissuasion against the material sin of these persons, that is, their riches. For such commination is the necessary sequel to such a dissuasive. He inflicts a woe also on \"the full, because they shall hunger; on those too which laugh now, because they shall mourn.\"[fn-58-P5824_1764816:544-nf] To these will correspond these opposites which occur, as we have seen above, in the benedictions of the Creator: \"Behold, my servants shall be full, but ye shall be hungry \"-even because ye have been filled; \"behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed\"[fn-58-P5825_1765105:545-nf] -even ye who shall mourn, who now are laughing. For as it is written in the psalm, \"They who sow in tears shall reap in joy,\"[fn-58-P5826_1765252:546-nf] so does it run in the Gospel: They who sow in laughter, that is, in joy, shall reap in tears. These principles did the Creator lay down of old; and Christ has renewed them, by simply bringing them into prominent view,[fn-58-P5827_1765491:547-nf] not by making any change in them. \"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\"[fn-58-P5828_1765648:548-nf] With equal stress does the Creator, by His prophet Isaiah, censure those who seek after human flattery and praise: \"O my people, they who call you happy mislead you, and disturb the paths of your feet.\"[fn-58-P5829_1765871:549-nf] In another passage He forbids all implicit trust in man, and likewise in the applause of man; as by the prophet Jeremiah: \"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man.\"[fn-58-P5830_1766056:550-nf] Whereas in Psalms 117 it is said: \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord than to place hope in princes.\"[fn-58-P5831_1766243:551-nf] Thus everything which is caught at by men is adjured by the Creator, down to their good words.[fn-58-P5832_1766364:552-nf] It is as much His property to condemn the praise and flattering words bestowed on the false prophets by their fathers, as to condemn their vexatious and persecuting treatment of the (true) prophets. As the injuries suffered by the prophets could not be imputed[fn-58-P5833_1766653:553-nf] to their own God, so the applause bestowed on the false prophets could not have been displeasing to any other god but the God of the true prophets.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":30,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Then, turning to His disciples, He says: \"Woe unto him through whom offences come! It were better for him if he had not been born, or if a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones,\"[fn-67-P6718_1964834:1377-nf] that is, one of His disciples. Judge, then, what the sort of punishment is which He so severely threatens. For it is no stranger who is to avenge the offence done to His disciples. Recognise also in Him the Judge, and one too, who expresses Himself on the safety of His followers with the same tenderness as that which the Creator long ago exhibited: \"He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of my eye.\"[fn-67-P6719_1965264:1378-nf] Such identity of care proceeds from one and the same Being. A trespassing brother He will have rebuked.[fn-67-P6720_1965390:1379-nf] If one failed in this duty of reproof, he in fact sinned, either because out of hatred he wished his brother to continue in sin, or else spared him from mistaken friendship,[fn-67-P6721_1965587:1380-nf] although possessing the injunction in Leviticus: \"Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart; thy neighbor thou shalt seriously rebuke, and on his account shalt not contract sin.\"[fn-67-P6722_1965851:1381-nf] Nor is it to be wondered at, if He thus teaches who forbids your refusing to bring back even your brother's cattle, if you find them astray in the road; much more should you bring back your erring brother to himself. He commands you to forgive your brother, should he trespass against you even \"seven times.\"[fn-67-P6723_1966437:1382-nf] But that surely, is a small matter; for with the Creator there is a larger grace, when He sets no limits to forgiveness, indefinitely charging you \"not to bear any malice against your brother,\"[fn-67-P6724_1966654:1383-nf] and to give not merely to him who asks, but even to him who does not ask. For His will is, not that you should forgive[fn-67-P6725_1966796:1384-nf] an offence, but forget it. The law about lepers had a profound meaning as respects[fn-67-P6726_1966895:1385-nf] the forms of the disease itself, and of the inspection by the high priest.[fn-67-P6727_1966997:1386-nf] The interpretation of this sense it will be our task to ascertain. Marcion's labour, however, is to object to us the strictness[fn-67-P6728_1967158:1387-nf] of the law, with the view of maintaining that here also Christ is its enemy-forestalling[fn-67-P6729_1967269:1388-nf] its enactments even in His cure of the ten lepers. These He simply commanded to show themselves to the priest; \"and as they went, He cleansed them\"[fn-67-P6730_1967441:1389-nf] -without a touch, and without a word, by His silent power and simple will. Well, but what necessity was there for Christ, who had been once for all announced as the healer of our sicknesses and sins, and had proved Himself such by His acts,[fn-67-P6731_1967709:1390-nf] to busy Himself with inquiries[fn-67-P6732_1967822:1391-nf] into the qualities and details of cures; or for the Creator to be summoned to the scrutiny of the law in the person of Christ? If any pan of this healing was effected by Him in a way different from the law, He yet Himself did it to perfection; for surely the Lord may by Himself, or by His Son, produce after one manner, and after another manner by His servants the prophets, those proofs of His power and might especially, which (as excelling in glory and strength, because they are His own acts) rightly enough leave in the distance behind them the works which are done by His servants. But enough has been already said on this point in a former passage.[fn-67-P6733_1968501:1392-nf] Now, although He said in a preceding chapter,[fn-67-P6734_1968579:1393-nf] that \"there were many lepers in lsrµl in the days of Eliseus the prophet, and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian,\" yet of course the mere number proves nothing towards a difference in the gods, as tending to the abasement[fn-67-P6735_1968858:1394-nf] of the Creator in curing only one, and the pre-eminence of Him who healed ten. For who can doubt that many might have been cured by Him who cured one more easily than ten by him who had never healed one before? But His main purpose in this declaration was to strike at the unbelief or the pride of Israel, in that (although there were many lepers amongst them, and a prophet was not wanting to them) not one had been moved even by so conspicuous an example to betake himself to God who was working in His prophets. Forasmuch, then, as He was Himself the veritable[fn-67-P6736_1969446:1395-nf] High Priest of God the Father, He inspected them according to the hidden purport of the law, which signified that Christ was the true distinguisher and extinguisher of the defilements of mankind. However, what was obviously required by the law He commanded should be done: \"Go,\" said He, \"show yourselves to the priests.\"[fn-67-P6737_1969957:1396-nf] Yet why this, if He meant to cleanse them first? Was it as a despiser of the law, in order to prove to them that, having been cured already on the road, the law was now nothing to them, nor even the priests? Well, the matter must of course pass as it best may,[fn-67-P6738_1970242:1397-nf] if anybody supposes that Christ had such views as these![fn-67-P6739_1970327:1398-nf] But there are certainly better interpretations to be found of the passage, and more deserving of belief: how that they were cleansed on this account, because[fn-67-P6740_1970509:1399-nf] they were obedient, and went as the law required, when they were commanded to go to the priests; and it is not to be believed that persons who observed the law could have found a cure from a god that was destroying the law. Why, however, did He not give such a command to the leper who first returned?[fn-67-P6741_1970858:1400-nf] Because Elisha did not in the case of Naaman the Syrian, and yet was not on that account less the Creator's agent? This is a sufficient answer.But the believer knows that there is a profounder reason. Consider, therefore, the true motives.[fn-67-P6742_1971139:1401-nf] The miracle was performed in the district of Samaria, to which country also belonged one of the lepers.[fn-67-P6743_1971260:1402-nf] Samaria, however, had revolted from Israel, carrying with it the disaffected nine tribes,[fn-67-P6744_1971374:1403-nf] which, having been alienated[fn-67-P6745_1971836:1404-nf] by the prophet Ahijah,[fn-67-P6746_1971877:1405-nf] Jeroboam settled in Samaria. Besides, the Samaritans were always pleased with the mountains and the wells of their ancestors. Thus, in the Gospel of John, the woman of Samaria, when conversing with the Lord at the well, says, \"No doubt[fn-67-P6747_1972153:1406-nf] Thou art greater,\" etc.; and again, \"Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; but ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.\"[fn-67-P6748_1972317:1407-nf] Accordingly, He who said, \"Woe unto them that trust in the mountain of Samaria,\"[fn-67-P6749_1972424:1408-nf] vouchsafing now to restore that very region, purposely requests the men \"to go and show themselves to the priests,\" because these were to be found only there where the temple was; submitting[fn-67-P6750_1972636:1409-nf] the Samaritan to the Jew, inasmuch as \"salvation was of the Jews,\"[fn-67-P6751_1972740:1410-nf] whether to the Israelite or the Samaritan. To the tribe of Judah, indeed, wholly appertained the promised Christ,[fn-67-P6752_1972876:1411-nf] in order that men might know that at Jerusalem were both the priests and the temple; that there also was the womb[fn-67-P6753_1973024:1412-nf] of religion, and its living fountain, not its mere \"well.\"[fn-67-P6754_1973102:1413-nf] Seeing, therefore, that they recognised[fn-67-P6755_1973178:1414-nf] the truth that at Jerusalem the law was to be fulfilled, He healed them. whose salvation was to come[fn-67-P6756_1973299:1415-nf] of faith[fn-67-P6757_1973332:1416-nf] without the ceremony of the law. Whence also, astonished that one only out of the ten was thankful for his release to the divine grace, He does not command him to offer a gift according to the law, because he had already paid his tribute of gratitude when \"he glorified God;[fn-67-P6758_1973631:1417-nf] for thus did the Lord will that the law's requirement should be interpreted. And yet who was the God to whom the Samaritan gave thanks, because thus far not even had an Israelite heard of another god? Who else but He by whom all had hitherto been healed through Christ? And therefore it was said to him, \"Thy faith hath made thee whole,\"[fn-67-P6759_1973994:1418-nf] because he had discovered that it was his duty to render the true oblation to Almighty God-even thanksgiving-in His true temple, and before His true High Priest Jesus Christ. But it is impossible either that the Pharisees should seem to have inquired of the Lord about the coming of the kingdom of the rival god, when no other god has ever yet been announced by Christ; or that He should have answered them concerning the kingdom of any other god than Him of whom they were in the habit of asking Him. \"The kingdom of God,\" He says, \"cometh not with observation; neither do they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-67-P6760_1974673:1419-nf] Now, who will not interpret the words \"within you\" to mean in your hand, within your power, if you hear, and do the commandment of God? If, however, the kingdom of God lies in His commandment, set before your mind Moses on the other side, according to our antitheses, and you will find the self-same view of the case.[fn-67-P6761_1975019:1420-nf] \"The commandment is not a lofty one,[fn-67-P6762_1975080:1421-nf] neither is it far off from thee. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, `Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 'nor is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, `Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 'But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, and in thy hands, to do it.\"[fn-67-P6763_1975526:1422-nf] This means, \"Neither in this place nor that place is the kingdom of God; for, behold, it is within you.\"[fn-67-P6764_1975658:1423-nf] And if the heretics, in their audacity, should contend that the Lord did not give an answer about His own kingdom, but only about the Creator's kingdom, concerning which they had inquired, then the following words are against them. For He tells them that \"the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected,\" before His coming,[fn-67-P6765_1976015:1424-nf] at which His kingdom will be really[fn-67-P6766_1976075:1425-nf] revealed. In this statement He shows that it was His own kingdom which His answer to them had contemplated, and which was now awaiting His own sufferings and rejection. But having to be rejected and afterwards to be acknowledged, and taken up[fn-67-P6767_1976344:1426-nf] and glorified, He borrowed the very word \"rejected\" from the passage, where, under the figure of a stone, His twofold manifestation was celebrated by David-the first in rejection, the second in honour: \"The stone,\" says He, \"which the builders rejected, is become the head-stone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing.\"[fn-67-P6768_1976682:1427-nf] Now it would be idle, if we believed that God had predicted the humiliation, or even the glory, of any Christ at all, that He could have signed His prophecy for any but Him whom He had foretold under the figure of a stone, and a rock, and a mountain.[fn-67-P6769_1976958:1428-nf] If, however, He speaks of His own coming, why does He compare it with the days of Noe and of Lot,[fn-67-P6770_1977100:1429-nf] which were dark and terrible-a mild and gentle God as He is? Why does He bid us \"remember Lot's wife,\"[fn-67-P6771_1977230:1430-nf] who despised the Creator's command, and was punished for her contempt, if He does not come with judgment to avenge the infraction of His precepts? If He really does punish, like the Creator,[fn-67-P6772_1977445:1431-nf] if He is my Judge, He ought not to have adduced examples for the purpose of instructing me from Him whom He yet destroys, that He[fn-67-P6773_1977593:1432-nf] might not seem to be my instructor. But if He does not even here speak of His own coming, but of the coming of the Hebrew Christ,[fn-67-P6774_1977748:1433-nf] let us still wait in expectation that He will vouchsafe to us some prophecy of His own advent; meanwhile we will continue to believe that He is none other than He whom He reminds us of in every passage.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":30,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Jeremiah: \"Thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah, and to them who inhabit Jerusalem, Renew newness among you, and do not sow among thorns: circumcise yourselves to your God, and circumcise the foreskin of your heart; lest my anger go forth like fire, and burn you up, and there be none to extinguish it.\"[fn-80-P8000_2675903:46-nf] Also Moses says: \"In the last days God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God.\"[fn-80-P8001_2676043:47-nf] Also in Jesus the son of Nave: \"And the Lord said unto Jesus, Make thee small knives of stone, very sharp, and set about to circumcise the children of Israel for the second time.\"[fn-80-P8002_2676242:48-nf] Paul also, to the Colossians: \"Ye are circumcised with the circumcision not made with hands in the putting off of the flesh, but with the circumcision of Christ.\"[fn-80-P8003_2676422:49-nf] Also, because Adam was first made by God uncircumcised, and righteous Abel, and Enoch, who pleased God and was translated; and Noah, who, when the world and men were perishing on account of transgressions, was chosen alone, that in him the human race might be preserved; and Melchizedek, the priest according to whose order Christ was promised.

Read a compendious interpretation of some apostolic words from the same discourse. Let us see, then, what it is that we have endeavoured to say respecting the apostle. For this saying of his, \"I was alive without the law once,\"[fn-58-P5856_1773244:60-nf] refers to the life which was lived in paradise before the law, not without a body, but with a body, by our first parents, as we have shown above; for we lived without concupiscence, being altogether ignorant of its assaults. For not to have a law according to which we ought to live, nor a power of establishing what manner of life we ought to adopt, so that we might justly be approved or blamed, is considered to exempt a person from accusation. Because one cannot lust after those things from which he is not restrained, and even if he lusted after them, he would not be blamed. For lust is not directed to things which are before us, and subject to our power, but to those which are before us, and not in our power. For how should one care for a thing which is neither forbidden nor necessary to him? And for this reason it is said, \"I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.\"[fn-58-P5857_1774171:61-nf] For when (our first parents) heard, \"Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shall not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die,\"[fn-58-P5858_1774358:62-nf] then they conceived lust, and gathered it. Therefore was it said, I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet; \"nor would they have desired to eat, except it had been said, \"Thou shalt not eat of it.\" For it was thence that sin took occasion to deceive me. For when the law was given, the devil had it in his power to work lust in me; \"for without the law, sin was dead; \"[fn-58-P5859_1774773:63-nf] which means \"when the law was not given, sin could not be committed.\" But I was alive and blameless before the law, having no commandment in accordance with which it was necessary to live; \"but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.\"[fn-58-P5860_1775113:64-nf] For after God had given the law, and had commanded me what I ought to do, and what I ought not to do, the devil wrought lust in me. For the promise of God which was given to me, this was for life and incorruption, so that obeying it I might have ever-blooming life and joy unto incorruption; but to him who disobeyed it, it would issue in death. But the devil, whom he calls sin, because he is the author of sin, taking occasion by the commandment to deceive me to disobedience, deceived and slew me, thus rendering me subject to the condemnation, \"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die.\"[fn-58-P5861_1775744:65-nf] \"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just and good; \"[fn-58-P5862_1775837:66-nf] because it was given, not for injury, but for safety; for let us not suppose that God makes anything useless or hurtful. What thou? \"Was then that which is good made death unto me? \"[fn-58-P5863_1776039:67-nf] namely, that which was given as a law, that it might be the cause of the greatest good? \"God forbid.\" For it was not the law of God that became the cause of my being brought into subjection to corruption, but the devil; that he might be made manifested who, through that which is good, wrought evil; that the inventor of evil might become and be proved the greatest of all sinners. \"For we know that the law is spiritual; \"[fn-58-P5864_1776482:68-nf] and therefore it can in no respect be injurious to any one; for spiritual things are far removed from irrational lust and sin. \"But I am carnal, sold under sin; \"[fn-58-P5865_1776664:69-nf] which means: But I being carnal, and being placed between good and evil as a voluntary agent, am so that I may have it in my power to choose what I will. For \"behold I set before thee life and death; \"[fn-58-P5866_1776885:70-nf] meaning that death would result from disobedience of the spiritual law, that is of the commandment; and from obedience to the carnal law, that is the counsel of the serpent; for by such a choice \"I am sold\" to the devil, fallen under sin. Hence evil, as though besieging me, cleaves to me and dwells in me, justice giving me up to be sold to the Evil One, in consequence of having violated the law. Therefore also the expressions: \"That which I do, I allow not,\" and \"what I hate, that do I,\"[fn-58-P5867_1777426:71-nf] are not to be understood of doing evil, but of only thinking it.

Yet there is a plainer guide to be found than verbal instruction; and that is practice: and there is nothing vexatious in the maxim that when we are undertaking a long journey or voyage we should get an instructor. \"But,\" says the Apostle[fn-28-P2880_1936874:162-nf] , \"the word is nigh thee;\"the grace begins at home; there is the manufactory of all the virtues; there this life has become exquisitely refined by a continual progress towards consummate perfection; there, whether men are silent or whether they speak, there is large opportunity for being instructed in this heavenly citizenship through the actual practice of it. Any theory divorced from living examples, however admirably it may be dressed out, is like the unbreathing statue, with its show of a blooming complexion impressed in tints and colours; but the man who acts as well as teaches, as the Gospel tells us, he is the man who is truly living, and has the bloom of beauty, and is efficient and stirring. It is to him that we must go, if we mean, according to the saying[fn-28-P2881_1937750:163-nf] of Scripture, to \"retain\" virginity. One who wants to learn a foreign language is not a competent instructor of himself; he gets himself taught by experts, and can then talk with foreigners. So, for this high life, which does not advance in nature's groove, but is estranged from her by the novelty of its course, a man cannot be instructed thoroughly unless he puts himself into the hands of one who has himself led it in perfection; and indeed in all the other professions of life the candidate is more likely to achieve success if he gets from tutors a scientific knowledge of each part of the subject of his choice, than if he undertook to study it by himself; and this particular profession[fn-28-P2882_1938563:164-nf] is not one where everything is so clear that judgment as to our best course in it is necessarily left to ourselves; it is one where to hazard a step into the unknown at once brings us into danger. The science of medicine once did not exist; it has come into being by the experiments which men have made, and has gradually been revealed through their various observations; the healing and the harmful drug became known from the attestation of those who had tried them, and this distinction was adopted into the theory of the art, so that the close observation of former practitioners became a precept for those who succeeded; and now any one who studies to attain this art is under no necessity to ascertain at his own peril the power of any drug, whether it be a poison or a medicine; he has only to learn from others the known facts, and may than practise with success. It is so also with that medicine of the soul, philosophy, from which we learn the remedy for every weakness that can touch the soul. We need not hunt after a knowledge of these remedies by dint of guess-work and surmisings; we have abundant means of learning them from him who by a long and rich experience has gained the possession which we seek. In any matter youth is generally a giddy[fn-28-P2883_1940288:165-nf] guide; and it would not be easy to find anything of importance succeeding, in which gray hairs have not been called in to share in the deliberations. Even in all other undertakings we must, in proportion to their greater importance, take the more precaution against failure; for in them too the thoughtless designs of youth have brought loss; on property, for instance; or have compelled the surrender of a position in the world, and even of renown. But in this mighty and sublime ambition it is not property, or secular glory lasting for its hour, or any external fortune, that is at stake;-of such things[fn-28-P2884_1941127:166-nf] , whether they settle themselves well or the reverse, the wise take small account;-here rashness can affect the soul itself; and we run the awful hazard, not of losing any of those other things whose recovery even may perhaps be possible, but of ruining our very selves and making the soul a bankrupt. A man who has spent or lost his patrimony does not despair, as long as he is in the land of the living, of perchance coming again through contrivances into his former competence; but the man who has ejected himself from this calling, deprives himself as well of all hope of a return to better things. Therefore, since most embrace virginity while still young and unformed in understanding, this before anything else should be their employment, to search out a fitting guide and master of this way, lest, in their present ignorance, they should wander from the direct route, and strike out new paths of their own in trackless wilds[fn-28-P2885_1942310:167-nf] . \"Two are better than one,\" saysthe Preacher[fn-28-P2886_1942485:168-nf] ; but a single one is easily vanquished by the foe who infests the path which leads to God; and verily \"woe to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up[fn-28-P2887_1942697:169-nf] .\" Some ere now in their enthusiasm for the stricter life have shown a dexterous alacrity; but, as if in the very moment of their choice they had already touched perfection, their pride has had a shocking fall[fn-28-P2888_1943023:170-nf] , and they have been tripped up from madly deluding themselves into thinking that that to which their own mind inclined them was the true beauty. In this number are those whom Wisdom calls the \"slothful ones[fn-28-P2889_1943269:171-nf] ,\" who bestrew their \"way\" with \"thorns\"; who think it a moral loss to be anxious about keeping the commandments; who erase from their own minds the Apostolic teaching, and instead of eating the bread of their own honest earning fix on that of others, and make their idleness itself into an art of living. From this number, too, come the Dreamers, who put more faith in the illusions of their dreams[fn-28-P2890_1943690:172-nf] than in the Gospel teaching, and style their own phantasies \"revelations.\" Hence, too, those who \"creep into the houses\"; and again others who suppose virtue to consist in savage bearishness, and have never known the fruits of long-suffering and humility of spirit. Who could enumerate all the pitfalls into which any one might slip, from refusing to have recourse to men of godly celebrity? Why, we have known ascetics of this class who have persisted in their fasting even unto death, as if \"with such sacrifices God were well pleased[fn-28-P2891_1944484:173-nf] ;\" and, again, others who rush off into the extreme diametrically opposite, practising celibacy in name only and leading a life in no way different from the secular; for they not only indulge in the pleasures of the table, but are openly known to have a woman in their houses[fn-28-P2892_1944782:174-nf] ; and they call such a friendship a brotherly affection, as if, forsooth, they could veil their own thought, which is inclined to evil, under a sacred term. It is owing to them that this pure and holy profession of virginity is \"blasphemed amongst the Gentiles[fn-28-P2893_1945103:175-nf] .\"","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":30,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_13_part_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"The tenets we have been speaking of have been proved to be nothing more than a false guide for life; but the way of truth will aim at reaching the real and true God. But for its knowledge and accurate comprehension, there is need of none other save of ourselves. Neither as God Himself is above all, is the road to Him afar off or outside ourselves, but it is in us and it is possible to find it from ourselves, in the first instance, as Moses also taught, when he said[fn-17-P1709_612360:1-nf] : \"The word\" of faith \"is within thy heart.\" Which very thing the Saviour declared and confirmed, when He said: \"The kingdom of God is within you[fn-17-P1710_612524:2-nf] .\" 2.

And if one were to ask, what road is this? I say that it is the soul of each one of us, and the intelligence which resides there. For by it alone can God be contemplated and perceived. 4. Unless, as they have denied God, the impious men will repudiate having a soul; which indeed is more plausible than the rest of what they say, for it is unlike men possessed of an intellect to deny God, its Maker and Artificer. It is necessary then, for the sake of the simple, to shew briefly that each one of mankind has a soul, and that soul rational; especially as certain of the sectaries deny this also, thinking that man is nothing more than the visible form of the body.

But the enemy of this life, who is also the last enemy of all His enemies that shall be destroyed, is death,[fn-81-P8120_1736550:214-nf] of which the soul that sinneth dies, having the opposite disposition to that which takes place in the soul that lives uprightly, and in consequence of living uprightly lives. And when it is said in the law, \"I have placed life before thy face,\"[fn-81-P8121_1736817:215-nf] the Scripture says this about Him who said, \"I am the Life,\" and about His enemy, death; the one or other of which each of us by his deeds is always choosing. And when we sin with life before our face, the curse is fulfilled against us which says, \"And thy life shall be hanging up before thee,\" etc., down to the words, \"and for the sights of thine eyes which thou shall see.\"[fn-81-P8122_1737217:216-nf] As, therefore, the Life is also the living bread which came down from heaven and gave life to the world,[fn-81-P8123_1737351:217-nf] so His enemy death is dead bread. Now every rational soul is fed either on living bread or dead bread, by the opinions good or bad which it receives. As then in the case of more common foods it is the practice at one time only to taste them, and at another to eat of them more largely; so also, in the case of these loaves, one eats insufficiently only tasting them, but another is satiated,-he that is good or is on the way to being good with the living bread which came down from heaven, but he that is wicked with the dead bread, which is death; and some perhaps sparingly, and sinning a little, only taste of death; but those who have attained to virtue do not even taste of it, but are always fed on the living bread. It naturally followed then in the case of Peter, against whom the gates of Hades will not prevail, that he did not taste of death, since any one tastes of death and eats death at the time when the gates of Hades prevail against him; and one eats or tastes of death in proportion as the gates of Hades to a greater or less extent, more or fewer in number, prevail against him. But also for the sons of thunder who were begotten of thunder, which is a heavenly thing, it was impossible to taste of death, which is extremely far removed from thunder, their mother. But these things the Word prophesies to those who shall be perfected, and who by standing with the Word advanced so far that they did not taste of death, until they saw the manifestation and the glory and the kingdom and the excellency of the Word of God in virtue of which He excels every word, which by an appearance of truth draws away and drags about those who are not able to break through the bonds of distraction, and go up to the height of the excellency of the Word of truth.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":30,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_46_the_first_apology_of_justin","source_chapter":46,"source_paragraph":"162","folder":"ANF-01","text":"And the holy Spirit of prophecy taught us this, telling us by Moses that God spoke thus to the man first created: \"Behold, before thy face are good and evil: choose the good.\"[fn-38-P3816_702068:89-nf] And again, by the other prophet Isaiah, that the following utterance was made as if from God the Father and Lord of all: \"Wash you, make you clean; put away evils from your souls; learn to do well; judge the orphan, and plead for the widow: and come and let us reason together, saith the Lord: And if your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as wool; and if they be red like as crimson, I will make them white as snow.

Wherefore He says, \"The sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.\" And if He had spoken concerning a sword that cuts and at once despatches, He would not have said, shall devour. And so, too, Plato, when he says, \"The blame is his who chooses, and God is blameless,\"[fn-38-P3818_703199:91-nf] took this from the prophet Moses and uttered it. For Moses is more ancient than all the Greek writers. And whatever both philosophers and poets have said concerning the immortality of the soul, or punishments after death, or contemplation of things heavenly, or doctrines of the like kind, they have received such suggestions from the prophets as have enabled them to understand and interpret these things.

So that what we say about future events being foretold, we do not say it as if they came about by a fatal necessity; but God foreknowing all that shall be done by all men, and it being His decree that the future actions of men shall all be recompensed according to their several value, He foretells by the Spirit of prophecy that He will bestow meet rewards according to the merit of the actions done, always urging the human race to effort and recollection, showing that He cares and provides for men. But by the agency of the devils death has been decreed against those who read the books of Hystaspes, or of the Sibyl,[fn-38-P3819_704556:92-nf] or of the prophets, that through fear they may prevent men who read them from receiving the knowledge of the good, and may retain them in slavery to themselves; which, however, they could not always effect. For not only do we fearlessly read them, but, as you see, bring them for your inspection, knowing that their contents will be pleasing to all. And if we persuade even a few, our gain will be very great; for, as good husbandmen, we shall receive the reward from the Master.","title":"The First Apology of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":30,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"ANF-04","text":"6. And now, to confirm the deductions of reason by the authority of Scripture-viz., that it is our own doing whether we live rightly or not, and that we are not compelled, either by those causes which come to us from without, or, as some think, by the presence of fate-we adduce the testimony of the prophet Micah, in these words: \"If it has been announced to thee, O man, what is good, or what the Lord requires of thee, except that thou shouldst do justice, and love mercy, and be ready to walk with the Lord thy God.\"[fn-68-P6818_1440464:36-nf] Moses also speaks as follows: \"I have placed before thy face the way of life and the way of death: choose what is good, and walk in it.\"[fn-68-P6819_1440618:37-nf] Isaiah, moreover, makes this declaration: \"If you are willing, and hear me, ye shall eat the good of the land.

But, according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou art treasuring up for thyself wrath on the day of judgment and of the revelation of the just judgment of God, who will render to every one according to his work: to those who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and immortality, eternal life;[fn-68-P6828_1443253:46-nf] while to those who are contentious, and believe not the truth, but who believe iniquity, anger, indignation, tribulation, and distress, on every soul of man that worketh evil, on the Jew first, and (afterwards) on the Greek; but glory, and honour, and peace to every one that doeth good, to the Jew first, and (afterwards) to the Greek.\"[fn-68-P6829_1443715:47-nf] You will find also innumerable other passages in holy Scripture, which manifestly show that we possess freedom of will.

Let us therefore repent, and pass from ignorance to knowledge, from foolishness to wisdom, from licentiousness to self-restraint, from unrighteousness to righteousness, from godlessness to God. It is an enterprise of noble daring to take our way to God; and the enjoyment of many other good things is within the reach of the lovers of righteousness, who pursue eternal life, specially those things to which God Himself alludes, speaking by Isaiah: \"There is an inheritance for those who serve the Lord.\"[fn-31-P3180_928968:123-nf] Noble and desirable is this inheritance: not gold, not silver, not raiment, which the moth assails, and things of earth which are assailed by the robber, whose eye is dazzled by worldly wealth; but it is that treasure of salvation to which we must hasten, by becoming lovers of the Word. Thence praise-worthy works descend to us, and fly with us on the wing of truth. This is the inheritance with Which the eternal covenant of God invests us, conveying the everlasting gift of grace; and thus our loving Father-the true Father-ceases not to exhort, admonish, train, love us. For He ceases not to save, and advises the best course: \"Become righteous,\" says the Lord.[fn-31-P3181_929655:124-nf] Ye that thirst, come to the water; and ye that have no money, come, and buy and drink without money.[fn-31-P3182_929820:125-nf] He invites to the layer, to salvation, to illumination, all but crying out and saying, The land I give thee, and the sea, my child, and heaven too; and all the living creatures in them I freely bestow upon thee. Only, O child, thirst for thy Father; God shall be revealed to thee without price; the truth is not made merchandise of. He gives thee all creatures that fly and swim, and those on the land. These the Father has created for thy thankful enjoyment. What the bastard, who is a son of perdition, foredoomed to be the slave of mammon, has to buy for money, He assigns to thee as thine own, even to His own son who loves the Father; for whose sake He still works, and to whom alone He promises, saying, \"The land shall not be sold in perpetuity,\" for it is not destined to corruption. \"For the whole land is mine; \"and it is thine too, if thou receive God. Wherefore the Scripture, as might have been expected, proclaims good news to those who have believed. \"The saints of the Lord shall inherit the glory of God and His power.\" What glory, tell me, O blessed One, which \"eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man; \"[fn-31-P3183_930998:126-nf] and \"they shall be glad in the kingdom of their Lord for ever and ever! Amen.\" You have, O men, the divine promise of grace; you have heard, on the other hand, the threatening of punishment: by these the Lord saves, teaching men by fear and grace. Why do we delay? Why do we not shun the punishment? Why do we not receive the free gift? Why, in fine. do we not choose the better part, God instead of the evil one, and prefer wisdom to idolatry, and take life in exchange for death? \"Behold,\" He says, \"I have set before your face death and life.\"[fn-31-P3184_931566:127-nf] The Lord tries you, that \"you may choose life.\" He counsels yon as a father to obey God. \"For if ye hear Me,\" He says, \"and be willing, ye shall eat the good things of the land: \"[fn-31-P3185_931768:128-nf] this is the grace attached to obedience. \"But if ye obey Me not, and are unwilling, the sword and fire shall devour you: \"[fn-31-P3186_931910:129-nf] this is the penalty of disobedience.

You ought, O men, when reflecting on the Good, to have brought forward a witness inborn and competent, viz, faith, which of itself, and from its own resources, chooses at once what is best, instead of occupying yourselves in painfully inquiring whether what is best ought to be followed. For, allow me to tell you, you ought to doubt whether you should get drunk, but you get drunk before reflecting on the matter; and whether you ought to do an injury, but you do injury with the utmost readiness. The only thing you make the subject of question is, whether God should be worshipped, and whether this wise God and Christ should be followed: and this you think requires deliberation and doubt, and know not what is worthy of God. Have faith in us, as you have in drunkenness, that you may be wise; have faith in us, as you have in injury, that you may live.

Again, showing the opposite scale of the balance of justice, He says, \"But not so the ungodly-not so; but as the dust which the wind sweeps away from the face of the earth.\"[fn-36-P3661_1104630:249-nf] By showing the punishment of sinners, and their easy dispersion, and carrying off by the wind, the Instructor dissuades from crime by means of punishment; and by holding up the merited penalty, shows the benignity of His beneficence in the most skilful way, in order that we may possess and enjoy its blessings. He invites us to knowledge also, when He says by Jeremiah, \"Hadst thou walked in the way of God, thou wouldst have dwelt for ever in peace; \"[fn-36-P3662_1105101:250-nf] for, exhibiting there the reward of knowledge, He calls the wise to the love of it. And, granting pardon to him who has erred, He says, \"Turn, turn, as a grape-gatherer to his basket.\"[fn-36-P3663_1105309:251-nf] Do you see the goodness of justice, in that it counsels to repentance? And still further, by Jeremiah, He enlightens in the truth those who have erred. \"Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the ways, and look, and ask for the eternal paths of the Lord, what is the good path, and walk in it, and ye shall find purification for your souls.\"[fn-36-P3664_1105661:252-nf] And in order to promote our salvation, He leads us to repentance.

For it were a legitimate inference to say, that rebuke and censure are suitable to men, since they say that all men are bad; but God alone is wise, from whom cometh wisdom, and alone perfect, and therefore alone worthy of praise.

Accordingly, Antipatrus the Stoic, who composed three books on the point, \"That, according to Plato, only the beautiful is good,\" shows that, according to him, virtue is sufficient for happiness; and adduces several other dogmas agreeing with the Stoics. And by Aristobulus, who lived in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, who is mentioned by the composer of the epitome of the books of the Maccabees, there were abundant books to show that the Peripatetic philosophy was derived from the law of Moses and from the other prophets. Let such be the case.","title":"Book V.","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":30,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_67_book_vi_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"394","folder":"ANF-02","text":"What then? Did not the same dispensation obtain in Hades, so that even there, all the souls, on hearing the proclamation, might either exhibit repentance, or confess that their punishment was just, because they believed not? And it were the exercise of no ordinary arbitrariness, for those who had departed before the advent of the Lord (not having the Gospel preached to them, and having afforded no ground from themselves, in consequence of believing or not) to obtain either salvation or punishment. For it is not right that these should be condemned without trial, and that those alone who lived after the advent should have the advantage of the divine righteousness.

For he does not come immediately to the words just given, but what does he say? \"But the righteousness which is of faith saith on this wise; Say not in thine heart, Who shall go up into heaven?

And this is just why he brings the same before one. And as he did in Abraham's case, so he does here also. For having there shown that he was justified by faith, lest he should seem to have gotten so great a crown by a mere chance, as if it were a thing of no account, to extol the nature of faith, he says, \"Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations. And being not weak in faith, he considered his own body now dead, and the deadness of Sarah's womb. He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that what He had promised He was able also to perform\" (Rom. iv. 18-21): so he showed that there is need of vigor, and a lofty soul, that takes in things beyond expectation, and stumbles not at appearances. This then he does here also, and shows that it requires a wise mind, and a spirit heavenly (Gr. heaven-reaching) and great. And he does not say merely, \"Say not,\" but, \"Say not in thine heart,\" that is, do not so much as think of doubting and saying with thyself, And how can this be? You see that this is a chief characteristic of faith, to leave all the consequences[fn-28-P2842_2685497:8-nf] of this lower world, and so to seek for that which is above nature, and to cast out the feebleness of calculation, and so to accept everything from the Power of God. The Jews, however, did not merely assert this, but that it was not possible to be justified by faith. But himself turns even what had taken place to another account, that having shown the thing to be so great, that even after it had taken place it required faith, he might seem with good reason to bestow a crown on these: and he uses the words which are found in the Old Testament, being always at pains to keep quite clear of the charges of love of novelties, and of opposition to it. For this, which he here says of faith, Moses says to them of the commandment,[fn-28-P2843_2686294:9-nf] so showing that they had enjoyed at God's hand a great benefit. For there is no need to say, he means, that one must go up to heaven, or cross a great sea, and then receive the commandments, but things so great and grand hath God made of easy access to us. And what meaneth the phrase, \"The Word is nigh thee?\" That is, It is easy. For in thy mind and in thy tongue is thy salvation. There is no long journey to go, no seas to sail over, no mountains to pass, to get saved. But if you be not minded to cross so much as the threshold, you may even while you sit at home be saved. For \"in thy mouth and in thy heart\" is the source of salvation. And then on another score also he makes the word of faith easy, and says, that \"God raised Him from the dead.\" For just reflect upon the worthiness of the Worker, and you will no longer see any difficulty in the thing. That He is Lord then, is plain from the resurrection. And this he said at the beginning even of the Epistle. \"Which was declared to be the Son of God with power ... by the resurrection from the dead.\" (Rom. i. 4.) But that the resurrection is easy too, has been shown even to those who are very unbelieving, from the might of the Worker of it. Since then the righteousness is greater, and light and easy to receive, is it not a sign of the utmost contentiousness to leave what is light and easy, and set about impossibilities? For they could not say that it was a thing they declined as burdensome. See then how he deprives them of all excuse. For what do they deserve to have said in their defence, who choose what is burdensome and impracticable, and pass by what is light, and able to save them, and to give them those things which the Law could not give? All this can come only from a contentious spirit, which is in a state of rebellion against God. For the Law is galling (epaxqhj), but grace is easy. The Law, though they dispute never so much, does not save; Grace yieldeth the righteousness resulting from itself, and that from the Law likewise.
