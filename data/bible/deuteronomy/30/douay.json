{"verses":["Now when all these things shall be come upon thee, the blessing\nor the curse, which I have set forth before thee, and thou shalt be\ntouched with repentance of thy heart among all the nations, into which\nthe Lord thy God shall have scattered thee,","And shalt return to him, and obey his commandments, as I command\nthee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all\nthy soul:","The Lord thy God will bring back again thy captivity, and will\nhave mercy on thee, and gather thee again out of all the nations, into\nwhich he scattered thee before.","If thou be driven as far as the poles of heaven, the Lord thy God\nwill fetch thee back from hence,","And will take thee to himself, and bring thee into the land which\nthy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it:  and blessing thee, he\nwill make thee more numerous than were thy fathers.","The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy\nseed:  that thou mayst love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with\nall thy soul, that thou mayst live.","And he will turn all these curses upon thy enemies, and upon them\nthat hate and persecute thee.","But thou shalt return, and hear the voice of the Lord thy God,\nand shalt do all the commandments which I command thee this day:","And the Lord thy God will make thee abound in all the works of\nthy hands, in the fruit of thy womb, and in the fruit of thy cattle, in\nthe fruitfulness of thy land, and in the plenty of all things.  For the\nLord will return to rejoice over thee in all good things, as he\nrejoiced in thy fathers:","Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep his\nprecepts and ceremonies, which are written in this law:  and return to\nthe Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.","This commandment, that I command thee this day is not above\nthee, nor far off from thee:","Nor is it in heaven, that thou shouldst say:  Which of us can go\nup to heaven to bring it unto us, and we may hear and fulfil it in\nwork?","Nor is it beyond the sea:  that thou mayst excuse thyself, and\nsay:  Which of us can cross the sea, and bring it unto us:  that we may\nhear, and do that which is commanded?","But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy\nheart, that thou mayst do it.","Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good, and\non the other hand death and evil:","That thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and\nkeep his commandments and ceremonies and judgments, and bless thee in\nthe land, which thou shalt go in to possess.","But if thy heart be turned away, so that thou wilt not hear, and\nbeing deceived with error thou adore strange gods, and serve them:","I foretell thee this day that thou shalt perish, and shalt\nremain but a short time in the land, to which thou shalt pass over the\nJordan, and shalt go in to possess it.","I call heaven and earth to witness this day, that I have set\nbefore you life and death, blessing and cursing.  Choose therefore life,\nthat both thou and thy seed may live:","And that thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and obey his voice,\nand adhere to him (for he is thy life, and the length of thy days,)\nthat thou mayst dwell in the land, for which the Lord swore to thy\nfathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give it them."]}
