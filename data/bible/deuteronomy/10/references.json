For the sake, then, of speaking of things that cannot be uttered, that we may be able in some way to utter what we are able in no way to utter fully, our Greek friends have spoken of one essence, three substances; but the Latins of one essence or substance, three persons; because, as we have already said,[fn-12-P1203_508048:20-nf] essence usually means nothing else than substance in our language, that is, in Latin. And provided that what is said is understood only in a mystery, such a way of speaking was sufficient, in order that there might be something to say when it was asked what the three are, which the true faith pronounces to be three, when it both declares that the Father is not the Son, and that the Holy Spirit, which is the gift of God, is neither the Father nor the Son. When, then, it is asked what the three are, or who the three are, we betake ourselves to the finding out of some special or general name under which we may embrace these three; and no such name occurs to the mind, because the super-eminence of the Godhead surpasses the power of customary speech. For God is more truly thought than He is altered, and exists more truly than He is thought. For when we say that Jacob was not the same as Abraham, but that Isaac was neither Abraham nor Jacob, certainly we confess that they are three, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But when it is asked what three, we reply three men, calling them in the plural by a specific name; but if we were to say three animals, then by a generic name; for man, as the ancients have defined him, is a rational, mortal animal: or again, as our Scriptures usually speak, three souls, since it is fitting to denominate the whole from the better part, that is, to denominate both body and soul, which is the whole man, from the soul; for so it is said that seventy-five souls went down into Egypt with Jacob, instead of saying so many men.[fn-12-P1204_509630:21-nf] Again, when we say that your horse is not mine, and that a third belonging to some one else is neither mine nor yours, then we confess that there are three; and if any one ask what three, we answer three horses by a specific name, but three animals by a generic one. And yet again, when we say that an ox is not a horse, but that a dog is neither an ox nor a horse, we speak of a three; and if any one questions us what three, we do not speak now by a specific name of three horses, or three oxen, or three dogs, because the three are not contained under the same species, but by a gener three animals; or if under a higher genus, three substances, or three creatures, or three natures. But whatsoever things are expressed in the plural number specifically by one name, can also be expressed genetically by one name. But all things which are generically called by one name cannot also be called specifically by one name. For three horses, which is a specific name, we also call three animals; but, a horse, and an ox, and a dog, we call only three animals or substances, which are generic names, or anything else that can be spoken generically concerning them; but we cannot speak of them as three horses, or oxen, or dogs, which are specific names; for we express those things by one name, although in the plural number, which have that in common that is signified by the name. For Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, have in common that which is man; therefore they are called three men: a horse also, and an ox, and a dog, have in common that which is animal; therefore they are called three animals. So three several laurels we also call three trees; but a laurel, and a myrtle, and an olive, we call only three trees, or three substances, or three natures: and so three stones we call also three bodies; but stone, and wood, and iron, we call only three bodies, or by any other higher generic name by which they can be called. Of the Father, therefore, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, seeing that they are three, let us ask what three they are, and what they have in common. For the being the Father is not common to them, so that they should be interchangeably fathers to one another: as friends, since they are so called relatively to each other, can be called three friends, because they are so mutually to each other. But this is not the case in the Trinity, since the Father only is there father; and not Father of two, but of the Son only. Neither are they three Sons, since the Father there is not the Son, nor is the Holy Spirit. Neither three Holy Spirits, because the Holy Spirit also, in that proper meaning by which He is also called the gift of God, is neither the Father nor the Son. What three therefore? For if three persons, then that which is meant by person is common to them; therefore this name is either specific or generic to them, according to the manner of speaking. But where there is no difference of nature, there things that are several in number are so expressed generically, that they can also be expressed specifically. For the difference of nature causes, that a laurel, and a myrtle, and an olive, or a horse, and an ox, and a dog, are not called by the specific name, the former of three laurels, or the latter of three oxen, but by the generic name, the former of three trees, and the latter of three animals. But here, where there is no difference of essence, it is necessary that these three should have a specific name, which yet is not to be found. For person is a generic name, insomuch that man also can be so called, although there is so great a difference between man and God.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_13_letter_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"Well, do I convince you, that one ought never to despair of the disorders of the soul as incurable? or must I again set other arguments in motion? For even if thou shouldst despair of thyself ten thousand times, I will never despair of thee, and I will never myself be guilty of that for which I reproach others; and yet it is not the same thing for a man to renounce hope of himself, as for another to renounce hope of him. For he who has this suspicion concerning another may readily obtain pardon; but he who has it of himself will not. Why so pray? Because the one has no controlling power over the zeal and repentance of the other, but over his own zeal and repentance a man has sole authority. Nevertheless even so I will not despair of you; though you should any number of times be heard the prophet vehemently declaring, and plainly threatening; \"yet three days and Nineveh shall be overthrown,\" even then did not lose heart, but, although they had no confidence that they should be able to move the utterance was not accompanied by any qualification, but was a simple declaration), even then they manifested repentance saying: \"Who knoweth whether God will repent and be entreated, and turn from the fierceness of His wrath, and that we perish not? And God say their works that they turned from their evil ways, and God repented of the evil which He said He would do unto them and He did it not.\"[fn-6-P686_406269:64-nf] Now if barbarian, and unreasoning men could perceive so much, much more ought we to do this who have been trained in the divine doctrines and have seen such a crowd of example of this kind both in history and actual experience. \"For my counsels\" we read \"not as your counsels nor my ways as your ways; but far as is the Heaven from the earth, so far are my thoughts from your mind, and my counsels from your counsels.\"[fn-6-P687_406713:65-nf] Now if we admit to our favour household slaves when they have often offended against us, on their promising to become better, and place them again in their former portion, and sometimes even grant them greater freedom of speech than before; much more does God act thus. For if God had made us in order to punish us, you might well have despaired, and questioned the possibility of your own salvation; but if He created us for no reason than His own good will, and with a view to our enjoying everalasting blessings, and if He does and contrives everything for this end, from the first day until the present time, what is there which can ever cause you to doubt? Have we provoked Him severely, so as no other man ever did? this is just the reason why we ought specially to abstain from our present deeds and to repent for the past, and exhibit a great change. For the evils we have once perpetrated cannot provoke Him so much as our being unwilling to make any change in the future. For to sin may be a merely human failing, but to continue in the same sin ceases to be human, and becomes altogether devilish. For observe how God by the mouth of His prophet blames this more than the other. \"For,\" we read, \"I said unto her after she had done all these deeds of fornication, return unto me, and yet she returned not.\"[fn-6-P688_408054:66-nf] And again: from another quarter, when wishing to show the great longing which He has for our salvation, having heard how the people promised, after many transgressions, to tread the right way He said: \"Who will grant unto them to have such an heart as to fear me, and to keep my commandments all their days, that it may be well with them and with their children forever?\"[fn-6-P689_408477:67-nf] And Moses when reasoning with them said, \"And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all His ways, and to love Him?\"[fn-6-P690_408679:68-nf] He then who is so anxious to be loved by us, and does everything for this end, and did not spare even His only begotten Son on account of His love towards us, and who counts it a desirable thing if at any time we become reconciled to Himself, how shall He not welcome and love us when we repent? Hear at least what He says by the mouth of the prophet: \"Declare thou first thy iniquities that thou mayest be justified.\"[fn-6-P691_409116:69-nf] Now this He demands from us in order to intensify our love towards Him. For when one who loves, after enduring many insults at the hands of those who are beloved, even then does not extinguish his fondness for them, the only reason why he takes pains to make those insults public, is that by displaying the strength of his affection he may induce them to feel a larger and warmer love. Now if the confession of sins brings so much consolation, much more does the endeavour to wash them away by means of our deeds For if this was not the case, but those who had vehemence in evil things, will also in turn exhibit the same in good things, being conscious what great debts they have incurred; which Christ also declared when He spoke to Simon concerning the woman: \"For seeset thou,\" saith He, \"this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she hath washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss, but she since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. Mine head with oil thou didst not anoint; but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.

Furthermore this is plainly taught by the divine Scripture, for so the holy Matthew narrates the event, \"When the even was come there came a rich man of Arimathaea named Joseph who also himself was Jesus' disciple: he went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered, and when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed.\"[fn-47-P4776_1177426:62-nf] See how often he mentions the body in order to stop the mouths of them who blaspheme the Godhead. The same course is pursued by the thrice blessed Mark, whose narrative I will also quote. \"And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. And Pilate marvelled if He were already dead; and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether He had been any while dead. And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph, and he brought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped Him in the linen, and laid Him in a sepulchre,\"[fn-47-P4777_1178202:63-nf] and so on. Observe with admiration, the harmony of terms, and how consistently and continuously the word body is introduced. The illustrious Luke, too, relates just in the same way how Joseph begged the body and after he had received it treated it with due rites.[fn-47-P4778_1178487:64-nf] By the divine John we are told yet more, \"Joseph of Arimathaea being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus. And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a hundred pound weight. Then took they the body of Jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day, for the sepulchre was nigh at band.\"[fn-47-P4779_1179270:65-nf] Observe how often mention is made of the body; how the Evangelist shows that it was the body which was nailed to the cross, the body begged by Joseph of Pilate, the body taken down from the tree, the body wrapped in linen clothes with the myrrh and aloes, and then the name of the person given to it; and Jesus said to have been laid in a tomb. Thus the angel said, \"Come see the place where the Lord lay,\"[fn-47-P4780_1179699:66-nf] naming the part by the name of the whole; and we constantly do just the same. In this place, we say, such an one was buried; not the body of such an one. Every one in his senses knows that we are speaking of the body, and such a mode of speech is customary in divine Scripture. Aaron, we read, died and they buried him on Mount Hor.[fn-47-P4781_1180054:67-nf] Samuel died and they buried him at Ramah,[fn-47-P4782_1180113:68-nf] and there are many similar instances. The same use is followed by the divine Apostle when speaking of the death of the Lord. \"I delivered unto you first of all,\" he writes, \"that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-47-P4783_1180489:69-nf] and so on.","title":"Dialogue III.-The Impassible.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":10,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_26_on_the_holy_spirit_against_the_followers_of_macedonius","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"If such, then, is the greatness of the Spirit, and whatever is morally beautiful, whatever is good, coming from God as it does through the Son, is completed by the instrumentality of the Spirit that \"worketh all in all,\" why do they set themselves against their own life?

Yes, rather than any other. Or if another destroyed them, he only helped on the purpose of the Creator, by removing what even He had condemned. But this is not the place to discuss the question why the Creator abolished His own laws. It is enough for us to have proved that He intended such an abolition, that so it may be affirmed that the apostle determined nothing to the prejudice of the Creator, since the abolition itself proceeds from the Creator. But as, in the case of thieves, something of the stolen goods is apt to drop by the way, as a clue to their detection; so, as it seems to me, it has happened to Marcion: the last mention of Abraham's name he has left untouched (in the epistle), although no passage required his erasure more than this, even his partial alteration of the text.[fn-73-P7312_2111763:159-nf] \"For (it is written) that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free woman; but he who was of the bond maid was born after the flesh, but he of the free woman was by promise: which things are allegorized\"[fn-73-P7313_2112197:160-nf] (that is to say, they presaged something besides the literal history); \"for these are the two covenants,\" or the two exhibitions (of the divine plans),[fn-73-P7314_2112560:161-nf] as we have found the word interpreted,\" the one from the Mount Sinai,\" in relation to the synagogue of the Jews, according to the law, \"which gendereth to bondage\"-\"the other gendereth\" (to liberty, being raised) above all principality, and power, and dominion, and every name that is l named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come, \"which is the mother of us all,\" in which we have the promise of (Christ's) holy church; by reason of which he adds in conclusion: \"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond woman, but of the free.\"[fn-73-P7315_2113158:162-nf] In this passage he has undoubtedly shown that Christianity had a noble birth, being sprung, as the mystery of the allegory indicates, from that son of Abraham who was born of the free woman; whereas from the son of the bond maid came the legal bondage of Judaism. Both dispensations, therefore, emanate from that same God by whom,[fn-73-P7316_2113516:163-nf] as we have found, they were both sketched out beforehand. When he speaks of \"the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free,\"[fn-73-P7317_2113660:164-nf] does not the very phrase indicate that He is the Liberator who was once the Master? For Galba himself never liberated slaves which were not his own, even when about to restore free men to their liberty.[fn-73-P7318_2113881:165-nf] By Him, therefore, will liberty be bestowed, at whose command lay the enslaving power of the law. And very properly. It was not meet that those who had received liberty should be \"entangled again with the yoke of bondage\"[fn-73-P7319_2114436:166-nf] -that is, of the law; now that the Psalm had its prophecy accomplished: \"Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us, since the rulers have gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ.\"[fn-73-P7320_2114689:167-nf] All those, therefore, who had been delivered from the yoke of slavery he would earnestly have to obliterate the very mark of slavery-even circumcision, on the authority of the prophet'sprediction. He remembered how that Jeremiah had said, \"Circumcise the foreskins of your heart; \"[fn-73-P7321_2114992:168-nf] as Moses likewise had enjoined, \"Circumcise your hard hearts\"[fn-73-P7322_2115073:169-nf] -not the literal flesh. If, now, he were for excluding circumcision, as the messenger of a new god, why does he say that \"in Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision?[fn-73-P7323_2115285:170-nf] For it was his duty to prefer the rival principle of that which he was abolishing, if he had a mission from the god who was the enemy of circumcision.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Since my little work is approaching its termination,[fn-77-P7777_2219354:594-nf] I must treat but briefly the points which still occur, whilst those which have so often turned up must be put aside. I regret still to have to contend about the law-after I have so often proved that its replacement (by the gospel)[fn-77-P7778_2219605:595-nf] affords no argument for another god, predicted as it was indeed in Christ, and in the Creator's own plans[fn-77-P7779_2219732:596-nf] ordained for His Christ. (But I must revert to that discussion) so far as (the apostle leads me, for) this very epistle looks very much as if it abrogated[fn-77-P7780_2219910:597-nf] the law. We have, however, often shown before now that God is declared by the apostle to be a Judge; and that in the Judge is implied an Avenger; area in the Avenger, the Creator. And so in the passage where he says: \"I am not ashamed of the gospel (of Christ): for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that beheveth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek; for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith,\"[fn-77-P7781_2220372:598-nf] he undoubtedly ascribes both the gospel and salvation to Him whom (in accordance with our heretic's own distinction) I have called the just God, not the good one. It is He who removes (men) from confidence in the law to faith in the gospel-that is to say,[fn-77-P7782_2220651:599-nf] His own law and His own gospel. When, again, he declares that \"the wrath (of God) is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,\"[fn-77-P7783_2220864:600-nf] (I ask) the wrath of what God? Of the Creator certainly. The truth, therefore, will be His, whose is also the wrath, which has to be revealed to avenge the truth. Likewise, when adding, \"We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth,\"[fn-77-P7784_2221131:601-nf] he both vindicated that wrath from which comes this judgment for the truth, and at the same time afforded another proof that the truth emanates from the same God whose wrath he attested, by witnessing to His judgment. Marcion's averment is quite a different matter, that[fn-77-P7785_2221421:602-nf] the Creator in anger avenges Himself on the truth of the rival god which had been detained in unrighteousness. But what serious gaps Marcion has made in this epistle especially, by withdrawing whole passages at his will, will be clear from the unmutilated text of our own copy.[fn-77-P7786_2221720:603-nf] It is enough for my purpose to accept in evidence of its truth what he has seen fit to leave unerased, strange instances as they are also of his negligence and blindness. If, then, God will judge the secrets of men-both of those who have sinned in the law, and of those who have sinned without law (inasmuch as they who know not the law yet do by nature the things contained in the law)[fn-77-P7787_2222134:604-nf] -surely the God who shall judge is He to whom belong both the law, and that nature which is the rule[fn-77-P7788_2222258:605-nf] to them who know not the law. But how will He conduct this judgment? \"According to my gospel,\" says (the apostle), \"by (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7789_2222457:606-nf] So that both the gospel and Christ must be His, to whom appertain the law and the nature which are to be vindicated by the gospel and Christ-even at that judgment of God which, as he previously said, was to be according to truth.[fn-77-P7790_2222707:607-nf] The wrath, therefore, which is to vindicate truth, can only be revealed from heaven by the God of wrath;[fn-77-P7791_2222831:608-nf] so that this sentence, which is quite in accordance with that previous one wherein the judgment is declared to be the Creator's,[fn-77-P7792_2222979:609-nf] cannot possibly be ascribed to another god who is not a judge, and is incapable of wrath. It is only consistent in Him amongst whose attributes are found the judgment and the wrath of which I am speaking, and to whom of necessity must also appertain the media whereby these attributes are to be carried into effect. even the gospel and Christ. Hence his invective against the transgressors of the law, who teach that men should not steal, and yet practise theft themselves.[fn-77-P7793_2223503:610-nf] (This invective he utters) in perfect homage[fn-77-P7794_2223568:611-nf] to the law of God, not as if he meant to ten sure the Creator Himself with having commanded[fn-77-P7795_2223676:612-nf] a fraud to be practised against the Egyptians to get their gold and silver at the very time when He was forbidding men to steal,[fn-77-P7796_2223825:613-nf] -adopting such methods as they are apt (shamelessly) to charge upon Him in other particulars also. Are we then to suppose[fn-77-P7797_2224006:614-nf] that the apostle abstained through fear from openly calumniating God, from whom notwithstanding He did not hesitate to withdraw men? Well, but he had gone so far in his censure of the Jews, as to point against them the denunciation of the prophet, \"Through you the name of God is blasphemed (among the Gentiles).\"[fn-77-P7798_2224347:615-nf] But how absurd, that he should himself blaspheme Him for blaspheming whom he upbraids them as evil-doers! He prefers even circumcision of heart to neglect of it in the flesh. Now it is quite within the purpose of the God of the law that circumcision should be that of the heart, not in the flesh; in the spirit, and not in the letter.[fn-77-P7799_2224703:616-nf] Since this is the circumcision recommended by Jeremiah: \"Circumcise (yourselves to the Lord, and take away) the foreskins of your heart; \"[fn-78-P7800_2224862:617-nf] and even of Moses: \"Circumcise, therefore, the hardness of your heart,\"[fn-78-P7801_2224953:618-nf] -the Spirit which circumcises the heart will proceed from Him who prescribed the letter also which clips[fn-78-P7802_2225086:619-nf] the flesh; and \"the Jew which is one inwardly\" will be a subject of the self-same God as he also is who is \"a Jew outwardly; \"[fn-78-P7803_2225228:620-nf] because the apostle would have preferred not to have mentioned a Jew at all, unless he were a servant of the God of the Jews. It was once[fn-78-P7804_2225386:621-nf] the law; now it is \"the righteousness of God which is by the faith of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-78-P7805_2225486:622-nf] What means this distinction? Has your god been subserving the interests of the Creator's dispensation, by affording time to Him and to His law? Is the \"Now\" in the hands of Him to whom belonged the \"Then\"? Surely, then, the law was His, whose is now the righteousness of God. It is a distinction of dispensations, not of gods. He enjoins those who are justified by faith in Christ and not by the law to have peace with God.[fn-78-P7806_2225935:623-nf] With what God? Him whose enemies we have never, in any dispensation,[fn-78-P7807_2227095:624-nf] been? Or Him against whom we have rebelled, both in relation to His written law and His law of nature?

I, however, have no acquaintance with sin except through the law.[fn-78-P7824_2230294:641-nf] But how high an encomium of the law (do we obtain) from this fact, that by it there comes to light the latent presence of sin![fn-78-P7825_2230560:642-nf] It was not the law, therefore, which led me astray, but \"sin, taking occasion by the commandment.\"[fn-78-P7826_2230776:643-nf] Why then do you, (O Marcion, ) impute to the God of the law what His apostle dares not impute even to the law itself?

Any one might answer the charge that God is incapable of admonishing men; for He conveys His admonitions throughout the whole of Scripture, and by means of those persons who, through God's gracious appointment, are the instructors of His hearers. Unless, indeed, some peculiar meaning be understood to attach to the word \"admonish,\" as if it signified both to penetrate into the mind of the person admonished, and to make him hear the words of his[fn-106-P10652_2840292:289-nf] instructor, which is contrary to the usual meaning of the word. To the objection, \"How is he incapable of persuading? \"-which also might be brought against all who believe in providence,-we have to make the following remarks. Since the expression \"to be persuaded\" belongs to those words which are termed, so to speak, \"reciprocal\"[fn-106-P10653_2840725:290-nf] (compare the phrase \"to shave a man,\" when he makes an effort to submit himself to the barber[fn-106-P10654_2840879:291-nf] , there is for this reason needed not merely the effort of him who persuades, but also the submission, so to speak, which is to be yielded to the persuader, or the acceptance of what is said by him. And therefore it must not be said that it is because God is incapable of persuading men that they are not persuaded, but because they will not accept the faithful words of God. And if one were to apply this expression to men who are the \"artificers of persuasion,\"[fn-106-P10655_2841439:292-nf] he would not be wrong; for it is possible for a man who has thoroughly learned the principles of rhetoric, and who employs them properly, to do his utmost to persuade, and yet appear to fail, because he cannot overcome the will of him who ought to yield to his persuasive arts. Moreover, that persuasion does not come from God, although persuasive words may be uttered by him, is distinctly taught by Paul, when he says: \"This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.\"[fn-106-P10656_2841943:293-nf] Such also is the view indicated by these words: \"If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuse and rebel, a sword shall devour you.\"[fn-106-P10657_2842135:294-nf] For that one may (really) desire what is addressed to him by one who admonishes, and may become deserving of those promises of God which he hears, it is necessary to secure the will of the hearer, and his inclination to what is addressed to him. And therefore it appears to me, that in the book of Deuteronomy the following words are uttered with peculiar emphasis: \"And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to keep His commandments? \"[fn-106-P10658_2842701:295-nf] ","title":"Book VI.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":10,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_63_book_iv_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"280","folder":"ANF-02","text":"The soul is not then sent down from heaven to what is worse.

What do the heresies say to this utterance, seeing Scripture proclaims the Almighty God to be good, and not the author of evil and wrong, if indeed ignorance arises from one not knowing? But God does nothing absurd. \"For this God,\" it is said, \"is our God, and there is none to save besides Him.\"[fn-71-P7130_2179469:255-nf] \"For there is no unrighteousness with God,\"[fn-71-P7131_2179535:256-nf] according to the apostle.

Indeed, even Moses is called a god to Pharaoh,[fn-17-P1790_487295:42-nf] and it is certain that he was a man; and judges were called gods, and it is evident that they were mortal. The idols also of the Gentiles are called gods, and we all know that they are not; but this has been inflicted as a punishment on the wicked, that because they would not acknowledge the true God, they should regard as God whatever form or image should occur to them. Because they refused to receive the knowledge of the One who, as I said, is God of all, therefore it is permitted to them to have as gods those who can do nothing for their worshippers.
