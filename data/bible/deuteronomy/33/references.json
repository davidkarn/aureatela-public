The rest, however, of the proceeding (observed in these mysteries), as we have declared at some length, (they follow) just as (if they were) emasculated persons.

But Naas is the serpent from whom, i.e., from the word Naas, (the Naassene) says, are all that under heaven are denominated temples (Naos). And (he states) that to him alone-that is, Naas-is dedicated every shrine and every initiatory rite, and every mystery; and, in general, that a religious ceremony could not be discovered under heaven, in which a temple (Naos) has no existence; and in the temple itself is Naas, from whom it has received its denomination of temple (Naos).

Continue your study of the witness borne by Moses; mark how diligently he seizes every opportunity of proclaiming the Lord and God. You take note of the passage, Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One[fn-12-P1279_777269:65-nf] . Note also the words of that Divine song of his; See, See, that I am the Lord, and there is no God beside Me[fn-12-P1280_777397:66-nf] . While God has been the Speaker throughout the poem, he ends with, Rejoice, ye heavens, together with Him and let all the sons of God praise Him. Rejoice, O ye nations, with His people, and let all the Angels of God do Him honour[fn-12-P1281_777648:67-nf] . God is to be glorified by the Angels of God, and He says, For I am the Lord, and there is no God beside Me. For He is God the Only-begotten, and the title `Only-begotten' excludes all partnership in that character, just as the title `Unoriginate' denies that there is, in that regard, any who shares the character of the Unoriginate Father. The Son is One from One. There is none unoriginate except God the Unoriginate, and so likewise there is none only-begotten except God the Only-begotten. They stand Each single and alone, being respectively the One Unoriginate and the One Only-begotten. And so They Two are One God, for between the One, and the One Who is His offspring there lies no gulf of difference of nature in the eternal Godhead. Therefore He must be worshipped by the sons of God and glorified by the angels of God. Honour and reverence is demanded for God from the sons and from the angels of God. Notice Who it is that shall receive this honour, and by whom it is to lie paid. It is God, and they are the sons and angels of God. And test you should imagine that honour is not demanded for God Who shares our nature[fn-12-P1282_778801:68-nf] , but that Moses is thinking here of reverence due to God the Father,-though, indeed, it is in the Son that the Father must be honoured-examine the words of the blessing bestowed by God upon Joseph, at the end of the same book. They are, And let the things that are well-pleasing to Him that appeared in the bush came upon the head and crown of Joseph[fn-12-P1283_779192:69-nf] . Thus God is to be worshipped by the sons of God; but God Who is Himself the Son of God. And God is to be reverenced by the angels of God; but God Who is Himself the Angel of God. For God appeared from the bush as the Angel of God, and the prayer for Joseph is that he may receive such blessings as He shall please, He is none the less God because He is the Angel of God; and none the less the Angel of God because He is God. A clear indication is given of the Divine Persons; the line is definitely drawn between the Unbegotten and the Begotten. A revelation of the mysteries of heaven is granted, and we are taught not to dream of God as dwelling in solitude, when angels and sons of God shall worship Him, Who is God's Angel and Its Son.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":33,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_13_to_pammachius_against_john_of_jerusalem","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8. These are the arrows with which you are pierced; these the weapons with which throughout the whole letter you are wounded; or I should rather say Epiphanius throws himself as a suppliant at your knees, and casts his hoary locks beneath your feet, and, for a time laying aside his episcopal dignity, prays for your salvation in words such as these: \"Grant to me and to yourself the favour of your salvation; save yourself, as it is written, from this crooked generation,[fn-70-P7028_2282998:20-nf] and forsake the heresy of Origen, and all heresies, dearly beloved.\" And lower down, \"In the defence of heresy you kindle hatred against me, and destroy that love which I had towards you; insomuch that you would make us even repent of holding communion with you who so resolutely defend the errors and doctrines of Origen.\" Tell me, prince of arguers, to which, out of the eight sections, you have replied. For the present, I say nothing of the rest. Take the first blasphemy-that the Son cannot see the Father, nor the Holy Spirit the Son. By what weapons of yours has it been pierced? the answer we get is, \"We believe that the Holy and Adorable Trinity are of the same substance; that they are co-eternal, and of the same glory and Godhead, and we anathematize those who say that there is any greatness, smallness, inequality, or aught that is visible in the Godhead of the Trinity. But as we say the Father is incorporeal, invisible, and eternal; so we say the Son and Holy Spirit are incorporeal, invisible, and eternal.\" If you did not say this, you would not hold to the Church. I do not ask whether there was not a time when you refused to say this. I will not discuss the question, whether you were fond of those who preached such doctrines; on whose side you were when, for expressing those sentiments, they underwent banishment; or who the man was that, when the presbyter Theo preached in the Church that the Holy Spirit is God, closed his ears, and excitedly rushed out of doors that he might not so much as hear the impiety.

Either deny that the accused said what is imputed to him, or, if he did give utterance to such sentiments, condemn him for so speaking. You have still to learn how intense is the zeal of the orthodox. Listen to the Apostle:[fn-70-P7030_2285396:22-nf] \"If I or an angel from heaven bring you another gospel than that we have declared, let him be anathema.\" You would extenuate the fault and hide the name of the guilty party: as though everything were right and no one were accused of blasphemy, you frame, in artificial language, an uncalled-for profession of your faith. Speak out at once, and let your letter thus begin: \"Let him be accursed who has dared to write such things.\" Pure faith is impatient of delay. As soon as the scorpion appears, he must be crushed under foot. David, who was proved to be a man after God's own heart, says:[fn-70-P7031_2286004:23-nf] \"Do not I hate those that hate thee, O Lord, and did not I pine away over thine enemies? I hated them with a perfect hatred.\" Had I heard my father, or mother, or brother say such things against my Master Christ, I would have broken their blasphemous jaws like those of a mad dog, and my hand should have been amongst the first lifted up against them.

What wonder that ye know not Christ, seeing ye knew not Moses, and God Who was manifested by such wonders? But they not only knew Him not: they also insulted in another way, by their idol making. \"Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven\" (v. 42.) Hence these same \"customs\" date their origin, hence the sacrifices: they were themselves the first that made sacrifices to their idols! For that is why it is marked,[fn-7-P771_650369:7-nf] \"They made a calf in Horeb, and offered sacrifices to the idol:\" seeing that, before this the name of sacrifice is nowhere mentioned, but only lively ordinances, and \"lively oracles.

And yet the Gentiles also had been driven out: for that is why he mentions this: \"Whom God drave out,\" he says, \"before the face of our fathers. Whom He drave out,\" he says: and even then, no Temple! And so many wonders, and no mention of a Temple! So that, although first there is a Tabernacle, yet nowhere a Temple. \"Until the days of David,\" he says: even David, and no Temple! \"And he sought to find favor before God\" (v. 46): and built not:-so far was the Temple from being a great matter! \"But Solomon built Him an house.\" (v. 47.) They thought Solomon was great: but that he was not better than his father, nay not even equal to him, is manifest. \"Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool.\" (v. 48, 49.) Nay, not even these are worthy of God, forasmuch as they are made, seeing they are creatures, the works of His hand.

Where[fn-7-P769_648870:5-nf] they ought to give thanks (to God), they bring Moses forward: where it was, to do as the Law bade them, they no longer make account of Moses. \"We know not what is become of him.\" And yet he told them that he was going up to receive the Law: and they had not patience to wait forty days. \"Make us gods\"-they[fn-7-P770_649300:6-nf] did not say, \"a God.\"-And yet one may well wonder at this, that they do not even know.-\"And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifices unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands\" (v. 41): for which they ought to have hid their faces. What wonder that ye know not Christ, seeing ye knew not Moses, and God Who was manifested by such wonders? But they not only knew Him not: they also insulted in another way, by their idol making. \"Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven\" (v. 42.) Hence these same \"customs\" date their origin, hence the sacrifices: they were themselves the first that made sacrifices to their idols! For that is why it is marked,[fn-7-P771_650369:7-nf] \"They made a calf in Horeb, and offered sacrifices to the idol:\" seeing that, before this the name of sacrifice is nowhere mentioned, but only lively ordinances, and \"lively oracles. And rejoiced\"-that is the reason for the feasts. Exod. xxxii. 5, 6.) \"As it is written in the Book of the Prophets\"-and observe, he does not cite the text without a purpose, but shows by it that there is no need of sacrifices; saying: \"Did ye offer slain beasts and sacrifice to Me?\"-He lays an emphasis on this word (to Me?). \"Ye cannot say that it was from sacrificing to Me, that ye proceeded to sacrifice to them:-\"by the space of forty years:\" and this too, \"in the wilderness,\" where He had most signally shown Himself their Protector. \"Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan: images which ye made to worship them.[fn-7-P772_654093:8-nf] The cause of sacrifices! \"And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.\" (v. 43.) Even the captivity, an impeachment of their wickedness! \"But a Tabernacle,\" say you, \"there was (the Tabernacle) `of Witness.'\" (v. 44.) (Yes,) this is why it was: that they should have God for Witness: this was all. \"According to the fashion,\" it says, \"that was shown thee on the mount:\" so[fn-7-P773_655573:9-nf] that on the mount was the Original. And this Tabernacle, moreover, \"in the wilderness,\" was carried about, and not locally fixed. And he calls it, \"Tabernacle of witness:\" i.e. (for witness) of the miracles, of the statutes.[fn-7-P774_656000:10-nf] This is the reason why both it and those (the fathers) had no Temple. \"As He had appointed, that spake unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.\" Again, it was none other than He (Christ) that gave the fashion itself. \"Until the days of David\" (v. 45): and there was no temple! And yet the Gentiles also had been driven out: for that is why he mentions this: \"Whom God drave out,\" he says, \"before the face of our fathers. Whom He drave out,\" he says: and even then, no Temple! And so many wonders, and no mention of a Temple! So that, although first there is a Tabernacle, yet nowhere a Temple. \"Until the days of David,\" he says: even David, and no Temple! \"And he sought to find favor before God\" (v. 46): and built not:-so far was the Temple from being a great matter! \"But Solomon built Him an house.\" (v. 47.) They thought Solomon was great: but that he was not better than his father, nay not even equal to him, is manifest. \"Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool.\" (v. 48, 49.) Nay, not even these are worthy of God, forasmuch as they are made, seeing they are creatures, the works of His hand. See how he leads them on by little and little (showing) that not even these are to be mentioned.

First, I shall offer a full explanation[fn-50-P5077_1595510:257-nf] of the types. And no doubt it was proper that this mystery should be prophetically set forth by types, and indeed chiefly by that method: for in proportion to its incredibility would it be a stumbling-block, if it were set forth in bare prophecy; and in proportion too, to its grandeur, was the need of obscuring it in shadow,[fn-50-P5078_1595853:258-nf] that the difficulty of understanding it might lead to prayer for the grace of God. First, then, Isaac, when he was given up by his father as an offering, himself carried the wood for his own death. By this act he even then was setting forth the death of Christ, who was destined by His Father as a sacrifice, and carried the cross whereon He suffered. Joseph likewise was a type of Christ, not indeed on this ground (that I may not delay my course[fn-50-P5079_1596327:259-nf] ), that he suffered persecution for the cause of God from his brethren, as Christ did from His brethren after the flesh, the Jews; but when he is blessed by his father in these words: \"His glory is that of a bullock; his horns are the horns of a unicorn; with them shall he push the nations to the very ends of the earth,\"[fn-50-P5080_1596966:260-nf] -he was not, of course, designated as a mere unicorn with its one horn, or a minotaur with two; but Christ was indicated in him-a bullock in respect of both His characteristics: to some as severe as a Judge, to others gentle as a Saviour, whose horns were the extremities of His cross. For of the antenna, which is a part of a cross, the ends are called horns; while the midway stake of the whole frame is the unicorn. By this virtue, then, of His cross, and in this manner \"horned,\" He is both now pushing all nations through faith, bearing them away from earth to heaven; and will then push them through judgment, casting them down from heaven to earth. He will also, according to another passage in the same scripture, be a bullock, when He is spiritually interpreted to be Jacob against Simeon and Levi, which means against the scribes and the Pharisees; for it was from them that these last derived their origin.[fn-50-P5081_1597909:261-nf] Like Simeon and Levi, they consummated their wickedness by their heresy, with which they persecuted Christ. \"Into their counsel let not my soul enter; to their assembly let not my heart be united: for in their anger they slew men,\" that is, the prophets; \"and in their self-will they hacked the sinews of a bullock,\"[fn-50-P5082_1598241:262-nf] that is, of Christ. For against Him did they wreak their fury after they had slain His prophets, even by affixing Him with nails to the cross. Otherwise, it is an idle thing[fn-50-P5083_1598484:263-nf] when, after slaying men, he inveighs against them for the torture of a bullock! Again, in the case of Moses, wherefore did he at that moment particularly, when Joshua was fighting Amalek, pray in a sitting posture with outstretched hands, when in such a conflict it would surely have been more seemly to have bent the knee, and smitten the breast, and to have fallen on the face to the ground, and in such prostration to have offered prayer? Wherefore, but because in a battle fought in the name of that Lord who was one day to fight against the devil, the shape was necessary of that very cross through which Jesus was to win the victory? Why, once more, did the same Moses, after prohibiting the likeness of everything, set up the golden serpent on the pole; and as it hung there, propose it as an object to be looked at for a cure?[fn-50-P5084_1599333:264-nf] Did he not here also intend to show the power of our Lord's cross, whereby that old serpent the devil was vanquished,-whereby also to every man who was bitten by spiritual serpents, but who yet turned with an eye of faith to it, was proclaimed a cure from the bite of sin, and health for evermore?","title":"Book III.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":33,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_11_homily_iii_on_the_firmament_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"8. \"And God called the firmament heaven.\"[fn-21-P2179_650803:45-nf] The nature of right belongs to another, and the firmament only shares it on account of its resemblance to heaven.

For the one beam is placed upright, from which the highest extremity is raised up into a horn, when the other beam is fitted on to it, and the ends appear on both sides as horns joined on to the one horn.

And it seems that the type and sign, which was erected to counteract the serpents which bit Israel, was intended for the salvation of those who believe that death was declared to come thereafter on the serpent through Him that would be crucified, but salvation to those who had been bitten by him and had betaken themselves to Him that sent His Son into the world to be crucified.[fn-48-P4860_1063201:359-nf] For the Spirit of prophecy by Moses did not teach us to believe in the serpent, since it shows us that he was cursed by God from the beginning; and in Isaiah tells us that he shall be put to death as an enemy by the mighty sword, which is Christ.","title":"Dialogue of Justin","author":"Justin Martyr"},{"chapter":33,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§8.

Born in the seventh generation[fn-53-P5385_1642271:303-nf] and having received a royal education, the following are the circumstances of his history. The Hebrews having increased in Egypt to a great multitude, and the king of the country being afraid of insurrection in consequence of their numbers, he ordered all the female children born to the Hebrews to be reared (woman being unfit for war), but the male to be destroyed, being suspicious of stalwart youth. But the child being goodly, his parents nursed him secretly three months, natural affection being too strong for the monarch's cruelty. But at last, dreading lest they should be destroyed along with the child, they made a basket of the papyrus that grew there, put the child in it, and laid it on the banks of the marshy river. The child's sister stood at a distance, and watched what would happen. In this emergency, the king's daughter, who for a long time had not been pregnant, and who longed for a child, came that day to the river to bathe and wash herself; and hearing the child cry, she ordered it to be brought to her; and touched with pity, sought a nurse. At that moment the child's sister ran up, and said that, if she wished, she could procure for her as nurse one of the Hebrew women who had recently had a child. And on her consenting and desiring her to do so, she brought the child's mother to be nurse for a stipulated fee, as if she had been some other person. Thereupon the queen gave the babe the name of Moses, with etymological propriety, from his being drawn out of \"the water,\"[fn-53-P5386_1643906:304-nf] -for the Egyptians call water \"mou,\"-in which he had been exposed to die. For they call Moses one who \"who breathed [on being taken] from the water.\" It is clear that previously the parents gave a name to the child on his circumcision; and he was called Joachim. And he had a third name in heaven, after his ascension,[fn-53-P5387_1644250:305-nf] as the mystics say-Melchi. Having reached the proper age, he was taught arithmetic, geometry, poetry, harmony, and besides, medicine and music, by those that excelled in these arts among the Egyptians; and besides, the philosophy which is conveyed by symbols, which they point out in the hieroglyphical inscriptions. The rest of the usual course of instruction, Greeks taught him in Egypt as a royal child, as Philo says in his life of Moses. He learned, besides, the literature of the Egyptians, and the knowledge of the heavenly bodies from the Chaldeans and the Egyptians; whence in the Acts[fn-53-P5388_1645020:306-nf] he is said \"to have been instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.\" And Eupolemus, in his book On the Kings in Judea, says that \"Moses was the first wise man, and the first that imparted grammar to the Jews, that the Phoenicians received it from the Jews, and the Greeks from the Phoenicians.\" And betaking himself to their philosophy,[fn-53-P5389_1645382:307-nf] he increased his wisdom, being ardently attached to the training received from his kindred and ancestors, till he struck and slew the Egyptian who wrongfully attacked the Hebrew. And the mystics say that he slew the Egyptian by a word only; as, certainly, Peter in the Acts is related to have slain by speech those who appropriated part of the price of the field, and lied.[fn-53-P5390_1645830:308-nf] And so Artapanus, in his work On the Jews, relates \"that Moses, being shut up in custody by Chenephres, king of the Egyptians, on account of the people demanding to be let go from Egypt, the prison being opened by night, by the interposition of God, went forth, and reaching the palace, stood before the king as he slept, and aroused him; and that the latter, struck with what had taken place, bade Moses tell him the name of the God who had sent him; and that he, bending forward, told him in his ear; and that the king on hearing it fell speechless, but being supported by Moses, revived again.\" And respecting the education of Moses, we shall find a harmonious account in Ezekiel,[fn-53-P5391_1646532:309-nf] the composer of Jewish tragedies in the drama entitled The Exodus.

And that he means this conspiracy, is evident to us. For the blessed David sings, \"Rulers have taken counsel together against the Lord,\"[fn-26-P2667_859706:11-nf] and so forth. And of this conspiracy the Spirit prophesied, saying, \"Let not my soul contend,\" desiring to draw them off, if possible, so that that future crime might not happen through them. \"They slew men, and houghed the bull; \"by the \"strong bull\" he means Christ. And \"they houghed,\" since, when He was suspended on the tree, they pierced through His sinews. Again, \"in their anger they houghed a bull.\" And mark the nicety of the expression: for \"they slew men, and houghed a bull.\" For they killed the saints, and they remain dead, awaiting the time of the resurrection. But as a young bull, so to speak, when houghed, sinks down to the ground, such was Christ in submitting voluntarily to the death of the flesh; but He was not overcome of death. But though as man He became one of the dead, He remained alive in the nature of divinity. For Christ is the bull,-an animal, above all, strong and neat and devoted to sacred use. And the Son is Lord of all power, who did no sin, but rather offered Himself for us, a savour of a sweet smell to His God and Father. Therefore let those hear who houghed this august bull: \"Cursed be their anger, for it was stubborn; and their wrath, for it was hardened.\"[fn-26-P2668_860929:12-nf] But this people of the Jews dared to boast of houghing the bull: \"Our hands shed this.\"[fn-26-P2669_861036:13-nf] For this is nothing different, I think, from the word of folly: \"His blood\" (be upon us), and so forth.[fn-26-P2670_861222:14-nf] Moses recalls[fn-26-P2671_861258:15-nf] the curse against Levi, or, rather converts it into a blessing, on account of the subsequent zeal of the tribe, and of Phinehas in particular, in behalf of God.
