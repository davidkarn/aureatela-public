{"verses":["This is the blessing, wherewith the man of God, Moses, blessed\nthe children of Israel, before his death.","And he said:  The Lord came from Sinai, and from Seir he rose up\nto us:  he hath appeared from mount Pharan, and with him thousands of\nsaints.  In his right hand a fiery law.","He hath loved the people, all the saints are in his hand:  and\nthey that approach to his feet, shall receive of his doctrine.","Moses commanded us a law, the inheritance of the multitude of\nJacob.","He shall be king with the most right, the princes of the people,\nbeing assembled with the tribes of Israel.","Let Ruben live, and not die, and be he small in number.","This is the blessing of Juda.  Hear, O Lord, the voice of Juda,\nand bring him in unto his people:  his hands shall fight for him, and he\nshall be his helper against his enemies.","To Levi also he said:  Thy perfection, and thy doctrine be to thy\nholy man, whom thou hast proved in the temptation, and judged at the\nwaters of contradiction:","Who hath said to his father, and to his mother:  I do not know\nyou; and to his brethren:  I know you not:  and their own children they\nhave not known.  These have kept thy word, and observed thy covenant,","Thy judgments, O Jacob, and thy law, O Israel:  they shall put\nincense in thy wrath and holocaust upon thy altar.","Bless, O Lord, his strength, and receive the works of his hands.\nStrike the backs of his enemies, and let not them that hate him rise.","And to Benjamin he said:  The best beloved of the Lord shall\ndwell confidently in him:  as in a bride chamber shall he abide all the\nday long, and between his shoulders shall be rest.","To Joseph also he said:  Of the blessing of the Lord be his land,\nof the fruits of heaven, and of the dew, and of the deep that lieth\nbeneath.","Of the fruits brought forth by the sun and by the moon.","Of the tops of the ancient mountains, of the fruits of the\neverlasting hills:","And of the fruits of the earth, and of the fulness thereof.  The\nblessing of him that appeared in the bush, come upon the head of\nJoseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren.","His beauty as of the firstling of a bullock, his horns as the\nhorns of a rhinoceros:  with them shall he push the nations even to the\nends of the earth.  These are the multitudes of Ephraim and these the\nthousands of Manasses.","And to Zabulon he said:  Rejoice, O Zabulon, in thy going out;\nand Issachar in thy tabernacles.","They shall call the people to the mountain:  there shall they\nsacrifice the victims of justice.  Who shall suck as milk the abundance\nof the sea, and the hidden treasures of the sands.","And to Gad he said:  Blessed be Gad in his breadth:  he hath\nrested as a lion, and hath seized upon the arm and the top of the head.","And he saw his pre-eminence, that in his portion the teacher was\nlaid up:  who was with the princes of the people, and did the justices\nof the Lord, and his judgment with Israel.","To Dan also he said:  Dan is a young lion, he shall flow\nplentifully from Basan.","And To Nephtali he said:  Nephtali shall enjoy abundance, and\nshall be full of the blessings of the Lord:  he shall possess the sea\nand the south.","To Aser also he said:  Let Aser be blessed with children, let him\nbe acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.","His shoe shall be iron and brass.  As the days of thy youth, so\nalso shall thy old age be.","There is no other god like the God of the rightest:  he that is\nmounted upon the heaven is thy helper.  By his magnificence the clouds\nrun hither and thither.","His dwelling is above, and underneath are the everlasting arms:\nhe shall cast out the enemy from before thee, and shall say:  Be thou\nbrought to nought.","Israel shall dwell in safety, and alone.
