Something, also, appears to be troubling you. You are afraid that, if continence, sobriety, and fasting strike root among the people of Gaul, your taverns will not pay, and you will be unable to keep up through the night your diabolical vigils and drunken revels. Moreover, I have learnt from those same letters that, in defiance of the authority of Paul, nay, rather of Peter, John, and James, who gave the right hand of fellowship to Paul and Barnabas, and commanded them to remember the poor, you forbid any pecuniary relief to be sent to Jerusalem for the benefit of the saints. Now, if I reply to this, you will immediately give tongue and cry out that I am pleading my own cause. You, forsooth, were so generous to the whole community that if you had not come to Jerusalem, and lavished your own money or that of your patrons, we should all be on the verge of starvation. I say what the blessed Apostle Paul says in nearly all his Epistles; and he makes it a rule for the Churches of the Gentiles that, on the first day of the week, that is, on the Lord's day, contributions should be made by every one which should be sent up to Jerusalem for the relief of the saints, and that either by his own disciples, or by those whom they should themselves approve; and if it were thought fit, he would himself either send, or take what was collected. Also in the Acts of the Apostles, when speaking to the governor Felix, he says,[fn-69-P6978_2249772:33-nf] \"After many years I went up to Jerusalem to bring alms to my nation and offerings, and to perform my vows, amidst which they found me purified in the temple.\" Might he not have distributed in some other part of the world, and in the infant Churches which he was training in his own faith, the gifts he had received from others? But he longed to give to the poor of the holy places who, abandoning their own little possessions for the sake of Christ, turned with their whole heart to the service of the Lord. It would take too long now if I purposed to repeat all the passages from the whole range of his Epistles in which he advocates and urges with all his heart that money be sent to Jerusalem and to the holy places for the faithful; not to gratify avarice, but to give relief; not to accumulate wealth, but to support the weakness of the poor body, and to stave off cold and hunger. And this custom continues in Judea to the present day, not only among us, but also among the Hebrews, so that they who[fn-69-P6979_2250813:34-nf] meditate in the law of the Lord, day and night, and have[fn-69-P6980_2250885:35-nf] no father upon earth except the Lord alone, may be cherished by the aid of the synagogues and of the whole world; that there may be[fn-69-P6981_2251041:36-nf] equality-not that some may be refreshed while others are in distress, but that the abundance of some may support the need of others.","title":"Against Vigilantius","author":false},{"chapter":18,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"95","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Having premised these remarks, let us carefully attend to the passages which he whom we are answering has produced, as if we ourselves had quoted them. \"In Deuteronomy, `Thou shalt be perfect before the Lord thy God.'[fn-25-P2526_1015706:67-nf] Again, in the same book, `There shall be not an imperfect man[fn-25-P2527_1015790:68-nf] among the sons of Israel.'[fn-25-P2528_1016005:69-nf] In like manner the Saviour says in the Gospel, Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.'[fn-25-P2529_1016141:70-nf] So the apostle, in his second Epistle to the Corinthians, says: `Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect.'[fn-25-P2530_1016266:71-nf] Again, to the Colossians he writes: 'Warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ.'[fn-25-P2531_1016432:72-nf] And so to the Philippians: `Do all things without murmurings and disputings, that ye may be blameless, and harmless, as the immaculate sons of God.'[fn-25-P2532_1016598:73-nf] In like manner to the Ephesians he writes: `Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; according as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.'[fn-25-P2533_1016924:74-nf] Then again to the Colossians he says in another passage: `And you, that were sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath He reconciled in the body of His flesh through death; present yourselves holy and unblameable and unreprovable in His sight.'[fn-25-P2534_1017221:75-nf] In the same strain, he says to the Ephesians: `That He might present to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish.'[fn-25-P2535_1017438:76-nf] So in his first Epistle to the Corinthians he says `Be ye sober, and righteous, and sin not.'[fn-25-P2536_1017553:77-nf] So again in the Epistle of St. Peter it is written `Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is offered to you: . . . as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written,[fn-25-P2537_1017946:78-nf] Be ye holy; for I am holy.'[fn-25-P2538_1017992:79-nf] Whence blessed David likewise says: `O Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy tabernacle, or who shall rest on Thy holy mountain? He that walketh without blame, and worketh righteousness.'[fn-25-P2539_1018195:80-nf] And in another passage: `I shall be blameless with Him.'[fn-25-P2540_1018271:81-nf] And yet again: `Blessed are the blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.'[fn-25-P2541_1018379:82-nf] To the same effect it is written in Solomon: `The Lord loveth holy hearts, and all they that are blameless are acceptable unto Him.'\"[fn-25-P2542_1018531:83-nf] Now some of these passages exhort men who are running their course that they run perfectly; others refer to the end thereof, that men may reach forward to it as they run. He, however, is not unreasonably said to walk blamelessly, not who has already reached the end of his journey, but who is pressing on towards the end in a blameless manner, free from damnable sins, and at the same time not neglecting to cleanse by almsgiving such sins as are venial. For the way in which we walk, that is, the road by which we reach perfection, is cleansed by clean prayer. That, however, is a clean prayer in which we say in truth, \"Forgive us, as we ourselves forgive.\"[fn-25-P2543_1019210:84-nf] So that, as there is nothing censured when blame is not imputed, we may hold on our course to perfection without censure, in a word, blamelessly; and in this perfect state, when we arrive at it at last, we shall find that there is absolutely nothing which requires cleansing by forgiveness.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_15_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"14.

This, to be sure,[fn-61-P6139_1837638:838-nf] was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him\"[fn-61-P6140_1837814:839-nf] -Him, that is, not Moses or Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of Moses and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must have forbidden all[fn-61-P6141_1838040:840-nf] others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he prohibited those whom he did display? Now, even if their presence was necessary, they surely should not be represented as conversing together, which is a sign of familiarity; nor as associated in glory with him, for this indicates respect and graciousness; but they should be shown in some slough[fn-61-P6142_1838493:841-nf] as a sure token of their ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was sent to disperse, far removed from the glory of Him who was about to sever their words and writings from His gospel. This, then, is the way[fn-61-P6143_1838751:842-nf] how he demonstrates them to be aliens,[fn-61-P6144_1838802:843-nf] even by keeping them in his own company! This is how he shows they ought to be relinquished: he associates them with himself instead! This is how he destroys them: he irradiates them with his glory! How would their own Christ act? I suppose He would have imitated the frowardness (of heresy),[fn-61-P6145_1839128:844-nf] and revealed them just as Marcion's Christ was bound to do, or at least as having with Him any others rather than His own prophets! But what could so well befit the Creator's Christ, as to manifest Him in the company of His own foreannouncers?[fn-61-P6146_1839403:845-nf] -to let Him be seen with those to whom He had appeared in revelations?-to let Him be speaking with those who had spoken of Him?-to share His glory with those by whom He used to be called the Lord of glory; even with those chief servants of His, one of whom was once the moulder[fn-61-P6147_1839703:846-nf] of His people, the other afterwards the reformer[fn-61-P6148_1839810:847-nf] thereof; one the initiator of the Old Testament, the other the consummator[fn-61-P6149_1839930:848-nf] of the New? Well therefore does Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble connection with Him, suggest an expedient: \"It is good for us to be here\" (good: that evidently means to be where Moses and Elias are); \"and let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. But he knew not what he said.\"[fn-61-P6150_1840483:849-nf] How knew not? Was his ignorance the result of simple error? Or was it on the principle which we maintain[fn-61-P6151_1840608:850-nf] in the cause of the new prophecy,[fn-61-P6152_1840959:851-nf] that to grace ecstasy or rapture[fn-61-P6153_1841018:852-nf] is incident. For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, especially when he beholds the glory of God, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily loses his sensation,[fn-61-P6154_1841199:853-nf] because he is overshadowed with the power of God,-a point concerning which there is a question between us and the carnally-minded.[fn-61-P6155_1841352:854-nf] Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture[fn-61-P6156_1842177:855-nf] of Peter. For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the law forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the Spirit? And therefore, because it was in the Spirit that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not know what he had said. But if, on the other hand,[fn-61-P6157_1842594:856-nf] he was thus ignorant, because he erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, \"Whom they thought Him to be,\" meant the Creator's Christ, when he answered, \"Thou art the Christ; \"because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival god, he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in error here because of his previous erroneous opinion,[fn-61-P6158_1843038:857-nf] then you may be sure that up to that very day no new divinity had been revealed by Christ, and that Peter had so far made no mistake, because hitherto Christ had revealed nothing of the kind; and that Christ accordingly was not to be regarded as belonging to any other than the Creator, whose entire dispensation[fn-61-P6159_1843388:858-nf] he, in fact, here described. He selects from His disciples three witnesses of the impending vision and voice. And this is just the way of the Creator. \"In the mouth of three witnesses,\" says He, \"shall every word be established.\"[fn-61-P6160_1843707:859-nf] He withdraws to a mountain. In the nature of the place I see much meaning. For the Creator had originally formed His ancient people on a mountain both with visible glory and His voice. It was only tight that the New Testament should be attested[fn-61-P6161_1843999:860-nf] on such an elevated spot[fn-61-P6162_1844043:861-nf] as that whereon the Old Testament had been composed;[fn-61-P6163_1844119:862-nf] under a like covering of cloud also, which nobody will doubt, was condensed out of the Creator's air. Unless, indeed, he[fn-61-P6164_1844267:863-nf] had brought down his own clouds thither, because he had himself forced his way through the Creator's heaven;[fn-61-P6165_1844398:864-nf] or else it was only a precarious cloud,[fn-61-P6166_1844500:865-nf] as it were, of the Creator which he used. On the present (as also on the former)[fn-61-P6167_1844705:866-nf] occasion, therefore, the cloud was not silent; but there was the accustomed voice from heaven, and the Father's testimony to the Son; precisely as in the first Psalm He had said, \"Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.\"[fn-61-P6168_1844948:867-nf] By the mouth of Isaiah also He had asked concerning Him, \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6169_1845101:868-nf] When therefore He here presents Him with the words, \"This is my (beloved) Son,\" this clause is of course understood, \"whom I have promised.\" For if He once promised, and then afterwards says, \"This is He,\" it is suitable conduct for one who accomplishes His purpose[fn-61-P6170_1845415:869-nf] that He should utter His voice in proof of the promise which He had formerly made; but unsuitable in one who is amenable to the retort, Can you, indeed, have a right to say, \"This is my son,\" concerning whom you have given us no previous information,[fn-61-P6171_1845694:870-nf] any more than you have favoured us with a revelation about your own prior existence? \"Hear ye Him,\" therefore, whom from the beginning (the Creator) had declared entitled to be heard in the name of a prophet, since it was as a prophet that He had to be regarded by the people. \"A prophet,\" says Moses, \"shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your sons\" (that is, of course, after a carnal descent[fn-61-P6172_1846178:871-nf] ); \"unto Him shall ye hearken, as unto me.\"[fn-61-P6173_1846264:872-nf] \"Every one who will not hearken unto Him, his soul[fn-61-P6174_1846339:873-nf] shall be cut off from amongst his people.\"[fn-61-P6175_1846402:874-nf] , So also Isaiah: \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6176_1846522:875-nf] This voice the Father was going Himself to recommend. For, says he,[fn-61-P6177_1846609:876-nf] He establishes the words of His Son, when He says, \"This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.\" Therefore, even if there be made a transfer of the obedient \"heating\" from Moses and Elias to[fn-61-P6178_1847561:877-nf] Christ, it is still not from[fn-61-P6179_1847684:878-nf] another God, or to another Christ; but from\" the Creator to His Christ, in consequence of the departure of the old covenant and the supervening of the new. \"Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but He Himself,\" says Isaiah, \"shall save them; \"[fn-61-P6180_1847960:879-nf] for it is He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law and the prophets. The Father gave to the Son new disciples,[fn-61-P6181_1848177:880-nf] after that Moses and Elias had been exhibited along with Him in the honour of His glory, and had then been dismissed as having fully discharged their duty and office, for the express purpose of affirming for Marcion's information the fact that Moses and Elias had a share in even the glory of Christ. But we have the entire structure[fn-61-P6182_1848541:881-nf] of this same vision in Habakkuk also, where the Spirit in the person of some[fn-61-P6183_1848634:882-nf] of the apostles says, \"O Lord, I have heard Thy speech, and was afraid.\" What speech was this, other than the words of the voice from heaven, This is my beloved Son, hear ye, Him? \"I considered thy works, and was astonished.\" When could this have better happened than when Peter, on seeing His glory, knew not what he was saying? \"In the midst of the two Thou shalt be known\"-even Moses and Elias.[fn-61-P6184_1849050:883-nf] These likewise did Zechariah see under the figure of the two olive trees and olive branches.[fn-61-P6185_1849261:884-nf] For these are they of whom he says, \"They are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.\" And again Habakkuk says, \"His glory covered the heavens\" (that is, with that cloud), \"and His splendour shall be like the light-even the light, wherewith His very raiment glistened.\" And if we would make mention of[fn-61-P6186_1849613:885-nf] the promise to Moses, we shall find it accomplished here. For when Moses desired to see the Lord, saying, \"If therefore I have found grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself to me, that I may see Thee distinctly,\"[fn-61-P6187_1849874:886-nf] the sight which he desired to have was of that condition which he was to assume as man, and which as a prophet he knew was to occur. Respecting the face of God, however, he had already heard, \"No man shall see me, and live.\" \"This thing,\" said He, \"which thou hast spoken, will I do unto thee.\" Then Moses said, \"Show me Thy glory.\" And the Lord, with like reference to the future, replied, \"I will pass before thee in my glory,\" etc. Then at the last He says, \"And then thou shall see my back.\"[fn-61-P6188_1850423:887-nf] Not loins, or calves of the legs, did he want to behold, but the glory which was to be revealed in the latter days.[fn-61-P6189_1850569:888-nf] He had promised that He would make Himself thus face to face visible to him, when He said to Aaron, \"If there shall be a prophet among you, I will make myself known to him by vision, and by vision will I speak with him; but not so is my manner to Moses; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently\" (that is to say, in the form of man which He was to assume), \"and not in dark speeches.\"[fn-61-P6190_1851193:889-nf] Now, although Marcion has denied[fn-61-P6191_1851248:890-nf] that he is here represented as speaking with the Lord, but only as standing, yet, inasmuch as he stood \"mouth to mouth,\" he must also have stood \"face to face\" with him, to use his words,[fn-61-P6192_1851451:891-nf] not far from him, in His very glory-not to say,[fn-61-P6193_1851553:892-nf] in His presence. And with this glory he went away enlightened from Christ, just as he used to do from the Creator; as then to dazzle the eyes of the children of Israel, so now to smite those of the blinded Marcion, who has failed to see how this argument also makes against him.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":18,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"ANF-03","text":"You ought to be very much ashamed of yourself on this account too, for permitting him to appear on the retired mountain in the company of Moses and Elias,[fn-61-P6138_1837568:837-nf] whom he had come to destroy. This, to be sure,[fn-61-P6139_1837638:838-nf] was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him\"[fn-61-P6140_1837814:839-nf] -Him, that is, not Moses or Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of Moses and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must have forbidden all[fn-61-P6141_1838040:840-nf] others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he prohibited those whom he did display? Now, even if their presence was necessary, they surely should not be represented as conversing together, which is a sign of familiarity; nor as associated in glory with him, for this indicates respect and graciousness; but they should be shown in some slough[fn-61-P6142_1838493:841-nf] as a sure token of their ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was sent to disperse, far removed from the glory of Him who was about to sever their words and writings from His gospel. This, then, is the way[fn-61-P6143_1838751:842-nf] how he demonstrates them to be aliens,[fn-61-P6144_1838802:843-nf] even by keeping them in his own company! This is how he shows they ought to be relinquished: he associates them with himself instead! This is how he destroys them: he irradiates them with his glory! How would their own Christ act? I suppose He would have imitated the frowardness (of heresy),[fn-61-P6145_1839128:844-nf] and revealed them just as Marcion's Christ was bound to do, or at least as having with Him any others rather than His own prophets! But what could so well befit the Creator's Christ, as to manifest Him in the company of His own foreannouncers?[fn-61-P6146_1839403:845-nf] -to let Him be seen with those to whom He had appeared in revelations?-to let Him be speaking with those who had spoken of Him?-to share His glory with those by whom He used to be called the Lord of glory; even with those chief servants of His, one of whom was once the moulder[fn-61-P6147_1839703:846-nf] of His people, the other afterwards the reformer[fn-61-P6148_1839810:847-nf] thereof; one the initiator of the Old Testament, the other the consummator[fn-61-P6149_1839930:848-nf] of the New? Well therefore does Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble connection with Him, suggest an expedient: \"It is good for us to be here\" (good: that evidently means to be where Moses and Elias are); \"and let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. But he knew not what he said.\"[fn-61-P6150_1840483:849-nf] How knew not? Was his ignorance the result of simple error? Or was it on the principle which we maintain[fn-61-P6151_1840608:850-nf] in the cause of the new prophecy,[fn-61-P6152_1840959:851-nf] that to grace ecstasy or rapture[fn-61-P6153_1841018:852-nf] is incident. For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, especially when he beholds the glory of God, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily loses his sensation,[fn-61-P6154_1841199:853-nf] because he is overshadowed with the power of God,-a point concerning which there is a question between us and the carnally-minded.[fn-61-P6155_1841352:854-nf] Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture[fn-61-P6156_1842177:855-nf] of Peter. For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the law forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the Spirit? And therefore, because it was in the Spirit that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not know what he had said. But if, on the other hand,[fn-61-P6157_1842594:856-nf] he was thus ignorant, because he erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, \"Whom they thought Him to be,\" meant the Creator's Christ, when he answered, \"Thou art the Christ; \"because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival god, he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in error here because of his previous erroneous opinion,[fn-61-P6158_1843038:857-nf] then you may be sure that up to that very day no new divinity had been revealed by Christ, and that Peter had so far made no mistake, because hitherto Christ had revealed nothing of the kind; and that Christ accordingly was not to be regarded as belonging to any other than the Creator, whose entire dispensation[fn-61-P6159_1843388:858-nf] he, in fact, here described. He selects from His disciples three witnesses of the impending vision and voice. And this is just the way of the Creator. \"In the mouth of three witnesses,\" says He, \"shall every word be established.\"[fn-61-P6160_1843707:859-nf] He withdraws to a mountain. In the nature of the place I see much meaning. For the Creator had originally formed His ancient people on a mountain both with visible glory and His voice. It was only tight that the New Testament should be attested[fn-61-P6161_1843999:860-nf] on such an elevated spot[fn-61-P6162_1844043:861-nf] as that whereon the Old Testament had been composed;[fn-61-P6163_1844119:862-nf] under a like covering of cloud also, which nobody will doubt, was condensed out of the Creator's air. Unless, indeed, he[fn-61-P6164_1844267:863-nf] had brought down his own clouds thither, because he had himself forced his way through the Creator's heaven;[fn-61-P6165_1844398:864-nf] or else it was only a precarious cloud,[fn-61-P6166_1844500:865-nf] as it were, of the Creator which he used. On the present (as also on the former)[fn-61-P6167_1844705:866-nf] occasion, therefore, the cloud was not silent; but there was the accustomed voice from heaven, and the Father's testimony to the Son; precisely as in the first Psalm He had said, \"Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.\"[fn-61-P6168_1844948:867-nf] By the mouth of Isaiah also He had asked concerning Him, \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6169_1845101:868-nf] When therefore He here presents Him with the words, \"This is my (beloved) Son,\" this clause is of course understood, \"whom I have promised.\" For if He once promised, and then afterwards says, \"This is He,\" it is suitable conduct for one who accomplishes His purpose[fn-61-P6170_1845415:869-nf] that He should utter His voice in proof of the promise which He had formerly made; but unsuitable in one who is amenable to the retort, Can you, indeed, have a right to say, \"This is my son,\" concerning whom you have given us no previous information,[fn-61-P6171_1845694:870-nf] any more than you have favoured us with a revelation about your own prior existence? \"Hear ye Him,\" therefore, whom from the beginning (the Creator) had declared entitled to be heard in the name of a prophet, since it was as a prophet that He had to be regarded by the people. \"A prophet,\" says Moses, \"shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your sons\" (that is, of course, after a carnal descent[fn-61-P6172_1846178:871-nf] ); \"unto Him shall ye hearken, as unto me.\"[fn-61-P6173_1846264:872-nf] \"Every one who will not hearken unto Him, his soul[fn-61-P6174_1846339:873-nf] shall be cut off from amongst his people.\"[fn-61-P6175_1846402:874-nf] , So also Isaiah: \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6176_1846522:875-nf] This voice the Father was going Himself to recommend. For, says he,[fn-61-P6177_1846609:876-nf] He establishes the words of His Son, when He says, \"This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.\" Therefore, even if there be made a transfer of the obedient \"heating\" from Moses and Elias to[fn-61-P6178_1847561:877-nf] Christ, it is still not from[fn-61-P6179_1847684:878-nf] another God, or to another Christ; but from\" the Creator to His Christ, in consequence of the departure of the old covenant and the supervening of the new. \"Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but He Himself,\" says Isaiah, \"shall save them; \"[fn-61-P6180_1847960:879-nf] for it is He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law and the prophets. The Father gave to the Son new disciples,[fn-61-P6181_1848177:880-nf] after that Moses and Elias had been exhibited along with Him in the honour of His glory, and had then been dismissed as having fully discharged their duty and office, for the express purpose of affirming for Marcion's information the fact that Moses and Elias had a share in even the glory of Christ.

You attempt to prove, by a comparison of Christ and Moses, that they are unlike, and that therefore the words. \"I will raise up a prophet like unto thee,\" cannot be understood of Christ. You specify a number of particulars in which you find a diversity: that the one is man, and the other God; that one is a sinner, the other sinless; that one is born of ordinary generation, the other, as we hold, of a virgin, and, as you hold, not even of a virgin; the one incurs God's anger, and is put to death on a mountain, the other suffers voluntarily, having throughout the approval of His Father. But surely things may be said to be like, although they are not like in every respect. Besides the resemblance between things of the same nature, as between two men, or between parents and children, or between men in general, or any species of animals, or in trees, between one olive and another, or one laurel and another, there is often a resemblance in things of a different nature, as between a wild and a tame olive, or between wheat and barley. These things are to some extent allied. But there is the greatest possible distance between the Son of God, by whom all things were made, and a beast or a stone. And yet in the Gospel we read, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\"[fn-16-P1688_946079:18-nf] and in the apostle, \"That rock was Christ.\"[fn-16-P1689_946140:19-nf] This could not be said except on the supposition of some resemblance. What wonder, then, if Christ condescended to become like Moses, when He was made like the lamb which God by Moses commanded His people to eat as a type of Christ, enjoining that its blood should be used as a means of protection, and that it should be called the Passover, which every one must admit to be fulfilled in Christ? The Scripture, I acknowledge, shows points of difference; and the Scripture also, as I call on you to acknowledge, shows points of resemblance. There are points of both kinds, and one can be proved as well as the other. Christ is unlike man, for He is God; and it is written of Him that He is \"over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-16-P1690_946881:20-nf] Christ is also like man, for He is man; and it is likewise written of Him, that He is the \"Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.\"[fn-16-P1691_947042:21-nf] Christ is unlike a sinner, for He is ever holy; and He is like a sinner, for \"God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh.\"[fn-16-P1692_947237:22-nf] Christ is unlike a man born in ordinary generation, for He was born of a virgin; and yet He is like, for He too was born of a woman, to whom it was said, \"That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-16-P1693_947488:23-nf] Christ is unlike a man, who dies on account of his own sin, for He died without sin, and of His own free-will; and again, He is like, for He too died a real death of the body.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now, when Marcion wholly prohibits all carnal intercourse to the faithful (for we will say nothing[fn-74-P7475_2147391:310-nf] about his catechumens), and when he prescribes repudiation of all engagements before marriage, whose teaching does he follow, that of Moses or of Christ? Even Christ,[fn-74-P7476_2147575:311-nf] however, when He here commands \"the wife not to depart from her husband, or if she depart, to remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband,\"[fn-74-P7477_2148067:312-nf] both permitted divorce, which indeed He never absolutely prohibited, and confirmed (the sanctity) of marriage, by first forbidding its dissolution; and, if separation had taken place, by wishing the nuptial bond to be resumed by reconciliation. But what reasons does (the apostle) allege for continence? Because \"the time is short.\"[fn-74-P7478_2148427:313-nf] I had almost thought it was because in Christ there was another god! And yet He from whom emanates this shortness of the time, will also send what suits the said brevity. No one makes provision for the time which is another's. You degrade your god, O Marcion, when you make him circumscribed at all by the Creator's time. Assuredly also, when (the apostle) rules that marriage should be \"only in the Lord,\"[fn-74-P7479_2148857:314-nf] that no Christian should intermarry with a heathen, he maintains a law of the Creator, who everywhere prohibits marriage with strangers. But when he says, \"although there be that are called gods, whether in l heaven or in earth,\"[fn-74-P7480_2149111:315-nf] the meaning of his words is clear-not as if there were gods in reality, but as if there were some who are called gods, without being truly so. He introduces his discussion about meats offered to idols with a statement concerning idols (themselves): \"We know that an idol is nothing in the world.\"[fn-74-P7481_2149431:316-nf] Marcion, however, does not say that the Creator is not God; so that the apostle can hardly be thought to have ranked the Creator amongst those who are called gods, without being so; since, even if they had been gods, \"to us there is but one God, the Father.\"[fn-74-P7482_2149713:317-nf] Now, from whom do all things come to us, but from Him to whom all things belong?

From Him, therefore, amongst the \"all things\" comes also Christ.[fn-74-P7484_2150275:319-nf] When he teaches that every man ought to live of his own industry,[fn-74-P7485_2150364:320-nf] he begins with a copious induction of examples-of soldiers, and shepherds, and husbandmen.[fn-74-P7486_2150477:321-nf] But he[fn-74-P7487_2150505:322-nf] wanted divine authority. What was the use, however, of adducing the Creator's, which he was destroying? It was vain to do so; for his god had no such authority! (The apostle) says: \"Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn,\"[fn-74-P7488_2150779:323-nf] and adds: \"Doth God take care of oxen? \"Yes, of oxen, for the sake of men! For, says he, \"it is written for our sakes.\"[fn-74-P7489_2150937:324-nf] Thus he showed that the law had a symbolic reference to ourselves, and that it gives its sanction in favour of those who live of the gospel. (He showed) also, that those who preach the gospel are on this account sent by no other god but Him to whom belongs the law, which made provision for them, when he says: \"For our sakes was this writ. ten.\"[fn-74-P7490_2151306:325-nf] Still he declined to use this power which the law gave him, because he preferred working without any restraint.[fn-74-P7491_2151474:326-nf] Of this he boasted, and suffered no man to rob him of such glory[fn-74-P7492_2151554:327-nf] -certainly with no view of destroying the law, which he proved that another man might use. For behold Marcion, in his blindness, stumbled at the rock whereof our fathers drank in the wilderness. For since \"that rock was Christ,\"[fn-74-P7493_2151805:328-nf] it was, of course, the Creator's, to whom also belonged the people. But why resort to the figure of a sacred sign given by an extraneous god?[fn-74-P7494_2151967:329-nf] Was it to teach the very truth, that ancient things prefigured the Christ who was to be educed[fn-74-P7495_2152098:330-nf] out of them? For, being about to take a cursory view of what befell the people (of Israel) he begins with saying: \"Now these things happened as examples for us.\"[fn-74-P7496_2152280:331-nf] Now, tell me, were these examples given by the Creator to men belonging to a rival god? Or did one god borrow examples from another, and a hostile one too? He withdraws me to himself in alarm[fn-74-P7497_2152492:332-nf] from Him from whom he transfers my allegiance. Will his antagonist make me better disposed to him? Should I now commit the same sins as the people, shall I have to suffer the same penalties, or not?[fn-74-P7498_2152714:333-nf] But if not the same, how vainly does he propose to me terrors which I shall not have to endure!

And how will it happen that, jealous God as He is, He shall punish the man who offends His rival, instead of rather encouraging[fn-74-P7499_2153077:334-nf] him. If, however, from the other god-but he knows not how to punish. So that the whole declaration of the apostle lacks a reasonable basis, if it is not meant to relate to the Creator's discipline. But the fact is, the apostle's conclusion corresponds to the beginning: \"Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.\"[fn-75-P7500_2153513:335-nf] What a Creator! how prescient already, and considerate in warning Christians who belong to another god!

A great argument for another god is the permission to eat of all kinds of meats, contrary to the law.[fn-75-P7501_2153867:336-nf] Just as if we did not ourselves allow that the burdensome ordinances of the law were abrogated-but by Him who imposed them, who also promised the new condition of things.[fn-75-P7502_2154063:337-nf] The same, therefore, who prohibited meats, also restored the use of them, just as He had indeed allowed them from the beginning. If, however, some strange god had come to destroy our God, his foremost prohibition would certainly have been, that his own votaries should abstain from supporting their lives on the resources of his adversary.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":18,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Deuteronomy God said to Moses: \"And the Lord said to me, A Prophet will I raise up to them from among their brethren, such as thee, and I will give my word in His mouth; and He shall speak unto them that which I shall command Him.

But for the time that remains, my most attentive hearers, let us take up the old man, the receiver of God, and our pious teacher, who hath put in here, as it were, in safety from that virginal sea, and let us refresh him, both satisfied as to his divine longing, and conveying to us this most blessed theology; and let us ourselves follow out the rest of our discourse, directing our course unerringly with reference to our prescribed end, and that under the guidance of God the Almighty, so shall we not be found altogether unfruitful and unprofitable as to what is required of us. When, then, to these sacred rites, prophecy and the priesthood had been jointly called, and that pair of just ones elected of God-Simeon, I mean, and Anna, bearing in themselves most evidently the images of both peoples-had taken their station by the side of that glorious and virginal throne,-for by the old man was represented the people of Israel, and the law now waxing old; whilst the widow represents the Church of the Gentiles, which had been up to this point a widow,-the old man, indeed, as personating the law, seeks dismissal; but the widow, as personating the Church, brought her joyous confession of faith[fn-61-P6118_1878628:100-nf] and spake of Him to all that looked for redemption in Jerusalem, even as the things that were spoken of both have been appositely and excellently recorded, and quite in harmony with the sacred festival. For it was fitting and necessary that the old man who knew so accurately that decree of the law, in which it is said: Hear Him, and every soul that will not hearken unto Him shall be cut off from His people,[fn-61-P6119_1879059:101-nf] should seek a peaceful discharge from the tutorship of the law; for in truth it were insolence and presumption, when the king is present and addressing the people, for one of his attendants to make a speech over against him, and that to this man his subjects should incline their ears. It was necessary, too, that the widow who had been increased with gifts beyond measure, should in festal strains return her thanks to God; and so the things which there took place were agreeable to the law. But, for what remains, it is necessary to inquire how, since the prophetic types and figures bear, as has been shown, a certain analogy and relation to this prominent feast, it is said that the house was filled with smoke. Nor does the prophet say this incidentally, but with significance, speaking of that cry of the Thrice-Holy,[fn-61-P6120_1879910:102-nf] uttered by the heavenly seraphs. You will discover the meaning of this, my attentive hearer, if you do but take up and examine what follows upon this narration: For hearing, he says, ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing, ye shall see, and not perceive.[fn-61-P6121_1880197:103-nf] When, therefore, the foolish Jewish children had seen the glorious wonders which, as David sang, the Lord had performed in the earth, and had seen the sign from the depth[fn-61-P6122_1880404:104-nf] and from the height meeting together, without division or confusion; as also Isaiah had before declared, namely, a mother beyond nature, and an offspring beyond reason; an earthly mother and a heavenly son; a new taking of man's nature, I say, by God, and a child-bearing without marriage; what in creation's circuit could be more glorious and more to be spoken of than this! yet when they had seen this it was all one as if they had not seen it; they closed their eyes, and in respect of praise were supine. Therefore the house in which they boasted was filled with smoke.","title":"Oration Concerning Simeon and Anna","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":18,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Now let us consider John's second testimony. Jews from Jerusalem,[fn-67-P6728_1198094:26-nf] kindred to John the Baptist, since he also belonged to a priestly race, send priests and levites to ask John who he is. In saying, \"I am not the Christ,\" he made a confession of the truth. The words are not, as one might suppose, a negation; for it is no negation to say, in the honour of Christ, that one is not Christ. The priests and levites sent from Jerusalem, having there heard in the first place that he is not the expected Messiah, put a question about the second great personage whom they expected, namely, Elijah, whether John were he, and he says he is not Elijah, and by his \"I am not\" makes a second confession of the truth. And, as many prophets had appeared in Israel, and one in particular was looked for according to the prophecy of Moses, who said,[fn-67-P6729_1198882:27-nf] \"A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brethren, like unto me, him shall ye hear; and it shall come to pass that every soul that shall not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people,\" they, therefore, ask a third question, not whether he is a prophet, but whether he is the prophet. Now, they did not apply this name to the Christ, but supposed the prophet to be a second figure beside the Christ. But John, on the contrary, who knew that He whose forerunner he was was both the Christ and the prophet thus foretold, answered \"No; \"whereas, if they had asked if he was a prophet, he would have answered \"Yes; \"[fn-67-P6730_1199552:28-nf] for he was not unconscious that he was a prophet.

From the sonship itself? What then is the distinction between the first and second? The first is the honor of a name, in the second the thing goes with it. Of the first the Prophet says, \"I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High\" (Ps. lxxxii. 6); but of the latter, that they \"were born of God.\" How, and in what way? By the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost. For then even after they had received the title of sons, retained the spirit of slavery, (for while they remained laves they were honored with this appellation,) but we being made free, received the honor, not in name, but in deed. And this Paul has declared and said, \"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\" (Rom. viii. 15.) For having been born again,[fn-7-P792_245196:8-nf] and, as one may say, thoroughly remade,[fn-7-P793_245273:9-nf] we so are called \"sons.\" And if one consider the character of the holiness, what the first was and what the second, he will find there also great[fn-7-P794_245441:10-nf] difference. They when they did not worship idols, nor commit fornication or adultery, were called by this name; but we become holy, not by refraining from these vices merely, but by acquiring things greater. And this gift we obtain first by means of the coming upon us of the Holy Ghost; and next, by a rule of life far more comprehensive[fn-7-P795_245833:11-nf] than that of the Jews. To prove that these words are not mere boasting hear what He saith to them, \"Ye shall not use divination,[fn-7-P796_246029:12-nf] nor make purification of your children, for ye are a holy people.\" So that holines with them consisted in being free from the customs of idolatry; but it is not so with us. \"That she may be holy,\" saith Paul, \"in body and spirit.\" (1 Cor. vii. 34.) \"Follow peace, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord\" (Heb. xii. 14): and, \"Perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\" (2 Cor. vii. 1.) For the word \"holy\" has not force to give the same meaning in every case to which it is applied; since God is called \"Holy,\" though not as we are. What, for instance, does the Prophet say, when he heard that cry raised[fn-7-P797_246674:13-nf] by the flying Seraphim? \"Woe is me! because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips\" (Isa. vi. 5); though he was holy and clean; but if we be compared with the holiness which is above, we are unclean. Angels are holy, Archangels are holy, the Cherubim and Seraphim themselves are holy, but of this holiness again there is a double difference; that is, in relation to us, and to the higher powers.[fn-7-P798_247155:14-nf] We might proceed to all the other points, but then the discussion would become too long, and its extent too great. We will therefore desist from proceeding farther, and leave it to you to take in hand the rest, for it is in your power at home to put these things together, and examine their difference, and in the same way to go over what remains. \"Give,\" saith one, \"a starting place to the wise, and he becometh wiser.\" (Prov. ix. 9, Prov. ix. 9 LXX.)

Therefore He chose us twelve,[fn-14-P1481_380092:32-nf] the first who believed in Him, whom He named apostles; and afterwards other seventy-two most approved disciples,[fn-14-P1482_380219:33-nf] that, at least in this way recognising the pattern of Moses,[fn-14-P1483_380293:34-nf] the multitude might believe that this is He of whom Moses foretold, the Prophet that was to come.\"[fn-14-P1484_380410:35-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Pseudo-Clementine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_83_letter_xiv_for_342_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"4.

I have been given to understand, moreover, that this man, who made his way to me before these days, and sought to introduce a novel kind of knowledge here, different from what is apostolic and ecclesiastical, has also come to you. To that person, indeed, I gave no place: for presently, when we held a disputation together, he was confuted. And I could wish now to transcribe for your behoof all the arguments of which I made use on that occasion, so that by means of these you might get an idea of what that man's faith is. But as that could be done only with leisure at my disposal, I have deemed it requisite, in view of the immediate exigency, to write a short reply to you with reference to what you have written me on the subject of the statements advanced by him. I understand, then, that his chief[fn-37-P3722_1043809:441-nf] effort was directed to prove that the law of Moses is not consonant with the law of Christ; and this position he attempted to found on the authority of our Scriptures. Well, on the other hand, not only did we establish the law of Moses, and all things which are written in it, by the same Scripture; but we also proved that the whole Old Testament agrees with the New Testament, and is in perfect harmony with the same, and that they form really one texture, just as a person may see one and the same robe made up of weft and warp together.[fn-37-P3723_1044417:442-nf] For the truth is simply this, that just as we trace the purple in a robe, so, if we may thus express it, we can discern the New Testament in the texture of the Old Testament; for we see the glory of the Lord mirrored in the same.[fn-37-P3724_1044923:443-nf] We are not therefore to cast aside the mirror,[fn-37-P3725_1045151:444-nf] seeing that it shows us the genuine image of the things themselves, faithfully and truly; but, on the contrary, we ought to honour it all the more. Think you, indeed, that the boy who is brought by his paedagogue to the teachers of learning[fn-37-P3726_1045531:445-nf] when he is yet a very little fellow, ought to hold that paedagogue in no honour[fn-37-P3727_1045827:446-nf] after he has grown up to manhood, simply because he needs his services[fn-37-P3728_1045965:447-nf] no longer, but can make his course without any assistance from that attendant to the schools, and quickly find his way to the lecture-rooms? Or, to take another instance, would it be right for the child who has been nourished on milk at first, after he has grown to be capable of receiving stronger meats, then injuriously to spurn the breasts of his nurse, and conceive a horror of them? Nay, rather he should honour and cherish them, and confess himself a debtor to their good services. We may also make use, if it please you, of another illustration. A certain man on one occasion having noticed an infant exposed on the ground and already suffering excessively, picked it up, and undertook to rear it in his own house until it should reach the age of youth, and sustained all the toils and anxieties which are wont to fall to the lot of those who have to bring up children. After a time, however, it happened that he who was the child's natural father came seeking the boy, and found him with this person who had brought him up.[fn-37-P3729_1047088:448-nf] What ought this boy to do on learning that this is his real father? For I speak, of course, of a boy of the right type. Would he not see to it, that he who had brought him up should be recompensed with liberal gifts; and would he not then follow his natural father, having his proper inheritance in view?[fn-37-P3730_1047553:449-nf] Even so, then, I think we must suppose that that distinguished servant of God, Moses, in a manner something like this, found[fn-37-P3731_1047761:450-nf] a people afflicted by the Egyptians; and he took this people to himself, and nurtured them in the desert like a father, and instructed them like a teacher, and ruled them as a magistrate. This people he also preserved against the coming of him whose people they were. And after a considerable period the father[fn-37-P3732_1048134:451-nf] did come, and did receive, his sheep. Now will not that guardian be honoured in all things by him to whom he delivered that flock; and will he not be glorified by those who have been preserved by him? Who, then, can be so senseless, my dearly beloved Diodorus, as to say that those are aliens to each other who have been allied with each other, who have prophesied in turn for each other, and who have shown signs and wonders which are equal and similar, the one to the other, and of like nature with each other;[fn-37-P3733_1048702:452-nf] or rather, to speak in truth, which belong wholly to the same stock the one with the other? For, indeed, Moses first said to the people: \"A Prophet will the Lord our God raise up unto you, like unto me.\"[fn-37-P3734_1048972:453-nf] And Jesus afterwards said: \"For Moses spake of me.\"[fn-37-P3735_1049048:454-nf] You see[fn-37-P3736_1049075:455-nf] how these twain give the fight hand to each other, although[fn-37-P3737_1049222:456-nf] the one was the prophet and the other was the beloved Son,[fn-37-P3738_1049314:457-nf] and although in the one we are to recognise the faithful servant, but in the other the Lord Himself. Now, on the other hand, I might refer to the fact, that one who of old was minded to make his way to the schools without the paedagogue was not taken in by the master. For the master said: \"I will not receive him unless he accepts the paedagogue.\" And who the person is, who is spoken of under that figure, I shall briefly explain. There was a certain rich man,[fn-37-P3739_1049804:458-nf] who lived after the manner of the Gentiles, and passed his time in great luxury every day; and there was also another man, a poor man, who was his neighbour, and who was unable to procure even his daily bread. It happened that both these men departed this life, that they both descended into the grave,[fn-37-P3740_1050133:459-nf] and that the poor man was conveyed into the place of rest, and so forth, as is known to you. But, furthermore, that rich man had also five brothers, living as he too had lived, and disturbed by no doubt as to lessons which they had learned at home from such a master. The rich man then entreated that these should be instructed in the superior doctrine together and at once.[fn-37-P3741_1050552:460-nf] But Abraham, knowing that they still stood in need of the paedagogue, said to him: \"They have Moses and the prophets.\" For if they received not these, so as to have their course directed by him, i.e., Moses, as by a paedagogue, they would not be capable of accepting the doctrine of the superior master.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":18,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"ANF-06","text":"43. I shall speak now with the utmost brevity of the veil of Moses and the ministration of death. For I do not think that these things at least can introduce very much to the disparagement of the law. The text in question,[fn-37-P3777_1061464:494-nf] then, proceeds thus: \"But if the ministration of death, engraven[fn-37-P3778_1061576:495-nf] in letters on the stones, was made in glory, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away; \"[fn-37-P3779_1061841:496-nf] and so on. Well, this passage at any rate acknowledges the existence of a glory on the countenance of Moses, and that surely is a fact favourable to our position. And even although it is to be done away. and although there is a veil in the reading of the same, that does not annoy me or disturb me, provided there be glory in it still. Neither is it the case, that whatever is to be done away is reduced thereby under all manner of circumstances to a condition of dishonour.[fn-37-P3780_1062338:497-nf] For when the Scripture speaks of glory, it shows us also that it had cognizance[fn-37-P3781_1062561:498-nf] of differences in glory. Thus it says: \"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.\"[fn-37-P3782_1062878:499-nf] Although, then, the sun has a greater glory than the moon, it does not follow that the moon is thereby reduced to a condition of dishonour. And even thus, too, although my Lord Jesus Christ excelleth Moses in glory, as the lord excelleth the servant, it does not follow from this that the glory of Moses is to be scorned. For in this way, too, we are able to satisfy our hearers, as the nature of the word itself carries the conviction[fn-37-P3783_1063336:500-nf] with it in that we affirm what we allege on the authority of the Scriptures themselves, or verily make the proof of our statements all the clearer also by illustrations taken from them. Thus, although a person kindles a lamp in the night-time, after the sun has once risen he has no further need of the paltry light of his lamp, on account of that effulgence of the sun which sends forth its rays all the world over; and yet, for all that, the man does not throw his lamp contemptuously away, as if it were something absolutely antagonistic to the sun; but rather, when he has once found out its use, he will keep it with all the greater carefulness. Precisely in this way, then, the law of Moses served as a sort of guardian to the people, like the tamp, until the true Sun, who is our Saviour, should arise, even as the apostle also says to us: \"And Christ shall give thee light.\"[fn-37-P3784_1064350:501-nf] We must look, however, to what is said further on: \"Their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same veil in the reading of the Old Testament; it is untaken away, because it is done away in Christ.[fn-37-P3785_1064583:502-nf] For even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit.\"[fn-37-P3786_1064812:503-nf] What, then, is meant by this? Is Moses present with us even unto this day? Is it the case that he has never slept, that he has never gone to his rest, that he has never departed this life? How is it that this phrase \"unto this day\" is used here? Well, only mark the veil, which is placed, where he says it is placed, on their hearts in their reading. This, therefore, is the word of censure upon the children of Israel, because they read Moses and yet do not understand him, and refuse to turn to the Lord; for it is He that was prophesied of by Moses as about to come. This, then, is the veil which was placed upon the face of Moses,[fn-37-P3787_1065473:504-nf] and this also is his testament;[fn-37-P3788_1065543:505-nf] for he says in the law:[fn-37-P3789_1065676:506-nf] \"A prince shall not be wanting from Judah, nor a leader from his thighs,[fn-37-P3790_1065774:507-nf] until He come whose he is;[fn-37-P3791_1066170:508-nf] and He will be the expectation of the nations: who shall bind[fn-37-P3792_1066609:509-nf] His foal unto the vine, and His ass's colt unto the choice vine; He shall wash His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes; His eyes shall be suffused[fn-37-P3793_1066879:510-nf] with wine, and His teeth white with milk; \"and so on. Moreover, he indicated who He was, and whence He was to come. For he said: \"The Lord God will raise up unto you, a Prophet from among your brethren, like unto me: unto Him hearken ye.\"[fn-37-P3794_1067259:511-nf] Now it is plain that this cannot be understood to have been said of Jesus the son of Nun.[fn-37-P3795_1067373:512-nf] For there is nothing of this circumcision[fn-37-P3796_1067610:513-nf] found in him. After him, too, there have still been kings from Judah; and consequently this prophecy is far from being applicable to him. And this is the veil which is on Moses; for it was not, as some among the unlearned perhaps fancy, any piece of linen cloth, or any skin that covered his face. But the apostle also takes care to make this plain to us, when he tells us that the veil is put on in the reading of the Old Testament, inasmuch as they who are called Israel from olden time still look for the coming of Christ, and perceive not that the princes have been wanting from Judah, and the leaders from his thighs; as even at present we see them in subjection to kings and princes, and paying tribute to these, without having any power left to them either of judgment or of punishment, such as Judah certainly had, for after he had condemned Thamar, he was able also to justify her.[fn-37-P3797_1068629:514-nf] \"But you will also see your life hang (in doubt) before your eyes.\"[fn-37-P3798_1068824:515-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"}]
