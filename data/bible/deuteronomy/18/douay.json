{"verses":["The priests and Levites, and all that are of the same tribe,\nshall have no part nor inheritance with the rest of Israel, because\nthey shall eat the sacrifices of the Lord, and his oblations,","And they shall receive nothing else of the possession of their\nbrethren:  for the Lord himself is their inheritance, as he hath said to\nthem.","This shall be the priest's due from the people, and from them\nthat offer victims:  whether they sacrifice an ox, or a sheep, they\nshall give to the priest the shoulder and the breast:","The firstfruits also of corn, of wine, and of oil, and a part of\nthe wool from the shearing of their sheep.","For the Lord thy God hath chosen him of all thy tribes, to stand\nand to minister to the name of the Lord, him and his sons for ever.","If a Levite go out of any one of the cities throughout all\nIsrael, in which he dwelleth, and have a longing mind to come to the\nplace which the Lord shall choose,","He shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, as all his\nbrethren the Levites do, that shall stand at that time before the Lord.","He shall receive the same portion of food that the rest do:\nbesides that which is due to him in his own city, by succession from\nhis fathers.","When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God shall\ngive thee, beware lest thou have a mind to imitate the abominations of\nthose nations.","Neither let there be found among you any one that shall expiate\nhis son or daughter, making them to pass through the fire:  or that\nconsulteth soothsayers, or observeth dreams and omens, neither let\nthere be any wizard,","Nor charmer, nor any one that consulteth pythonic spirits, or\nfortune tellers, or that seeketh the truth from the dead.","For the Lord abhorreth all these things, and for these\nabominations he will destroy them at thy coming.","Thou shalt be perfect, and without spot before the Lord thy God.","These nations, whose land thou shalt possess, hearken to\nsoothsayers and diviners:  but thou art otherwise instructed by the Lord\nthy God.","The Lord thy God will raise up to thee a PROPHET of thy nation\nand of thy brethren like unto me:  him thou shalt hear:","As thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the\nassembly was gathered together, and saidst:  Let me not hear any more\nthe voice of the Lord my God, neither let me see any more this\nexceeding great fire, lest I die.","And the Lord said to me:  They have spoken all things well.","I will raise them up a prophet out of the midst of their\nbrethren like to thee:  and I will put my words in his mouth, and he\nshall speak to them all that I shall command him.","And he that will not hear his words, which he shall speak in my\nname, I will be the revenger.","But the prophet, who being corrupted with pride, shall speak in\nmy name things that I did not command him to say, or in the name of\nstrange gods, shall be slain.","And if in silent thought thou answer:  How shall I know the word\nthat the Lord hath not spoken?","Thou shalt have this sign:  Whatsoever that same prophet\nforetelleth in the name of the Lord, and it cometh not to pass:  that\nthing the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath forged it by the\npride of his mind:  and therefore thou shalt not fear him."]}
