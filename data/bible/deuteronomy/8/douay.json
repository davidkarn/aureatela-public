{"verses":["All the commandments, that I command thee this day, take great\ncare to observe:  that you may live, and be multiplied, and going in may\npossess the land, for which the Lord swore to your fathers.","And thou shalt remember all the way through which the Lord thy God\nhath brought thee for forty years through the desert, to afflict thee\nand to prove thee, and that the things that were known in thy heart\nmight be made known, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no.","He afflicted thee with want, and gave thee manna for thy food,\nwhich neither thou nor thy fathers knew:  to shew that not in bread\nalone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth\nof God.","Thy raiment, with which thou wast covered, hath not decayed for\nage, and thy foot is not worn, lo this is the fortieth year,","That thou mayst consider in thy heart, that as a man traineth up\nhis son, so the Lord thy God hath trained thee up.","That thou shouldst keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and\nwalk in his ways, and fear him.","For the Lord thy God will bring thee into a good land, of brooks\nand of waters, and of fountains:  in the plains of which and the hills\ndeep rivers break out:","A land of wheat, and barley, and vineyards, wherein fig trees and\npomegranates, and oliveyards grow:  a land of oil and honey.","Where without any want thou shalt eat thy bread, and enjoy\nabundance of all things:  where the stones are iron, and out of its\nhills are dug mines of brass:","That when thou hast eaten, and art full, thou mayst bless the\nLord thy God for the excellent land which he hath given thee.","Take heed, and beware lest at any time thou forget the Lord thy\nGod, and neglect his commandments and judgments and ceremonies, which I\ncommand thee this day:","Lest after thou hast eaten and art filled, hast built goodly\nhouses, and dwelt in them,","And shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, and plenty of\ngold and of silver, and of all things,","Thy heart be lifted up, and thou remember not the Lord thy God,\nwho brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage:","And was thy leader in the great and terrible wilderness, wherein\nthere was the serpent burning with his breath, and the scorpion and the\ndipsas, and no waters at all:  who brought forth streams out of the\nhardest rock,","And fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew\nnot.  And after he had afflicted and proved thee, at the last he had\nmercy on thee,","Lest thou shouldst say in thy heart:  My own might, and the\nstrength of my own hand have achieved all these things for me.","But remember the Lord thy God, that he hath given thee strength,\nthat he might fulfil his covenant, concerning which he swore to thy\nfathers, as this present day sheweth.","But if thou forget the Lord thy God, and follow strange gods, and\nserve and adore them:  behold now I foretell thee that thou shalt\nutterly perish.","As the nations, which the Lord destroyed at thy entrance, so\nshall you also perish, if you be disobedient to the voice of the Lord\nyour God."]}
