It is an extraordinary statement, but it is none the less true, that the Spirit is frequently spoken of as the place of them that are being sanctified, and it will become evident that even by this figure the Spirit, so far from being degraded, is rather glorified. For words applicable to the body are, for the sake of clearness, frequently transferred in scripture to spiritual conceptions. Accordingly we find the Psalmist, even in reference to God, saying \"Be Thou to me a champion God and a strong place to save me\"[fn-18-P1828_473364:540-nf] and concerning the Spirit \"behold there is place by me, and stand upon a rock.\"[fn-18-P1829_473467:541-nf] Plainly meaning the place or contemplation in the Spirit wherein, after Moses had entered thither, he was able to see God intelligibly manifested to him. This is the special and peculiar place of true worship; for it is said \"Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place . . . but in the place the Lord thy God shall choose.\"[fn-18-P1830_473847:542-nf] Now what is a spiritual burnt offering? \"The sacrifice of praise.\"[fn-18-P1831_473953:543-nf] And in what place do we offer it? In the Holy Spirit. Where have we learnt this? From the Lord himself in the words \"The true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth.\"[fn-18-P1832_474169:544-nf] This place Jacob saw and said \"The Lord is in this place.\"[fn-18-P1833_474254:545-nf] It follows that the Spirit is verily the place of the saints and the saint is the proper place forthe Spirit, offering himself as he does for the indwelling of God, and called God's Temple.[fn-18-P1834_474467:546-nf] So Paul speaks in Christ, saying \"In the sight of God we speak in Christ,\"[fn-18-P1835_474870:547-nf] and Christ in Paul, as he himself says \"Since ye seek a proof ne Christ speaking in me.\"[fn-18-P1836_474983:548-nf] So also in the Spirit he speaketh mysteries,[fn-18-P1837_475050:549-nf] and again the Spirit speaks in him.[fn-18-P1838_475108:550-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":12,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"ANF-03","text":"So, again, we show that sacrifices of earthly oblations and of spiritual sacrifices[fn-21-P2115_718619:72-nf] were predicted; and, moreover, that from the beginning the earthly were foreshown, in the person of Cain, to be those of the \"elder son,\" that is, of Israel; and the opposite sacrifices demonstrated to be those of the \"younger son,\" Abel, that is, of our people.

And then God said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper? To whom God said, The voice of the blood of thy brother crieth forth unto me from the earth.

The passage itself, in which Christ tells the Jews not to think that He came to destroy the law, is rather designed to show that He did destroy it. For, had He not done something of the kind, the Jews would not have suspected Him. His words are: \"Think not that I am come to destroy the law.\" Suppose the Jews had replied, What actions of thine might lead us to suspect this? Is it because thou exposest circumcision, breakest the Sabbath, discardest sacrifices, makest no distinction in foods? this would be the natural answer to the words, Think not. The Jews had the best possible reason for thinking that Jesus destroyed the law. If this was not to destroy the law, what is? But, indeed, the law and the prophets consider themselves already so faultlessly perfect, that they have no desire to be fulfilled. Their author and father condemns adding to them as much as taking away anything from them; as we read in Deuteronomy: \"These precepts which I deliver unto thee this day, O Israel, thou shalt observe to do; thou shalt not turn aside from them to the right hand or to the left; thou shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it, that thy God may bless thee.\"[fn-17-P1763_996882:2-nf] Whether, therefore, Jesus turned aside to the right by adding to the law and the prophets in order to fulfill them, or to the left in taking away from them to destroy them, either way he offended the author of the law.
