{"verses":["These are the precepts and judgments, that you must do in the\nland, which the Lord the God of thy fathers will give thee, to possess\nit all the days that thou shalt walk upon the earth.","Destroy all the places in which the nations, that you shall\npossess, worshipped their gods upon high mountains, and hills, and\nunder every shady tree:","Overthrow their altars, and break down their statues, burn their\ngroves with fire, and break their idols in pieces:  destroy their names\nout of those places.","You shall not do so to the Lord your God:","But you shall come to the place, which the Lord your God shall\nchoose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, and to dwell in\nit:","And you shall offer in that place your holocausts and victims,\nthe tithes and firstfruits of your hands and your vows and gifts, the\nfirstborn of your herds and your sheep.","And you shall eat there in the sight of the Lord your God:  and\nyou shall rejoice in all things, whereunto you shall put your hand, you\nand your houses wherein the Lord your God hath blessed you.","You shall not do there the things we do here this day, every man\nthat which seemeth good to himself.","For until this present time you are not come to rest, and to the\npossession, which the Lord your God will give you.","You shall pass over the Jordan, and shall dwell in the land\nwhich the Lord your God will give you, that you may have rest from all\nenemies round about:  and may dwell without any fear,","In the place, which the Lord your God shall choose, that his\nname may be therein.  Thither shall you bring all the things that I\ncommand you, holocausts, and victims, and tithes, and the firstfruits\nof your hands:  and whatsoever is the choicest in the gifts which you\nshall vow to the Lord.","There shall you feast before the Lord your God, you and your\nsons and your daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the\nLevite that dwelleth in your cities.  For he hath no other part and\npossession among you.","Beware lest thou offer thy holocausts in every place that thou\nshalt see:","But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy\ntribes shalt thou offer sacrifices, and shalt do all that I command\nthee.","But if thou desirest to eat, and the eating of flesh delight\nthee, kill, and eat according to the blessing of the Lord thy God,\nwhich he hath given thee, in thy cities:  whether it be unclean, that is\nto say, having blemish or defect:  or clean, that is to say, sound and\nwithout blemish, such as may be offered, as the roe, and the hart,\nshalt thou eat it:","Only the blood thou shalt not eat, but thou shalt pour it out\nupon the earth as water.","Thou mayst not eat in thy towns the tithes of thy corn, and thy\nwine, and thy oil, the firstborn of thy herds and thy cattle, nor any\nthing that thou vowest, and that thou wilt offer voluntarily, and the\nfirstfruits of thy hands:","But thou shalt eat them before the Lord thy God in the place\nwhich the Lord thy God shall choose, thou and thy son and thy daughter,\nand thy manservant, and maidservant, and the Levite that dwelleth in\nthy cities:  and thou shalt rejoice and be refreshed before the Lord thy\nGod in all things, whereunto thou shalt put thy hand.","Take heed thou forsake not the Levite all the time that thou\nlivest in the land.","When the Lord thy God shall have enlarged thy borders, as he hath\nspoken to thee, and thou wilt eat the flesh that thy soul desireth:","And if the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, that his\nname should be there, be far off, thou shalt kill of thy herds and of\nthy flocks, as I have commanded thee, and shalt eat in thy towns, as it\npleaseth thee.","Even as the roe and the hart is eaten, so shalt thou eat them:\nboth the clean and unclean shall eat of them alike.","Only beware of this, that thou eat not the blood, for the blood\nis for the soul:  and therefore thou must not eat the soul with the\nflesh:","But thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water,","That it may be well with thee and thy children after thee, when\nthou shalt do that which is pleasing in the sight of the Lord.","But the things which thou hast sanctified and vowed to the Lord,\nthou shalt take, and shalt come to the place which the Lord shall\nchoose:","And shalt offer thy oblations, the flesh and the blood upon the\naltar of the Lord thy God:  the blood of thy victims thou shalt pour on\nthe altar:  and the flesh thou thyself shalt eat.","Observe and hear all the things that I command thee, that it may\nbe well with thee and thy children after thee for ever, when thou shalt\ndo what is good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God.","When the Lord thy God shall have destroyed before thy face the\nnations, which thou shalt go in to possess, and when thou shalt possess\nthem, and dwell in their land:","Beware lest thou imitate them, after they are destroyed at thy\ncoming in, and lest thou seek after their ceremonies, saying:  As these\nnations have worshipped their gods, so will I also worship.","Thou shalt not do in like manner to the Lord thy God.  For they\nhave done to their gods all the abominations which the Lord abhorreth,\noffering their sons and daughters, and burning them with fire.","What I command thee, that only do thou to the Lord:  neither add\nany thing, nor diminish."]}
