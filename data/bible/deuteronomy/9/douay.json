{"verses":["Hear, O Israel:  Thou shalt go over the Jordan this day; to possess\nnations very great, and stronger than thyself, cities great, and walled\nup to the sky,","A people great and tall, the sons of the Enacims, whom thou hast\nseen, and heard of, against whom no man is able to stand.","Thou shalt know therefore this day that the Lord thy God himself\nwill pass over before thee, a devouring and consuming fire, to destroy\nand extirpate and bring them to nothing before thy face quickly, as he\nhath spoken to thee.","Say not in thy heart, when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed\nthem in thy sight:  For my justice hath the Lord brought me in to\npossess this land, whereas these nations are destroyed for their\nwickedness.","For it is not for thy justices, and the uprightness of thy heart\nthat thou shalt go in to possess their lands:  but because they have\ndone wickedly, they are destroyed at thy coming in:  and that the Lord\nmight accomplish his word, which he promised by oath to thy fathers\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob.","Know therefore that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this\nexcellent land in possession for thy justices, for thou art a very\nstiffnecked people.","Remember, and forget not how thou provokedst the Lord thy God to\nwrath in the wilderness.  From the day that thou camest out of Egypt\nunto this place, thou hast always strove against the Lord.","For in Horeb, also thou didst provoke him, and he was angry, and\nwould have destroyed thee,","When I went up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, the\ntables of the covenant which the Lord made with you:  and I continued in\nthe mount forty days and nights, neither eating bread, nor drinking\nwater.","And the Lord gave me two tables of stone written with the finger\nof God, and containing all the words that he spoke to you in the mount\nfrom the midst of the fire, when the people were assembled together.","And when forty days were passed, and as many nights, the Lord\ngave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant,","And said to me:  Arise, and go down from hence quickly:  for thy\npeople, which thou hast brought out of Egypt, have quickly forsaken the\nway that thou hast shewn them, and have made to themselves a molten\nidol.","And again the Lord said to me:  I see that this people is\nstiffnecked:","Let me alone that I may destroy them, and abolish their name from\nunder heaven, and set thee over a nation, that is greater and stronger\nthan this.","And when I came down from the burning mount, and held the two\ntables of the covenant with both hands,","And saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God, and had\nmade to yourselves a molten calf, and had quickly forsaken his way,\nwhich he had shewn you:","I cast the tables out of my hands, and broke them in your sight.","And I fell down before the Lord as before, forty days and nights\nneither eating bread, nor drinking water, for all your sins, which you\nhad committed against the Lord, and had provoked him to wrath:","For I feared his indignation and anger, wherewith being moved\nagainst you, he would have destroyed you.  And the Lord heard me this\ntime also.","And he was exceeding angry against Aaron also, and would have\ndestroyed him, and I prayed in like manner for him.","And your sin that you had committed, that is, the calf, I took,\nand burned it with fire, and breaking it into pieces, until it was as\nsmall as dust, I threw it into the torrent, which cometh down from the\nmountain.","At the burning also, and at the place of temptation, and at the\ngraves of lust you provoked the Lord:","And when he sent you from Cadesbarne, saying:  Go up, and possess\nthe land that I have given you, and you slighted the commandment of the\nLord your God, and did not believe him, neither would you hearken to\nhis voice:","But were always rebellious from the day that I began to know you.","And I lay prostrate before the Lord forty days and nights, in\nwhich I humbly besought him, that he would not destroy you as he had\nthreatened:","And praying, I said:  O Lord God, destroy not thy people, and thy\ninheritance, which thou hast redeemed in thy greatness, whom thou hast\nbrought out of Egypt with a strong hand.","Remember thy servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob:  look not on the\nstubbornness of this people, nor on their wickedness and sin:","Lest perhaps the inhabitants of the land, out of which thou hast\nbrought us, say:  The Lord could not bring them into the land that he\npromised them, and he hated them:  therefore he brought them out, that\nhe might kill them in the wilderness,","Who are thy people and thy inheritance, whom thou hast brought\nout by thy great strength, and in thy stretched out arm."]}
