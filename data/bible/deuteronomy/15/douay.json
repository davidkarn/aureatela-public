{"verses":["In the seventh year thou shalt make a remission,","Which shall be celebrated in this order.  He to whom any thing is\nowing from his friend or neighbour or brother, cannot demand it again,\nbecause it is the year of remission of the Lord.","Of the foreigner or stranger thou mayst exact it:  of thy\ncountryman and neighbour thou shalt not have power to demand it again.","And there shall be no poor nor beggar among you:  that the Lord\nthy God may bless thee in the land which he will give thee in\npossession.","Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep all\nthings that he hath ordained, and which I command thee this day, he\nwill bless thee, as he hath promised.","Thou shalt lend to many nations, and thou shalt borrow of no man.\nThou shalt have dominion over very many nations, and no one shall have\ndominion over thee.","If one of thy brethren that dwelleth within thy gates of thy city\nin the land which the Lord thy God will give thee, come to poverty:\nthou shalt not harden thy heart, nor close thy hand,","But shalt open it to the poor man, thou shalt lend him, that\nwhich thou perceivest he hath need of.","Beware lest perhaps a wicked thought steal in upon thee, and thou\nsay in thy heart:  The seventh year of remission draweth nigh; and thou\nturn away thy eyes from thy poor brother, denying to lend him that\nwhich he asketh:  lest he cry against thee to the Lord, and it become a\nsin unto thee.","But thou shalt give to him:  neither shalt thou do any thing\ncraftily in relieving his necessities:  that the Lord thy God may bless\nthee at all times, and in all things to which thou shalt put thy hand.","There will not be wanting poor in the land of thy habitation:\ntherefore I command thee to open thy hand to thy needy and poor\nbrother, that liveth in the land.","When thy brother a Hebrew man, or Hebrew woman is sold to thee,\nand hath served thee six years, in the seventh year thou shalt let him\ngo free:","And when thou sendest him out free, thou shalt not let him go\naway empty:","But shall give him for his way out of thy flocks, and out of thy\nbarnfloor, and thy winepress, wherewith the Lord thy God shall bless\nthee.","Remember that thou also wast a bondservant in the land of Egypt,\nand the Lord thy God made thee free, and therefore I now command thee\nthis.","But if he say:  I will not depart:  because he loveth thee, and\nthy house, and findeth that he is well with thee:","Thou shalt take an awl, and bore through his ear in the door of\nthy house, and he shall serve thee for ever:  thou shalt do in like\nmanner to thy womanservant also.","Turn not away thy eyes from them when thou makest them free:\nbecause he hath served thee six years according to the wages of a\nhireling:  that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works that\nthou dost.","Of the firstlings, that come of thy herds and thy sheep, thou\nshalt sanctify to the Lord thy God whatsoever is of the male sex.  Thou\nshalt not work with the firstling of a bullock, and thou shalt not\nshear the firstlings of thy sheep.","In the sight of the Lord thy God shalt thou eat them every year,\nin the place that the Lord shall choose, thou and thy house.","But if it have a blemish, or be lame, or blind, or in any part\ndisfigured or feeble, it shall not be sacrificed to the Lord thy God.","But thou shalt eat it within the gates of thy city:  the clean\nand the unclean shall eat them alike, as the roe and as the hart.","Only thou shalt take heed not to eat their blood, but pour it\nout on the earth as water."]}
