Roaming thus through the fairest fields of scripture I have culled its loveliest flowers to weave for your brows a garland of penitence; for my aim is that, flying on the wings of a dove, you may find rest[fn-45-P4504_1222409:3204-nf] and make your peace with the Father of mercy. Your former wife, who is now your sister and fellow-servant, has told me that, acting on the apostolic precept,[fn-45-P4505_1222587:3205-nf] you and she lived apart by consent that you might give yourselves to prayer; but that after a time your feet sank beneath you as if resting on water and indeed-to speak plainly-gave way altogether. For her part she heard the Lord saying to her as to Moses: \"as for thee stand thou here by me;\"[fn-45-P4506_1222905:3206-nf] and with the psalmist she said of Him: \"He hath set my feet upon a rock.\"[fn-45-P4507_1223001:3207-nf] But your house-she went on-having no sure foundation of faith fell before a whirlwind of the devil.[fn-45-P4508_1223121:3208-nf] Hers however still stands in the Lord, and does not refuse its shelter to you; you can still be joined in spirit to her to whom you were once joined in body.

Perform, now, the vow which you then made in the presence of God. Human life is uncertain.

For unless He had given it to all by no means would He have habitually permitted even proselytes out of the nations to have access to it. But-as is congruous with the goodness of God, and with His equity, as the Fashioner of mankind-He gave to all nations the selfsame law, which at definite and stated times He enjoined should be observed, when He willed, and through whom He willed, and as He willed. For in the beginning of the world He gave to Adam himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of the tree planted in the midst of paradise; but that, if they did contrariwise, by death they were to die.[fn-20-P2047_698574:16-nf] Which law had continued enough for them, had it been kept. For in this law given to Adam we recognise in embryo[fn-20-P2048_698720:17-nf] all the precepts which afterwards sprouted forth when given through Moses; that is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart and out of thy whole soul; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;[fn-20-P2049_698941:18-nf] Thou shalt not kill; Thou shall not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; False witness thou shall not utter; Honour thy father and mother; and, That which is another's, shall thou not covet. For the primordial law was given to Adam and Eve in paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of God. In short, if they had loved the Lord their God, they would not have contravened His precept; if they had habitually loved their neighbour-that is, themselves[fn-20-P2050_699548:19-nf] -they would not have believed the persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed murder upon themselves,[fn-20-P2051_699698:20-nf] by falling[fn-20-P2052_699740:21-nf] from immortality, by contravening God's precept; from theft also they would have abstained, if they had not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had been anxious to skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their God; nor would they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating devil, by believing him that they would be \"like God; \"and thus they would not have offended God either, as their Father, who had fashioned them from clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if they had not coveted another's, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit. Therefore, in this general and primordial law of God, the observance of which, in the case of the tree's fruit, He had sanctioned, we recognise enclosed all the precepts specially of the posterior Law, which germinated when disclosed at their proper times. For the subsequent superinduction of a law is the work of the same Being who had before premised a precept; since it is His province withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to form, righteous creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it? if He advances who begins? In short, before the Law of Moses,[fn-20-P2053_701005:22-nf] written in stone-tables, I contend that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood naturally, and by the fathers was habitually kept. For whence was Noah \"found righteous,\"[fn-20-P2054_701248:23-nf] if in his case the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was Abraham accounted \"a friend of God,\"[fn-20-P2055_701408:24-nf] if not on the ground of equity and righteousness, (in the observance) of a natural law? Whence was Melchizedek named \"priest of the most high God,\"[fn-20-P2056_701591:25-nf] if, before the priesthood of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer sacrifices to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from Egypt, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years. In fact, it was after Abraham's \"four hundred and thirty years\"[fn-20-P2057_702033:26-nf] that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses' Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as \"the law was given through Moses\"[fn-20-P2058_702739:27-nf] at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered \"friends of God.\" For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges? At all events, in settling him in paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise. Therefore, since God originated Adam uncircumcised, and inobservant of the Sabbath, consequently his offspring also, Abel, offering Him sacrifices, uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was by Him commended; while He accepted[fn-20-P2059_703780:28-nf] what he was offering in simplicity of heart, and reprobated the sacrifice of his brother Cain, who was not rightly dividing what he was offering.[fn-20-P2060_703955:29-nf] Noah also, uncircumcised-yes, and inobservant of the Sabbath-God freed from the deluge.[fn-20-P2061_704104:30-nf] For Enoch, too, most righteous man, uncircumcised and in-observant of the Sabbath, He translated from this world;[fn-20-P2062_704259:31-nf] who did not first taste[fn-20-P2063_704320:32-nf] death, in order that, being a candidate for eternal life,[fn-20-P2064_704418:33-nf] he might by this time show us that we also may, without the burden of the law of Moses, please God.

For a skillful physician knows, indeed, professionally almost all diseases; but experimentally he is ignorant of a great number which he himself has never suffered from. As, therefore, there are two ways of knowing evil things,-one by mental insight, the other by sensible experience, for it is one thing to understand all vices by the wisdom of a cultivated mind, another to understand them by the foolishness of an abandoned life,-so also there are two ways of forgetting evils. For a well-instructed and learned man forgets them one way, and he who has experimentally suffered from them forgets them another,-the former by neglecting what he has learned, the latter by escaping what he has suffered. And in this latter way the saints shall forget their past ills, for they shall have so thoroughly escaped them all, that they shall be quite blotted out of their experience. But their intellectual knowledge, which shall be great, shall keep them acquainted not only with their own past woes, but with the eternal sufferings of the lost.

Certainly that city shall have no greater joy than the celebration of the grace of Christ, who redeemed us by His blood. There shall be accomplished the words of the psalm, \"Be still, and know that I am God.\"[fn-45-P4564_2528099:93-nf] There shall be the great Sabbath which has no evening, which God celebrated among His first works, as it is written, \"And God rested on the seventh day from all His works which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it He had rested from all His work which God began to make.\"[fn-45-P4565_2528438:94-nf] For we shall ourselves be the seventh day, when we shall be filled and replenished with God's blessing and sanctification. There shall we be still, and know that He is God; that He is that which we ourselves aspired to be when we fell away from Him, and listened to the voice of the seducer, \"Ye shall be as gods,\"[fn-45-P4566_2528773:95-nf] and so abandoned God, who would have made us as gods, not by deserting Him, but by participating in Him. For without Him what have we accomplished, save to perish in His anger? But when we are restored by Him, and perfected with greater grace, we shall have eternal leisure to see that He is God, for we shall be full of Him when He shall be all in all. For even our good works, when they are understood to be rather His than ours, are imputed to us that we may enjoy this Sabbath rest. For if we attribute them to ourselves, they shall be servile; for it is said of the Sabbath, \"Ye shall do no servile work in it.\"[fn-45-P4567_2529408:96-nf] Wherefore also it is said by Ezekiel the prophet, \"And I gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctify them.\"[fn-45-P4568_2529599:97-nf] This knowledge shall be perfected when we shall be perfectly at rest, and shall perfectly know that He is God.","title":"Book XXII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_12_book_viii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"ANF-05","text":" (The Docetae maintain) that God is the primal (Being), as it were a seed of a fig-tree, which is altogether very diminutive in size, but infinite in power. (This seed constitutes, according to the Docetae,) a lowly magnitude, incalculable in multitude,[fn-20-P2042_628418:6-nf] (and) labouring under no deficiency as regards generation. (This seed is) a refuge for the terror-stricken, a shelter of the naked, a veil for modesty, (and) the sought-for produce, to which He came in search (for fruit), he says, three times,[fn-20-P2043_629063:7-nf] and did not discover (any). Wherefore, he says, He cursed the fig-tree,[fn-20-P2044_629279:8-nf] because He did not find upon it that sweet fruit-the sought-for produce. And inasmuch as the Deity is, according to them to express myself briefly-of this description and so great, that is, small and minute, the world, as it seems to them, was made in some such manner as the following: When the branches of the fig-tree became tender, leaves budded (first), as one may (generally) see, and next in succession the fruit. Now, in this (fruit) is preserved treasured the infinite and incalculable seed of the fig-tree. We think, therefore, (say the Docetae,) that there are three (parts) which are primarily produced by the seed of the fig-tree, (viz.,) stem, which constitutes the fig-tree, leaves, and fruit-the fig itself, as we have previously declared. In this manner, the (Docetic) affirms, have been produced three Aeons, which are principles from the primal originating cause of the universe. And Moses has not been silent on this point, when he says, that there are three words of God, \"darkness, gloom, tempest, and added no more.\"[fn-20-P2045_630365:9-nf] For the (Docetic) says, God has made no addition to the three Aeons; but these, in every respect. have been sufficient for (the exigencies of) those who have been begotten and are sufficient. God Himself, however, remains with Himself, far separated froth the three Aeons. When each of these Aeons had obtained an originating cause of generation, he grew, as has been declared, by little and little, and (by degrees) was magnified, and (ultimately) became perfect. But they think that that is perfect which is reckoned at ten. When, therefore, the Aeons had become equal in number and in perfection, they were, as (the Docetae) are of opinion, constituted thirty Aeons in all, while each of them attains full perfection in a decade. And the three are mutually distinct, and hold one (degree of) honour relatively to one another, differing in position merely, because one of them is first, and the other second, and the other of these third. Position, however, afforded them diversity of power. For he who has obtained a position nearest to the primal Deity-who is, as it were, a seed-possessed a more productive power than the rest, inasmuch as he himself who is the immeasurable one, measured himself tenfold in bulk. He, however, who in position is second to the primal Deity, has, inasmuch as he is the incomprehensible one, comprehended himself sixfold. But he who is now third in position is conveyed to an infinite distance, in consequence of the dilatation of his brethren. (And when this third Aeon) had thrice realized himself in thought, he encircled himself with, as it were, some eternal chain of union.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"3.

Behold, then, I find both in the Gospels and in the (writings of the) apostles a visible and an invisible God (revealed to us), under a manifest and personal distinction in the condition of both. There is a certain emphatic saying by John: \"No man hath seen God at any time; \"[fn-105-P10594_2976311:172-nf] meaning, of course, at any previous time But he has indeed taken away all question of time, by saying that God had never been seen. The apostle confirms this statement; for, speaking of God, he says, \"Whom no man hath seen, nor can see; \"[fn-105-P10595_2976569:173-nf] because the man indeed would die who should see Him.[fn-105-P10596_2976644:174-nf] But the very same apostles testify that they had both seen and \"handled\" Christ.[fn-105-P10597_2976777:175-nf] Now, if Christ is Himself both the Father and the Son, how can He be both the Visible and the Invisible? In order, however, to reconcile this diversity between the Visible and the Invisible, will not some one on the other side argue that the two statements are quite correct: that He was visible indeed in the flesh, but was invisible before His appearance in the flesh; so that He who as the Father was invisible before the flesh, is the same as the Son who was visible in the flesh? If, however, He is the same who was invisible before the incarnation, how comes it that He was actually seen in ancient times before (coming in) the flesh? And by parity of reasoning, if He is the same who was visible after (coming in) the flesh, how happens it that He is now declared to be invisible by the apostles? How, I repeat, can all this be, unless it be that He is one, who anciently was visible only in mystery and enigma, and became more clearly visible by His incarnation, even the Word who was also made flesh; whilst He is another whom no man has seen at any time, being none else than the Father, even Him to whom the Word belongs? Let us, in short, examine who it is whom the apostles saw. \"That,\" says John, \"which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.\"[fn-105-P10598_2978120:176-nf] Now the Word of life became flesh, and was heard, and was seen, and was handled, because He was flesh who, before He came in the flesh, was the \"Word in the beginning with God\" the Father,[fn-105-P10599_2978329:177-nf] and not the Father with the Word. For although the Word was God, yet was He with God, because He is God of God; and being joined to the Father, is with the Father.[fn-106-P10600_2978514:178-nf] \"And we have seen His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father; \"[fn-106-P10601_2978630:179-nf] that is, of course, (the glory) of the Son, even Him who was visible, and was glorified by the invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the Word of God was God, in order that he might give no help to the presumption of the adversary, (which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself and in order to draw a distinction between the invisible Father and the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, ex abundanti as it were: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-106-P10602_2979142:180-nf] What God does he mean? The Word? But he has already said: \"Him we have seen and heard, and our hands have handled the Word of life.\" Well, (I must again ask, ) what God does he mean? It is of course the Father, with whom was the Word, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and has Himself declared Him.[fn-106-P10603_2979484:181-nf] He was both heard and seen and, that He might not be supposed to be a phantom, was actually handled. Him, too, did Paul behold; but yet he saw not the Father. \"Have I not,\" he says, \"seen Jesus Christ our Lord? \"[fn-106-P10604_2979716:182-nf] Moreover, he expressly called Christ God, saying: \"Of whom are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-106-P10605_2979902:183-nf] He shows us also that the Son of God, which is the Word of God, is visible, because He who became flesh was called Christ.

But when they turned themselves to make a calf, and had gone back in their minds to Egypt, desiring to be slaves instead of free-men, they were placed for the future in a state of servitude suited to their wish,-[a slavery] which did not indeed cut them off from God, but subjected them to the yoke of bondage; as Ezekiel the prophet, when stating the reasons for the giving of such a law, declares: \"And their eyes were after the desire of their heart; and I gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments in which they shall not live.\"[fn-82-P8244_2293288:173-nf] Luke also has recorded that Stephen, who was the first elected into the diaconate by the apostles,[fn-82-P8245_2293409:174-nf] and who was the first slain for the testimony of Christ, spoke regarding Moses as follows: \"This man did indeed receive the commandments of the living God to give to us, whom your fathers would not obey, but thrust [Him from them], and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; for we do not know what has happened to [this] Moses, who led us from the land of Egypt. And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifices to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their own hands. But God turned, and gave them up to worship the hosts of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets:[fn-82-P8246_2294152:175-nf] O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to Me sacrifices and oblations for forty years in the wilderness?

Enoch, too, pleasing God, without circumcision, discharged the office of God's legate to the angels although he was a man, and was translated, and is preserved until now as a witness of the just judgment of God, because the angels when they had transgressed fell to the earth for judgment, but the man who pleased [God] was translated for salvation.[fn-82-P8271_2301008:195-nf] Moreover, all the rest of the multitude of those righteous men who lived before Abraham, and of those patriarchs who preceded Moses, were justified independently of the things above mentioned, and without the law of Moses.

But readers, gifted with greater curiosity, are naturally inclined to probe into the question further. How, they ask, can justice be satisfied seven times? And what are the vengeances? Are they for seven sins committed? Or is the sin committed once and are there seven punishments for the one sin? Scripture continually assigns seven as the number of the remission of sins. \"How often,\" it is asked, \"shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?\" (It is Peter who is speaking to the Lord.) \"Till seven times?\" Then comes the Lord's answer, \"I say not unto thee, until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.\"[fn-58-P5856_1837625:5-nf] Our Lord did not vary the number, but multiplied the seven, and so fixed the limit of the forgiveness. After seven years the Hebrew used to be freed from slavery.[fn-58-P5857_1837811:6-nf] Seven weeks of years used in old times to make the famous jubilee,[fn-58-P5858_1837894:7-nf] in which the land rested, debts were remitted, slaves were set free, and, as it were, a new life began over again, the old life from age to age being in a sense completed at the number seven. These things are types of this present life, which revolves in seven days and passes by, wherein punishments of slighter sins are inflicted, according to the loving care of our good Lord, to save us from being delivered to punishment in the age that has no end. The expression seven times is therefore introduced because of its connexion with this present world for men who love this world ought specially to be punished in the things for the sake of which they have chosen to live wicked lives. If you understand the vengeances to be for the sins committed by Cain, you will find those sins to be seven. Or if you understand them to mean the sentence passed on him by the Judge, you will not go far wrong. To take the crimes of Cain: the first sin is envy at the preference of Abel; the second is guile, whereby he said to his brother, \"Let us go into the field:\"[fn-58-P5859_1838968:8-nf] the third is murder, a further wickedness: the fourth, fratricide, a still greater iniquity: the fifth that he committed the first murder, and set a bad example to mankind: the sixth wrong in that he grieved his parents: the seventh, his lie to God; for when he was asked, \"Where is Abel thy brother?\" he replied, \"I know not.\"[fn-58-P5860_1839311:9-nf] Seven sins were therefore avenged in the destruction of Cain. For when the Lord said, \"Cursed is the earth which has opened to receive the blood of thy brother,\" and \"groaning and trembling shall there be on the earth,\" Cain said, \"If thou castest me out to-day from the earth, then from thy face shall I be hid, and groaning and trembling shall I lie upon the earth, and every one that findeth me shall slay me.\" It is in answer to this that the Lord says, \"Whosoever slayeth Cain will discharge seven vengeances.\"[fn-58-P5861_1839843:10-nf] Cain supposed that he would be an easy prey to every one, because of there being no safety for him in the earth (for the earth was cursed for his sake), and of his being deprived of the succour of God, Who was angry with him for the murder, and so of there being no help for him either from earth or from heaven. Therefore he said, \"It shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me.\" Scripture proves his error in the words, \"Not so;\" i.e. thou shall not be slain. For to men suffering punishment, death is a gain, because it brings relief from their pain. But thy life shall be prolonged, that thy punishment may be made commensurate with thy sins. Since then the word e0kdikou/menon may be understood in two senses; both the sin for which vengeance was taken, and the manner of the punishment, let us now examine whether the criminal suffered a sevenfold torment.","title":"Letter CCLX.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":5,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_64_letter_xlvi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"1.
