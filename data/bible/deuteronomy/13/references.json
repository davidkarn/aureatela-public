Envy always follows in the track of virtue: as Horace says, it is ever the mountain top that is smitten by the lightning.[fn-40-P4034_1086476:2891-nf] It is not surprising that I declare this of men and women, when the jealousy of the Pharisees succeeded in crucifying our Lord Himself. All the saints have had illwishers, and even Paradise was not free from the serpent through whose malice death came into the world.[fn-40-P4035_1086835:2892-nf] So the Lord stirred up against Paula Hadad the Edomite[fn-40-P4036_1086914:2893-nf] to buffet her that she might not be exalted, and warned her frequently by the thorn in her flesh[fn-40-P4037_1087057:2894-nf] not to be elated by the greatness of her own virtues or to fancy that, compared with other women, she had attained the summit of perfection. For my part I used to say that it was best to give in to rancour and to retire before passion. So Jacob dealt with his brother Esau; so David met the unrelenting persecution of Saul. I reminded her how the first of these fled into Mesopotamia;[fn-40-P4038_1087467:2895-nf] and how the second surrendered himself to the Philistines,[fn-40-P4039_1087548:2896-nf] and chose to submit to foreign foes rather than to enemies at home. She however replied as follows:- 'Your suggestion would be a wise one if the devil did not everywhere fight against God's servants and handmaidens, and did he not always precede the fugitives to their chosen refuges. Moreover, I am deterred from accepting it by my love for the holy places; and I cannot find another Bethlehem elsewhere. Why may I not by my patience conquer this ill will? Why may I not by my humility break down this pride, and when I am smitten on the one cheek offer to the smiter the other?[fn-40-P4040_1088151:2897-nf] Surely the apostle Paul says \"Overcome evil with good.\"[fn-40-P4041_1088242:2898-nf] Did not the apostles glory when they suffered reproach for the Lord's sake? Did not even the Saviour humble Himself, taking the form of a servant and being made obedient to the Father unto death, even the death of the cross,[fn-40-P4042_1088492:2899-nf] that He might save us by His passion? If Job had not fought the battle and won the victory, he would never have received the crown of righteousness, or have heard the Lord say: \"Thinkest thou that I have spoken unto thee for aught else than this, that thou mightest appear righteous.\"[fn-40-P4043_1088799:2900-nf] In the gospel those only are said to be blessed who suffer persecution for righteousness' sake.[fn-40-P4044_1088962:2901-nf] My conscience is at rest, and I know that it is not from any fault of mine that I am suffering; moreover affliction in this world is a ground for expecting a reward hereafter.' When the enemy was more than usually forward and ventured to reproach her to her face, she used to chant the words of the psalter: \"While the wicked was before me, I was dumb with silence; I held my peace even from good:\"[fn-40-P4045_1089387:2902-nf] and again, \"I as a deaf man heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth:\"[fn-40-P4046_1089505:2903-nf] and \"I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.\"[fn-40-P4047_1089604:2904-nf] When she felt herself tempted, she dwelt upon the words in Deuteronomy: \"The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.\"[fn-40-P4048_1089828:2905-nf] In tribulations and afflictions she turned to the splendid language of Isaiah: \"Ye that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts, look for tribulation upon tribulation, for hope also upon hope: yet a little while must these things be by reason of the malice of the lips and by reason of a spiteful tongue.\" This passage of scripture she explained for her own consolation as meaning that the weaned, that is, those who have come to full age, must endure tribulation upon tribulation that they may be accounted worthy to receive hope upon hope. She recalled to mind also the words of the apostle, \"we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope: and hope maketh not ashamed\"[fn-40-P4049_1090606:2906-nf] and \"though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day\":[fn-40-P4050_1090709:2907-nf] and \"our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh in us[fn-40-P4051_1090790:2908-nf] an eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal.[fn-40-P4052_1091033:2909-nf] She used to say that, although to human impatience the time might seem slow in coming, yet that it would not be long but that presently help would come from God who says: \"In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee.\"[fn-40-P4053_1091316:2910-nf] We ought not, she declared, to dread the deceitful lips and tongues of the wicked, for we rejoice in the aid of the Lord who warns us by His prophet: \"fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings; for the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool\":[fn-40-P4054_1091661:2911-nf] and she quoted His own words, \"In your patience ye shall win your souls\":[fn-40-P4055_1091763:2912-nf] as well as those of the apostle, \"the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed? us\":[fn-40-P4056_1091932:2913-nf] and in another place, \"we are to suffer affliction\"[fn-40-P4057_1092012:2914-nf] that we may be patient in all things that befall us, for \"he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.\"[fn-40-P4058_1092194:2915-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":13,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1152","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3.

And the heretics who are opposed to the Old Testament, not understanding this, think that the brand of ignorance, as it were, is to be placed upon Him of whom it is said, \"The Lord your God tempteth you:\" as if in the Gospel it were not written of the Lord, \"And this He said to tempt (prove) him, for He Himself knew what He would do.\"[fn-7-P707_266499:72-nf] For if He knew the heart of him whom He was tempting, what is it that He wished to see by tempting him?

Not that I have found any division among you do I write these things; but I arm you beforehand, as the children of God. For as many as are of Christ are also with the bishop; but as many as fall away from him, and embrace communion with the accursed, these shall be cut off along with them. For they are not Christ's husbandry, but the seed of the enemy, from whom may you ever be delivered by the prayers of the shepherd, that most faithful and gentle shepherd who presides over you.

Brethren, be not deceived. If any man follows him that separates from the truth, he shall not inherit the kingdom of God; and if any man does not stand aloof from the preacher of falsehood, he shall be condemned to hell. For it is obligatory neither to separate from the godly, nor to associate with the ungodly.

Righteous men have ever possessed this endurance. The apostles maintained this discipline from the law of the Lord, not to murmur in adversity, but to accept bravely and patiently whatever things happen in the world; since the people of the Jews in this matter always offended, that they constantly murmured against God, as the Lord God bears witness in the book of Numbers, saying, \"Let their murmuring cease from me, and they shall not die.\"[fn-74-P7430_2466851:25-nf] We must not murmur in adversity, beloved brethren, but we must bear with patience and courage whatever happens, since it is written, \"The sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a contrite and humbled heart God does not despise; \"[fn-74-P7431_2467099:26-nf] since also in Deuteronomy the Holy Spirit warns by Moses. and says, \"The Lord thy God will vex thee, and will bring hunger upon thee; and it shall be known in thine heart if thou hast well kept His commandments or no.\"[fn-74-P7432_2467335:27-nf] And again: \"The Lord your God proveth you, that He may know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.\"[fn-74-P7433_2467496:28-nf] ","title":"Treatise VII.

Another question which it is also usual to put is this: How comes it that Matthew and Luke have stated that the Lord said to His disciples that they were not to take a staff with them, whereas Mark puts the matter in this way: \"And He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only;\"[fn-17-P1788_731464:313-nf] and proceeds further in this strain, \"no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:\" thereby making it quite evident that his narrative belongs to the same place and circumstances with which the narratives of those others deal who have mentioned that the staff was not to be taken? Now this question admits of being solved on the principle of understanding that the staff which, according to Mark, was to be taken, bears one sense, and that the staff which,according to Matthew and Luke, was not to be taken with them, is to be interpreted in a different sense; just in the same way as we find the term \"temptation\" used in one meaning, when it is said, \"God tempteth no man,\"[fn-17-P1789_732347:314-nf] and in a different meaning where it is said, \"The Lord your God tempteth [proveth] you, to know whether ye love Him.\"[fn-17-P1790_732484:315-nf] For in the former case the temptation of seduction is intended; but in the latter the temptation of probation. Another parallel occurs in the case of the term \"judgment,\" which must be taken in one way, where it is said, \"They that have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment;\"[fn-17-P1791_732849:316-nf] and in another way, where it is said, \"Judge me, O God, and discern[fn-17-P1792_732945:317-nf] my cause, in respect of an ungodly nation.\"[fn-17-P1793_733006:318-nf] For the former refers to the judgment of damnation, and the latter to the judgment of discrimination.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"5. Or shall we take another favorite passage of yours:\" They shall see their life hanging, and shall not believe their life?\"[fn-16-P1662_924115:3-nf] You insert the words \"on a tree,\" which are not in the original. Nothing can be easier than to show that this has no reference to Christ. Moses is uttering dire threatenings in case the people should depart from his law, and says among other things that they would be taken captive by their enemies, and would be expecting death day and night, having no confidence in the life allowed them by their conquerors, so that their life would hang in uncertainty from fear of impending danger. This passage will not do, we must try others. I cannot admit that the words, \"Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,\" refer to Christ, or when it is said that the prince or prophet must be killed who should try to turn away the people from their God, or should break any of the commandments.[fn-16-P1663_924921:4-nf] That Christ did this I am obliged to grant. But if you assert that these things were written of Christ, it may be asked in reply, What spirit dictated these prophecies in which Moses curses Christ and orders him to be killed? If he had the Spirit of God, these things are not written of Christ; if they are written of Christ, he had not the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God would not curse Christ, or order Him to be killed. To vindicate Moses, you must confess that these passages too have no reference to Christ. So, if you have no others to show, there are none. If there are none, Christ could not have said that there were; and if Christ did not say so, that verse is spurious.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_121_treatise_xi_exhortation_to_martyrdom_addressed_to_fortunatus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Deuteronomy: \"But if thy brother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or thy wife which is in thy bosom, or thy friend which is the fellow of thine own soul, should ask thee secretly, saying, Let us go anti serve other gods, the gods of the nations, thou shalt not consent unto him, and thou shalt not hearken unto him, neither shall thine eye spare him, neither shalt thou conceal him, declaring thou shalt declare concerning him.

But if before the coming of Christ these precepts concerning the worship of God and the despising of idols were observed, how much more should they be regarded since Christ's advent; since He, when He came, not only exhorted us with words, but with deeds also, but after all wrongs and contumelies, suffered also, and was crucified, that He might teach us to suffer and to die by His example, that there might be no excuse for a man not to suffer for Him,[fn-78-P7803_2619552:36-nf] since He suffered for us; and that since He suffered for the sins of others, much rather ought each to suffer for his own sins. And therefore in the Gospel He threatens, and says: \"Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father which is in heaven; but whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-78-P7804_2619974:37-nf] The Apostle Paul also says: \"For if we die with Him, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us.\"[fn-78-P7805_2620161:38-nf] John too: \"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father; he that acknowledgeth the Son, hath both the Son and the Father.\"[fn-78-P7806_2620319:39-nf] Whence the Lord exhorts and strengthens us to contempt of death, saying: \"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him which is able to kill soul and body in Gehenna.\"[fn-78-P7807_2620553:40-nf] And again: \"He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he who hateth his life in this world, shall keep it unto life eternal.\"[fn-78-P7808_2620698:41-nf] ","title":"Treatise XI.

Hence it came to pass, that this Origen, such and so great as he was, wantonly abusing the grace of God, rashly following the bent of his own genius, and placing overmuch confidence in himself, making light account of the ancient simplicity of the Christian religion, presuming that he knew more than all the world besides, de- spising the traditions of the Church and the determinations of the ancients, and interpreting certain passages of Scripture in a novel way, deserved for himself the warning given to the Church of God, as applicable in his case as in that of others, \"If there arise a prophet in the midst of thee,\" ... \"thou shalt not hearken to the words of that prophet,\" ... \"because the Lord your God doth make trial of you, whether you love Him or not.\"[fn-16-P1627_714248:67-nf] Truly, thus of a sudden to seduce the Church which was devoted to him, and hung upon him through admiration of his genius, his learning, his eloquence, his manner of life and influence, while she had no fear, no suspicion for herself,-thus, I say, to seduce the Church, slowly and little by little, from the old religion to a new profaneness, was not only a trial, but a great trial.[fn-16-P1628_714658:68-nf] ","title":"Introduction.","author":"Vincent of Lerins"},{"chapter":13,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_24_sermon_vii_lvii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"9. \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\"[fn-33-P3369_1479811:14-nf] Will this again be necessary in the life to come? \"Lead us not into temptation,\" will not be said, except where there can be temptation. We read in the book of holy Job, \"Is not the life of man upon earth a temptation?\"[fn-33-P3370_1480050:15-nf] What then do we pray for? Hear what. The Apostle James saith, \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.\"[fn-33-P3371_1480208:16-nf] He spoke of those evil temptations, whereby men are deceived, and brought under the yoke of the devil. This is the kind of temptation he spoke of. For there is another sort of temptation which is called a proving; of this kind of temptation it is written, \"The Lord your God tempteth (proveth) you to know whether ye love Him.\"[fn-33-P3372_1480553:17-nf] What means \"to know\"? \"To make you know,\" for He knoweth already. With that kind of temptation, whereby we are deceived and seduced, God tempteth no man. But undoubtedly in His deep and hidden judgment He abandons some. And when He hath abandoned them, the tempter finds his opportunity. For he finds in him no resistance against his power, but forthwith presents himself to him as his possessor, if God abandon him. Therefore that He may not abandon us, do we say, \"Lead us not into temptation.\" \"For every one is tempted,\" says the same Apostle James, \"when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed. Then lust, when it hath conceived, bringeth forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.\"[fn-33-P3373_1481288:18-nf] What then has he hereby taught us? To fight against our lusts. For ye are about to put away your sins in Holy Baptism; but lusts will still remain, wherewith ye must fight after that ye are regenerate. For a conflict with your own selves still remains. Let no enemy from without be feared: conquer thine own self, and the whole world is conquered. What can any tempter from without, whether the devil or the devil's minister, do against thee? Whosoever sets the hope of gain before thee to seduce thee, let him only find no covetousness in thee; and what can he who would tempt thee by gain effect? Whereas if covetousness be found in thee, thou takest fire at the sight of gain, and art taken by the bait of this corrupt food.[fn-33-P3374_1482037:19-nf] But if he find no covetousness in thee, the trap remains spread in vain. Or should the tempter set before thee some woman of surpassing beauty; if chastity be within, iniquity from without is overcome. Therefore that he may not take thee with the bait of a strange woman's beauty, fight with thine own lust within; thou hast no sensible perception of thine enemy, but of thine own concupiscence thou hast. Thou dost not see the devil, but the object that engageth thee thou dost see. Get the mastery then over that of which thou art sensible within. Fight valiantly, for He who hath regenerated thee is thy Judge; He hath arranged the lists, He is making ready the crown. But because thou wilt without doubt be conquered, if thou have not Him to aid thee, if He abandon thee: therefore dost thou say in the prayer, \"Lead us not into temptation.\" The Judge's wrath hath given over some to their own lusts; and the Apostle says, \"God gave them over to the lusts of their hearts.\"[fn-33-P3375_1483043:20-nf] How did He give them up?

The (question of the)divine warrant goes first-whether God has willed and also commanded ought of the kind, so that they who assert that it is not good are not plied with arguments for thinking it profitable save when they have been subdued.[fn-109-P10979_3086835:14-nf] It is proper that heretics be driven[fn-109-P10980_3086934:15-nf] to duty, not enticed. Obstinacy must be conquered, not coaxed. And, certainly, that will be pronounced beforehand quite good enough, which will be shown to have been instituted and also enjoined by God. Let the Gospels wait a little, while I set forth their root the Law, while I ascertain the will of God from those writings from which I recall to mind Himself also: \"I am,\" says He, \"God, thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.

Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve Him only, and cleave to Him, and swear by His name. Ye shall not go after strange gods, and the gods of the nations which are round about you, because the Lord thy God is also a jealous God among you, and lest His anger should be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.\"[fn-109-P10984_3088609:19-nf] But setting before them blessings and curses, He also says: \"Blessings shall be yours, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, whatsoever I command you this day, and do not wander from the way which I have commanded you, to go and serve other gods whom ye know not.\"[fn-109-P10985_3088905:20-nf] And as to rooting them out in every way: \"Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations, which ye shall possess by inheritance, served their gods, upon mountains and hills, and under shady trees. Ye shall overthrow all their altars, ye shall overturn and break in pieces their pillars, and cut down their groves, and burn with fire the graven images of the gods themselves, and destroy the names of them out of that place.\"[fn-109-P10986_3089362:21-nf] He further urges, when they (the Israelites) had entered the land of promise, and driven out its nations: \"Take heed to thy self, that thou do not follow them after they be driven out from before thee, that thou do not inquire after their gods, saying, As the nations serve their gods, so let me do likewise.\"[fn-109-P10987_3089694:22-nf] But also says He: \"If there arise among you a prophet himself, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and it come to pass, and he say, Let us go and serve other gods, whom ye know not, do not hearken to the words of that prophet or dreamer, for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye fear God with all your heart and with all your soul. After the Lord your God ye shall go, and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and obey His voice, and serve Him, and cleave unto Him.

For he says, \"Walk after the Lord your God, and keep His commandments.\"[fn-76-P7650_2308557:174-nf] And I reckon all the virtuous, servants and followers of God. Hence the Stoics say that the end of philosophy is to live agreeable to nature; and Plato, likeness to God, as we have shown in the second Miscellany. And Zeno the Stoic, borrowing from Plato, and he from the Barbarian philosophy, says that all the good are friends of one another. For Socrates says in the Phaedrus, \"that it has not been ordained that the bad should be a friend to the bad, nor the good be not a friend to the good; \"as also he showed sufficiently in the Lysis, that friendship is never preserved in wickedness and vice. And the Athenian stranger similarly says, \"that there is conduct pleasing and conformable to God, based on one ancient ground-principle, That like loves like, provided it be within measure. But things beyond measure are congenial neither to what is within nor what is beyond measure. Now it is the case that God is the measure to us of all things.\" Then proceeding, Plato[fn-76-P7651_2309553:175-nf] adds: \"For every good man is like every other good man; and so being like to God, he is liked by every good man and by God.\" At this point I have just recollected the following. In the end of the Timaeus he says: \"You must necessarily assimilate that which perceives to that which is perceived, according to its original nature; and it is by so assimilating it that you attain to the end of the highest life proposed by the gods to men,[fn-76-P7652_2310042:176-nf] for the present or the future time.\" For those have equal power with these. He, who seeks, will not stop till he find; and having found, he will wonder; and wondering, he will reign; and reigning, he will rest. And what? Were not also those expressions of Thales derived from these? The fact that God is glorified for ever, and that He is expressly called by us the Searcher of hearts, he interprets. For Thales being asked, What is the divinity? said, What has neither beginning nor end.

For if he had advanced against his foe, not with his own strength, but solely with the protection of God's grace; and, supported only by Divine aid without any virtue of patience on his own part, had borne that manifold weight of temptations and losses, contrived with all the cruelty of his foe, how would the devil have repeated with some justice that slanderous speech which he had previously uttered: \"Doth Job serve God for nought? Hast Thou not hedged him in, and all his substance round about? but take away thine hand,\" i.e., allow him to fight with me in his own strength, \"and he will curse Thee to Thy face.\"[fn-53-P5387_1927061:90-nf] But as after the struggle the slanderous foe dare not give vent to any such murmur as this, he admired that he was vanquished by his strength and not by that of God; although too we must not hold that the grace of God was altogether wanting to him, which gave to the tempter a power of tempting in proportion to that which it knew that he had of resisting, without protecting him from his attacks in such a way as to leave no room for human virtue, but only providing for this; viz., that the most fierce foe should not drive him out of his mind and overwhelm him when weakened, with unequal thoughts and in an unfair contest. But that the Lord is sometimes wont to tempt our faith that it maybe made stronger and more glorious, we are taught by the example of the centurion in the gospel, in whose case though the Lord knew that He would cure his servant by the power of His word, yet He chose to offer His bodily presence, saying: \"I will come and heal him:\" but when the centurion overcame this offer of His by the ardour of still more fervent faith, and said: \"Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed,\" the Lord marvelled at him and praised him, and put him before all those of the people of Israel who had believed, saying: \"Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith in Israel.\"[fn-53-P5388_1928454:91-nf] For there would have been no ground for praise or merit, if Christ had only preferred in him what He Himself had given. And this searching trial of faith we read that the Divine righteousness brought about also in the case of the grandest of the patriarchs; where it is said: \"And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham.\"[fn-53-P5389_1928825:92-nf] For the Divine righteousness wished to try not that faith with which the Lord had inspired him, but that which when called and enlightened by the Lord he could show forth by his own free will. Wherefore the firmness of his faith was not without reason proved, and when the grace of God, which had for a while left him to prove him, came to his aid, it was said: \"Lay not thine hand on the lad, and do nothing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest the Lord, and for my sake hast not spared thy beloved son.\"[fn-53-P5390_1929356:93-nf] And that this kind of temptation can befall us, for the sake of proving us, is sufficiently clearly foretold by the giver of the Law in Deuteronomy: \"If there rise in the midst of you a prophet or one that saith he hath seen a dream, and foretell a sign and wonder; and that come to pass which he spoke, and he say to thee: Let us go and serve strange gods which ye know not, thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet or dreamer; for the Lord your God surely trieth thee, whether thou lovest Him with all thine heart, and keepest His Commandments, or no.\"[fn-53-P5391_1929934:94-nf] What then follows? When God has permitted that prophet or dreamer to arise, must we hold that He will protect those whose faith He is purposing to try, in such a way as to leave no place for their own free will, where they can fight with the tempter with their own strength? And why is it necessary for them even to be tried if He knows them to be so weak and feeble as not to be able by their own power to resist the tempter? But certainly the Divine righteousness would not have permitted them to be tempted, unless it knew that there was within them an equal power of resistance, by which they could by an equitable judgment be found in either result either guilty or worthy of praise. To the same effect also is this which the Apostle says: \"Therefore let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall. There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man. But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the temptation make also a way of escape that ye may be able to bear it.\"[fn-53-P5392_1931007:95-nf] For when he says \"Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall\" he sets free will on its guard, as he certainly knew that, after grace had been received, it could either stand by its exertions or fall through carelessness. But when he adds: \"there hath no temptation taken you but what is common to man\" he chides their weakness and the frailty of their heart that is not yet strengthened, as they could not yet resist the attacks of the hosts of spiritual wickedness, against which he knew that he and those who were perfect daily fought; of which also he says to the Ephesians: \"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places.\"[fn-53-P5393_1931792:96-nf] But when he subjoins: \"But God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able,\" he certainly is not hoping that the Lord will not suffer them to be tempted, but that they may not be tempted above what they are able to bear. For the one shows the power of man's will, the other denotes the grace of the Lord who moderates the violence of temptations. In all these phrases then there is proof that Divine grace ever stirs up the will of man, not so as to protect and defend it in all things in such a way as to cause it not to fight by its own efforts against its spiritual adversaries, the victor over whom may set it down to God's grace, and the vanquished to his own weakness, and thus learn that his hope is always not in his own courage but in the Divine assistance, and that he must ever fly to his Protector. And to prove this not by our own conjecture but by still clearer passages of Holy Scripture let us consider what we read in Joshuah the son of Nun: \"The Lord,\" it says, \"left these nations and would not destroy them, that by them He might try Israel, whether they would keep the commandments of the Lord their God, and that they might learn to fight with their enemies.\"[fn-53-P5394_1933022:97-nf] And if we may illustrate the incomparable mercy of our Creator from something earthly, not as being equal in kindness, but as an illustration of mercy: if a tender and anxious nurse carries an infant in her bosom for a long time in order sometime to teach it to walk, and first allows it to crawl, then supports it that by the aid of her right hand it may lean on its alternate steps, presently leaves it for a little and if she sees it tottering at all, catches hold of it, and grabs at it when falling, when down picks it up, and either shields it from a fall, or allows it to fall lightly, and sets it up again after a tumble, but when she has brought it up to boyhood or the strength of youth or early manhood, lays upon it some burdens or labours by which it may be not overwhelmed but exercised, and allows it to vie with those of its own age; how much more does the heavenly Father of all know whom to carry in the bosom of His grace, whom to train to virtue in His sight by the exercise of free will, and yet He helps him in his efforts, hears him when he calls, leaves him not when he seeks Him, and sometimes snatches him from peril even without his knowing it.","title":"XIII.

The previous order of our discourse had brought us to the exposition of the system of spiritual gifts, which we have learnt from the tradition of the Elders is a threefold one. The first indeed is for the sake of healing, when the grace of signs accompanies certain elect and righteous men on account of the merits of their holiness, as it is clear that the apostles and many of the saints wrought signs and wonders in accordance with the authority of the Lord Who says: \"Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.\"[fn-55-P5597_1999267:1-nf] The second when for the edification of the church or on account of the faith of those who bring their sick, or of those whoare to be cured, the virtue of health proceeds even from sinners and men unworthy of it. Of whom the Saviour says in the gospel: \"Many shall say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name, and in Thy name cast out devils, and in Thy name done many mighty works? And then I will confess to them, I never knew you: Depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity.\"[fn-55-P5598_1999785:2-nf] And on the other hand, if the faith of those who bring them or of the sick is wanting, it prevents those onwhom the gifts of healing are conferred from exercising their powers of healing. On which subject Luke the Evangelist says: \"And Jesus could not there do any mighty work because of their unbelief.\"[fn-55-P5599_2000115:3-nf] Whence also the Lord Himself says:\"Many lepers were in Israel in the days of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.\"[fn-56-P5600_2000287:4-nf] The third method of healing is copied by the deceit and contrivance of devils, that, when a man who is enslaved to evident sins is out of admiration for his miracles regarded as a saint and a servant of God, men may be persuaded to copy his sins and thus an opening being made for cavilling, the sanctity of religion may be brought into disgrace, or else that he, who believes that he possesses the gift of healing, may be puffed up by pride of heart and so fall more grievously. Hence it is that invoking the names of those, who, as they know, have no merits of holiness or any spiritual fruits, they pretend that by their merits they are disturbed and made to flee from the bodies they have possessed. Of which it says in Deuteronomy: \"If there rise up in the midst of thee a prophet, or one who says that he has seen a dream, and declare a sign and a wonder, and that which he hath spoken cometh to pass, and he say to thee: Let us go and follow after other gods whom thou knowest not, and let us serve them: thou shalt not hear the words of that prophet or of that dreamer, for the Lord thy God is tempting thee that it may appear whether thou lovest Him or not, with all thy heart and with all thy soul.\"[fn-56-P5601_2001517:5-nf] And in the gospel it says: \"There shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall give great signs and wonders, so that, if it were possible, even the elect should be led astray.\"[fn-56-P5602_2001725:6-nf] ","title":"XV.

For the Son says, `I and the Father are One,' and, `I in the Father, and the Father in Me;' but things originate, when they make advance, are attached unto the Lord. The Word then is in the Father as being His own; but things originate, being external, are attached, as being by nature foreign, and attached by free choice.
