{"verses":["And when thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God will\ngive thee to possess, and hast conquered it, and dwellest in it:","Thou shalt take the first of all thy fruits, and put them in a\nbasket, and shalt go to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose,\nthat his name may be invocated there:","And thou shalt go to the priest that shall be in those days, and\nsay to him:  I profess this day before the Lord thy God, that I am come\ninto the land, for which he swore to our fathers, that he would give it\nus.","And the priest taking the basket at thy hand, shall set it before\nthe altar of the Lord thy God:","And thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the Lord thy God:  The\nSyrian pursued my father, who went down into Egypt, and sojourned there\nin a very small number, and grew into a nation great and strong and of\nan infinite multitude.","And the Egyptians afflicted us, and persecuted us, laying on us\nmost grievous burdens:","And we cried to the Lord God of our fathers:  who heard us, and\nlooked down upon our affliction, and labour, and distress:","And brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand, and a stretched\nout arm, with great terror, with signs and wonders:","And brought us into this place, and gave us this land flowing\nwith milk and honey.","And therefore now I offer the firstfruits of the land which the\nLord hath given me.  And thou shalt leave them in the sight of the Lord\nthy God, adoring the Lord thy God.","And thou shalt feast in all the good things which the Lord thy\nGod hath given thee, and thy house, thou and the Levite, and the\nstranger that is with thee.","When thou hast made an end of tithing all thy fruits, in the\nthird year of tithes thou shalt give it to the Levite, and to the\nstranger, and to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat\nwithin thy gates, and be filled:","And thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the Lord thy God:  I\nhave taken that which was sanctified out of my house, and I have given\nit to the Levite, and to the stranger, and to the fatherless, and to\nthe widow, as thou hast commanded me:  I have not transgressed thy\ncommandments nor forgotten thy precepts.","I have not eaten of them in my mourning, nor separated them for\nany uncleanness, nor spent any thing of them in funerals.  I have obeyed\nthe voice of the Lord my God, and have done all things as thou hast\ncommanded me.","Look from thy sanctuary, and thy high habitation of heaven, and\nbless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou\ndidst swear to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.","This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these\ncommandments and judgments:  and to keep and fulfil them with all thy\nheart, and with all thy soul.","Thou hast chosen the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in\nhis ways and keep his ceremonies, and precepts, and judgments, and obey\nhis command.","And the Lord hath chosen thee this day, to be his peculiar\npeople, as he hath spoken to thee, and to keep all his commandments:","And to make thee higher than all nations which he hath created,\nto his own praise, and name, and glory:  that thou mayst be a holy\npeople of the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken."]}
