But the continual lamentations of my mother hindered me from granting him the favor, or rather from receiving this boon at his hands. For when she perceived that I was meditating this step, she took me into her own private chamber, and, sitting near me on the bed where she had given birth to me, she shed torrents of tears, to which she added words yet more pitiable than her weeping, in the following lamentable strain: My child, it was not the will of Heaven that I should long enjoy the benefit of thy father's virtue. For his death soon followed the pangs which I endured at thy birth, leaving thee an orphan and me a widow before my time to face all the horrors of widowhood, which only those who have experienced them can fairly understand. For no words are adequate to describe the tempest-tossed condition of a young woman who, having but lately left her paternal home, and being inexperienced in business, is suddenly racked by an overwhelming sorrow, and compelled to support a load of care too great for her age and sex. For she has to correct the laziness of servants, and to be on the watch for their rogueries, to repel the designs of relations, to bear bravely the threats of those who collect the public taxes,[fn-2-P279_83863:3-nf] and harshness in the imposition of rates. And if the departed one should have left a child, even if it be a girl, great anxiety will be caused to the mother, although free from much expense and fear: but a boy fills her with ten thousand alarms and many anxieties every day, to say nothing of the great expense which one is compelled to incur if she wishes to bring him up in a liberal way. None of these things, however, induced me to enter into a second marriage, or introduce a second husband into thy father's house: but I held on as I was, in the midst of the storm and uproar, and did not shun the iron furnace[fn-2-P280_84617:4-nf] of widowhood. My foremost help indeed was the grace from above; but it was no small consolation to me under those terrible trials to look continually on thy face and to preserve in thee a living image of him who had gone, an image indeed which was a fairly exact likeness.","title":"Book I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"\"For into one Spirit,\"[fn-14-P1457_355634:247-nf] it says, \"we were. all baptized in[fn-14-P1458_355894:248-nf] one body.\" And in harmony with this are the passages: \"You shaft be baptized with the Holy Ghost,\"[fn-14-P1459_356005:249-nf] and \"He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-14-P1460_356092:250-nf] But no one on this account would be justified in calling that baptism a perfect baptism wherein only the name of the Spirit was invoked.

He who redeemed our life from destruction[fn-14-P1461_356386:251-nf] gave us power of renewal, whereof the cause is ineffable and hidden in mystery, but bringing great salvation to our souls, so that to add or to take away anything[fn-14-P1462_356570:252-nf] involves manifestly a falling away from the life everlasting.

And not only Paul, but generally all those to whom is committed any ministry of the word, never cease from testifying, but call heaven and earth to witness on the ground that now every deed that is done is done within them, and that in the examination of all the actions of life they will be present with the judged. So it is said, \"He shall call to tile heavens above and to earth, that he may judge his people.\"[fn-14-P1473_360194:258-nf] And so Moses when about to deliver his oracles to the people says, \"I call heaven and earth to witness this day;\"[fn-14-P1474_360328:259-nf] and again in his song he says, \"Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak, and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth;\"[fn-14-P1475_360462:260-nf] and Isaiah, \"Hear, O heavens. and give ear, O earth;\"[fn-14-P1476_360537:261-nf] and Jeremiah describes astonishment in heaven at the tidings of the unholy deeds of the people: \"The heaven was astonished at this, and was horribly afraid, because my people committed two evils.\"[fn-14-P1477_360757:262-nf] And so the apostle, knowing the angels to be set over men astutors and guardians, calls them to witness. Moreover, Joshua, the son of Nun, even set up a stone as witness of his words (already a heap somewhere had been called a witness by Jacob),[fn-14-P1478_361021:263-nf] for he says, \"Behold this stone shall be a witness unto you this day to the end of days, when ye lie to tile Lord our God,\"[fn-14-P1479_361174:264-nf] perhaps believing that by God's power even the stones would speak to the conviction of the transgressors; or, if not, that at least each man's conscience would be wounded by the force of the reminder. In this manner they who have been entrusted with the stewardship of souls provide witnesses, whatever they may be, so as to produce them at some future day.

Nor did their calculation fail them; and it came to pass even as they foretold.

It is not, however, situated near to his rising in summer or in winter, but where the sun pours the day from his vernal chariot. There a plain spreads its open tracts; nor does any mound rise, nor hollow valley open[fn-42-P4212_1682869:3-nf] itself. But through twice six ells that place rises above the mountains, whose tops are thought to be lofty among us. Here is the grove of the sun; a wood stands planted with many a tree, blooming with the honour of perpetual foliage. When the pole had blazed with the fires of Phaethon, that place was uninjured by the flames; and when the deluge had immersed the world in waves, it rose above the waters of Deucalion. No enfeebling diseases, no sickly old age, nor cruel death, nor harsh fear, approaches hither, nor dreadful crime, nor mad desire of riches, nor Mars, nor fury, burning with the love of slaughter.[fn-42-P4213_1683495:4-nf] Bitter grief is absent, and want clothed in rags, and sleepless cares, and violent hunger. No tempest rages there, nor dreadful violence of the wind; nor does the hoar-frost cover the earth with cold dew. No cloud extends its fleecy[fn-42-P4214_1683786:5-nf] covering above the plains, nor does the turbid moisture of water fall from on high; but there is a fountain in the middle, which they call by the name of \"living; \"[fn-42-P4215_1684054:6-nf] it is clear, gentle, and abounding with sweet waters, which, bursting forth once during the space of each[fn-42-P4216_1684170:7-nf] month, twelve times irrigates all the grove with waters. Here a species of tree, rising with lofty stem, bears mellow fruits not about to fall on the ground. This grove, these woods, a single[fn-42-P4217_1684393:8-nf] bird, the phoenix, inhabits,-single, but it lives reproduced by its own death. It obeys and submits[fn-42-P4218_1684610:9-nf] to Phoebus, a remarkable attendant. Its parent nature has given it to possess this office. When at its first rising the saffron morn grows red, when it puts to flight the stars with its rosy light, thrice and four times she plunges her body into the sacred waves, thrice and four times she sips water from the living stream.[fn-42-P4219_1685067:10-nf] She is raised aloft, and takes her seat on the highest top of the lofty tree, which alone looks down upon the whole grove; and turning herself to the fresh risings of the nascent Phoebus, she awaits his rays and rising beam. And when the sun has thrown back the threshold of the shining gate, and the light gleam[fn-42-P4220_1685394:11-nf] of the first light has shone forth, she begins to pour strains of sacred song, and to hail[fn-42-P4221_1685569:12-nf] the new light with wondrous voice, which neither the notes of the nightingale[fn-42-P4222_1685659:13-nf] nor the flute of the Muses can equal with Cyrrhaean[fn-42-P4223_1685789:14-nf] strains. But neither is it thought that the dying swan can imitate it, nor the tuneful strings of the lyre of Mercury. After that Phoebus has brought back his horses to the open heaven,[fn-42-P4224_1686082:15-nf] and continually advancing, has displayed[fn-42-P4225_1686182:16-nf] his whole orb; she applauds with thrice-repeated flapping of her wings, and having thrice adored the fire-bearing head, is silent. And she also distinguishes the swift hours by sounds not liable to error by day and night: an overseer[fn-42-P4226_1686431:17-nf] of the groves, a venerable priestess of the wood, and alone admitted to thy secrets, O Phoebus. And when she has now accomplished the thousand years of her life, and length of days has rendered her burdensome,[fn-42-P4227_1686657:18-nf] in order that she may renew the age which has glided by, the fates pressing[fn-42-P4228_1686773:19-nf] her, she flees from the beloved couch of the accustomed grove. And when she has left the sacred places, through a desire of being born[fn-42-P4229_1686966:20-nf] again, then she seeks this world, where death reigns. Full of years, she directs her swift flight into Syria, to which Venus herself has given the name of Phoenice;[fn-42-P4230_1687155:21-nf] and through trackless deserts she seeks the retired groves in the place, where a remote wood lies concealed through the glens. Then she chooses a lofty palm, with top reaching to the heavens, which has the pleasing[fn-42-P4231_1687414:22-nf] name of phoenix from the bird, and where[fn-42-P4232_1687499:23-nf] no hurtful living creature can break through, or slimy serpent, or any bird of prey. Then Aeolus shuts in the winds in hanging caverns, lest they should injure the bright[fn-42-P4233_1687719:24-nf] air with their blasts, or lest a cloud collected by the south wind through the empty sky should remove the rays of the sun, and be a hindrance[fn-42-P4234_1687922:25-nf] to the bird. Afterwards she builds for herself either a nest or a tomb, for she perishes that she may live; yet she produces herself. Hence she collects juices and odours, which the Assyrian gathers from the rich wood, which the wealthy Arabian gathers; which either the Pygmaean[fn-42-P4235_1688214:26-nf] nations, or India crops, or the Sabaean land produces from its soft bosom. Hence she heaps together cinnamon and the odour of the far-scented amomum, and balsams with mixed leaves. Neither the twig of the mild cassia nor of the fragrant acanthus is absent, nor the tears and rich drop of frankincense. To these she adds tender ears[fn-42-P4236_1688632:27-nf] of flourishing spikenard, and joins the too pleasing pastures[fn-42-P4237_1688762:28-nf] of myrrh. Immediately she places her body about to be changed on the strewed nest, and her quiet limbs on such[fn-42-P4238_1688977:29-nf] a couch. Then with her mouth she scatters juices around and upon her limbs, about to die with her own funeral rites. Then amidst various odours she yields up[fn-42-P4239_1689205:30-nf] her life, nor fears the faith of so great a deposit. In the meantime her body, destroyed by death, which proves the source of life,[fn-42-P4240_1689353:31-nf] is hot, and the heat itself produces a flame; and it conceives fire afar off from the light of heaven: it blazes, and is dissolved into burnt ashes. And these ashes collected in death it fuses,[fn-42-P4241_1689600:32-nf] as it were, into a mass, and has an effect[fn-42-P4242_1689657:33-nf] resembling seed. From this an animal is said to arise without limbs, but the worm is said to be of a milky colour. And it suddenly increases vastly with an imperfectly formed[fn-42-P4243_1689895:34-nf] body, and collects itself into the appearance of a well-rounded egg. After this it is formed again, such as its figure was before, and the phoenix, having burst her shell,[fn-42-P4244_1690125:35-nf] shoots forth, even as caterpillars[fn-42-P4245_1690274:36-nf] in the fields, when they are fastened by a thread to a stone, are wont to be changed into a butterfly. No food is appointed for her in our world, nor does any one make it his business to feed her while unfledged. She sips the delicate[fn-42-P4246_1690522:37-nf] ambrosial dews of heavenly nectar which have fallen from the star-bearing pole. She gathers these; with these the bird is nourished in the midst of odours, until she bears a natural form. But when she begins to flourish with early youth, she flies forth now about to return to her native abode. Previously, however, she encloses in an ointment of balsam, and in myrrh and dissolved[fn-42-P4247_1690939:38-nf] frankincense, all the remains of her own body, and the bones or ashes, and relics[fn-42-P4248_1691040:39-nf] of herself, and with pious mouth brings it into a round form,[fn-42-P4249_1691121:40-nf] and carrying this with her feet, she goes to the rising of the sun, and tarrying at the altar, she draws it forth in the sacred temple. She shows and presents herself an object of admiration to the beholder; such great beauty is there, such great honour abounds. In the first place, her colour is like the brilliancy[fn-42-P4250_1691464:41-nf] of that which the seeds of the pomegranate when ripe take under the smooth rind;[fn-42-P4251_1691667:42-nf] such colour as is contained in the leaves which the poppy produces in the fields, when Flora spreads her garments beneath the blushing sky. Her shoulders and beautiful breasts shine with this covering; with this her head, with this her neck, and the upper parts of her back shine. And her tail is extended, varied with yellow metal, in the spots of which mingled purple blushes. Between her wings there is a bright[fn-42-P4252_1692148:43-nf] mark above, as[fn-42-P4253_1692217:44-nf] Tris on high is wont to paint a cloud from above. She gleams resplendent with a mingling of the green emerald, and a shining beak[fn-42-P4254_1692377:45-nf] of pure horn opens itself. Her eyes are large;[fn-42-P4255_1692502:46-nf] you might believe that they were two jacinths;[fn-42-P4256_1692594:47-nf] from the middle of which a bright flame shines. An irradiated crown is fitted[fn-42-P4257_1692710:48-nf] to the whole of head, resembling on high the glory of the head of Phoebus.[fn-42-P4258_1692800:49-nf] Scales cover her thighs spangled with yellow metal, but a rosy[fn-42-P4259_1692895:50-nf] colour paints her claws with honour. Her form is seen to blend the figure of the peacock with that of the painted bird of Phasis.[fn-42-P4260_1693067:51-nf] The winged creature which is produced in the lands of the Arabians, whether it be beast or bird, can scarcely equal her magnitude.[fn-42-P4261_1693217:52-nf] She is not, however, slow, as birds which through the greatness of their body have sluggish motions, and a very heavy[fn-42-P4262_1693425:53-nf] weight. But she is light and swift, full of royal beauty. Such she always shows herself[fn-42-P4263_1693599:54-nf] in the sight of men. Egypt comes hither to such a wondrous[fn-42-P4264_1693700:55-nf] sight, and the exulting crowd salutes the rare bird. Immediately they carve her image on the consecrated marble, and mark both the occurrence and the day with a new title. Birds of every kind assemble together; none is mindful of prey, none of fear. Attended by a chorus of birds, she flies through the heaven, and a crowd accompanies her, exulting in the pious duty. But when she has arrived at the regions of pure ether, she presently returns;[fn-42-P4265_1694192:56-nf] afterwards she is concealed in her own regions. But oh, bird of happy lot and fate,[fn-42-P4266_1694342:57-nf] to whom the god himself granted to be born from herself! Whether it be female, or male, or neither, or both, happy she, who enters into[fn-42-P4267_1694517:58-nf] no compacts of Venus. Death is Venus to her; her only pleasure is in death: that she may be born, she desires previously to die. She is an offspring to herself, her own father and heir, her own nurse, and always a foster-child to herself. She is herself indeed, but not the same, since she is herself, and not herself, having gained eternal life by the blessing of death.

So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible.

They may fear that the glory of Him who surpasses all creation may be lowered to the level of those other beings called gods. We drew this distinction between Him and them that we showed God the Word to be to all the other gods the minister of their divinity. To this we must add, in order to obviate objections, that the reason which is in every reasonable creature occupied the same relation to the reason who was in the beginning with God, and is God the Word, as God the Word occupies to God. As the Father who is Very God and the True God is to His image and to the images of His image-men are said to be according to the image, not to be images of God-so He, the Word, is to the reason (word) in every man. Each fills the place of a fountain-the Father is the fountain of divinity, the Son of reason. As, then, there are many gods, but to us there is but one God the Father, and many Lords, but to us there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, so there are many Lo/goi, but we, for our part, pray that that one Lo/goj may be with us who was in the beginning and was with God, God the Logos. For whoever does not receive this Logos who was in the beginning with God, or attach himself to Him as He appeared in flesh, or take part in some of those who had part in this Logos, or whoever having had part in Him falls away from Him again, he will have his portion in what is called most opposite to reason. What we have drawn out from the truths with which we started will now be clear enough. First, we spoke about God and the Word of God, and of Gods, either, that is, beings who partake in deity or beings who are called Gods and are not. And again of the Logos of God and of the Logos of God made flesh, and of logoi, or beings which partake in some way of the Logos, of second logoi or of third, thought to be logoi, in addition to that Logos that was before them all, but not really so. Irrational Reasons these may be styled; beings are spoken of who are said to be Gods but are not, and one might place beside these Gods who are no Gods, Reasons which are no Reasons. Now the God of the universe is the God of the elect, and in a much greater degree of the Saviours of the elect; then He is the God of these beings who are truly Gods, and then He is the God, in a word, of the living and not of the dead. But God the Logos is the God, perhaps, of those who attribute everything to Him and who consider Him to be their Father. Now the sun and the moon and the stars were connected, according to the accounts of men of old times, with beings who were not worthy to have the God of gods counted their God. To this opinion they were led by a passage in Deuteronomy which is somewhat on this wise:[fn-64-P6438_1056789:9-nf] \"Lest when thou liftest up thine eyes to heaven, and seest the sun and the moon and the whole host of heaven, thou wander away and worship them and serve them which the Lord thy God hath appointed to all the peoples. But to you the Lord thy God hath not so given them.\" But how did God appoint the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven to all the nations, if He did not give them in the same way to Israel also, to the end that those who could not rise to the realm of intellect, might be inclined by gods of sense to consider about the Godhead, and might of their own free will connect themselves with these and so be kept from falling away to idols and demons? Is it not the case that some have for their God the God of the universe, while a second class, after these, attach themselves to the Son of God, His Christ, and a third class worship the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, wandering, it is true, from God, but with a far different and a better wandering than that of those who invoke as gods the works of men's hands, silver and gold, -works of human skill. Last of all are those who devote themselves to the beings which are called gods but are no gods. In the same way, now, some have faith in that Reason which was in the beginning and was with God and was God; so did Hosea and Isaiah and Jeremiah and others who declared that the Word of the Lord, or the Logos, had come to them. A second class are those who know nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified, considering that the Word made flesh is the whole Word, and knowing only Christ after the flesh. Such is the great multitude of those who are counted believers. A third class give themselves to logoi (discourses) having some part in the Logos which they consider superior to all other reason: these are they who follow the honourable and distinguished philosophical schools among the Greeks. A fourth class besides these are they who put their trust in corrupt and godless discourses, doing away with Providence, which is so manifest and almost visible, and who recognize another end for man to follow than the good. It may appear to some that we have wandered from our theme, but to my thinking the view we have reached of four things connected with the name of God and four things connected with the Logos comes in very well at this point. There was God with the article and God without the article, then there were gods in two orders, at the summit of the higher order of whom is God the Word, transcended Himself by the God of the universe. And, again, there was the Logos with the article and the Logos without the article, corresponding to God absolutely and a god; and the Logoi in two ranks. And some men are connected with the Father, being part of Him, and next to these, those whom our argument now brings into clearer light, those who have come to the Saviour and take their stand entirely in Him. And third are those of whom we spoke before, who reckon the sun and the moon and the stars to be gods, and take their stand by them. And in the fourth and last place those who submit to soulless and dead idols. To all this we find analogies in what concerns the Logos. Some are adorned with the Word Himself; some with what is next to Him and appears to be the very original Logos Himself, those, namely, who know nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified, and who behold the Word as flesh. And the third class, as we described them a little before. Why should I speak of those who are thought to be in the Logos, but have fallen away, not only from the good itself, but from the very traces of it and from those who have a part in it?","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_41_the_epistle_of_barnabas","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Now, wherefore did Moses say, \"Thou shalt not eat the swine, nor the eagle, nor the hawk, nor the raven, nor any fish which is not possessed of scales? \"[fn-32-P3294_556378:132-nf] He embraced three doctrines in his mind [in doing so]. Moreover, the Lord saith to them in Deuteronomy, \"And I will establish my ordinances among this people.\"[fn-32-P3295_556628:133-nf] Is there then not a command of God they should not eat [these things]? There is, but Moses spoke with a spiritual reference.[fn-32-P3296_556773:134-nf] For this reason he named the swine, as much as to say, \"Thou shalt not join thyself to men who resemble swine.\" For when they live in pleasure, they forget their Lord; but when they come to want, they acknowledge the Lord. And [in like manner] the swine, when it has eaten, does not recognize its master; but when hungry it cries out, and on receiving food is quiet again. \"Neither shalt thou eat,\" says he \"the eagle, nor the hawk, nor the kite, nor the raven.\" \"Thou shalt not join thyself,\" he means, \"to such men as know not how to procure food for themselves by labour and sweat, but seize on that of others in their iniquity, and although wearing an aspect of simplicity, are on the watch to plunder others.\"[fn-32-P3297_557519:135-nf] So these birds, while they sit idle, inquire how they may devour the flesh of others, proving themselves pests [to all] by their wickedness. \"And thou shalt not eat,\" he says, \"the lamprey, or the polypus, or the cuttlefish.\" He means, \"Thou shalt not join thyself or be like to such men as are ungodly to the end, and are condemned[fn-32-P3298_558154:136-nf] to death.\" In like manner as those fishes, above accursed, float in the deep, not swimming [on the surface] like the rest, but make their abode in the mud which lies at the bottom. Moreover, \"Thou shall not,\" he says, \"eat the hare.\" Wherefore? \"Thou shall not be a corrupter of boys, nor like unto such.\"[fn-32-P3299_558503:137-nf] Because the hare multiplies, year by year, the places of its conception; for as many years as it lives so many[fn-33-P3300_558906:138-nf] it has. Moreover, \"Thou shall not eat the hyena.\" He means, \"Thou shall not be an adulterer, nor a corrupter, nor be like to them that are such.\" Wherefore? Because that animal annually changes its sex, and is at one time male, and at another female. Moreover, he has rightly detested the weasel. For he means, \"Thou shalt not be like to those whom we hear of as committing wickedness with the mouth,[fn-33-P3301_559380:139-nf] on account of their uncleanness; nor shall thou be joined to those impure women who commit iniquity with the mouth. For this animal conceives by the mouth.\" Moses then issued[fn-33-P3302_559647:140-nf] three doctrines concerning meats with a spiritual significance; but they received them according to fleshly desire, as if he had merely spoken of [literal] meats. David, however, comprehends the knowledge of the three doctrines, and speaks in like manner: \"Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,\"[fn-33-P3303_560020:141-nf] even as the fishes [referred to] go in darkness to the depths [of the sea]; \"and hath not stood in the way of sinners,\" even as those who profess to fear the Lord, but go astray like swine; \"and hath not sat in the seat of scorners,\"[fn-33-P3304_560271:142-nf] even as those birds that lie in wait for prey. Take a full and firm grasp of this spiritual[fn-33-P3305_560401:143-nf] knowledge. But Moses says still further, \"Ye shall eat every animal that is cloven-footed and ruminant.\" What does he mean? [The ruminant animal denotes him] who, on receiving food, recognizes Him that nourishes him, and being satisfied by Him,[fn-33-P3306_560843:144-nf] is visibly made glad. Well spake [Moses], having respect to the commandment. What, then, does he mean? That we ought to join ourselves to those that fear the Lord, those who meditate in their heart on the commandment which they have received, those who both utter the judgments of the Lord and observe them, those who know that meditation is a work of gladness, and who ruminate[fn-33-P3307_561254:145-nf] upon the word of the Lord. But what means the cloven-footed? That the righteous man also walks in this world, yet looks forward to the holy state[fn-33-P3308_561461:146-nf] [to come]. Behold how well Moses legislated. But how was it possible for them to understand or comprehend these things? We then, rightly understanding his commandments,[fn-33-P3309_561660:147-nf] explain them as the Lord intended.

Wherefore saith the holy law: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt not desire thy neighbour's wife.\" So also the prophets. Solomon indeed teaches us that we must not sin with so much as a turn of the eye,[fn-17-P1749_508228:71-nf] saying, \"Let thine eyes look right on, and let thy eyelids look straight before thee.\"[fn-17-P1750_508340:72-nf] And Moses, who himself also was a prophet, says, concerning the sole government of God: \"Your God is He who establishes the heaven, and forms the earth, whose hands have brought forth all the host of heaven; and has not set these things before you that you should go after them.\"[fn-17-P1751_508639:73-nf] And Isaiah himself also says: \"Thus saith the Lord God who established the heavens, and founded the earth and all that is therein, and giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein.

Moreover, they were in sore travail, bewailing the godless race of men, and they reproached those, who seemed to be wise, for their error and hardness of heart. Jeremiah, indeed, said: \"Every man is brutishly gone astray from the knowledge of Him; every founder is confounded by his graven images; in vain the silversmith makes his molten images; there is no breath in them: in the day of their visitation they shall perish.\"[fn-17-P1756_510230:78-nf] The same, too, says David: \"They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; there is none that doeth good, no, not one; they have all gone aside, they have together become profitless.\"[fn-17-P1757_510440:79-nf] So also Habakkuk: \"What profiteth the graven image that he has graven it a lying image? Woe to him that saith to the stone, Awake; and to the wood, Arise.\"[fn-17-P1758_510616:80-nf] Likewise spoke the other prophets of the truth. And why should I recount the multitude of prophets, who are numerous, and said ten thousand things consistently and harmoniously?

And this one may see from our own experience; for if when a word proceeds from men[fn-17-P1786_653937:21-nf] we infer that the mind is its source, and, by thinking about the word, see with our reason the mind which it reveals, by far greater evidence and incomparably more, seeing the power of the Word, we receive a knowledge also of His good Father, as the Saviour Himself says, \"He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-17-P1787_654282:22-nf] .\" But this all inspired Scripture also teaches more plainly and with more authority, so that we in our turn write boldy to you as we do, and you, if you refer to them, will be able to verify what we say. 3. For an argument when confirmed by higher authority is irresistibly proved. From the first then the divine Word firmly taught the Jewish people about the abolition of idols when it said[fn-17-P1788_654693:23-nf] : \"Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven image, nor the likeness of anything that is in the heaven above or in the earth beneath.\" But the cause of their abolition another writer declares[fn-17-P1789_654899:24-nf] , saying: \"The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the works of men's hands: a mouth have they and will not speak, eyes have they. and will not see, ears have they and will not: hear, noses have they and will not smell, hands have they and will not handle, feet have they and will not walk.\" Nor has it passed over in silence the doctrine of creation; but, knowing well its beauty, lest any attending solely to this beauty should worship things as if they were gods, instead of God's works, it teaches men firmly beforehand when it says[fn-17-P1790_655461:25-nf] : \"And do not when thou lookest up with thine eyes and seest the sun and moon and all the host of heaven, go astray and worship them, which the Lord thy God hath given to all nations under heaven.\" But He gave them, not to be their gods, but that by their agency the Gentiles should know, as we have said, God the Maker of them all. 4. For the people of the Jews of old had abundant teaching, in that they had the knowledge of God not only from the works of Creation, but also from the divine Scriptures. And in general to draw men away from the error and irrational imagination of idols, He saith[fn-17-P1791_656078:26-nf] : \"Thou shalt have none other gods but Me.\" Not as if there were other gods does He forbid them to have them, but lest any, turning from the true God, should begin to make himself gods of what were not, such as those who in the poets and writers are called gods, though they are none. And the language itself shews that they are no Gods, when it says, \"Thou shalt have none other gods,\" which refers only to the future. But what is referred to the future does not exist at the time of speaking.","title":"Part III.","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":4,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_36_on_the_making_of_man","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"274","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"9.

But perhaps this question is asked, If it be the understanding which prays and sings with the spirit, and if it be the same which receives both perfection and salvation, how is it that Peter says, \"Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls? \"[fn-66-P6654_1346986:132-nf] If the soul neither prays nor sings with the spirit, how shall it hope for salvation? or when it attains to blessedness, shall it be no longer called a soul?[fn-66-P6655_1347164:133-nf] Let us see if perhaps an answer may be given in this way, that as the Saviour came to save what was lost, that which formerly was said to be lost is not lost when it is saved; so also, perhaps, this which is saved is called a soul, and when it has been placed in a state of salvation will receive a name from the Word that denotes its more perfect condition. But it appears to some that this also may be added, that as the thing which was lost undoubtedly existed before it was lost, at which time it was something else than destroyed, so also will be the case when it is no longer in a ruined condition. In like manner also, the soul which is said to have perished will appear to have been something at one time, when as yet it had not perished, and on that account would be termed soul, and being again freed from destruction, it may become a second time what it was before it perished, and be called a soul. But from the very signification of the name soul which the Greek word conveys, it has appeared to a few curious inquirers that a meaning of no small importance may be suggested. For in sacred language God is called a fire, as when Scripture says,\" Our God is a consuming fire.\"[fn-66-P6656_1349244:134-nf] Respecting the substance of the angels also it speaks as follows: \"Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a burning fire; \"[fn-66-P6657_1349400:135-nf] and in another place, \"The angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire in the bush.\"[fn-66-P6658_1349521:136-nf] We have, moreover, received a commandment to be \"fervent in spirit; \"[fn-66-P6659_1349610:137-nf] by which expression undoubtedly the Word of God is shown to be hot and fiery. The prophet Jeremiah also hears from Him, who gave him his answers, \"Behold, I have given My words into thy mouth a fire.\"[fn-66-P6660_1349832:138-nf] As God, then, is a fire, and the angels a flame of fire, and all the saints are fervent in spirit, so, on the contrary, those who have fallen away from the love of God are undoubtedly said to have cooled in their affection for Him, and to have become cold. For the Lord also says, that, \"because iniquity has abounded, the love of many will grow cold.\"[fn-66-P6661_1350277:139-nf] Nay, all things, whatever they are, which in holy Scripture are compared with the hostile power, the devil is said to be perpetually finding cold; and what is found to be colder than he? In the sea also the dragon is said to reign. For the prophet[fn-66-P6662_1350548:140-nf] intimates that the serpent and dragon, which certainly is referred to one of the wicked spirits, is also in the sea. And elsewhere the prophet says, \"I will draw out my holy sword upon the dragon the flying serpent, upon the dragon the crooked serpent, and will slay him.\"[fn-66-P6663_1350853:141-nf] And again he says: \"Even though they hide from my eyes, and descend into the depths of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.\"[fn-66-P6664_1351030:142-nf] In the book of Job also, he is said to be the king of all things in the waters.[fn-66-P6665_1351129:143-nf] The prophet[fn-66-P6666_1351168:144-nf] threatens that evils will be kindled by the north wind upon all who inhabit the earth. Now the north wind is described in holy Scripture as cold, according to the statement in the book of Wisdom, \"That cold north wind; \"[fn-66-P6667_1351408:145-nf] which same thing also must undoubtedly be understood of the devil. If, then, those things which are holy are named fire, and light, and fervent, while those which are of an opposite nature are said to be cold; and if the love of many is said to wax cold; we have to inquire whether perhaps the name soul, which in Greek is termed yukh/, be so termed from growing cold[fn-66-P6668_1351802:146-nf] out of a betterand more divine condition, and be thence derived, because it seems to have cooled from thatnatural and divine warmth, and therefore has been placed in its present position, and called by its present name. Finally, see if you caneasily find a place in holy Scripture where thesoul is properly mentioned in terms of praise: it frequently occurs, on the contrary, accompanied with expressions of censure, as in the passage, \"An evil soul ruins him who possesses it; \"[fn-66-P6669_1352309:147-nf] and, \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\"[fn-66-P6670_1352376:148-nf] For after it has been said, \"All souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine,\"[fn-66-P6671_1352521:149-nf] it seemed to follow that He would say, \"The soul that doeth righteousness, it shall be saved,\" and \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\" But now we see that He has associated with the soul what is censurable, and has been silent as to that which was deserving of praise. We have therefore to see if, perchance, as we have said is declared by the name itself, it was called yukh/, i.e., anima, because it has waxed cold from the fervour of just things,[fn-66-P6672_1353002:150-nf] and from participation in the divine fire, and yet has not lost the power of restoring itself to that condition of fervour in which it was at the beginning. Whence the prophet also appears to point out some such state of things by the words, \"Return, O my soul, unto thy rest.\"[fn-66-P6673_1353622:151-nf] From all which this appears to be made out, that the understanding, falling away from its status and dignity, was made or named soul; and that, if repaired and corrected, it returns to the condition of the understanding.[fn-66-P6674_1353863:152-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§25.

You say `he is the universal cause of sin;' and, while you make him the author of all crimes, you free men from fault, and take away the freedom of the will. Our Lord says that[fn-92-P9259_2491178:11-nf] `from our heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnesses, railings,' and of Judas we read in the Gospel;[fn-92-P9260_2491346:12-nf] \"After the sop Satan entered into him,\" that is, because he had before the sop sinned voluntarily, and had not been brought to repentance either by humbling himself or by the forbearance of the Saviour. So also the Apostle says;[fn-92-P9261_2491595:13-nf] \"Such men I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.\" He delivered to Satan as to a torturer, with a view to their punishment, those who, before they had been delivered to him learned to blaspheme by their own will. David also draws the distinction in a few words between the faults due to his own will and the incentives of vice when he says[fn-92-P9262_2491981:14-nf] \"Cleanse thou me from my secret faults, and keep back thy servant from alien sins.\" We read also in Ecclesiastes[fn-92-P9263_2492131:15-nf] \"If the spirit of a ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place;\" from which we may clearly see that we commit sin if we give opportunity to the power which rises up, and if we fail to hurl down headlong the enemy who is scaling our walls. As to your threatening your brothers, that is, those who accuse you, with eternal fire in company with the devil, it seems to me that you do not so much drag your brethren down as raise the devil up, since he, according to you, is to be punished only with the same fires as Christian men. But you well know, I think, what eternal fires mean according to the ideas of Origen, namely, the sinners' conscience, and the remorse which galls their hearts within. These ideas he thinks are intended in the words of Isaiah:[fn-92-P9264_2492908:16-nf] \"Their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched.\" And in the words addressed to Babylon:[fn-92-P9265_2493031:17-nf] \"Thou hast coals of fire, thou shalt sit upon them, these shall be thy help.\" So also in the Psalm it is said to the penitent;[fn-92-P9266_2493420:18-nf] \"What shall be given to thee, or what shall be done more for thee against thee false tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with desolating coals;\" which means (according to him) that the arrows of God's precepts (concerning which the Prophet says in another place,[fn-92-P9267_2493718:19-nf] \"I lived in misery while a thorn pierces me\") should wound and strike through the crafty tongue, and make an end of sins in it. He also interprets the place where the Lord testifies saying:[fn-92-P9268_2493970:20-nf] \"I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish that it may burn\" as meaning \"I wish that all may repent, and burn out through the Holy spirit their vices and their sins; for I am he of whom it is written,[fn-92-P9269_2494197:21-nf] \"Our God is a consuming fire;\" it is no great thing then to say this of the devil, since it is prepared also for men.\" You ought rather to have said, if you wished to avoid the suspicion of believing in the salvation of the devil;[fn-92-P9270_2494461:22-nf] \"Thou hast become perdition and shalt not be for ever;\" and as the Lord speaks to Job concerning the devil,[fn-92-P9271_2494600:23-nf] \"Behold his hope shall fail him and in the sight of all shall he be cast down. I will not arouse him as one that is cruel, for who can resist my countenance? Who has first given to me that I may return it to him? for all things beneath the heaven are mine. I will not spare him and his words that are powerful and fashioned to turn away wrath.\" Hence, these things may pass as the work of a plain man.

The divine word says that our God is \"a consuming fire,\"[fn-90-P9064_2329391:47-nf] and that \"He draws rivers of fire before Him; \"[fn-90-P9065_2329469:48-nf] nay, that He even entereth in as \"a refiner's fire, and as a fuller's herb,\"[fn-90-P9066_2329569:49-nf] to purify His own people.

But if, on the contrary, the works of the wicked man are spoken of figuratively under the names of \"wood, or hay, or stubble,\" why does it not at once occur (to inquire) in what sense the word \"fire\" is to be taken, so that \"wood\" of such a kind should be consumed? for (the Scripture) says: \"The fire will try each man's work of what sort it is.

Now it is evident that those who live according to the law, and worship the Maker of heaven, will not worship the heaven at the same time with God. Moreover, no one who obeys the law of Moses will bow down to the angels who are in heaven; and, in like manner, as they do not bow down to sun, moon, and stars, the host of heaven, they refrain from doing obeisance to heaven and its angels, obeying the law which declares: \"Lest thou lift up thine eyes to heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations.\"[fn-98-P9810_2558925:15-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_60_book_v_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"85","folder":"ANF-04","text":"And if it be necessary for us to offer a defence of our refusal to recognise as gods, equally with angels, and sun, and moon, and stars, those who are called by the Greeks \"manifest and visible\" divinities, we shall answer that the law of Moses knows that these latter have been apportioned by God among all the nations under the heaven, but not amongst those who were selected by God as His chosen people above all the nations of the earth. For it is written in the book of Deuteronomy: \"And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations unto the whole heaven.

Inasmuch, then, as the Spirit of God pointed out by the prophets things to come, forming and adapting us beforehand for the purpose of our being made subject to God, but it was still a future thing that man, through the good pleasure of the Holy Spirit, should see [God], it necessarily behoved those through whose instrumentality future things were announced, to see God, whom they intimated as to be seen by men; in order that God, and the Son of God, and the Son, and the Father, should not only be prophetically announced, but that He should also be seen by all His members who are sanctified and instructed in the things of God, that man might be disciplined beforehand and previously exercised for a reception into that glory which shall afterwards be revealed in those who love God.

For it is not so praiseworthy for us to abstain from forbidden as from lawful things, and not to use these last out of reverence for Him, Who has permitted us to use them because of our weakness. And so if even those who, faithfully offering tithes of their fruits, are obedient to the more ancient precepts of the Lord, cannot yet climb the heights of the gospel, you can see very clearly how far short of it those fall who do not even do this.

There Moses lays a burden that cannot be refused on those who are unwilling: here Paul meets with counsels those who are willing and eager for perfection. For that was not to be enjoined as a general charge, nor to be required, if I may so say, as a regular rule from all, which could not be secured by all, owing to its wonderful and lofty nature; but by counsels all are rather stimulated to grace, that those who are great may deservedly be crowned by the perfection of their virtues, while those who are small, and not able to come up to \"the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,\"[fn-63-P6329_2259527:19-nf] although they seem to be lost to sight and hidden as it were by the brightness of larger stars, may yet be free from the darkness of the curses which are in the law, and not adjudged to suffer present evils or visited with eternal punishment. Christ therefore does not constrain anyone, by the compulsion of a command, to those lofty heights of goodness, but stimulates them by the power of free will, and urges them on by wise counsels and the desire of perfection. For where there is a command, there is duty, and consequently punishment. But those who keep those things to which they are driven by the severity of the law established escape the punishment with which they were threatened, instead of obtaining rewards and a recompense.","title":"XXI.

For in this passage, not as signifying the Essence of His Godhead, nor His own everlasting and genuine generation from the Father, has the Word spoken by Solomon, but on the other hand His manhood and Economy towards us. And, as I said before, He has not said `I am a creature,' or `I became a creature,' but only `He created[fn-61-P6161_2456467:297-nf] .' For the creatures, having a created essence, are originate, and are said to be created, and of course the creature is created: but this mere term `He created' does not necessarily signify the essence or the generation, but indicates something else as coming to pass in Him of whom it speaks, and not simply that He who is said to be created, is at once in His Nature and Essence a creature[fn-61-P6162_2458035:298-nf] . And this difference divine Scripture recognises, saying concerning the creatures, `The earth is full of Thy creation,' and `the creation itself groaneth together and travaileth together[fn-61-P6163_2460210:299-nf] ;' and in the Apocalypse it says, `And the third part of the creatures in the sea died which had life;' as also Paul says, `Every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving[fn-61-P6164_2460470:300-nf] ;' and in the book of Wisdom it is written, `Having ordained man through Thy wisdom, that he should have dominion over the creatures which Thou hast made[fn-61-P6165_2460659:301-nf] .'
