{"verses":["And now, O Israel, hear the commandments and judgments which I\nteach thee:  that doing them, thou mayst live, and entering in mayst\npossess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers will give you.","You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall\nyou take away from it:  keep the commandments of the Lord your God which\nI command you.","Your eyes have seen all that the Lord hath done against\nBeelphegor, how he hath destroyed all his worshippers from among you.","But you that adhere to the Lord your God, are all alive until this\npresent day.","You know that I have taught you statutes and justices, as the Lord\nmy God hath commanded me:  so shall you do them in the land which you\nshall possess:","And you shall observe, and fulfil them in practice.  For this is\nyour wisdom, and understanding in the sight of nations, that hearing\nall these precepts, they may say:  Behold a wise and understanding\npeople, a great nation.","Neither is there any other nation so great, that hath gods so nigh\nthem, as our God is present to all our petitions.","For what other nation is there so renowned that hath ceremonies,\nand just judgments, and all the law, which I will set forth this day\nbefore our eyes?","Keep thyself therefore, and thy soul carefully.  Forget not the\nwords that thy eyes have seen, and let them not go out of thy heart all\nthe days of thy life.  Thou shalt teach them to thy sons and to thy\ngrandsons,","From the day in which thou didst stand before the Lord thy God in\nHoreb, when the Lord spoke to me, saying:  Call together the people unto\nme, that they may hear my words, and may learn to fear me all the time\nthat they live on the earth, and may teach their children.","And you came to the foot of the mount, which burned even unto\nheaven:  and there was darkness, and a cloud and obscurity in it.","And the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire.  You heard\nthe voice of his words, but you saw not any form at all.","And he shewed you his covenant, which he commanded you to do, and\nthe ten words that he wrote in two tables of stone.","And he commanded me at that time that I should teach you the\nceremonies and judgments which you shall do in the land, that you shall\npossess.","Keep therefore your souls carefully.  You saw not any similitude\nin the day that the Lord God spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of\nthe fire:","Lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a graven\nsimilitude, or image of male or female,","The similitude of any beasts, that are upon the earth, or of\nbirds, that fly under heaven,","Or of creeping things, that move on the earth, or of fishes, that\nabide in the waters under the earth:","Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven, thou see the sun and\nthe moon, and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived by error thou\nadore and serve them, which the Lord thy God created for the service of\nall the nations, that are under heaven.","But the Lord hath taken you and brought you out of the iron\nfurnaces of Egypt, to make you his people of inheritance, as it is this\npresent day.","And the Lord was angry with me for your words, and he swore that\nI should not pass over the Jordan, nor enter into the excellent land,\nwhich he will give you.","Behold I die in this land, I shall not pass over the Jordan:  you\nshall pass, and possess the goodly land.","Beware lest thou ever forget the covenant of the Lord thy God,\nwhich he hath made with thee:  and make to thyself a graven likeness of\nthose things which the Lord hath forbid to be made:","Because the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.","If you shall beget sons and grandsons, and abide in the land, and\nbeing deceived, make to yourselves any similitude, committing evil\nbefore the Lord your God, to provoke him to wrath:","I call this day heaven and earth to witness, that you shall\nquickly perish out of the land, which, when you have passed over the\nJordan, you shall possess.  You shall not dwell therein long, but the\nLord will destroy you,","And scatter you among all nations, and you shall remain a few\namong the nations, to which the Lord shall lead you.","And there you shall serve gods, that were framed with men's\nhands:  wood and stone, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.","And when thou shalt seek there the Lord thy God, thou shalt find\nhim:  yet so, if thou seek him with all thy heart, and all the\naffliction of thy soul.","After all the things aforesaid shall find thee, in the latter\ntime thou shalt return to the Lord thy God, and shalt hear his voice.","Because the Lord thy God is a merciful God:  he will not leave\nthee, nor altogether destroy thee, nor forget the covenant, by which he\nswore to thy fathers.","Ask of the days of old, that have been before thy time from the\nday that God created man upon the earth, from one end of heaven to the\nother end thereof, if ever there was done the like thing, or it hath\nbeen known at any time,","That a people should hear the voice of God speaking out of the\nmidst of fire, as thou hast heard, and lived:","If God ever did so as to go, and take to himself a nation out of\nthe midst of nations by temptations, signs, and wonders, by fight, and\na strong hand, and stretched out arm, and horrible visions according to\nall the things that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, before thy\neyes.","That thou mightest know that the Lord he is God, and there is no\nother besides him.","From heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might teach\nthee.  And upon earth he shewed thee his exceeding great fire, and thou\ndidst hear his words out of the midst of the fire,","Because he loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them.\nAnd he brought thee out of Egypt, going before thee with his great\npower,","To destroy at thy coming very great nations, and stronger than\nthou art, and to bring thee in, and give thee their land for a\npossession, as thou seest at this present day.","Know therefore this day, and think in thy heart that the Lord he\nis God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath, and there is no\nother.","Keep his precepts and commandments, which I command thee:  that it\nmay be well with thee, and thy children after thee, and thou mayst\nremain a long time upon the land, which the Lord thy God will give\nthee.","Then Moses set aside three cities beyond the Jordan at the east\nside,","That any one might flee to them who should kill his neighbour\nunwillingly, and was not his enemy a day or two before, and that he\nmight escape to some one of these cities:","Bosor in the wilderness, which is situate in the plains of the\ntribe of Ruben:  and Ramoth in Galaad, which is in the tribe of Gad:  and\nGolan in Basan, which is in the tribe of Manasses.","This is the law, that Moses set before the children of Israel,","And these are the testimonies and ceremonies and judgments, which\nhe spoke to the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt,","Beyond the Jordan in the valley over against the temple of\n\nPhogor, in the land of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt in\n\nHesebon, whom Moses slew.  And the children of Israel coming out of\n\nEgypt,\n","Possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Basan, of the two\nkings of the Amorrhites, who were beyond the Jordan towards the rising\nof the sun:","From Aroer, which is situate upon the bank of the torrent Arnon,\nunto mount Sion, which is also called Hermon,","All the plain beyond the Jordan at the east side, unto the sea of\nthe wilderness, and unto the foot of mount Phasga."]}
