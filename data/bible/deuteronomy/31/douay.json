{"verses":["And Moses went, and spoke all these words to all Israel,","And he said to them:  I am this day a hundred and twenty years\nold, I can no longer go out and come in, especially as the Lord also\nhath said to me:  Thou shalt not pass over this Jordan.","The Lord thy God then will pass over before thee:  he will destroy\nall these nations in thy sight, and thou shalt possess them:  and this\nJosue shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath spoken.","And the Lord shall do to them as he did to Sehon and Og the kings\nof the Amorrhites, and to their land, and shall destroy them.","Therefore when the Lord shall have delivered these also to you,\nyou shall do in like manner to them as I have commanded you.","Do manfully and be of good heart:  fear not, nor be ye dismayed at\ntheir sight:  for the Lord thy God he himself is thy leader, and will\nnot leave thee nor forsake thee.","And Moses called Josue, and said to him before all Israel:  Take\ncourage, and be valiant:  for thou shalt bring this people into the land\nwhich the Lord swore he would give to their fathers, and thou shalt\ndivide it by lot.","And the Lord who is your leader, he himself will be with thee:  he\nwill not leave thee, nor forsake thee:  fear not, neither be dismayed.","And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the\nsons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to\nall the ancients of Israel.","And he commanded them, saying:  After seven years, in the year of\nremission, in the feast of tabernacles,","When all Israel come together, to appear in the sight of the\nLord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose, thou shalt read\nthe words of this law before all Israel, in their hearing.","And the people being all assembled together, both men and women,\nchildren and strangers, that are within thy gates:  that hearing they\nmay learn, and fear the Lord your God, and keep, and fulfil all the\nwords of this law:","That their children also, who now are ignorant, may hear, and\nfear the Lord their God, all the days that they live in the land\nwhither you are going over the Jordan to possess it.","And the Lord said to Moses:  Behold the days of thy death are\nnigh:  call Josue, and stand ye in the tabernacle of the testimony, that\nI may give him a charge.  So Moses and Josue went and stood in the\ntabernacle of the testimony:","And the Lord appeared there in the pillar of a cloud, which\nstood in the entry of the tabernacle.","And the Lord said to Moses:  Behold thou shalt sleep with thy\nfathers, and this people rising up will go a fornicating after strange\ngods in the land, to which it goeth in to dwell:  there will they\nforsake me, and will make void the covenant, which I have made with\nthem,","And my wrath shall be kindled against them in that day:  and I\nwill forsake them, and will hide my face from them, and they shall be\ndevoured:  all evils and afflictions shall find them, so that they shall\nsay in that day:  In truth it is because God is not with me, that these\nevils have found me.","But I will hide, and cover my face in that day, for all the\nevils which they have done, because they have followed strange gods.","Now therefore write you this canticle, and teach the children of\nIsrael:  that they may know it by heart, and sing it by mouth, and this\nsong may be unto me for a testimony among the children of Israel.","For I will bring them into the land, for which I swore to their\nfathers, that floweth with milk and honey.  And when they have eaten,\nand are full and fat, they will turn away after strange gods, and will\nserve them:  and will despise me, and make void my covenant.","And after many evils and afflictions shall have come upon them,\nthis canticle shall answer them for a testimony, which no oblivion\nshall take away out of the mouth of their seed.  For I know their\nthoughts, and what they are about to do this day, before that I bring\nthem into the land which I have promised them.","Moses therefore wrote the canticle, and taught it to the\nchildren of Israel.","And the Lord commanded Josue the son of Nun, and said:  Take\ncourage, and be valiant:  for thou shalt bring the children of Israel\ninto the land which I have promised, and I will be with thee.","Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in a\nvolume, and finished it:","He commanded the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of\nthe Lord, saying:","Take this book, and put it in the side of the ark of the\ncovenant of the Lord your God:  that it may be there for a testimony\nagainst thee.","For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck.  While I am\nyet living, and going in with you, you have always been rebellious\nagainst the Lord:  how much more when I shall be dead?","Gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes, and your\ndoctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will call\nheaven and earth to witness against them.","For I know that, after my death, you will do wickedly, and will\nquickly turn aside form the way that I have commanded you:  and evils\nshall come upon you in the latter times, when you shall do evil in the\nsight of the Lord, to provoke him by the works of your hands.","Moses therefore spoke, in the hearing of the whole assembly of\nIsrael, the words of this canticle, and finished it even to the end."]}
