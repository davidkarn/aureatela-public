{"verses":["Therefore love the Lord thy God and observe his precepts and\nceremonies, his judgments and commandments at all times.","Know this day the things that your children know not, who saw not\nthe chastisements of the Lord your God, his great doings and strong\nhand, and stretched out arm,","The signs and works which he did in the midst of Egypt to king\nPharao, and to all his land,","And to all the host of the Egyptians, and to their horses and\nchariots:  how the waters of the Red Sea covered them, when they pursued\nyou, and how the Lord destroyed them until this present day:","And what he hath done to you in the wilderness, til you came to\nthis place:","And to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, who was the son of\nRuben:  whom the earth, opening her mouth swallowed up with their\nhouseholds and tents, and all their substance, which they had in the\nmidst of Israel.","Your eyes have seen all the great works of the Lord, that he hath\ndone,","That you may keep all his commandments, which I command you this\nday, and may go in, and possess the land, to which you are entering,","And may live in it a long time:  which the Lord promised by oath\nto your fathers, and to their seed, a land which floweth with milk and\nhoney.","For the land, which thou goest to possess, is not like the land\nof Egypt, from whence thou camest out, where, when the seed is sown,\nwaters are brought in to water it after the manner of gardens.","But it is a land of hills and plains, expecting rain from\nheaven.","And the Lord thy God doth always visit it, and his eyes are on\nit from the beginning of the year unto the end thereof.","If then you obey my commandments, which I command you this day,\nthat you love the Lord your God, and serve him with all your heart, and\nwith all your soul:","He will give to your land the early rain and the latter rain,\nthat you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your oil,","And your hay out of the fields to feed your cattle, and that you\nmay eat and be filled.","Beware lest perhaps your heart be deceived, and you depart from\nthe Lord, and serve strange gods, and adore them:","And the Lord being angry shut up heaven, that the rain come not\ndown, nor the earth yield her fruit, and you perish quickly from the\nexcellent land, which the Lord will give you.","Lay up these words in your hearts and minds, and hang them for a\nsign on your hands, and place them between your eyes.","Teach your children that they meditate on them, when thou\nsittest in thy house, and when thou walkest on the way, and when thou\nliest down and risest up.","Thou shalt write them upon the posts and the doors of thy house:","That thy days may be multiplied, and the days of thy children in\nthe land which the Lord swore to thy fathers, that he would give them\nas long as the heaven hangeth over the earth.","For if you keep the commandments which I command you, and do\nthem, to love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways, cleaving\nunto him,","The Lord will destroy all these nations before your face, and\nyou shall possess them, which are greater and stronger than you.","Every place, that your foot shall tread upon, shall be yours.\nFrom the desert, and from Libanus, from the great river Euphrates unto\nthe western sea shall be your borders.","None shall stand against you:  the Lord your God shall lay the\ndread and fear of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon, as\nhe hath spoken to you.","Behold I set forth in your sight this day a blessing and a\ncurse:","A blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God,\nwhich I command you this day:","A curse, if you obey not the commandments of the Lord your God,\nbut revolt from the way which now I shew you, and walk after strange\ngods which you know not.","And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land,\nwhither thou goest to dwell, thou shalt put the blessing upon mount\nGarizim, the curse upon mount Hebal:","Which are beyond the Jordan, behind the way that goeth to the\nsetting of the sun, in the land of the Chanaanite who dwelleth in the\nplain country over against Galgala, which is near the valley that\nreacheth and entereth far.","For you shall pass over the Jordan, to possess the land, which\nthe Lord your God will give you, that you may have it and possess it.","See therefore that you fulfil the ceremonies and judgments,\nwhich I shall set this day before you."]}
