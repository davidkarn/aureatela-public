{"verses":["And Jonas was exceedingly troubled, and was angry:","And he prayed to the Lord, and said:  I beseech thee, O Lord, is\nnot this what I said, when I was yet in my own country?  therefore I\nwent before to flee into Tharsis:  for I know that thou art a gracious\nand merciful God, patient, and of much compassion, and easy to forgive\nevil.","And now, O Lord, I beseech thee take my life from me:  for it is\nbetter for me to die than to live.","And the Lord said:  Dost thou think thou hast reason to be angry?","Then Jonas went out of the city, and sat toward the east side of\nthe city:  and he made himself a booth there, and he sat under it in the\nshadow, till he might see what would befall the city.","And the Lord God prepared an ivy, and it came up over the head of\nJonas, to be a shadow over his head, and to cover him (for he was\nfatigued):  and Jonas was exceeding glad of the ivy.","But God prepared a worm, when the morning arose on the following\nday:  and it struck the ivy and it withered.","And when the sun was risen, the Lord commanded a hot and burning\nwind:  and the sun beat upon the head of Jonas, and he broiled with the\nheat:  and he desired for his soul that he might die, and said:  It is\nbetter for me to die than to live.","And the Lord said to Jonas:  Dost thou think thou hast reason to be\nangry, for the ivy?  And he said:  I am angry with reason even unto\ndeath.","And the Lord said:  Thou art grieved for the ivy, for which thou\nhast not laboured, nor made it to grow, which in one night came up, and\nin one night perished.","And shall I not spare Ninive, that great city, in which there are\nmore than a hundred and twenty thousand persons, that know not how to\ndistinguish between their right hand and their left, and many beasts?"]}
