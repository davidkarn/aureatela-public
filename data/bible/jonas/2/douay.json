{"verses":["Now the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonas:  and Jonas\nwas in the belly of a fish for three days and three nights.","And Jonas prayed to the Lord, his God, out of the belly of the\nfish.","And he said:  I cried out of my affliction to the Lord, and he\nheard me:  I cried out of the belly of hell, and thou hast heard my\nvoice.","And thou hast cast me forth into the deep, in the heart of the\nsea, and a flood hast compassed me:  all thy billows, and thy waves have\npassed over me.","And I said:  I am cast away out of the sight of thy eyes:  but yet I\nshall see the holy temple again.","The waters compassed me about even to the soul:  the deep hath\nclosed me round about, the sea hath covered my head.","I went down to the lowest parts of the mountains:  the bars of the\nearth have shut me up for ever:  and thou wilt bring up my life from\ncorruption, O Lord, my God.","When my soul was in distress within me, I remembered the Lord:\nthat my prayer may come to thee, unto the holy temple.","They that in vain observe vanities, forsake their own mercy.","But I with the voice of praise will sacrifice to thee:  I will pay\nwhatsoever I have vowed for my salvation to the Lord.","And the Lord spoke to the fish:  and it vomited out Jonas upon the\ndry land."]}
