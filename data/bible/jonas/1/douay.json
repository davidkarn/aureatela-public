{"verses":["Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas, the son of Amathi, saying:","Arise and go to Ninive, the great city, and preach in it:  For the\nwickedness thereof is come up before me.","And Jonas rose up to flee into Tharsis from the face of the Lord,\nand he went down to Joppe, and found a ship going to Tharsis:  and he\npaid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to\nTharsis from the face of the Lord,","But the Lord sent a great wind to the sea:  and a great tempest was\nraised in the sea, and the ship was in danger to be broken.","And the mariners were afraid, and the men cried to their god:  and\nthey cast forth the wares that were in the ship, into the sea, to\nlighten it of them:  and Jonas went down into the inner part of the\nship, and fell into a deep sleep.","And the ship master came to him and said to him:  Why art thou fast\nasleep?  rise up call upon thy God, if so be that God will think of us\nthat we may not perish.","And they said every one to his fellow:  Come and let us cast lots,\nthat we may know why this evil is upon us.  And they cast lots, and the\nlot fell upon Jonas.","And they said to him:  Tell us for what cause this evil is upon us,\nwhat is thy business?  of what country art thou?  and whither goest thou?\nor of what people art thou?","And he said to them:  I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, and the\nGod of heaven, who made both the sea and the dry land.","And the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him:  Why hast\nthou done this?  (For the men knew that he fled from the face of the\nLord:  because he had told them.)","And they said to him:  What shall we do with thee, that the sea\nmay be calm to us?  for the sea flowed and swelled.","And he said to them:  take me up, and cast me into the sea, and\nthe sea shall be calm to you:  for I know for my sake this great tempest\nis upon you.","And the men rowed hard to return the land, but they were not\nable:  because the sea tossed and swelled upon them.","And they cried to the Lord, and said:  We beseech thee, O Lord let\nus not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood:\nfor thou, oh Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.","And they took Jonas, and cast him into the sea, and the sea\nceased from raging.","And the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and sacrificed victims\nto the Lord, and made vows."]}
