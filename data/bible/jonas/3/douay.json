{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to Jonas the second time saying:","Arise, and go to Ninive, the great city:  and preach in it the\npreaching that I bid thee.","And Jonas arose, and went to Ninive, according to the word of the\nLord:  now Ninive was a great city of three days' journey.","And Jonas began to enter into the city one day's journey:  and he\ncried and said:  Yet forty days and Ninive shall be destroyed.","And the men of Ninive believed in God:  and they proclaimed a fast,\nand put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least.","And the word came to the king of Ninive:  and he rose up out of his\nthrone, and cast away his robe from him, and was clothed in sackcloth,\nand sat in ashes.","And he caused it to be proclaimed and published in Ninive, from\nthe mouth of the king and of his princes, saying:  Let neither men nor\nbeasts, oxen, nor sheep taste anything:  let them not feed, nor drink\nwater.","And let men and beasts be covered with sackcloth, and cry to the\nLord with all their strength, and let them turn every one from his evil\nway, and from the iniquity that is in their hands.","Who can tell if God will turn, and forgive:  and will turn away\nfrom his fierce anger, and we shall not perish?","And God saw their works, that they were turned from their evil\nway:  and God had mercy with regard to the evil which he had said that\nhe would do to them, and he did it not."]}
