{"verses":["But all men are vain, in whom there is not the knowledge of God:\nand who by these good things that are seen, could not understand him\nthat is, neither by attending to the works have acknowledged who was\nthe workman:","But have imagined either the fire, or the wind, or the swift air,\nor the circle of the stars, or the great water, or the sun and moon, to\nbe the gods that rule the world.","With whose beauty, if they, being delighted, took them to be\ngods:  let them know how much the Lord of them is more beautiful than\nthey:  for the first author of beauty made all those things.","Or if they admired their power, and their effects, let them\nunderstand by them, that he that made them, is mightier than they:","For by the greatness of the beauty, and of the creature, the\ncreator of them may be seen, so as to be known thereby.","But yet as to these they are less to be blamed.  For they perhaps\nerr, seeking God, and desirous to find him.","For being conversant among his works, they search:  and they are\npersuaded that the things are good which are seen.","But then again they are not to be pardoned.","For if they were able to know so much as to make a judgment of\nthe world:  how did they not more easily find out the Lord thereof?","But unhappy are they, and their hope is among the dead, who have\ncalled gods the works of the hand of men, gold and silver, the\ninventions of art, and the resemblances of beasts, or an unprofitable\nstone the work of an ancient hand.","Or if an artist, a carpenter, hath cut down a tree proper for\nhis use in the wood, and skilfully taken off all the bark thereof, and\nwith his art, diligently formeth a vessel profitable for the common\nuses of life,","And useth the chips of his work to dress his meat:","And taking what was left thereof, which is good for nothing,\nbeing a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, carveth it diligently\nwhen he hath nothing else to do, and by the skill of his art fashioneth\nit, and maketh it like the image of a man:","Or the resemblance of some beast, laying it over with vermilion,\nand painting it red, and covering every spot that is in it:","And maketh a convenient dwelling place for it, and setting it in\na wall, and fastening it with iron,","Providing for it, lest it should fall, knowing that it is unable\nto help itself:  for it is an image, and hath need of help.","And then maketh prayer to it, enquiring concerning his\nsubstance, and his children, or his marriage.  And he is not ashamed to\nspeak to that which hath no life:","And for health he maketh supplication to the weak, and for life\nprayeth to that which is dead, and for help calleth upon that which is\nunprofitable:","And for a good journey he petitioneth him that cannot walk:  and\nfor getting, and for working, and for the event of all things he asketh\nhim that is unable to do any thing."]}
