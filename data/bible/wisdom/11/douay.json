{"verses":["She prospered their works in the hands of the holy prophet.","They went through wildernesses that were not inhabited, and in\ndesert places they pitched their tents.","They stood against their enemies, and revenged themselves of\ntheir adversaries.","They were thirsty, and they called upon thee, and water was given\nthem out of the high rock, and a refreshment of their thirst out of the\nhard stone.","For by what things their enemies were punished, when their drink\nfailed them, while the children of Israel abounded therewith, and\nrejoiced:","By the same things they in their need were benefited.","For instead of a fountain of an ever running river, thou gavest\nhuman blood to the unjust.","And whilst they were diminished for a manifest reproof of their\nmurdering the infants, thou gavest to thine abundant water unlooked\nfor:","Shewing by the thirst that was then, how thou didst exalt thine,\nand didst kill their adversaries.","For when they were tried, and chastised with mercy, they knew\nhow the wicked were judged with wrath, and tormented.","For thou didst admonish and try them as a father:  but the\nothers, as a severe king, thou didst examine and condemn.","For whether absent or present, they were tormented alike.","For a double affliction came upon them, and a groaning for the\nremembrance of things past.","For when they heard that by their punishments the others were\nbenefited, they remembered the Lord, wondering at the end of what was\ncome to pass.","For whom they scorned before, when he was thrown out at the time\nof his being wickedly exposed to perish, him they admired in the end,\nwhen they saw the event:  their thirsting being unlike to that of the\njust.","But for the foolish devices of their iniquity, because some\nbeing deceived worshipped dumb serpents and worthless beasts, thou\ndidst send upon them a multitude of dumb beasts for vengeance:","That they might know that by what things a man sinneth, by the\nsame also he is tormented.","For thy almighty hand, which made the world of matter without\nform, was not unable to send upon them a multitude of bears, or fierce\nlions,","Or unknown beasts of a new kind, full of rage; either breathing\nout a fiery vapour, or sending forth a stinking smoke, or shooting\nhorrible sparks out of their eyes:","Whereof not only the hurt might be able to destroy them, but\nalso the very sight might kill them through fear.","Yea, and without these, they might have been slain with one\nblast, persecuted by their own deeds, and scattered by the breath of\nthy power:  but thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and\nweight.","For great power always belonged to thee alone:  and who shall\nresist the strength of thy arm?","For the whole world before thee is as the least grain of the\nbalance, and as a drop of the morning dew, that falleth down upon tho\nearth.","But thou hast mercy upon all, because thou canst do all things,\nand overlookest the sins of men for the sake of repentance.","For thou lovest all things that are, and hatest none of the\nthings which thou hast made:  for thou didst not appoint, or make any\nthing hating it.","And how could any thing endure, if thou wouldst not?  or be\npreserved, if not called by thee?","But thou sparest all:  because they are thine, O Lord, who lovest\nsouls."]}
