{"verses":["Love justice, you that are the judges of the earth.  Think of the\nLord in goodness, and seek him in simplicity of heart:","For he is found by them that tempt him not:  and he sheweth himself\nto them that have faith in him.","For perverse thoughts separate from God:  and his power, when it is\ntried, reproveth the unwise:","For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a\nbody subject to sins.","For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful,\nand will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding,\nand he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in.","For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and will not acquit the\nevil speaker from his lips:  for God is witness of his reins, and he is\na true searcher of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.","For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world:  and that\nwhich containeth all things, hath knowledge of the voice.","Therefore he that speaketh unjust things, cannot be hid, neither\nshall the chastising judgment pass him by.","For inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly,\nand the hearing of his words shall come to God, to the chastising of\nhis iniquities.","For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of\nmurmuring shall not be hid.","Keep yourselves, therefore, from murmuring, which profiteth\nnothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction, for an obscure speech\nshall not go for nought:  and the mouth that belieth, killeth the soul.","Seek not death in the error of your life, neither procure ye\ndestruction by the works of your hands.","For God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the\ndestruction of the living.","For he created all things that they might be:  and he made the\nnations of the earth for health:  and there is no poison of destruction\nin them, nor kingdom of hell upon the earth.","For justice is perpetual and immortal.","But the wicked with works and words have called it to them:  and\nesteeming it a friend, have fallen away and have made a covenant with\nit:  because they are worthy to be of the part thereof."]}
