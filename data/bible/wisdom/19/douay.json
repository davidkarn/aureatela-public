{"verses":["But as to the wicked, even to the end there came upon them wrath\nwithout mercy.  For he knew before also what they would do:","For when they had given them leave to depart and had sent them\naway with great care, they repented and pursued after them.","For whilst they were yet mourning, and lamenting at the graves of\nthe dead, they took up another foolish device:  and pursued them as\nfugitives whom they had pressed to be gone:","For a necessity, of which they were worthy, brought them to this\nend:  and they lost the remembrance of those things which had happened,\nthat their punishment might fill up what was wanting to their torments:","And that thy people might wonderfully pass through, but they\nmight find a new death.","For every creature, according to its kind was fashioned again as\nfrom the beginning, obeying thy commandments, that thy children might\nbe kept without hurt.","For a cloud overshadowed their camps and where water was before,\ndry land appeared, and in the Red Sea a way without hindrance, and out\nof the great deep a springing field:","Through which all the nation passed which was protected with thy\nhand, seeing thy miracles and wonders.","For they fed on their food like horses, and they skipped like\nlambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.","For they were yet mindful of those things which had been done in\nthe time of their sojourning, how the ground brought forth flies\ninstead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs\ninstead of fishes.","And at length they saw a new generation of birds, when being led\nby their appetite, they asked for delicate meats.","For to satisfy their desire, the quail came up to them from the\nsea:  and punishments came upon the sinners, not without foregoing signs\nby the force of thunders:  for they suffered justly according to their\nown wickedness.","For they exercised a more detestable inhospitality than any:\nothers indeed received not strangers unknown to them, but these brought\ntheir guests into bondage that had deserved well of them.","And not only so, but in another respect also they were worse:\nfor the others against their will received the strangers.","But these grievously afflicted them whom they had received with\njoy, and who lived under the same laws.","But they were struck with blindness:  as those others were at the\ndoors of the just man, when they were covered with sudden darkness, and\nevery one sought the passage of his own door.","For while the elements are changed in themselves, as in an\ninstrument the sound of the quality is changed, yet all keep their\nsound:  which may clearly be perceived by the very sight.","For the things of the land were turned into things of the water:\nand the things that before swam in the water passed upon the land.","The fire had power in water above its own virtue, and the water\nforgot its quenching nature.","On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of\ncorruptible animals walking therein, neither did they melt that good\nfood, which was apt to melt as ice.  For in all things thou didst\nmagnify thy people, O Lord, and didst honour them, and didst not\ndespise them, but didst assist them at all times, and in every place."]}
