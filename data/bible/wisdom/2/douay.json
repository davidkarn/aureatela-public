{"verses":["For they have said, reasoning with themselves, but not right:  The\ntime of our life is short and tedious, and in the end of a man there is\nno remedy, and no man hath been known to have returned from hell:","For we are born of nothing, and after this we shall be as if we\nhad not been:  for the breath in our nostrils is smoke:  and speech a\nspark to move our heart,","Which being put out, our body shall be ashes, and our spirit shall\nbe poured abroad as soft air, and our life shall pass away as the trace\nof a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, which is driven away by\nthe beams of the sun, and overpowered with the heat thereof:","And our name in time shall be forgotten, and no man shall have any\nremembrance of our works.","For our time is as the passing of a shadow, and there is no going\nback of our end:  for it is fast sealed, and no man returneth:","Come, therefore, and let us enjoy the good things that are\npresent, and let us speedily use the creatures as in youth.","Let us fill ourselves with costly wine, and ointments:  and let not\nthe flower of the time pass by us.","Let us crown ourselves with roses, before they be withered:  let no\nmeadow escape our riot.","Let none of us go without his part in luxury:  let us every where\nleave tokens of joy:  for this is our portion, and this our lot.","Let us oppress the poor just man, and not spare the widow, nor\nhonour the ancient grey hairs of the aged.","But let our strength be the law of justice:  for that which is\nfeeble is found to be nothing worth.","Let us, therefore, lie in wait for the just, because he is not\nfor our turn, and he is contrary to our doings, and upbraideth us with\ntransgressions of the law, and divulgeth against us the sins of our way\nof life.","He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth\nhimself the son of God.","He is become a censurer of our thoughts.","He is grievous unto us, even to behold:  for his life is not like\nother men's, and his ways are very different.","We are esteemed by him as triflers, and he abstaineth from our\nways as from filthiness, and he preferreth the latter end of the just,\nand glorieth that he hath God for his father.","Let us see then if his words be true, and let us prove what shall\nhappen to him, and we shall know what his end shall be.","For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will\ndeliver him from the hands of his enemies.","Let us examine him by outrages and tortures, that we may know his\nmeekness, and try his patience.","Let us condemn him to a most shameful death:  for there shall be\nrespect had unto him by his words.","These things they thought, and were deceived:  for their own\nmalice blinded them.","And they knew not the secrets of God, nor hoped for the wages of\njustice, nor esteemed the honour of holy souls.","For God created man incorruptible, and to the image of his own\nlikeness he made him.","But by the envy of the devil, death came into the world:","And they follow him that are of his side."]}
