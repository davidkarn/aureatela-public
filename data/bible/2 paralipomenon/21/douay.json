{"verses":["And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in\nthe city of David:  and Joram his son reigned in his stead.","And he had brethren the sons of Josaphat, Azarias, and Jahiel,\nand Zacharias, and Azaria, and Michael, and Saphatias, all these were\nthe sons of Josaphat king of Juda.","And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,\nand pensions, with strong cities in Juda:  but the kingdom he gave to\nJoram, because he was the eldest.","So Joram rose up over the kingdom of his father:  and when he had\nestablished himself, he slew all his brethren with the sword, and some\nof the princes of Israel.","Joram was two and thirty years old when he began to reign:  and he\nreigned eight years in Jerusalem.","And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of\nAchab had done:  for his wife was a daughter of Achab, and he did evil\nin the sight of the Lord.","But the Lord would not destroy the house of David:  because of the\ncovenant which he had made with him:  and because he had promised to\ngive a lamp to him, and to his sons for ever.","In those days Edom revolted, from being subject to Juda, and made\nthemselves a king.","And Joram went over with his princes, and all his cavalry with\nhim, and rose in the night, and defeated the Edomites who had\nsurrounded him, and all the captains of his cavalry.","However Edom revolted, from being under the dominion of Juda\nunto this day:  at that time Lobna also revolted, from being under his\nhand.  For he had forsaken the Lord the God of his fathers.","Moreover he built also high places in the cities of Juda, and he\nmade the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and Juda to\ntransgress.","And there was a letter brought him from Eliseus the prophet, in\nwhich it was written:  Thus saith the Lord the God of David thy father:\nBecause thou hast not walked in the ways of Josaphat thy father nor in\nthe ways of Asa king of Juda,","But hast walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and hast\nmade Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication,\nimitating the fornication of the house of Achab, moreover also thou\nhast killed thy brethren, the house of thy father, better men than\nthyself,","Behold the Lord will strike thee with a great plague, with all\nthy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance.","And thou shalt be sick of a very grievous disease of thy bowels,\ntill thy vital parts come out by little and little every day.","And the Lord stirred up against Joram the spirit of the\nPhilistines, and of the Arabians, who border on the Ethiopians.","And they came up into the land of Juda, and wasted it, and they\ncarried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, his\nsons also, and his wives:  so that there was no son left him but\nJoachaz, who was the youngest.","And besides all this the Lord struck him with an incurable\ndisease in his bowels.","And as day came after day, and time rolled on, two whole years\npassed:  then after being wasted with a long consumption, so as to void\nhis very bowels, his disease ended with his life.  And he died of a most\nwretched illness, and the people did not make a funeral for him\naccording to the manner of burning, as they had done for his ancestors.","He was two and thirty years old when he began his reign, and he\nreigned eight years in Jerusalem.  And he walked not rightly, and they\nburied him in the city of David:  but not in the sepulchres of the\nkings."]}
