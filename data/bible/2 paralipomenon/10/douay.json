{"verses":["And Roboam went to Sichem:  for thither all Israel were assembled,\nto make him king.","And when Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who was in Egypt, (for he was\nfled thither from Solomon,) heard it, forthwith he returned.","And they sent for him, and he came with all Israel, and they\nspoke to Roboam, saying:","Thy father oppressed with a most grievous yoke, do thou govern us\nwith a lighter hand than thy father, who laid upon us a heavy\nservitude, and ease some thing of the burden, that we may serve thee.","And he said to them:  Come to me again after three days.  And when\nthe people were gone,","He took counsel with the ancients, who had stood before his\nfather Solomon, while he yet lived, saying:  What counsel give you to\nme, that I may answer the people?","And they said to him:  If thou please this people, and soothe them\nwith kind words, they will be thy servants for ever.","But he forsook the counsel of the ancients, and began to treat\nwith the young men, that had been brought up with him, and were in his\ntrain.","And he said to them:  What seemeth good to you?  or what shall I\nanswer this people, who have said to me:  Ease the yoke which thy father\nlaid upon us?","But they answered as young men, and brought up with him in\npleasures, and said:  Thus shalt thou speak to the people, that said to\nthee:  Thy father made our yoke heavy, do thou ease it:  thus shalt thou\nanswer them:  My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father.","My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add more weight\nto it:  my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with\nscorpions.","So Jeroboam, and all the people came to Roboam the third day, as\nhe commanded them.","And the king answered roughly, leaving the counsel of the\nancients.","And he spoke according to the advice of the young men:  My father\nlaid upon you a heavy yoke, which I will make heavier:  my father beat\nyou with scourges, but I will beat you with scorpions.","And he condescended not to the people's requests:  for it was the\nwill of God, that his word might be fulfilled which he had spoken by\nthe hand of Ahias the Silonite to Jeroboam the son of Nabat.","And all the people upon the king's speaking roughly, said thus\nunto him:  We have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Isai.\nReturn to thy dwellings, O Israel, and do thou, O David feed thy own\nhouse.  And Israel went away to their dwellings.","But Roboam reigned over the children of Israel that dwelt in the\ncities of Juda.","And king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tributes, and the\nchildren of Israel stoned him, and he died:  and king Roboam made haste\nto get up into his chariot, and fled into Jerusalem.","And Israel revolted from the house of David unto this day."]}
