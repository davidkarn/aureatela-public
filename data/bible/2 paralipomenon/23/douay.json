{"verses":["And in the seventh year Joiada being encouraged, took the\ncaptains of hundreds, to wit, Azarias the son of Jeroham, and Ismahel\nthe son of Johanan, and Azarias the son of Obed, and Maasias the son of\nAdaias, and Elisaphat the son of Zechri:  and made a covenant with them.","And they went about Juda, and gathered together the Levites out\nof all the cities of Juda, and the chiefs of the families of Israel,\nand they came to Jerusalem.","And all the multitude made a covenant with the king in the house\nof God:  and Joiada said to them:  Behold the king's son shall reign, as\nthe Lord hath said of the sons of David.","And this is the thing that you shall do:","A third part of you that come to the sabbath, of the priests, and\nof the Levites, and of the porters shall be at the gates:  and a third\npart at the king's house:  and a third at the gate that is called the\nFoundation:  but let all the rest of the people be in the courts of the\nhouse of the Lord.","And let no one come into the house of the Lord, but the priests,\nand they that minister of the Levites:  let them only come in, because\nthey are sanctified:  and let all the rest of the people keep the\nwatches of the Lord.","And let the Levites be round about the king, every man with his\narms; and if any other come into the temple, let him be slain; and let\nthem be with the king, both coming in, and going out.","So the Levites, and all Juda did according to all that Joiada the\nhigh priest had commanded:  and they took every one his men that were\nunder him, and that came in by the course of the sabbath, with those\nwho had fulfilled the sabbath, and were to go out.  For Joiada the high\npriest permitted not the companies to depart, which were accustomed to\nsucceed one another every week.","And Joiada the priest gave to the captains the spears, and the\nshields, and targets of king David, which he had dedicated in the house\nof the Lord.","And he set all the people with swords in their hands from the\nright side of the temple, to the left side of the temple, before the\naltar, and the temple, round about the king.","And they brought out the king's son, and put the crown upon him,\nand the testimony, and gave him the law to hold in his hand, and they\nmade him king:  and Joiada the high priest and his sons anointed him:\nand they prayed for him, and said:  God save the king.","Now when Athalia heard the noise of the people running and\npraising the king, she came in to the people, into the temple of the\nLord.","And when she saw the king standing upon the step in the\nentrance, and the princes, and the companies about him, and all the\npeople of the land rejoicing, and sounding with trumpets, and playing\non instruments of divers kinds, and the voice of those that praised,\nshe rent her garments, and said:  Treason, treason.","And Joiada the high priest going out to the captains, and the\nchiefs of the army, said to them:  Take her forth without the precinct\nof the temple, and when she is without let her be killed with the\nsword.  For the priest commanded that she should not be killed in the\nhouse of the Lord.","And they laid hold on her by the neck:  and when she was come\nwithin the horse gate of the palace, they killed her there.","And Joiada made a covenant between himself and all the people,\nand the king, that they should be the people of the lord.","And all the people went into the house of Baal, and destroyed\nit:  and they broke down his altars and his idols:  and they slew Mathan\nthe priest of Baal before the altars.","And Joiada appointed overseers in the house of the Lord, under\nthe hands of the priests, and the Levites, whom David had distributed\nin the house of the Lord:  to offer holocausts to the Lord, as it is\nwritten in the law of Moses, with joy and singing, according to the\ndisposition of David.","He appointed also porters in the gates of the house of the Lord,\nthat none who was unclean in any thing should enter in.","And he took the captains of hundreds, and the most valiant men,\nand the chiefs of the people, and all the people of the land, and they\nbrought down the king from the house of the Lord, and brought him\nthrough the upper gate into the king's house, and set him on the royal\nthrone.","And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet:\nbut Athalia was slain with the sword."]}
