{"verses":["And all the people of Juda took his son Ozias, who was sixteen\nyears old, and made him king in the room of Amasias his father.","He built Ailath, and restored it to the dominion of Juda, after\nthat the king slept with his fathers.","Ozias was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he\nreigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was\nJechelia of Jerusalem.","And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord,\naccording to all that Amasias his father had done.","And he sought the Lord in the days of Zacharias that understood\nand saw God:  and as long as he sought the Lord, he directed him in all\nthings.","Moreover he went forth and fought against the Philistines, and\nbroke down the wall of Geth, and the wall of Jabnia, and the wall of\nAzotus:  and he built towns in Azotus, and among the Philistines.","And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the\nArabians, that dwelt in Gurbaal, and against the Ammonites.","And the Ammonites gave gifts to Ozias:  and his name was spread\nabroad even to the entrance of Egypt for his frequent victories.","And Ozias built towers in Jerusalem over the gate of the corner,\nand over the gate of the valley, and the rest, in the same side of the\nwall, and fortified them.","And he built towers in the wilderness, and dug many cisterns,\nfor he had much cattle both in the plains, and in the waste of the\ndesert:  he had also vineyards and dressers of vines in the mountains,\nand in Carmel:  for he was a man that loved husbandry.","And the army of his fighting men, that went out to war, was\nunder the hand of Jehiel the scribe, and Maasias the doctor, and under\nthe hand of Henanias, who was one of the king's captains.","And the whole number of the chiefs by the families of valiant\nmen were two thousand six hundred.","And the whole army under them three hundred and seven thousand\nfive hundred:  who were fit for war, and fought for the king against the\nenemy.","And Ozias prepared for them, that is, for the whole army,\nshields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and\nslings to cast stones.","And he made in Jerusalem engines of diverse kinds, which he\nplaced in the towers, and in the corners of the walls, to shoot arrows,\nand great stones:  and his name went forth far abroad, for the Lord\nhelped him, and had strengthened him.","But when he was made strong, his heart was lifted up to his\ndestruction, and he neglected the Lord his God:  and going into the\ntemple of the Lord, he had a mind to burn incense upon the altar of\nincense.","And immediately Azarias the priest going in after him, and with\nhim fourscore priests of the Lord, most valiant men,","Withstood the king and said:  It doth not belong to thee, Ozias,\nto burn incense to the Lord, but to the priests, that is, to the sons\nof Aaron, who are consecrated for this ministry:  go out of the\nsanctuary, do not despise:  for this thing shall not be accounted to thy\nglory by the Lord God.","And Ozias was angry, and holding in his hand the censer to burn\nincense, threatened the priests.  And presently there rose a leprosy in\nhis forehead before the priests, in the house of the Lord at the altar\nof incense.","And Azarias the high priest, and all the rest of the priests\nlooked upon him, and saw the leprosy in his forehead, and they made\nhaste to thrust him out.  Yea himself also being frightened, hasted to\ngo out, because he had quickly felt the stroke of the Lord.","And Ozias the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and he\ndwelt in a house apart being full of the leprosy, for which he had been\ncast out of the house of the Lord.  And Joatham his son governed the\nking's house, and judged the people of the land.","But the rest of the acts of Ozias first and last were written by\nIsaias the son of Amos, the prophet.","And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the\nfield of the royal sepulchres, because he was a leper:  and Joatham his\nson reigned in his stead."]}
