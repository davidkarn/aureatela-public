{"verses":["Now Ezechias began to reign, when he was five and twenty years\nold, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem:  the name of his\nmother was Abia, the daughter of Zacharias.","And he did that which was pleasing in the sight of the Lord,\naccording to all that David his father had done.","In the first year and month of his reign he opened the doors of\nthe house of the Lord, and repaired them.","And he brought the priests and the Levites, and assembled them in\nthe east street.","And he said to them:  Hear me, ye Levites, and be sanctified,\npurify the house of the Lord the God of your fathers, and take away all\nfilth out of the sanctuary.","Our fathers have sinned and done evil in the sight of the Lord\nGod, forsaking him:  they have turned away their faces from the\ntabernacle of the Lord, and turned their backs.","They have shut up the doors that were in the porch, and put out\nthe lamps, and have not burnt incense, nor offered holocausts in the\nsanctuary of the God of Israel.","Therefore the wrath of the Lord hath been stirred up against Juda\nand Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, and to\ndestruction, and to be hissed at, as you see with your eyes.","Behold, our fathers are fallen by the sword, our sons, and our\ndaughters, and wives are led away captives for this wickedness.","Now therefore I have a mind that we make a covenant with the\nLord the God of Israel, and he will turn away the wrath of his\nindignation from us.","My sons, be not negligent:  the Lord hath chosen you to stand\nbefore him, and to minister to him, and to worship him, and to burn\nincense to him.","Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the\nson of Azarias, of the sons of Caath:  and of the sons of Merari, Cis\nthe son of Abdi, and Azarias the son of Jalaleel.  And of the sons of\nGerson, Joah the son of Zemma, and Eden the son of Joah.","And of the sons of Elisaphan, Samri, and Jahiel.  Also of the\nsons of Asaph, Zacharias, and Mathanias.","And of the sons of Heman, Jahiel, and Semei:  and of the sons of\nIdithun, Semeias, and Oziel.","And they gathered together their brethren, and sanctified\nthemselves, and went in according to the commandment of the king, and\nthe precept of the Lord, to purify the house of God.","And the priests went into the temple of the Lord to sanctify it,\nand brought out all the uncleanness that they found within to the\nentrance of the house of the Lord, and the Levites took it away, and\ncarried it out abroad to the torrent Cedron.","And they began to cleanse on the first day of the first month,\nand on the eighth day of the same month they came into the porch of the\ntemple of the Lord, and they purified the temple in eight days, and on\nthe sixteenth day of the same month they finished what they had begun.","And they went in to king Ezechias, and said to him:  We have\nsanctified all the house of the Lord, and the altar of holocaust, and\nthe vessels thereof, and the table of proposition with all its vessels,","And all the furniture of the temple, which king Achaz in his\nreign had defiled, after his transgression; and behold they are all set\nforth before the altar of the Lord.","And king Ezechias rising early, assembled all the rulers of the\ncity, and went up into the house of the Lord:","And they offered together seven bullocks, and seven rams, and\nseven lambs, and seven he goats for sin, for the kingdom, for the\nsanctuary, for Juda:  and he spoke to the priests the sons of Aaron, to\noffer them upon the altar of the Lord.","Therefore they killed the bullocks, and the priests took the\nblood, and poured it upon the altar; they killed also the rams, and\ntheir blood they poured also upon the altar, and they killed the lambs,\nand poured the blood upon the altar.","And they brought the he goats for sin before the king, and the\nwhole multitude, and they laid their hand upon them:","And the priests immolated them, and sprinkled their blood before\nthe altar for an expiation of all Israel:  for the king had commanded\nthat the holocaust and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.","And he set the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals,\nand psalteries, and harps according to the regulation of David the\nking, and of Gad the seer, and of Nathan the prophet:  for it was the\ncommandment of the Lord by the hand of his prophets.","And the Levites stood, with the instruments of David, and the\npriests with trumpets.","And Ezechias commanded that they should offer holocausts upon\nthe altar:  and when the holocausts were offered, they began to sing\npraises to the Lord, and to sound with trumpets, and divers instruments\nwhich David the king of Israel had prepared.","And all the multitude adored, and the singers, and the\ntrumpeters, were in their office till the holocaust was finished.","And when the oblation was ended, the king, and all that were\nwith him bowed down and adored.","And Ezechias and the princes commanded the Levites to praise the\nLord with the words of David, and Asaph the seer:  and they praised him\nwith great joy, and bowing the knee adored.","And Ezechias added, and said:  You have filled your hands to the\nLord, come and offer victims, and praises in the house of the Lord.  And\nall the multitude offered victims, and praises, and holocausts with a\ndevout mind.","And the number of the holocausts which the multitude offered,\nwas seventy bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs.","And they consecrated to the Lord six hundred oxen, and three\nthousand sheep.","But the priests were few, and were not enough to flay the\nholocausts:  wherefore the Levites their brethren helped them, till the\nwork was ended, and priests were sanctified, for the Levites are\nsanctified with an easier rite than the priests.","So there were many holocausts, and the fat of peace offerings,\nand the libations of holocausts:  and the service of the house of the\nLord was completed.","And Ezechias, and all the people rejoiced because the ministry\nof the Lord was accomplished.  For the resolution of doing this thing\nwas taken suddenly."]}
