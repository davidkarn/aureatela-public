{"verses":["Joas was seven years old when he began to reign:  and he reigned\nforty years in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was Sebia of Bersabee.","And he did that which is good before the Lord all the days of\nJoiada the priest.","And Joiada took for him two wives, by whom he had sons and\ndaughters.","After this Joas had a mind to repair the house of the Lord.","And he assembled the priests, and the Levites, and said to them:\nGo out to the cities of Juda, and gather of all Israel money to repair\nthe temple of your God, from year to year:  and do this with speed:  but\nthe Levites were negligent.","And the king called Joiada the chief, and said to him:  Why hast\nthou not taken care to oblige the Levites to bring in out of Juda and\nJerusalem the money that was appointed by Moses the servant of the Lord\nfor all the multitude of Israel to bring into the tabernacle of the\ntestimony?","For that wicked woman Athalia, and her children have destroyed\nthe house of God, and adorned the temple of Baal with all the things\nthat had been dedicated in the temple of the Lord.","And the king commanded, and they made a chest:  and set it by the\ngate of the house of the Lord on the outside.","And they made a proclamation in Juda and Jerusalem, that every\nman should bring to the Lord the money which Moses the servant of God\nappointed for all Israel, in the desert.","And all the princes, and all the people rejoiced:  and going in\nthey contributed and cast so much into the chest of the Lord, that it\nwas filled.","And when it was time to bring the chest before the king by the\nhands of the Levites, (for they saw there was much money,) the king's\nscribe, and he whom the high priest had appointed went in:  and they\npoured out the money that was in the chest:  and they carried back the\nchest to its place:  and thus they did from day to day, and there was\ngathered an immense sum of money.","And the king and Joiada gave it to those who were over the works\nof the house of the Lord:  but they hired with it stonecutters, and\nartificers of every kind of work to repair the house of the Lord:  and\nsuch as wrought in iron and brass, to uphold what began to be falling.","And the workmen were diligent, and the breach of the walls was\nclosed up by their hands, and they set up the house of the Lord in its\nformer state, and made it stand firm.","And when they had finished all the works, they brought the rest\nof the money before the king and Joiada:  and with it were made vessels\nfor the temple for the ministry, and for holocausts and bowls, and\nother vessels of gold and silver:  and holocausts were offered in the\nhouse of the Lord continually all the days of Joiada.","But Joiada grew old and was full of days, and died when he was a\nhundred and thirty years old.","And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,\nbecause he had done good to Israel, and to his house.","And after the death of Joiada, the princes of Juda went in, and\nworshipped the king:  and he was soothed by their services and hearkened\nto them.","And they forsook the temple of the Lord the God of their\nfathers, and served groves and idols, and wrath came upon Juda and\nJerusalem for this sin.","And he sent prophets to them to bring them back to the Lord, and\nthey would not give ear when they testified against them.","The spirit of God then came upon Zacharias the son of Joiada the\npriest, and he stood in the sight of the people, and said to them:  Thus\nsaith the Lord God:  Why transgress you the commandment of the Lord\nwhich will not be for your good, and have forsaken the Lord, to make\nhim forsake you?","And they gathered themselves together against him, and stoned\nhim at the king's commandment in the court of the house of the Lord.","And king Joas did not remember the kindness that Joiada his\nfather had done to him, but killed his son.  And when he died, he said:\nThe Lord see, and require it.","And when a year was come about, the army of Syria came up\nagainst him:  and they came to Juda and Jerusalem, and killed all the\nprinces of the people, and they sent all the spoils to the king of\nDamascus.","And whereas there came a very small number of the Syrians, the\nLord delivered into their hands an infinite multitude, because they had\nforsaken the Lord the God of their fathers:  and on Joas they executed\nshameful judgments.","And departing they left him in great diseases:  and his servants\nrose up against him, for revenge of the blood of the son of Joiada the\npriest, and they slew him in his bed, and he died:  and they buried him\nin the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.","Now the men that conspired against him were Zabad the son of\nSemmaath an Ammonitess, and Jozabad the son of Semarith a Moabitess.","And concerning his sons, and the sum of money which was gathered\nunder him, and the repairing the house of God, they are written more\ndiligently in the book of kings:  and Amasias his son reigned in his\nstead."]}
