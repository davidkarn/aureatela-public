{"verses":["Joatham was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and\nhe reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem:  the name of his mother was\nJerusa the daughter of Sadoc.","And he did that which was right before the Lord, according to all\nthat Ozias his father had done, only that he entered not into the\ntemple of the Lord, and the people still transgressed.","He built the high gate of the house of the Lord, and on the wall\nof Ophel he built much.","Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Juda, and castles\nand towers in the forests.","He fought against the king of the children of Ammon, and overcame\nthem, and the children of Ammon gave him at that time a hundred talents\nof silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and as many measures of\nbarley:  so much did the children of Ammon give him in the second and\nthird year.","And Joatham was strengthened, because he had his way directed\nbefore the Lord his God.","Now the rest of the acts of Joatham, and all his wars, and his\nworks, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Juda.","He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he\nreigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.","And Joatham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the\ncity of David:  and Achaz his son reigned in his stead."]}
