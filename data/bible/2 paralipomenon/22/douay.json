{"verses":["And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ochozias his youngest son\nking in his place:  for the rovers of the Arabians, who had broke in\nupon the camp, had killed all that were his elder brothers.  So Ochozias\nthe son of Joram king of Juda reigned.","Ochozias was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he\nreigned one year in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother was Athalia\nthe daughter of Amri.","He also walked in the ways of the house of Achab:  for his mother\npushed him on to do wickedly.","So he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as the house of Achab\ndid:  for they were his counsellors after the death of his father, to\nhis destruction.","And he walked after their counsels.  And he went with Joram the\nson of Achab king of Israel, to fight against Hazael king of Syria, at\nRamoth Galaad:  and the Syrians wounded Joram.","And he returned to be healed in Jezrahel:  for he received many\nwounds in the foresaid battle.  And Ochozias the son of Joram king of\nJuda, went down to visit Joram the son of Achab in Jezrahel where he\nlay sick.","For it was the will of God against Ochozias that he should come\nto Joram:  and when he was come should go out also against Jehu the son\nof Namsi, whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house of Achab.","So when Jehu was rooting out the house of Achab, he found the\nprinces of Juda, and the sons of the brethren of Ochozias, who served\nhim, and he slew them.","And he sought for Ochozias himself, and took him lying hid in\nSamaria:  and when he was brought to him, he killed him, and they buried\nhim:  because he was the son of Josaphat, who had sought the Lord with\nall his heart.  And there was no more hope that any one should reign of\nthe race of Ochozias.","For Athalia his mother, seeing that her son was dead, rose up,\nand killed all the royal family of the house of Joram.","But Josabeth the king's daughter took Joas the son of Ochozias,\nand stole him from among the king's sons that were slain.  And she hid\nhim with his nurse in a bedchamber:  now Josabeth that hid him, was\ndaughter of king Joram, wife of Joiada the high priest, and sister of\nOchozias, and therefore Athalia did not kill him.","And he was with them hid in the house of God six years, during\nwhich Athalia reigned over the land."]}
