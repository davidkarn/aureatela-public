{"verses":["This was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the Lord, and\nI saw, and I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that\nspoke, and he said to me:  Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will\nspeak to thee.","And the spirit entered into me after that he spoke to me, and he\nset me upon my feet:  and I heard him speaking to me,","And saying:  Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to\na rebellious people, that hath revolted from me, they, and their\nfathers, have transgressed my covenant even unto this day.","And they to whom I send thee are children of a hard face, and of\nan obstinate heart:  and thou shalt say to them:  Thus saith the Lord\nGod:","If so be they at least will hear, and if so be they will forbear,\nfor they are a provoking house:  and they shall know that there hath\nbeen a prophet in the midst of them.","And thou, O son of man, fear not, neither be thou afraid of their\nwords:  for thou art among unbelievers and destroyers, and thou dwellest\nwith scorpions.  Fear not their words, neither be thou dismayed at their\nlooks:  for they are a provoking house.","And thou shalt speak my words to them, if perhaps they will hear,\nand forbear:  for they provoke me to anger.","But thou, O son of man, hear all that I say to thee:  and do not\nthou provoke me, as that house provoketh me:  open thy mouth, and eat\nwhat I give thee.","And I looked, and behold, a hand was sent to me, wherein was a\nbook rolled up:  and he spread it before me, and it was written within\nand without:  and there were written in it lamentations, and canticles,\nand woe."]}
