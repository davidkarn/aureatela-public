{"verses":["Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on\nthe fifth day of the month, when I was in the midst of the captives by\nthe river Chobar, the heavens were opened, and I saw the visions of\nGod.","On the fifth day of the month, the same was the fifth year of the\ncaptivity of king Joachin,","The word of the Lord came to Ezechiel the priest the son of Buzi\nin the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chobar:  and the hand of the\nLord was there upon him.","And I saw, and behold a whirlwind came out of the north:  and a\ngreat cloud, and a fire infolding it, and brightness was about it:  and\nout of the midst thereof, that is, out of the midst of the fire, as it\nwere the resemblance of amber:","And in the midst thereof the likeness of four living creatures:\nand this was their appearance:  there was the likeness of a man in them.","Every one had four faces, and every one four wings.","Their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their foot was like\nthe sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of\nglowing brass.","And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four\nsides:  and they had faces, and wings on the four sides,","And the wings of one were joined to the wings of another.  They\nturned not when they went:  but every one went straight forward.","And as for the likeness of their faces:  there was the face of a\nman, and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four:  and the\nface of an ox, on the left side of all the four:  and the face of an\neagle over all the four.","And their faces, and their wings were stretched upward:  two wings\nof every one were joined, and two covered their bodies:","And every one of them went straight forward:  whither the impulse\nof the spirit was to go, thither they went:  and they turned not when\nthey went.","And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance\nwas like that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of\nlamps.  This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the\nliving creatures, a bright fire, and lightning going forth from the\nfire.","And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of\nlightning.","Now as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the\nearth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces.","And the appearance of the wheels, and the work of them was like\nthe appearance of the sea:  and the four had all one likeness:  and their\nappearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a\nwheel.","When they went, they went by their four parts:  and they turned\nnot when they went.","The wheels had also a size, and a height, and a dreadful\nappearance:  and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the\nfour.","And, when the living creatures went, the wheels also went\ntogether by them:  and when the living creatures were lifted up from the\nearth, the wheels also were lifted up with them.","Withersoever the spirit went, thither as the spirit went the\nwheels also were lifted up withal, and followed it:  for the spirit of\nlife was in the wheels.","When those went these went, and when those stood these stood, and\nwhen those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up\ntogether, and followed them:  for the spirit of life was in the wheels.","And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of\nthe firmament, the appearance of crystal terrible to behold, and\nstretched out over their heads above.","And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward\nthe other, every one with two wings covered his body, and the other was\ncovered in like manner.","And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many\nwaters, as it were the voice of the most high God:  when they walked, it\nwas like the voice of a multitude, like the noise of an army, and when\nthey stood, their wings were let down.","For when a voice came from above the firmament, that was over\ntheir heads, they stood, and let down their wings.","And above the firmament that was over their heads, was the\nlikeness of a throne, as the appearance of the sapphire stone, and upon\nthe likeness of the throne, was the likeness of the appearance of a man\nabove upon it.","And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber as the appearance\nof fire within it round about:  from his loins and upward, and from his\nloins downward, I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round\nabout.","As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy\nday:  this was the appearance of the brightness round about."]}
