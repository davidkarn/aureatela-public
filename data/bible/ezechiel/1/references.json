Why should I not mourn, you say? Jacob lint on sackcloth for Joseph, and when all his family gathered round him, refused to be comforted. \"I will go down,\" he said, \"into the grave unto my son mourning.\"[fn-12-P1230_263754:826-nf] David also mourned for Absalom, covering his face, and crying: \"O my son, Absalom ...my son, Absalom! Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son!\"[fn-12-P1231_263929:827-nf] Moses,[fn-12-P1232_263961:828-nf] too, and Aaron,[fn-12-P1233_264000:829-nf] and the rest of the saints were mourned for with a solemn mourning. The answer to your reasoning issimple. Jacob, it is true, mourned for Joseph, whom he fancied slain, and thought tomeet only in the grave (his words were: \"I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning\"), but he only did so because Christ had not yet broken open the door of paradise, nor quenched with his blood the flaming sword and the whirling of the guardian cherubim.[fn-12-P1234_264466:830-nf] (Hence in the story of Dives and Lazarus, Abraham and the beggar, though really in a place of refreshment, are described as being in hell.[fn-12-P1235_264876:831-nf] ) And David, who, after interceding in vain for the life of his infant child, refused to weep for it, knowing that it had not sinned, did well to weep for a son who had been a parricide-in will, if not in deed.[fn-12-P1236_265121:832-nf] And when we read that, for Moses and Aaron, lamentation was made after ancient custom, this ought not to surprise us, for even in the Acts of the Apostles, in the full blaze of the gospel, we see that the brethren at Jerusalem made great lamentation for Stephen.[fn-12-P1237_265409:833-nf] This great lamentation, however, refers not to the mourners, but to the funeral procession and to the crowds which accompanied it. This is what the Scripture says of Jacob: \"Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, and all the house of Joseph and his brethren\"; and a few lines farther on: \"And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a great company.\" Finally, \"they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation.\"[fn-12-P1238_265980:834-nf] This solemn lamentation does not impose prolonged weeping upon the Egyptians, but simply describes the funeral ceremony. In like manner, when we read of weeping made for Moses and Aaron,[fn-12-P1239_266188:835-nf] this is all that is meant.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"642","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"9.

Let me now fulfil the promise I made a little while ago and with all the skill of a rhetorician sing the praises of water and of baptism. In the beginning the earth was without form and void, there was no dazzling sun or pale moon, there were no glittering stars. There was nothing but matter inorganic and invisible, and even this was lost in abysmal depths and shrouded in a distorting gloom. The Spirit of God above moved, as a charioteer, over the face of the waters,[fn-28-P2879_762983:2051-nf] and produced from them the infant world, a type of the Christian child that is drawn from the laver of baptism. A firmament is constructed between heaven and earth, and to this is allotted the name heaven,-in the Hebrew Shamayim or `what comes out of the waters,'-[fn-28-P2880_763268:2052-nf] and the waters which are above the heavens are parted from the others to the praise of God. Wherefore also in the vision of the prophet Ezekiel there is seen above the cherubim a crystal stretched forth,[fn-28-P2881_763585:2053-nf] that is, the compressed and denser waters. The first living beings come out of the waters; and believers soar out of the layer with wings to heaven. Man is formed out of clay[fn-28-P2882_763782:2054-nf] and God holds the mystic waters in the hollow of his hand.[fn-28-P2883_763862:2055-nf] In Eden a garden[fn-28-P2884_763944:2056-nf] is planted, and a fountain in the midst of it parts into four heads.[fn-28-P2885_764033:2057-nf] This is the same fountain which Ezekiel later on describes as issuing out of the temple and flowing towards the rising of the sun, until it heals the bitter waters and quickens those that are dead.[fn-28-P2886_764265:2058-nf] When the world falls into sin nothing but a flood of waters can cleanse it again. But as soon as the foul bird of wickedness is driven away, the dove of the Holy Spirit comes to Noah[fn-28-P2887_764489:2059-nf] as it came afterwards to Christ in the Jordan,[fn-28-P2888_764574:2060-nf] and, carrying ill its beak a branch betokening restoration and light, brings tidings of peace to the whole world. Pharaoh and his host, loth to allow God's people to leave Egypt, are overwhelmed in the Red Sea figuring thereby our baptism. His destruction is thus described in the book of Psalms: \"Thou didst endow the sea with virtue through thy power: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters: thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces.\"[fn-28-P2889_765053:2061-nf] For this reason adders and scorpions haunt dry places[fn-28-P2890_765139:2062-nf] and whenever they come near water behave as if rabid or insane.[fn-28-P2891_765228:2063-nf] As wood sweetens Marah so that seventy palm-trees are watered by its streams, so the cross makes the waters of the law lifegiving to the seventy who are Christ's apostles.[fn-28-P2892_765444:2064-nf] It is Abraham and Isaac who dig wells, the Philistines who try to prevent them.[fn-28-P2893_765561:2065-nf] Beersheba too, the city of the oath,[fn-28-P2894_765637:2066-nf] and [Gihon], the scene of Solomon's coronation,[fn-28-P2895_765708:2067-nf] derive their names from springs. It is beside a well that Eliezer finds Rebekah.[fn-28-P2896_765833:2068-nf] Rachel too is a drawer of water and wins a kiss thereby[fn-28-P2897_765928:2069-nf] from the supplanter[fn-28-P2898_765987:2070-nf] Jacob. When the daughters of the priests of Midian are in a strait to reach the well, Moses opens a way for them and delivers them from outrage.[fn-28-P2899_766157:2071-nf] The Lord's forerunner at Salem (a name which means peace or perfection) makes ready the people for Christ with spring-water.[fn-29-P2900_766319:2072-nf] The Saviour Himself does not preach the kingdom of heaven until by His baptismal immersion He has cleansed the Jordan.[fn-29-P2901_766461:2073-nf] Water is the matter of His first miracle[fn-29-P2902_766542:2074-nf] and it is from a well that the Samaritan woman is bidden to slake her thirst.[fn-29-P2903_766699:2075-nf] To Nicodemus He secretly says:-\"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.\"[fn-29-P2904_766857:2076-nf] As His earthly course began with water, so it ended with it. His side is pierced by the spear, and blood and water flow forth, twin emblems of baptism and of martyrdom.[fn-29-P2905_767048:2077-nf] After His resurrection also, when sending His apostles to the Gentiles, He commands them to baptize these in the mystery of the Trinity.[fn-29-P2906_767263:2078-nf] The Jewish people repenting of their misdoing are sent forthwith by Peter to be baptized.[fn-29-P2907_767380:2079-nf] Before Sion travails she brings forth children, and a nation is born at once.[fn-29-P2908_767480:2080-nf] Paul the persecutor of the church, that ravening wolf out of Benjamin,[fn-29-P2909_767588:2081-nf] bows his head before Ananias one of Christ's sheep, and only recovers his sight when he applies the remedy of baptism.[fn-29-P2910_767731:2082-nf] By the reading of the prophet the eunuch of Candace the queen of Ethiopia is made ready for the baptism of Christ.[fn-29-P2911_767901:2083-nf] Though it is against nature the Ethiopian does change his skin and the leopard his spots.[fn-29-P2912_768018:2084-nf] Those who have received only John's baptism and have no knowledge of the Holy Spirit are baptized again, lest any should suppose that water unsanctified thereby could suffice for the salvation of either Jew or Gentile.[fn-29-P2913_768261:2085-nf] \"The voice of the Lord isupon the waters ...The Lord is uponmany waters ...the Lord maketh the flood to inhabit it.\"[fn-29-P2914_768398:2086-nf] His \"teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which came up from the washing; whereof everyone bear twins, and none is barren among them.\"[fn-29-P2915_768625:2087-nf] If none is barren among them, all of them must have udders filled with milk and be able to say with the apostle: \"Ye are my little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you;\"[fn-29-P2916_768853:2088-nf] and \"I have fed you with milk and not with meat.\"[fn-29-P2917_768925:2089-nf] And it is to the grace of baptism that the prophecy of Micah refers: \"He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us: he will subdue our iniquities, and will cast all our sins[fn-29-P2918_769130:2090-nf] into the depths of the sea.\"[fn-29-P2919_769207:2091-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"156","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"54.[fn-17-P1742_449631:472-nf] Now of the rest of the Powers each is believed to be in a circumscribed place.

But the Spirit is believed to have been operating at the saint time in Habakkuk and in Daniel at Babylon,[fn-17-P1745_450790:475-nf] and to have been at the prison with Jeremiah,[fn-17-P1746_450854:476-nf] and with Ezekiel at the Chebar.[fn-17-P1747_450908:477-nf] For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world,[fn-17-P1748_450984:478-nf] and \"whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?\"[fn-17-P1749_451532:479-nf] And, in the words of the Prophet, \"For I am with you, saith the Lord ... and my spirit remaineth among you.\"[fn-17-P1750_451658:480-nf] But what nature is it becoming to assign to Him who is omnipresent, and exists together with God? The nature which is all-embracing, or one which is confined to particular places, like that which our argument shews the nature of angels to be? No one would so say. Shall we not then highly exalt Him who is in His nature divine, in His greatness infinite, in His operations powerful, in the blessings He confers, good? Shall we not give Him glory? And I understand glory to mean nothing else than the enumeration of the wonders which are His own. It follows then that either we are forbidden by our antagonists even to mention the good things which flow to us from Him. or on the other hand that the mere recapitulation of His attributes is the fullest possible attribution of glory. For not even in the case of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and of the Only begotten Son, are we capable of giving Them glory otherwise than by recounting, to the extent of our powers, all the wonders that belong to Them.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"33. \"Granted,\" says Jovinianus, \"that there is a difference between marriage and virginity, what have you to say to this,-Suppose a virgin and a widow were baptized, and continued as they were, what difference will there be between them?\" What we have already said concerning Peter and John, Anna and Mary, may be of service here. For if there is no difference between a virgin and a widow, both being baptized, because baptism makes a new man, upon the same principle harlots and prostitutes, if they are baptized, will be equal to virgins. If previous marriage is no prejudice to a baptized widow, and past pleasures and the exposure of their bodies to public lust are no detriment in the case of harlots, once they have approached the layer they will gain the rewards of virginity. It is one thing to unite with God a mind pure and free from any stain of memory, another to remember the foul and forced embraces of a man, and in recollection to act a part which you do not in person. Jeremiah, who was[fn-63-P6396_1968656:231-nf] sanctified in the womb, and was known in his mother's belly, enjoyed the high privilege Because he was predestined to the blessing of virginity. And when all were captured, and even the vessels of the temple were plundered by the King of Babylon, he alone was[fn-63-P6397_1968934:232-nf] liberated by the enemy, knew not the insults of captivity, and was supported by the conquerors; and Nebuchadnezzar, though he gave Nebuzaradan no charge concerning the Holy of Holies, did give him charge concerning Jeremiah. For that is the true temple of God, and that is the Holy of Holies, which is consecrated to the Lord by pure virginity. On the other hand, Ezekiel, who was kept captive in Babylon, who saw the[fn-63-P6398_1969387:233-nf] storm approaching from the north, and the whirlwind sweeping all before it, says,[fn-63-P6399_1969488:234-nf] \"My wife died in the evening and I did in the morning as I was commanded.\" For the Lord had previously told him that in that day he should open his mouth, and speak, and no longer keep silence. Mark well, that while his wife was living he was not at liberty to admonish the people. His wife died, the bond of wedlock was broken, and without the least hesitation he constantly devoted himself to the prophetic office. For he who was called being free, is truly the Lord's bondservant. I do not deny the blessedness of widows who remain such after their baptism; nor do I disparage those wives who maintain their chastity in wedlock; but as they attain a greater reward with God than married women who pay the marriage due, let widows themselves the content to give the preference to virginity. For if a chastity which comes too late, when the glow of bodily pleasure is no longer felt, makes them feel superior to married women, why should they not acknowledge themselves inferior to perpetual virginity.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_17_homily_xi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Imagine only what sort of men it was meet for the hearers to become, when they considered that they were at once to be like the prophets, and like those great ones.

And are you not amazed at Manoah the Judge of yore, and at Peter the disciple in later days; the one being unable to endure the sight even of one in whom was a representation of God; and saying, \"We are undone, O wife, we have seen God;\"[fn-43-P4305_1333558:57-nf] speaking as though even a vision of God could not be grasped by human beings, let alone the Nature of God; and the other unable to endure the Presence of Christ in his boat and therefore bidding Him depart;[fn-43-P4306_1333786:58-nf] and this though Peter was more zealous than the others for the knowledge of Christ, and received a blessing for this,[fn-43-P4307_1333920:59-nf] and was entrusted with the greatest gifts. What would you say of Isaiah or Ezekiel, who was an eyewitness of very great mysteries, and of the other Prophets; for one of these saw the Lord of Sabaoth sitting on the Throne of glory,[fn-43-P4308_1334175:60-nf] and encircled and praised and hidden by the sixwinged Seraphim, and was himself purged by the live coal, and equipped for his prophetic office. And the other describes the Cherubic Chariot[fn-43-P4309_1334385:61-nf] of God, and the Throne upon them, and the Firmament over it, and Him that shewed Himself in the Firmament, and Voices, and Forces, and Deeds.[fn-43-P4310_1334547:62-nf] And whether this was an appearance by day, only visible to Saints, or an unerring vision of the night, or an impression on the mind holding converse with the future as if it were the present; or some other ineffable form of prophecy, I cannot say; the God of the Prophets knoweth, and they know who are thus inspired. But neither these of whom I am speaking, nor any of their fellows ever stood before the Council[fn-43-P4311_1334996:63-nf] and Essence of God, as it is written, or saw, or proclaimed the Nature of God.","title":"Oration XXVIII.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"ANF-05","text":"This God, then, setting aside the fables and figments of heretics, the Church knows and worships, to whom the universal and entire nature of things as well visible as invisible gives witness; whom angels adore, stars wonder at, seas bless, lands revere, and all things under the earth look up to; whom the whole mind of man is conscious of, even if it does not express itself; at whose command all things are set in motion, springs gush forth, rivers flow, waves arise, all creatures bring forth their young, winds arc compelled to blow, showers descend, seas arc stirred up, all things everywhere diffuse their fruitfulness. Who ordained, peculiar to the protoplasts of eternal life, a certain beautiful paradise in the east; He planted the tree of life, and similarly placed near it another tree of the knowledge of good and evil, gave a command, and decreed a judgment against sin; He preserved the most righteous Nöe from the perils of the deluge, for the merit of His innocence and faith; He translated Enoch: He elected Abraham into the society of his friendship; He protected Isaac: He increased Jacob; He gave Moses for a leader unto the people; He delivered the groaning children of Israel from the yoke of slavery; He wrote the law; He brought the offspring of our fathers into the land of promise; He instructed the prophets by His Spirit, and by all of them He promised His Son Christ; and at the time at which He had covenanted that He would give Him, He sent Him, and through Him He desired to come into our knowledge, and shed forth upon us the liberal stores of His mercy, by conferring His abundant Spirit on the poor and abject. And, because He of His own free-will is both liberal and kind, lest the whole of this globe, being turned away from the streams of His grace, should wither, He willed the apostles, as founders of our family, to be sent by His Son into the whole world, that the condition of the human race might be conscious of its Founder; and, if it should choose to follow Him, might have One whom even in its supplications it might now call Father instead of God.[fn-101-P10152_3158909:39-nf] And His providence has had or has its course among men, not only individually, but also among cities themselves, and states whose destructions have been announced by the words of prophets; yea, even through the whole world itself; whose end, whose miseries, and wastings, and sufferings on account of unbelief He has allotted. And lest moreover any one should think that such an indefatigable providence of God does not reach to even the very least things, \"One of two sparrows,\" says the Lord, \"shall not fall without the will of the Father; but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.\"[fn-101-P10153_3159686:40-nf] And His care and providence did not permit even the clothes of the Israelites to be worn out, nor even the vilest shoes on their feet to be wasted; nor, moreover, finally, the very garments of the captive young men to be burnt. And this is not without reason; for if He embraces all things, and contains all things,-and all things, and the whole, consist of individuals,-His care will consequently extend even to every individual thing, since His providence reaches to the whole, whatever it is. Hence it is that He also sitteth above the Cherubim; that is, He presides over the variety of His works, the living creatures which hold the control over the rest being subjected to His throne:[fn-101-P10154_3160398:41-nf] a crystal covering being thrown over all things; that is, the heaven covering all things, which at the command of God had been consolidated into a firmament[fn-101-P10155_3160592:42-nf] from the fluent material of the waters, that the strong hardness that divides the midst of the waters that covered the earth before, might sustain as if on its back the weight of the superincumbent water, its strength being established by the frost. And, moreover, wheels lie below-that is to say, the seasons-whereby all the members of the world are always being rolled onwards; such feet being added by which those things do not stand still for ever, but pass onward. And, moreover, throughout all their limbs they are studded with eyes; for the works of God must be contemplated with an ever watchful inspection: in the heart of which things, a fire of embers is in the midst, either because this world of ours is hastening to the fiery day of judgment; or because all the works of God are fiery, and are not darksome, but flourish.[fn-101-P10156_3161728:43-nf] Or, moreover, lest, because those things had arisen from earthly beginnings, they should naturally be inactive, from the rigidity of their origin, the hot nature of an interior spirit was added to all things; and that this nature concreted with the cold bodies might minister[fn-101-P10157_3162044:44-nf] for the purpose of life equal measures for all.[fn-101-P10158_3162153:45-nf] This, therefore, according to David, is God's chariot. \"For the chariot of God,\" says he, \"is multiplied ten thousand times; \"[fn-101-P10159_3162539:46-nf] that is, it is innumerable, infinite, immense.

The prophets, therefore, did not openly behold the actual face of God, but [they saw] the dispensations and the mysteries through which man should afterwards see God. As was also said to Elias: \"Thou shalt go forth tomorrow, and stand in the presence of the Lord; and, behold, a wind great and strong, which shall rend the mountains, and break the rocks in pieces before the Lord. And the Lord [was] not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord [was] not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord [was] not in the fire; and after the fire a scarcely audible voice\" (vox aurae tenuis).[fn-84-P8406_2353445:295-nf] For by such means was the prophet-very indignant, because of the transgression of the people and the slaughter of the prophets-both taught to act in a more gentle manner; and the Lord's advent as a man was pointed out, that it should be subsequent to that law which was given by Moses, mild and tranquil, in which He would neither break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax.[fn-84-P8407_2353857:296-nf] The mild and peaceful repose of His kingdom was indicated likewise. For, after the wind which rends the mountains, and after the earthquake, and after the fire, come the tranquil and peaceful times of His kingdom, in which the spirit of God does, in the most gentle manner, vivify and increase mankind. This, too, was made still clearer by Ezekiel, that the prophets saw the dispensations of God in part, but not actually God Himself. For when this man had seen the vision[fn-84-P8408_2354352:297-nf] of God, and the cherubim, and their wheels, and when he had recounted the mystery of the whole of that progression, and had beheld the likeness of a throne above them, and upon the throne a likeness as of the figure of a man, and the things which were upon his loins as the figure of amber, and what was below like the sight of fire, and when he set forth all the rest of the vision of the thrones, lest any one might happen to think that in those [visions] he had actually seen God, he added: \"This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of God.\"[fn-84-P8409_2354928:298-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_24_the_second_homily","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"ANF-06","text":"It is our duty to present to God, like sacrifices, all the festivals and hymnal celebrations; and first of all, the annunciation to the holy mother of God, to wit, the salutation made to her by the angel, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured!\" For first of all wisdom[fn-11-P1191_296906:2-nf] and saving doctrine in the New Testament was this salutation, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured!\" conveyed to us from the Father of lights. And this address, \"highly favoured,\"[fn-11-P1192_297112:3-nf] embraced the whole nature of men. \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured\"[fn-11-P1193_297210:4-nf] in the holy conception and in the glorious pregnancy, \"I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\"[fn-11-P1194_297361:5-nf] And again the Lord, who came for the purpose of accomplishing a saving passion, said, \"I will see you, and ye shall rejoice; and your joy no man taketh from you.\"[fn-11-P1195_297540:6-nf] And after His resurrection again, by the hand of the holy women, He gave us first of all the salutation \"Hail! \"[fn-11-P1196_297670:7-nf] And again, the apostle made the announcement in similar terms, saying, \"Rejoice evermore: pray without ceasing: in everything give thanks.\"[fn-11-P1197_297830:8-nf] See, then, dearly beloved, how the Lord has conferred upon us everywhere, and indivisibly, the joy that is beyond conception, and perennial. For since the holy Virgin, in the life of the flesh, was in possession of the incorruptible citizenship, and walked as such in all manner of virtues, and lived a life more excellent than man's common standard; therefore the Word that cometh from God the Father thought it meet to assume the flesh, and endue the perfect man from her, in order that in the same flesh in which sin entered into the world, and death by sin, sin might be condemned in the flesh, and that the tempter of sin might be overcome in the burying[fn-11-P1198_298512:9-nf] of the holy body, and that therewith also the beginning of the resurrection might be exhibited, and life eternal instituted in the world, and fellowship established for men with God the Father. And what shall we state, or what shall we pass by here? or who shall explain what is incomprehensible in the mystery? But for the present let us fall back upon our subject. Gabriel was sent to the holy virgin; the incorporeal was despatched to her who in the body pursued the incorruptible conversation, and lived in purity and in virtues. And when he came to her, he first addressed her with the salutation, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured! the Lord is with thee.\" Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for thou doest what is worthy of joy indeed, since thou hast put on the vesture of purity, and art girt with the cincture of prudence. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for to thy lot it has fallen to be the vehicle of celestial joy. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for through thee joy is decreed for the whole creation, and the human race receives again by thee its pristine dignity. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for in thy arms the Creator of all things shall be carried. And she was perplexed by this word; for she was inexperienced in all the addresses of men, and welcomed quiet, as the mother of prudence and purity; (yet) being a pure, and immaculate, and stainless image[fn-11-P1199_299997:10-nf] herself, she shrank not in terror from the angelic apparition, like most of the prophets, as indeed true virginity has a kind of affinity and equality with the angels. For the holy Virgin guarded carefully the torch of virginity, and gave diligent heed that it should not be extinguished or defiled. And as one who is clad in a brilliant robe deems it a matter of great moment that no impurity or filth be suffered to touch it anywhere, so did the holy Mary consider with herself, and said: Does this act of attention imply any deep design or seductive purpose? Shall this word \"Hail\" prove the cause of trouble to me, as of old the fair promise of being made like God, which was given her by the serpent-devil, proved to our first mother Eve? Has the devil, who is the author of all evil, become transformed again into an angel of light; and bearing a grudge against my espoused husband for his admirable temperance, and having assailed him with some fair-seeming address, and finding himself powerless to overcome a mind so firm, and to deceive the man, has he turned his attack upon me, as one endowed with a more susceptible mind; and is this word \"Hail\" (Grace be with thee) spoken as the sign of gracelessness hereafter? Is this benediction and salutation uttered in irony? Is there not some poison concealed in the honey? Is it not the address of one who brings good tidings, while the end of the same is to make me the designer's prey? And how is it that he can thus salute one whom he knows not? These things she pondered in perplexity with herself, and expressed in words. Then again the archangel addressed her with the announcement of a joy which all may believe in, and which shall not be taken away, and said to her, \"Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God.\" Shortly hast thou the proof of what has been said. For I not only give yon to understand that there is nothing to fear, but I show you the very key to the absence of all cause for fear. For through me all the heavenly powers hail thee, the holy virgin: yea rather, He Himself, who is Lord of all the heavenly powers and of all creation, has selected thee as the holy one and the wholly fair; and through thy holy, and chaste, and pure, and undefiled womb the enlightening Pearl comes forth for the salvation of all the world: since of all the race of man thou art by birth the holy one, and the more honourable, and the purer, and the more pious than any other: and thou hast a mind whiter than the snow, and a body made purer than any gold, however fine, and a womb such as the object which Ezekiel saw, and which he has described in these terms: \"And the likeness of the living creatures upon the head was as the firmament, and as the appearance of the terrible crystal, and the likeness of the throne above them was as the appearance of a sapphire-stone: and above the throne it was as the likeness of a man, and as the appearance of amber; and within it there was, as it were, the likeness of fire round about.\"[fn-12-P1200_303014:11-nf] ","title":"The Second Homily","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_63_xiii_the_third_conference_of_abbot_chaeremon_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Whence human reason cannot easily decide how the Lord gives to those that ask, is found by those that seek, and opens to those that knock, and on the other hand is found by those that sought Him not, appears openly among those who asked not for Him, and all the day long stretches forth His hands to an unbelieving and gainsaying people, calls those who resist and stand afar off, draws men against their will to salvation, takes away from those who want to sin the faculty of carrying out their desire, in His goodness stands in the way of those who are rushing into wickedness.

But that it may be still clearer that through the excellence of nature which is granted by the goodness of the Creator, sometimes first beginnings of a good will arise, which however cannot attain to the complete performance of what is good unless it is guided by the Lord, the Apostle bears witness and says: \"For to will is present with me, but to perform what is good I find not.\"[fn-53-P5315_1908321:38-nf] ","title":"XIII.

Now the scope and character of Holy Scripture, as we have often said, is this,-it contains a double account of the Saviour; that Fie was ever God, and is the Son, being the Father's Word and Radiance and Wisdom[fn-67-P6750_2677394:218-nf] ; and that afterwards for us He took flesh of a Virgin, Mary Bearer of God[fn-67-P6751_2677493:219-nf] , and was made man. And this scope is to be found throughout inspired Scripture, as the Lord Himself has said, `Search the Scriptures, for they are they which testify of Me[fn-67-P6752_2678144:220-nf] .' But lest I should exceed in writing, by bringing together all the passages on the subject, let it suffice to mention as a specimen, first John saying, `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was made not one thing[fn-67-P6753_2678506:221-nf] ;' next, `And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of one Only-begotten from the Fathers[fn-67-P6754_2678659:222-nf] ;' and next Paul writing, `Who being in the form of God, thought it not a prize to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion like a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross[fn-67-P6755_2678978:223-nf] .'

In short, the Jews also so understood and \"answered Him;\" not those who had already believed, but those in that crowd who were not yet believers. \"They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be free?\" But the Lord had not said, \"Ye shall be free,\" but, \"The truth shall make you free.\" That word, however, they, because, as I have said, it is clearly so in the Greek, understood as pointing only to freedom, and puffed themselves up as Abraham's seed, and said, \"We are Ahraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be free?\" O inflated skin! such is not magnanimity, but windy swelling. For even as regards freedom in this life, how was that the truth when you said, \"We were never in bondage to any man\"? Was not Joseph sold?[fn-17-P1730_1098472:5-nf] Were not the holy prophets led into captivity?[fn-17-P1731_1098539:6-nf] And again, did not that very nation, when making bricks in Egypt, also serve hard rulers, not only in gold and silver, but also in clay?[fn-17-P1732_1098716:7-nf] If you were never in bondage to any man, ungrateful people, why is it that God is continually reminding you that He delivered you from the house of bondage?[fn-17-P1733_1098887:8-nf] Or mean you, perchance, that your fathers were in bondage, but you who speak were never in bondage to any man? How then were you now paying tribute to the Romans, out of which also you formed a trap for the Truth Himself, as if to ensnare Him, when you said, \"Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar?\" in order that, had He said, It is lawful, you might fasten on Him as one ill-disposed to the liberty of Abraham's seed; and if He said, It is not lawful, you might slander Him before the kings of the earth, as forbidding the payment of tribute to such? Deservedly were you defeated on producing the money, and compelled yourselves to concur in your own capture. For there it was told you, \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's,\" after your own reply, that the money-piece bore the image of Caesar.[fn-17-P1734_1099766:9-nf] For as Caesar looks for his own image on the coin, so God looks for His in man. Thus, then, did He answer the Jews. I am moved, brethren, by the hollow pride of men, because even of that very freedom of theirs, which they understood carnally, they lied when they said, \"We were never in bondage to any man.\"","title":"Tractate XLI.","author":"Augustine"}]
