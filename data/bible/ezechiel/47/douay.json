{"verses":["And he brought me again to the gate of the house, and behold\nwaters issued out from under the threshold of the house toward the\neast:  for the forefront of the house looked toward the east:  but the\nwaters came down to the right side of the temple to the south part of\nthe altar.","And he led me out by the way of the north gate, and he caused me\nto turn to the way without the outward gate to the way that looked\ntoward the east:  and behold there ran out waters on the right side.","And when the man that had the line in his hand went out towards\nthe east, he measured a thousand cubits:  and he brought me through the\nwater up to the ankles.","And again he measured a thousand, and he brought me through the\nwater up to the knees.","And he measured a thousand, and he brought me through the water\nup to the loins.  And he measured a thousand, and it was a torrent,\nwhich I could not pass over:  for the waters were risen so as to make a\ndeep torrent, which could not be passed over.","And he said to me:  Surely thou hast seen, O son of man.  And he\nbrought me out, and he caused me to turn to the bank of the torrent.","And when I had turned myself, behold on the bank of the torrent\nwere very many trees on both sides.","And he said to me:  These waters that issue forth toward the\nhillocks of sand to the east, and go down to the plains of the desert,\nshall go into the sea, and shall go out, and the waters shall be\nhealed.","And every living creature that creepeth whithersoever the torrent\nshall come, shall live:  and there shall be fishes in abundance after\nthese waters shall come thither, and they shall be healed, and all\nthings shall live to which the torrent shall come.","And the fishers shall stand over these waters, from Engaddi even\nto Engallim there shall be drying of nets:  there shall be many sorts of\nthe fishes thereof, as the fishes of the great sea, a very great\nmultitude:","But on the shore thereof, and in the fenny places they shall not\nbe healed, because they shall be turned into saltpits.","And by the torrent on the banks thereof on both sides shall grow\nall trees that bear fruit:  their leaf shall not fall off, and their\nfruit shall not fail:  every month shall they bring forth firstfruits,\nbecause the waters thereof shall issue out of the sanctuary:  and the\nfruits thereof shall be for food, and the leaves thereof for medicine.","Thus saith the Lord God:  This is the border, by which you shall\npossess the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel:  for Joseph\nhath a double portion.","And you shall possess it, every man in like manner as his\nbrother:  concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to your\nfathers:  and this land shall fall unto you for a possession.","And this is the border of the land:  toward the north side, from\nthe great sea by the way of Hethalon, as men go to Sedada,","Emath, Berotha, Sabarim, which is between the border of Damascus\nand the border of Emath the house of Tichon, which is by the border of\nAuran.","And the border from the sea even to the court of Enan, shall be\nthe border of Damascus, and from the north to the north:  the border of\nEmath, this is the north side.","And the east side is from the midst of Auran, and from the midst\nof Damascus, and from the midst of Galaad, and from the midst of the\nland of Israel, Jordan making the bound to the east sea, and thus you\nshall measure the east side.","And the south side southward is, from Thamar even to the waters\nof contradiction of Cades:  and, the torrent even to the great sea:  and\nthis is the south side southward.","And the side toward the sea, is the great sea from the borders\nstraight on, till thou come to Emath:  this is the side of the sea.","And you shall divide this land unto you by the tribes of Israel:","And you shall divide it by lot for an inheritance to you, and to\nthe strangers that shall come over to you, that shall beget children\namong you:  and they shall be unto you as men of the same country born\namong the children of Israel:  they shall divide the possession with you\nin the midst of the tribes of Israel.","And in what tribe soever the stranger shall be, there shall you\ngive him possession, saith the Lord God."]}
