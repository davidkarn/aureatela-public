{"verses":["And it came to pass, in the eleventh year, the third month the\nfirst day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, speak to Pharao king of Egypt, and to his people:  To\nwhom art thou like in thy greatness?","Behold, the Assyrian like a cedar in Libanus, with fair branches,\nand full of leaves, of a high stature, and his top was elevated among\nthe thick boughs.","The waters nourished him, the deep set him tip on high, the\nstreams thereof ran round about his roots, and it sent, forth its\nrivulets to all the trees of the country.","Therefore was his height exalted above all the trees of the\ncountry and his branches were multiplied, and his boughs were elevated\nbecause of many waters.","And when he had spread forth his shadow, all the fowls of the air\nmade their nests in his boughs, and all the beasts of the forest\nbrought forth their young under his branches, and the assembly of many\nnations dwelt under his shadow.","And he was most beautiful for his greatness, and for the\nspreading of his branches:  for his root was near great waters.","The cedars in the paradise of God were not higher than he, the\nfir trees did not equal his top, neither were the plane trees to be\ncompared with him for branches:  no tree in the paradise of God was like\nhim in his beauty.","For I made him beautiful and thick set with many branches:  and\nall the trees of pleasure, that were in the paradise of God, envied\nhim.","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Because he was exalted in\nheight, and shot up his top green and thick, and his heart was lifted\nup in his height:","I have delivered him into the hands of the mighty one of the\nnations, he shall deal with him:  I have cast him out according to his\nwickedness.","And strangers, and the most cruel of the nations shall cut him\ndown, and cast him away upon the mountains, and his boughs shall fall\nin every valley, and his branches shall be broken on every rock of the\ncountry:  and all the people of the earth shall depart from his shadow,\nand leave him.","All the fowls of the air dwelt upon his ruins, and all the\nbeasts of the field were among his branches.","For which cause none of the trees by the waters shall exalt\nthemselves for their height:  nor shoot up their tops among the thick\nbranches and leaves, neither shall any of them that are watered stand\nup in their height:  for they are all delivered unto death to the lowest\nparts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that\ngo down into the pit.","Thus saith the Lord God:  In the day when he went down to hell, I\nbrought in mourning, I covered him with the deep:  and I withheld its\nrivers, and restrained the many waters:  Libanus grieved for him, and\nall the trees of the field trembled.","I shook the nations with the sound of his fall, when I brought\nhim down to hell with them that descend into the pit:  and all the trees\nof pleasure, the choice and best in Libanus, all that were moistened\nwith waters, were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth.","For they also shall go down with him to hell to them that are\nslain by the sword; and the arm of every one shall sit down under his\nshadow in the midst of the nations.","To whom art thou like, O thou that art famous and lofty among\nthe trees of pleasure?  Behold, thou art brought down with the trees of\npleasure to the lowest parts of the earth:  thou shalt sleep in the\nmidst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword:  this\nis Pharao, and all his multitude, saith the Lord God."]}
