The attractions of the world it entirely wants, but its spiritual attractions are for this all the greater. Mary, the mother of the Lord, left the lowlands and made her way to the hill country, when, after receiving the angel's message, she realized that she bore within her womb the Son of God.[fn-14-P1411_312257:948-nf] When of old the Philistines had been overcome, when their devilish audacity had been smitten, when their champion had fallen on his face to the earth,[fn-14-P1412_312442:949-nf] it was from this city that there went forth a procession of jubilant souls, a harmonious choir to sing our David's victory over tens of thousands.[fn-14-P1413_312613:950-nf] Here, too, it was that the angel grasped his sword, and while he laid waste the whole of the ungodly city, marked out the temple of the Lord in the threshing floor of Ornan, king of the Jebusites.[fn-14-P1414_312851:951-nf] Thus early was it made plain that Christ's church would grow up, not in Israel, but among the Gentiles. Turn back to Genesis,[fn-14-P1415_313037:952-nf] and you will find that this was the city over which Melchizedek held sway, that king of Salem who, as a type of Christ, offered to Abraham bread and wine, and even then consecrated the mystery which Christians consecrate in the body and blood of the Saviour.[fn-14-P1416_313317:953-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":8,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"711","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3. In speaking thus I am not laying myself open to a charge of inconsistency or condemning the course which I have myself taken. It is not, I believe, for nothing that I, like Abraham, have left my home and people. But I do not presume to limit God's omnipotence or to restrict to a narrow strip of earth Him whom the heaven cannot contain. Each believer is judged not by his residence in this place or in that but according to the deserts of his faith. The true worshippers worship the Father neither at Jerusalem nor on mount Gerizim; for \"God is a spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.\"[fn-24-P2444_625254:1751-nf] \"Now the spirit bloweth where it listeth,\"[fn-24-P2445_625319:1752-nf] and \"the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof.\"[fn-24-P2446_625406:1753-nf] When the fleece of Judaea was made dry although the whole world was wet with the dew of heaven,[fn-24-P2447_625524:1754-nf] and when many came from the East and from the West[fn-24-P2448_625601:1755-nf] and sat in Abraham's bosom:[fn-24-P2449_625653:1756-nf] then God ceased to be known in Judah only and His name to be great in Israel alone;[fn-24-P2450_625760:1757-nf] the sound of the apostles went out into all the earth and their words into the ends of the world.[fn-24-P2451_625881:1758-nf] The Saviour Himself speaking to His disciples in the temple[fn-24-P2452_625962:1759-nf] said: \"arise, let us go hence,\"[fn-24-P2453_626111:1760-nf] and to the Jews: \"your house is left unto you desolate.\"[fn-24-P2454_626191:1761-nf] If heaven and earth must pass away,[fn-24-P2455_626253:1762-nf] obviously all things that are earthly must pass away also. Therefore the spots which witnessed the crucifixion and the resurrection profit those only who bear their several crosses, who day by day rise again with Christ, and who thus shew themselves worthy of an abode so holy. Those who say \"the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord,\"[fn-24-P2456_626618:1763-nf] should give ear to the words of the apostle: \"ye are the temple of the Lord,\"[fn-24-P2457_626718:1764-nf] and the Holy Ghost \"dwelleth in you.\"[fn-24-P2458_626780:1765-nf] Access to the courts of heaven is as easy from Britain as it is from Jerusalem; for \"the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-24-P2459_626924:1766-nf] Antony and the hosts of monks who are in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Pontus, Cappadocia, and Armenia, have never seen Jerusalem: and the door of Paradise is opened for them at a distance from it. The blessed Hilarion, though a native of and a dweller in Palestine, only set eyes on Jerusalem for a single day, not wishing on the one hand when he was so near to neglect the holy places, nor yet on the other to appear to confine God within local limits. From the time of Hadrian to the reign of Constantine-a period of about one hundred and eighty years[fn-24-P2460_627493:1767-nf] -the spot which had witnessed the resurrection was occupied by a figure of Jupiter; while on the rock where the cross had stood, a marble statue of Venus was set up by the heathen and became an object of worship. The original persecutors, indeed, supposed that by polluting our holy places they would deprive us of our faith in the passion and in the resurrection. Even my own Bethlehem, as it now is, that most venerable spot in the whole world of which the psalmist sings: \"the truth hath sprung out of the earth,\"[fn-24-P2461_628084:1768-nf] was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz,[fn-24-P2462_628153:1769-nf] that is of Adonis; and in the very cave[fn-24-P2463_628218:1770-nf] where the infant Christ had uttered His earliest cry lamentation was made for the paramour of Venus.[fn-24-P2464_628437:1771-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":8,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"25. What folly it was to include Elijah and Elisha in a list of married men, is plain without a word from me. For, since John Baptist came in the spirit and power of Elijah, and John was a virgin, it is clear that he came not only in Elijah's spirit, but also in his bodily chastity. Then the passage relating to Hezekiah might be adduced (though Jovinianus with his wonted stupidity did not notice it), in which after his recovery and the addition of fifteen years to his life he said, \"Now will I beget children.\" It must be remembered, however, that in the Hebrew texts the passage is not so, but runs thus:[fn-63-P6310_1932572:152-nf] \"The father to the children shall make known thy faithfulness.\" Nor need we wonder that Huldah, the prophetess, and wife of Shallum, was[fn-63-P6311_1932733:153-nf] consulted by Josiah, King of Judah, when the captivity was approaching and the wrath of the Lord was falling upon Jerusalem: since it is the rule of Scripture when holy men fail, to praise women to the reproach of men. And it is superfluous to speak of Daniel, for the Hebrews to the present day affirm that the three youths were eunuchs, in accordance with the declaration of God which Isaiah utters to Hezekiah:[fn-63-P6312_1933172:154-nf] \"And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away: and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the King of Babylon.\" And again in Daniel we read:[fn-63-P6313_1933380:155-nf] \"And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles: youth in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science.\" The conclusion is that if Daniel and the three youths were chosen from the seed royal, and if Scripture foretold that that there should be eunuchs of the seed royal, these men were those who were made eunuchs. If he meets us with the argument that in Ezekiel[fn-63-P6314_1933960:156-nf] it is said that Noah, Daniel and Job in a sinful land could not free their sons and daughters, we reply that the words are used hypothetically. Noah and Job were not in existence at that time: we know that they lived many ages before. And the meaning is this: if there were such and such men in a sinful land, they shall not be able to save their own sons and daughters: because the righteousness of the father shall not save the son, nor shall the sin of one be imputed to another.[fn-63-P6315_1934480:157-nf] \"For the soul that sinneth, it shall die.\" This, too, must be said, that Daniel, as the history of his book shows, was taken captive with King Jehoiakim at the same time that Ezekiel was also led into captivity. How then could he have sons who was still a youth? And only three years had elapsed when he was brought in to wait upon the king. Let no one suppose that Ezekiel at this time remembers Daniel as a man, not as a youth; for \"It came to pass,\" he says,[fn-63-P6316_1934965:158-nf] \"in the sixth year,\" that is of King Jehoiakim, \"in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month:\" and, \"as I sat in my house, and the eiders of Judah sat before me.\" Yet on that same day it was said to him,[fn-63-P6317_1935197:159-nf] \"Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it.\" Daniel was therefore a youth, and known to the people, either on account of his interpretation of the king's dreams,[fn-63-P6318_1935396:160-nf] or on account of the release of Susannah, and the slaying of the elders. And it is clearly proved that at the time these things were spoken of Noah, Daniel, and Job, Daniel was still a youth and could not have had sons and daughters, whom he might save by his righteousness.

From which ruin none will be freed but he who shall have been frontally sealed[fn-23-P2380_780373:241-nf] with the passion of the Christ whom you have rejected. For thus it is written: \"And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, thou hast seen what the elders of Israel do, each one of them in darkness, each in a hidden bed-chamber: because they have said, The Lord seeth us not; the Lord hath derelinquished the earth. And He said unto me, Turn thee again, and thou shall see greater enormities which these do. And He introduced me unto the thresholds of the gate of the house of the Lord which looketh unto the north; and, behold, there, women sitting and bewailing Thammuz. And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen? Is the house of Judah moderate, to do the enormities which they have done? And yet thou art about to see greater affections of theirs. And He introduced me into the inner shrine of the house of the Lord; and, behold, on the thresholds of the house of the Lord, between the midst of the porch and between the midst of the altar,[fn-23-P2381_781373:242-nf] as it were twenty and five men have turned their backs unto the temple of the Lord, and their faces over against the east; these were adoring the sun. And He said unto me, Seest thou, son of man? Are such deeds trifles to the house of Judah, that they should do the enormities which these have done? because they have filled up (the measure of) their impieties, and, behold, are themselves, as it were, grimacing; I will deal with mine indignation,[fn-23-P2382_781946:243-nf] mine eye shall not spare, neither will I pity; they shall cry out unto mine ears with a loud voice, and I will not hear them, nay, I will not pity. And He cried into mine ears with a loud voice, saying, The vengeance of this city is at hand; and each one had vessels of extermination in his hand. And, behold, six men were coming toward the way of the high gate which was looking toward the north, and each one's double-axe of dispersion was in his hand: and one man in the midst of them, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet,[fn-23-P2383_782724:244-nf] and a girdle of sapphire about his loins: and they entered, and took their stand close to the brazen altar. And the glory of the God of Israel, which was over the house, in the open court of it,[fn-23-P2384_782944:245-nf] ascended from the cherubim: and the Lord called the man who was clothed with the garment reaching to the feet, who had upon his loins the girdle; and said unto him, Pass through the midst of Jerusalem, and write the sign Tau[fn-23-P2385_783289:246-nf] on the foreheads of the men who groan and grieve over all the enormities which are done in their midst. And while these things were doing, He said unto an hearer,[fn-23-P2386_783524:247-nf] Go ye after him into the city, and cut short; and spare not with your eyes, and pity not elder or youth or virgin; and little ones and women slay ye all, that they may be thoroughly wiped away; but all upon whom is the sign Tau approach ye not; and begin with my saints.\"[fn-23-P2387_783896:248-nf] Now the mystery of this \"sign\" was in various ways predicted; (a \"sign\") in which the foundation of life was forelaid for mankind; (a \"sign\") in which the Jews were not to believe: just as Moses beforetime kept on announcing in Exodus,[fn-23-P2388_784275:249-nf] saying, \"Ye shall be ejected from the land into which ye shall enter; and in those nations ye shall not be able to rest: and there shall be instabilityof the print[fn-23-P2389_784492:250-nf] of thy foot: and God shall give thee a wearying heart, and a pining soul, and failing eyes, that they see not: and thy life shall hang on the tree[fn-23-P2390_784658:251-nf] before thine eyes; and thou shalt not trust thy life.\"","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_19_lecture_xiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"24.

Thus when about to destroy Sodom, He first defended Himself to Abraham, by showing the desolation and rareness of virtue, when indeed not even ten men were found in so many cities, who had made it their rule to live chastely. And to Lot also in like manner, He first signifies their inhospitality and their unnatural lusts, and then He brings the fire on them. And with regard to the deluge again He did the self-same thing, by His acts excusing Himself to Noah.

If a husband come upon his wife, and see her lying with another man, is he not angry and raging, and by the passion of his rage does he not perhaps take his sword into his hand? And what shall Christ and our Lord and Judge think, when He sees His virgin, dedicated to Him, and destined for His holiness, lying with another? How indignant and angry is He, and what penalties does He threaten against such unchaste connections! whose spiritual sword and the coming day of judgment, that every one of the brethren may be able to escape, we ought with all our counsel to provide and to strive.
