In the first place we differ from the Montanists regarding the rule of faith. We distinguish the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as three persons, but unite them as one substance. They, on the other hand, following the doctrine of Sabellius,[fn-13-P1304_285382:879-nf] force the Trinity into the narrow limits of a single personality. We, while we do not encourage them, yet allow second marriages, since Paul bids the younger widows to marry.[fn-13-P1305_285761:880-nf] They suppose a repetition of marriage a sin so awful that he who has committed it is to be regarded as an adulterer. We, according to the apostolic tradition (in which the whole world is at one with us), fast through one Lent yearly; whereas they keep three in the year as though three saviours had suffered. I do not mean, of course, that it is unlawful to fast at other times through the year-always excepting Pentecost[fn-13-P1306_286205:881-nf] -only that while in Lent it is a duty of obligation, at other seasons it is a matter of choice. With us, again, the bishops occupy the place of the apostles, but with them a bishop ranks not first but third. For while they put first the patriarchs of Pepusa[fn-13-P1307_286521:882-nf] in Phrygia, and place next to these the ministers called stewards,[fn-13-P1308_286639:883-nf] the bishops are relegated to the third or almost the lowest rank. No doubt their object is to make their religion more pretentious by putting that last which we put first. Again they close the doors of the Church to almost every fault, whilst we read daily, \"I desire the repentance of a sinner rather than his death,\"[fn-13-P1309_287033:884-nf] and \"Shall they fall and not arise, saith the Lord,\"[fn-13-P1310_287110:885-nf] and once more \"Return ye backsliding children and I will heal your backslidings.\"[fn-13-P1311_287213:886-nf] Their strictness does not prevent them from themselves committing grave sins, far from it; but there is this difference between us and them, that, whereas they in their self-righteousness blush to confess their faults, we do penance for ours, and so more readily gain pardon for them.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":18,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"663","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8.

Why then must we needs boast of our chastity, a thing which cannot prove itself to be genuine without its companions and attendants, continence and plain living?

The advice of the rhetoricians in such cases is that you should first search out the remote ancestors of the person to be eulogized and recount their exploits, and then come gradually to your hero; so as to make him more illustrious by the virtues of his forefathers, and to show either that he is a worthy successor of good men, or that he has conferred lustre upon a lineage in itself obscure. But as my duty is to sing the praises of the soul, I will not dwell upon those fleshly advantages which Nepotian for his part always despised.

But why do I linger over old and forgotten matters, seeking to excuse a fault for which Fabiola has herself confessed her penitence? Who would believe that, after the death of her second husband at a time when most widows, having shaken off the yoke of servitude, grow careless and allow themselves more liberty than ever, frequenting the baths, flitting through the streets, shewing their harlot faces everywhere; that at this time Fabiola came to herself? Yet it was then that she put on sackcloth to make public confession of her error. It was then that in the presence of all Rome (in the basilica which formerly belonged to that Lateranus who perished by the sword of Caesar[fn-32-P3218_843271:2332-nf] ) she stood in the ranks of the penitents and exposed before bishop, presbyters, and people-all of whom wept when they saw her weep-her dishevelled hair, pale features, soiled hands and unwashed neck. What sins would such a penance fail to purge away? What ingrained stains would such tears be unable to wash out? By a threefold confession Peter blotted out his threefold denial.[fn-32-P3219_843887:2333-nf] If Aaron committed sacrilege by fashioning molten gold into the head of a calf, his brother's prayers made amends for his transgressions.[fn-32-P3220_844070:2334-nf] If holy David, meekest of men, committed the double sin of murder and adultery, he atoned for it by a fast of seven days. He lay upon the earth, he rolled in the ashes, he forgot his royal power, he sought for light in the darkness.[fn-32-P3221_844330:2335-nf] And then, turning his eyes to that God whom he had so deeply offended, he cried with a lamentable voice: \"Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight,\" and \"Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit.\"[fn-32-P3222_844618:2336-nf] He who by his virtues teaches me how to stand and not to fall, by his penitence teaches me how, if I fall, I may rise again. Among the kings do we read of any so wicked as Ahab, of whom the scripture says: \"there was none like unto Ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord\"?[fn-32-P3223_844956:2337-nf] For shedding Naboth's blood Elijah rebuked him, and the prophet denounced God's wrath against him: \"Hast thou killed and also taken possession? ...behold I will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity\"[fn-32-P3224_845196:2338-nf] and so on. Yet when Ahab heard these words \"he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted ...in sackcloth, and went softly.\"[fn-32-P3225_845376:2339-nf] Then came the word of God to Elijah the Tishbite saying: \"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me?

The same conduct is in the Chronicles[fn-32-P3227_845802:2341-nf] attributed to Manasseh, and in the book of the prophet Jonah[fn-32-P3228_845910:2342-nf] to Nineveh, and in the gospel to the publican.[fn-32-P3229_845982:2343-nf] The first of these not only was allowed to obtain forgiveness but also recovered his kingdom, the second broke the force of God's impending wrath, while the third, smiting his breast with his hands, \"would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven.\" Yet for all that the publican with his humble confession of his faults went back justified far more than the Pharisee with his arrogant boasting of his virtues.

But perhaps you imagine that, if they are not baptized, the children of Christians are liable for their own sins; and that no guilt attaches to parents who withhold from baptism those who by reason of their tender age can offer no objection to it. The truth is that, as baptism ensures the salvation of the child, this in turn brings advantage to the parents. Whether you would offer your child or not lay within your choice, but now that you have offered her, you neglect her at your peril. I speak generally for in your case you have no discretion, having offered your child even before her conception.

I am induced to write to you, a stranger to a stranger, by the entreaties of that holy servant of Christ Hedibia[fn-44-P4402_1198884:3112-nf] and of my daughter in the faith Artemia, once your wife but now no longer your wife but your sister and fellow-servant. Not content with assuring her own salvation she has sought yours also, in former days at home and now in the holy places. She is anxious to emulate the thoughtfulness of the apostles Andrew and Philip; who after Christ had found them, desired in their turn to find, the one his brother Simon and the other his friend Nathanael.[fn-44-P4403_1199437:3113-nf] To the former of these it was said \"Thou art Simon, the son of Jona: thou shall be called Cephas which is by interpretation a stone;\"[fn-44-P4404_1199604:3114-nf] while the latter, whose name Nathanael means the gift of God, was comforted by Christ's witness to him: \"behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile.\"[fn-44-P4405_1199779:3115-nf] So of old Lot[fn-44-P4406_1199814:3116-nf] desired to rescue his wife as well as his two daughters, and refusing to leave blazing Sodom and Gomorrah until he was himself half-on-fire, tried to lead forth one who was tied and bound by her past sins. But in her despair she lost her composure, and looking back became a monument of an unbelieving soul.[fn-44-P4407_1200148:3117-nf] Yet, as if to make up for the loss of a single woman, Lot's glowing faith set free the whole city of Zoar. In fact when he left the dark valleys in which Sodom lay and came to the mountains, the sun rose upon him as he entered Zoar or the little City; so-called because the little faith that Lot possessed, though unable to save greater places, was at least able to preserve smaller ones. For one who had gone so far astray as to live in Gomorrah could not all at once reach the noonland where Abraham, the friend of God,[fn-44-P4408_1200697:3118-nf] entertained God and His angels.[fn-44-P4409_1200751:3119-nf] (For it was in Egypt that Joseph fed his brothers, and when the bride speaks to the Bridegroom her cry is: \"tell me where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon.\"[fn-44-P4410_1200957:3120-nf] ) Good men have always sorrowed for the sins of others. Samuel of old lamented for Saul[fn-44-P4411_1201066:3121-nf] because he neglected to treat the ulcers of pride with the balm of penitence. And Paul wept for the Corinthians[fn-44-P4412_1201202:3122-nf] who refused to wash out with their tears the stains of fornication. For the same reason Ezekiel swallowed the book where were written within and without song, and lamentation and woe;[fn-44-P4413_1201409:3123-nf] the song in praise of the righteous, the lamentation over the penitent, and the woe for those of whom it is written, \"When the wicked man falleth into the depths of evil, then is he filled with scorn.\"[fn-44-P4414_1201639:3124-nf] It is to these that Isaiah alludes when he says: \"in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen; and killing sheep, eating flesh\" and saying, \"let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\"[fn-44-P4415_1201969:3125-nf] Yet of such persons Ezekiel is bidden to speak thus: \"O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live,\" and again, \"turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?\"[fn-44-P4416_1202467:3126-nf] Nothing makes God so angry as when men from despair of better things cleave to those which are worse; and indeed this despair in itself is a sign of unbelief. One who despairs of salvation can have no expectation of a judgment to come. For if he dreaded such, he would by doing good works prepare to meet his Judge. Let us hear what God says through Jeremiah, \"withhold thy foot from a rough way and thy throat from thirst\"[fn-44-P4417_1202936:3127-nf] and again \"shall they fall, and not arise? Shall he turn away, and not return?\"[fn-44-P4418_1203043:3128-nf] Let us hear also what God says by Isaiah: \"When thou shalt turn and bewail thyself, then shall thou be saved, and then shalt thou know where thou hast hitherto been.\"[fn-44-P4419_1203233:3129-nf] We do not realize the miseries of sickness till returning health reveals them to us. So sins serve as a foil to the blessedness of virtue; and light shines more brightly when it is relieved against darkness. Ezekiel uses language like that of the other prophets because he is animated by a similar spirit. \"Repent,\" he cries, \"and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord.\"[fn-44-P4420_1203902:3130-nf] Wherefore in a subsequent passage he says: \"As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked: but that the wicked turn from his way and live.\"[fn-44-P4421_1204103:3131-nf] These words shew us that the mind must not through disbelief in the promised blessings give way to despair; and that the soul once marked out for perdition must not refuse to apply remedies on the ground that its wounds are past curing. Ezekiel describes God as swearing, that if we refuse to believe His promise in regard to our salvation we may at least believe His oath. It is with full confidence that the righteous man prays and says, \"Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease,\"[fn-44-P4422_1204647:3132-nf] and again, \"Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.\"[fn-44-P4423_1204792:3133-nf] He means to say, \"when I forsook the foulness of my faults for the beauty of virtue, God strengthened my weakness with His grace.\" Lo, I hear. His promise: \"I will pursue mine enemies and overtake them: neither will I turn again till they are consumed,\"[fn-44-P4424_1205067:3134-nf] so that I who was once thine enemy and a fugitive from thee, shall be laid hold of by thine hand. Cease not from pursuing me till my wickedness is consumed, and I return to my old husband who will give me my wool and my flax, my oil and my fine flour and will feed me with the richest foods.[fn-44-P4425_1205388:3135-nf] He it was who hedged up and enclosed my evil ways[fn-44-P4426_1205461:3136-nf] that I might find Him the true way who says in the gospel, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\"[fn-44-P4427_1205582:3137-nf] Hear the words of the prophet: \"they that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\"[fn-44-P4428_1205809:3138-nf] Say also with him: \"All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears\"[fn-44-P4429_1205935:3139-nf] : and again, \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night,\"[fn-44-P4430_1206182:3140-nf] and in another place, \"O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and weary land where no water is. So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary.\"[fn-44-P4431_1206420:3141-nf] For although my soul has thirsted after thee, yet much more have I sought thee by the labour of my flesh and have not been able to look upon thee in thy sanctuary; not at any rate till I have first dwelt in a land barren of sin, where the weary wayfarer is no more assailed by the adversary, and where there are no pools or rivers of lust.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":18,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1553","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"10.

And even Eli himself offended God by shewing too great leniency to his sons; therefore, so far from the righteousness of your bishop being able to deliver you, it is rather to be feared that your wickedness may hurl him from his seat and that falling on his back like Eli he may perish irretrievably.[fn-56-P5629_1574633:4005-nf] If the Levite Uzzah was smitten merely because he tried to hold up from falling the ark which it was his special province to carry;[fn-56-P5630_1574789:4006-nf] what punishment, think you, will be inflicted upon you who have tried to overthrow the Lord's ark when standing firm?

The manifest sense of Holy Scripture which we have considered, removes all obscurities. Even as death is in this our mortal body derived from the beginning, so from the beginning has sin been drawn into this sinful flesh of ours, for the cure of which, both as it is derived by propagation and augmented by wilful transgression, as well as for the quickening of our flesh itself, our Physician came in the likeness of sinful flesh, who is not needed by the sound, but only by the sick,- and who came not to call the righteous, but sinners.[fn-12-P1229_635660:50-nf] Therefore the saying of the apostle, when advising believers not to separate themselves from unbelieving partners: \"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy,\"[fn-12-P1230_635961:51-nf] must be either so understood as both we ourselves elsewhere,[fn-12-P1231_636043:52-nf] and as Pelagius in his notes on this same Epistle to the Corinthians,[fn-12-P1232_636173:53-nf] has expounded it, according to the purport of the passages already mentioned, that sometimes wives gained husbands to Christ, and sometimes husbands converted wives, whilst the Christian will of even one of the parents prevailed towards making their children Christians; or else (as the apostle's words seem rather to indicate, and to a certain degree compel us) some particular sanctification is to be here understood, by which an unbelieving husband or wife was sanctified by the believing partner, and by which the children of the believing parents were sanctified,-whether it was that the husband or the wife, during the woman's menstruation, abstained from cohabiting, having learned that duty in the law (for Ezekiel classes this amongst the precepts which were not to be taken in a metaphorical sense[fn-12-P1233_637115:54-nf] ), or on account of some other voluntary sanctification which is not there expressly prescribed, - a sprinkling of holiness arising out of the close ties of married life and children. Nevertheless, whatever be the sanctification meant, this must be steadily held: that there is no other valid means of making Christians and remitting sins, except by men becoming believers through the sacrament according to the institution of Christ and the Church. For neither are unbelieving husbands and wives, notwithstanding their intimate union with holy and righteous spouses, cleansed of the sin which separates men from the kingdom of God and drives them into condemnation, nor are the children who are born of parents, however just and holy, absolved from the guilt of original sin, unless they have been baptized into Christ; and in behalf of these our plea should be the more earnest, the less able they are to urge one themselves.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_17_vi_on_monogamy_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"ANF-04","text":"After the ancient examples of the patriarchs, let us equally pass on to the ancient documents of the legal Scriptures, that we may treat in order of all our canon.

If, then, forasmuch as there is in the law a precept that a man is to take in marriage the wife of his brother if he have died without children,[fn-11-P1142_297844:44-nf] for the purpose of raising up seed to his brother; and this may happen repeatedly to the same person, according to that crafty question of the Sadducees;[fn-11-P1143_298020:45-nf] men for that reason think that frequency of marriage is permitted in other cases as well: it will be their duty to understand first the reason of the precept itself; and thus they will come to know that that reason, now ceasing, is among those parts of the law which have been cancelled. Necessary it was that there should be a succession to the marriage of a brother if he died childless: first, because that ancient benediction, \"Grow and multiply,\"[fn-11-P1144_298553:46-nf] had still to run its course; secondly, because the sins of the fathers used to be exacted even from the sons;[fn-11-P1145_298707:47-nf] thirdly, because eunuchs and barren persons used to be regarded as ignominious. And thus, for fear that such as had died childless, not from natural inability, but from being prematurely overtaken by death, should be judged equally accursed (with the other class); for this reason a vicarious and (so to say) posthumous offspring used to be supplied them. But (now), when the \"extremity of the times\" has cancelled (the command) \"Grow and multiply,\" since the apostles (another command), \"It remaineth, that both they who have wives so be as if they have not,\" because \"the time is compressed;[fn-11-P1146_299388:48-nf] and \"the sour grape\" chewed by \"the fathers\" has ceased \"to set the sons' teeth on edge,\"[fn-11-P1147_299510:49-nf] for, \"each one shall die in his own sin; \"and \"eunuchs\" not only have lost ignominy, but have even deserved grace, being invited into \"the kingdoms of the heavens: \"[fn-11-P1148_299748:50-nf] the law of succeeding to the wife of a brother being buried, its contrary has obtained-that of not succeeding to the wife of a brother. And thus, as we have said before, what has ceased to be valid, on the cessation of its reason, cannot furnish a ground of argument to another. Therefore a wife, when her husband is dead, will not marry; for if she marry, she will of course be marrying (his) brother: for \"all we are brethren.\"[fn-11-P1149_300212:51-nf] Again, the woman, if intending to marry, has to marry \"in the Lord; \"[fn-11-P1150_300303:52-nf] that is, not to an heathen, but to a brother, inasmuch as even the ancient law forbids[fn-11-P1151_300411:53-nf] marriage with members of another tribe. Since, moreover, even in Leviticus there is a caution, \"Whoever shall have taken (his) brother's wife, (it) is uncleanness-turpitude; without children shall (he) die; \"[fn-11-P1152_300702:54-nf] beyond doubt, while the man is prohibited from marrying a second time, the woman is prohibited too, having no one to marry except a brother. In what way, then, an agreement shall be established between the apostle and the Law (which he is not impugning in its entirety), shall be shown when we shall have come to his own epistle. Meantime, so far as pertains to the law, the lines of argument drawn from it are more suitable for us (than for our opponents). In short, the same (law) prohibits priests from marrying a second time. The daughter also of a priest it bids, if widowed or repudiated, if she have had no seed, to return into her father's home and be nourished from his bread.[fn-11-P1153_301425:55-nf] The reason why (it is said), \"If she have had no seed,\" is not that if she have she may marry again-for how much more will she abstain from marrying if she have sons?-but that, if she have, she may be \"nourished\" by her son rather than by her father; in order that the son, too, may carry out the precept of God, \"Honour father and mother.\"[fn-11-P1154_301870:56-nf] Us, moreover, Jesus, the Father's Highest and Great Priest,[fn-11-P1155_301956:57-nf] clothing us from His own store[fn-11-P1156_302153:58-nf] -inasmuch as they \"who are baptized in Christ[fn-11-P1157_302352:59-nf] have put on Christ\"-has made \"priests to God His Father,\"[fn-11-P1158_302463:60-nf] according to John. For the reason why He recalls that young man who was hastening to his father's obsequies,[fn-11-P1159_302592:61-nf] is that He may show that we are called priests by Him; (priests) whom the Law used to forbid to be present at the sepulture of parents:[fn-11-P1160_302770:62-nf] \"Over every dead soul,\" it says, \"the priest shall not enter, and over his own father and over his own mother he shall not be contaminated.\" \"Does it follow that we too are bound to observe this prohibition? \"No, of course.

If, then, forasmuch as there is in the law a precept that a man is to take in marriage the wife of his brother if he have died without children,[fn-11-P1142_297844:44-nf] for the purpose of raising up seed to his brother; and this may happen repeatedly to the same person, according to that crafty question of the Sadducees;[fn-11-P1143_298020:45-nf] men for that reason think that frequency of marriage is permitted in other cases as well: it will be their duty to understand first the reason of the precept itself; and thus they will come to know that that reason, now ceasing, is among those parts of the law which have been cancelled. Necessary it was that there should be a succession to the marriage of a brother if he died childless: first, because that ancient benediction, \"Grow and multiply,\"[fn-11-P1144_298553:46-nf] had still to run its course; secondly, because the sins of the fathers used to be exacted even from the sons;[fn-11-P1145_298707:47-nf] thirdly, because eunuchs and barren persons used to be regarded as ignominious. And thus, for fear that such as had died childless, not from natural inability, but from being prematurely overtaken by death, should be judged equally accursed (with the other class); for this reason a vicarious and (so to say) posthumous offspring used to be supplied them. But (now), when the \"extremity of the times\" has cancelled (the command) \"Grow and multiply,\" since the apostles (another command), \"It remaineth, that both they who have wives so be as if they have not,\" because \"the time is compressed;[fn-11-P1146_299388:48-nf] and \"the sour grape\" chewed by \"the fathers\" has ceased \"to set the sons' teeth on edge,\"[fn-11-P1147_299510:49-nf] for, \"each one shall die in his own sin; \"and \"eunuchs\" not only have lost ignominy, but have even deserved grace, being invited into \"the kingdoms of the heavens: \"[fn-11-P1148_299748:50-nf] the law of succeeding to the wife of a brother being buried, its contrary has obtained-that of not succeeding to the wife of a brother. And thus, as we have said before, what has ceased to be valid, on the cessation of its reason, cannot furnish a ground of argument to another. Therefore a wife, when her husband is dead, will not marry; for if she marry, she will of course be marrying (his) brother: for \"all we are brethren.\"[fn-11-P1149_300212:51-nf] Again, the woman, if intending to marry, has to marry \"in the Lord; \"[fn-11-P1150_300303:52-nf] that is, not to an heathen, but to a brother, inasmuch as even the ancient law forbids[fn-11-P1151_300411:53-nf] marriage with members of another tribe. Since, moreover, even in Leviticus there is a caution, \"Whoever shall have taken (his) brother's wife, (it) is uncleanness-turpitude; without children shall (he) die; \"[fn-11-P1152_300702:54-nf] beyond doubt, while the man is prohibited from marrying a second time, the woman is prohibited too, having no one to marry except a brother. In what way, then, an agreement shall be established between the apostle and the Law (which he is not impugning in its entirety), shall be shown when we shall have come to his own epistle. Meantime, so far as pertains to the law, the lines of argument drawn from it are more suitable for us (than for our opponents). In short, the same (law) prohibits priests from marrying a second time. The daughter also of a priest it bids, if widowed or repudiated, if she have had no seed, to return into her father's home and be nourished from his bread.[fn-11-P1153_301425:55-nf] The reason why (it is said), \"If she have had no seed,\" is not that if she have she may marry again-for how much more will she abstain from marrying if she have sons?-but that, if she have, she may be \"nourished\" by her son rather than by her father; in order that the son, too, may carry out the precept of God, \"Honour father and mother.\"[fn-11-P1154_301870:56-nf] Us, moreover, Jesus, the Father's Highest and Great Priest,[fn-11-P1155_301956:57-nf] clothing us from His own store[fn-11-P1156_302153:58-nf] -inasmuch as they \"who are baptized in Christ[fn-11-P1157_302352:59-nf] have put on Christ\"-has made \"priests to God His Father,\"[fn-11-P1158_302463:60-nf] according to John. For the reason why He recalls that young man who was hastening to his father's obsequies,[fn-11-P1159_302592:61-nf] is that He may show that we are called priests by Him; (priests) whom the Law used to forbid to be present at the sepulture of parents:[fn-11-P1160_302770:62-nf] \"Over every dead soul,\" it says, \"the priest shall not enter, and over his own father and over his own mother he shall not be contaminated.\" \"Does it follow that we too are bound to observe this prohibition? \"No, of course. For our one Father, God, lives, and our mother, the Church; and neither are we dead who live to God, nor do we bury our dead, inasmuch as they too are living in Christ. At all events, priests we are called by Christ; debtors to monogamy, in accordance with the pristine Law of God, which prophesied at that time of us in its own priests.","title":"VI.

What folly it was to include Elijah and Elisha in a list of married men, is plain without a word from me. For, since John Baptist came in the spirit and power of Elijah, and John was a virgin, it is clear that he came not only in Elijah's spirit, but also in his bodily chastity. Then the passage relating to Hezekiah might be adduced (though Jovinianus with his wonted stupidity did not notice it), in which after his recovery and the addition of fifteen years to his life he said, \"Now will I beget children.\" It must be remembered, however, that in the Hebrew texts the passage is not so, but runs thus:[fn-63-P6310_1932572:152-nf] \"The father to the children shall make known thy faithfulness.\" Nor need we wonder that Huldah, the prophetess, and wife of Shallum, was[fn-63-P6311_1932733:153-nf] consulted by Josiah, King of Judah, when the captivity was approaching and the wrath of the Lord was falling upon Jerusalem: since it is the rule of Scripture when holy men fail, to praise women to the reproach of men. And it is superfluous to speak of Daniel, for the Hebrews to the present day affirm that the three youths were eunuchs, in accordance with the declaration of God which Isaiah utters to Hezekiah:[fn-63-P6312_1933172:154-nf] \"And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away: and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the King of Babylon.\" And again in Daniel we read:[fn-63-P6313_1933380:155-nf] \"And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, even of the seed royal and of the nobles: youth in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science.\" The conclusion is that if Daniel and the three youths were chosen from the seed royal, and if Scripture foretold that that there should be eunuchs of the seed royal, these men were those who were made eunuchs. If he meets us with the argument that in Ezekiel[fn-63-P6314_1933960:156-nf] it is said that Noah, Daniel and Job in a sinful land could not free their sons and daughters, we reply that the words are used hypothetically. Noah and Job were not in existence at that time: we know that they lived many ages before. And the meaning is this: if there were such and such men in a sinful land, they shall not be able to save their own sons and daughters: because the righteousness of the father shall not save the son, nor shall the sin of one be imputed to another.[fn-63-P6315_1934480:157-nf] \"For the soul that sinneth, it shall die.\" This, too, must be said, that Daniel, as the history of his book shows, was taken captive with King Jehoiakim at the same time that Ezekiel was also led into captivity. How then could he have sons who was still a youth? And only three years had elapsed when he was brought in to wait upon the king. Let no one suppose that Ezekiel at this time remembers Daniel as a man, not as a youth; for \"It came to pass,\" he says,[fn-63-P6316_1934965:158-nf] \"in the sixth year,\" that is of King Jehoiakim, \"in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month:\" and, \"as I sat in my house, and the eiders of Judah sat before me.\" Yet on that same day it was said to him,[fn-63-P6317_1935197:159-nf] \"Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it.\" Daniel was therefore a youth, and known to the people, either on account of his interpretation of the king's dreams,[fn-63-P6318_1935396:160-nf] or on account of the release of Susannah, and the slaying of the elders. And it is clearly proved that at the time these things were spoken of Noah, Daniel, and Job, Daniel was still a youth and could not have had sons and daughters, whom he might save by his righteousness. So far concerning the Law.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":18,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_19_vii_on_modesty_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"ANF-04","text":"\"But,\" say they, \"God is `good, 'and `most good, '[fn-13-P1302_358203:15-nf] and `pitiful-hearted, 'and `a pitier, 'and `abundant in pitiful-heartedness, '[fn-13-P1303_358334:16-nf] which He holds `dearer than all sacrifice, '[fn-13-P1304_358405:17-nf] `not thinking the sinner's death of so much worth as his repentance',[fn-13-P1305_358526:18-nf] `a Saviour of all men, most of all of believers.'[fn-13-P1306_358614:19-nf] And so it will be becoming for `the sons of God'[fn-13-P1307_358683:20-nf] too to be `pitiful-hearted'[fn-13-P1308_358734:21-nf] and `peacemakers; '[fn-13-P1309_358772:22-nf] `giving in their turn just as Christ withal hath given to us; '[fn-13-P1310_358854:23-nf] `not judging, that we be not judged.'[fn-13-P1311_359072:24-nf] For `to his own lord a man standeth or falleth; who art thou, to judge another's servant?

Because, albeit God is by nature good, still He is \"just\"[fn-13-P1315_359685:28-nf] too.

For God is \"jealous,\"[fn-13-P1321_360862:34-nf] and is One who is not contemptuously derided[fn-13-P1322_360996:35-nf] -derided, namely, by such as flatter His goodness-and who, albeit \"patient,\"[fn-13-P1323_361090:36-nf] yet threatens, through Isaiah, an end of (His) patience. \"I have held my peace; shall I withal always hold my peace and endure? I have been quiet as (a woman) in birth-throes; I will arise, and will make (them) to grow arid.\"[fn-13-P1324_361362:37-nf] For \"a fire shall proceed before His face, and shall utterly burn His enemies; \"[fn-13-P1325_361463:38-nf] striking down not the body only, but the souls too, into hell.[fn-13-P1326_361551:39-nf] Besides, the Lord Himself demonstrates the manner in which He threatens such as judge: \"For with what judgment ye judge, judgment shall be given on you.\"[fn-13-P1327_361745:40-nf] Thus He has not prohibited judging, but taught (how to do it). Whence the apostle withal judges, and that in a case of fornication,[fn-13-P1328_361909:41-nf] that \"such a man must be surrendered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh; \"[fn-13-P1329_362041:42-nf] chiding them likewise because \"brethren\" were not \"judged at the bar of the saints: \"[fn-13-P1330_362145:43-nf] for he goes on and says, \"To what (purpose is it) for me to judge those who are without? \"\"But you remit, in order that remission may be granted you by God.\" The sins which are (thus) cleansed are such as a man may have committed against his brother, not against God. We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

Their object in such a malignant perversion of the true doctrine, is to show that the less exalted statements, which our Lord utters in tits humanity, are to be thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show their blasphemy to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual acknowledgment of the Lord. For this reason it is that Eunomius says, \"He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man made up of soul and body.\" But, after searching through all the inspired and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came \"to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-12-P1204_656584:193-nf] .\" Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster of our nature bad its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was twofold, death correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the deprivation of the twofold life that operates in him who is thus mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body into its kindred elements: but \"the soul that sinneth,\" he saith, \"it shall die[fn-12-P1205_657543:194-nf] .\" Now sin is nothing else than alienation from God, Who is the true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived many hundred years after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, \"In the day that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die[fn-12-P1206_657814:195-nf] .\" For by the fact of his alienation from the true life, the sentence of death was ratified against him that self-same day: and after this, at a much later time, there followed also the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this cause that He might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries home on His shoulders the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may make the man of God complete, united to the deity in body and in soul. And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now the soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the result of being ill-advised: and this He sanctifies by union with Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy along with the first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the destruction of the enemies of the Lord, said, \"They are dead which sought the young Child's life[fn-12-P1207_658887:196-nf] ,\" (or \"soul\"): and the Lord says to the Jews, \"Ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth[fn-12-P1208_659073:197-nf] .\" Now by \"Man\" is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is composed of both, soul and body. And again, He says to them, \"Are ye angry at Me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day[fn-12-P1209_659388:198-nf] ?\" And what He meant by \"every whit whole,\" He showed in the other Gospels, when He said to the man who was let down on a couch in the midst, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee,\" which is a healing of the soul, and, \"Arise and walk[fn-12-P1210_659636:199-nf] ,\" which has regard to the body: and in the Gospel of S. John, by liberating the soul also from its own malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, \"Thou art made whole, sin no more[fn-12-P1211_659932:200-nf] ,\" thou, that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul and in body. For so too does S. Paul speak, \"for to make in Himself of twain one new man[fn-12-P1212_660105:201-nf] .\" And so too He foretells that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul from His body, saying, \"No man taketh\" my soul \"from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again[fn-12-P1213_660370:202-nf] .\" Yea, the prophet David also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with foresight of Him, \"Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption[fn-12-P1214_660678:203-nf] ,\" while the Apostle Peter thus expounds the saying, that \"His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption.\" For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh and in the flesh and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at all times what It was by nature, and so continuing for ever. But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter said, \"This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ[fn-12-P1215_661720:204-nf] ;\" and we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them through His body. But it would be superfluous to encumber our argument by entering into every detail.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":18,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_15_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"132","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"A.

And in truth, through the goodness of God, you do not now need to be exhorted, inasmuch as, perfecting your faith at the very beginning of your saintly life, you display a devoted love in Christ. One thing, however, I do press upon you, that you do not go back on things you have already passed away from, that you do not long again for things you have already scorned, and that, having put your hand to the plow, you do not look back[fn-6-P691_280381:3-nf] again, retracing your steps; for, undoubtedly, by falling into this fault, your furrow will lose its straightness, and the cultivator will not receive his own proper reward. Moreover, he does not secure even a measure of thereward, if he has, in a measure, failed. For, as we must flee from sin to righteousness, so he who has entered on the practice of righteousness must beware lest he lay himself open to sin. For it is written that \"his righteousness shall not profit the righteous on the day on which hehas gone astray.\"[fn-6-P692_280928:4-nf] For this, then, we must take our stand, for this we must labor, that we, who have escaped from sins, do not lose the prepared rewards.

Our shield, therefore, is not to be cast aside, lest our side be exposed to attack; and our sword is not to be put away, lest the enemy then begin to give up all fear: moreover, we know that if he sees a man fully armed, he will retreat. Nor are we ignorant that it is a hard and difficult thing daily to fight against the flesh and the world. But if you reflect upon eternity, and if you consider the kingdom of heaven, which undoubtedly the Lord will condescend to bestow upon us although we are sinners, what suffering, I ask, is sufficiently great, by which we may merit such things? And besides, our struggle in this world is but for a short time; for although death do not speedily overtake us, old age will come.

And I to speak to deaf ears. I will therefore reply to your argument. Made up of soul and body, we have the nature of both substances. As the body is said to be healthy if it is troubled with no weakness, so the soul is free from fault if it is unshaken and undisturbed. And yet, although the body may be healthy, sound, and active, with all the faculties in their full vigour, yet it suffers much from infirmities at more or less frequent intervals, and, however strong it may be, is sometimes distressed by various humours; so the soul, bearing the onset of thoughts and agitations, even though it escape shipwreck, does not sail without danger, and remembering its weakness, is always anxious about death, according as it is written,[fn-78-P7842_2537113:42-nf] \"What man is he that shall live and not see death?\"-death, which threatens all mortal men, not through the decay of nature, but through the death of sin, according to the prophet's words,[fn-78-P7843_2537322:43-nf] \"The soul that sinneth, it shall die.\" Besides, we know that Enoch and Elias have not yet seen this death which is common to man and the brutes. Show me a body which is never sick, or which after sickness is ever safe and sound, and I will show you a soul which never sinned, and after acquiring virtues will never again sin. The thing is impossible, and all the more when we remember that vice borders on virtue, and that, if you deviate ever so little, you will either go astray or fall over a precipice. How small is the interval between obstinacy and perseverance, miserliness and frugality, liberality and extravagance, wisdom and craft, intrepidity and rashness, caution and timidity! some of which are classed as good, others as bad. And the same applies to bodies. If you take precautions against biliousness, the phlegm increases. If you dry up the humours too quickly, the blood becomes heated and vitiated with bile, and a sallow hue spreads over the countenance.

Accordingly, God gave him to live when he was formed into a living soul; but He charged him to live virtuously when he was required to obey a law. So also God shows that man was not constituted for death, by now wishing that he should be restored to life, preferring the sinner's repentance to his death.[fn-44-P4415_1426540:119-nf] As, therefore, God designed for man a condition of life, so man brought on himself a state of death; and this, too, neither through infirmity nor through ignorance, so that no blame can be imputed to the Creator. No doubt it was an angel who was the seducer; but then the victim of that seduction was free, and master of himself; and as being the image and likeness of God, was stronger than any angel; and as being, too, the afflatus of the Divine Being, was nobler than that material spirit of which angels were made.

Well, but Christ plainly teaches a new kind of patience,[fn-58-P5841_1768076:558-nf] when He actually prohibits the reprisals which the Creator permitted in requiring \"an eye for an eye,[fn-58-P5842_1768296:559-nf] and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-58-P5843_1768491:560-nf] and bids us, on the contrary, \"to him who smiteth us on the one cheek, to offer the other also, and to give up our coat to him that taketh away our cloak.\"[fn-58-P5844_1768667:561-nf] No doubt these are supplementary additions by Christ, but they are quite in keeping with the teaching of the Creator.

When by Zechariah He commanded, \"Let none of you imagine evil against his brother,\"[fn-58-P5847_1769047:564-nf] He did not expressly include his neighbour; but then in another passage He says, \"Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour.\"[fn-58-P5848_1769219:565-nf] He who counselled that an injury should be forgotten, was still more likely to counsel the patient endurance of it. But then, when He said, \"Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,\"[fn-58-P5849_1769421:566-nf] He thereby teaches that patience calmly waits for the infliction of vengeance. Therefore, inasmuch as it is incredible[fn-58-P5850_1769599:567-nf] that the same (God) should seem to require \"a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye,\" in return for an injury, who forbids not only all reprisals, but even a revengeful thought or recollection of an injury, in so far does it become plain to us in what sense He required \"an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,\"-not, indeed, for the purpose of permitting the repetition of the injury by retaliating it, which it virtually prohibited when it forbade vengeance; but for the purpose of restraining the injury in the first instance, which it had forbidden on pain of retaliation or reciprocity;[fn-58-P5851_1770219:568-nf] so that every man, in view of the permission to inflict a second (or retaliatory) injury, might abstain from the commission of the first (or provocative) wrong. For He knows how much more easy it is to repress violence by the prospect of retaliation, than by the promise of (indefinite) vengeance. Both results, however, it was necessary to provide, in consideration of the nature and the faith of men, that the man who believed in God might expect vengeance from God, while he who had no faith (to restrain him) might fear the laws which prescribed retaliation.[fn-58-P5852_1770808:569-nf] This purpose[fn-58-P5853_1770881:570-nf] of the law, which it was difficult to understand, Christ, as the Lord of the Sabbath and of the law, and of all the dispensations of the Father, both revealed and made intelligible,[fn-58-P5854_1771082:571-nf] when He commanded that \"the other cheek should be offered (to the smiter),\" in order that He might the more effectually extinguish all reprisals of an injury, which the law had wished to prevent by the method of retaliation, (and) which most certainly revelation[fn-58-P5855_1771407:572-nf] had manifestly restricted, both by prohibiting the memory of the wrong, and referring the vengeance thereof to God. Thus, whatever (new provision) Christ introduced, He did it not in opposition to the law, but rather in furtherance of it, without at all impairing the prescription[fn-58-P5856_1771707:573-nf] of the Creator. If, therefore,[fn-58-P5857_1771773:574-nf] one looks carefully[fn-58-P5858_1771809:575-nf] into the very grounds for which patience is enjoined (and that to such a full and complete extent), one finds that it cannot stand if it is not the precept of the Creator, who promises vengeance, who presents Himself as the judge (in the case). If it were not so,[fn-58-P5859_1772143:576-nf] -if so vast a weight of patience-which is to refrain from giving blow for blow; which is to offer the other cheek; which is not only not to return railing for railing, but contrariwise blessing; and which, so far from keeping the coat, is to give up the cloak also-is laid upon me by one who means not to help me,-(then all I can say is, ) he has taught me patience to no purpose,[fn-58-P5860_1772541:577-nf] because he shows me no reward to his precept-I mean no fruit of such patience. There is revenge which he ought to have permitted me to take, if he meant not to inflict it himself; if he did not give me that permission, then he should himself have inflicted it;[fn-58-P5861_1772820:578-nf] since it is for the interest of discipline itself that an injury should be avenged. For by the fear of vengeance all iniquity is curbed. But if licence is allowed to it without discrimination,[fn-58-P5862_1773057:579-nf] it will get the mastery-it will put out (a man's) both eyes; it will knock out[fn-58-P5863_1773151:580-nf] every tooth in the safety of its impunity. This, however, is (the principle) of your good and simply beneficent god-to do a wrong to patience, to open the door to violence, to leave the righteous undefended, and the wicked unrestrained! \"Give to every one that asketh of thee\"[fn-58-P5864_1773447:581-nf] -to the indigent of course, or rather to the indigent more especially, although to the affluent likewise. But in order that no man may be indigent, you have in Deuteronomy a provision commanded by the Creator to the creditor.[fn-58-P5865_1773693:582-nf] \"There shall not be in thine hand an indigent man; so that the Lord thy God shall bless thee with blessings,\"[fn-58-P5866_1773818:583-nf] -thee meaning the creditor to whom it was owing that the man was not indigent. But more than this. To one who does not ask, He bids a gift to be given. \"Let there be, not,\" He says, \"a poor man in thine hand; \"in other words, see that there be not, so far as thy will can prevent;[fn-58-P5867_1774143:584-nf] by which command, too, He all the more strongly by inference requires[fn-58-P5868_1774239:585-nf] men to give to him that asks, as in the following words also: \"If there be among you a poor man of thy brethren, thou shalt not turn away thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother. But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him as much as he wanteth,\"[fn-58-P5869_1774549:586-nf] Loans are not usually given, except to such as ask for them. On this subject of lending,[fn-58-P5870_1774661:587-nf] however, more hereafter.[fn-58-P5871_1774704:588-nf] Now, should any one wish to argue that the Creator's precepts extended only to a man's brethren, but Christ's to all that ask, so as to make the latter a new and different precept, (I have to reply) that one rule only can be made out of those principles, which show the law of the Creator to be repeated in Christ.[fn-58-P5872_1775054:589-nf] For that is not a different thing which Christ enjoined to be done towards all men, from that which the Creator prescribed in favour of a man's brethren. For although that is a greater charity, which is shown to strangers, it is yet not preferable to that[fn-58-P5873_1775413:590-nf] which was previously due to one's neighbours. For what man will be able to bestow the love (which proceeds from knowledge of character,[fn-58-P5874_1775566:591-nf] upon strangers? Since, however, the second step[fn-58-P5875_1776029:592-nf] in charity is towards strangers, while the first is towards one's neighbours, the second step will belong to him to whom the first also belongs, more fitly than the second will belong to him who owned no first.[fn-58-P5876_1776255:593-nf] Accordingly, the Creator, when following the course of nature, taught in the first instance kindness to neighbours,[fn-58-P5877_1776404:594-nf] intending afterwards to enjoin it towards strangers; and when following the method of His dispensation, He limited charity first to the Jews, but afterwards extended it to the whole race of mankind. So long, therefore, as the mystery of His government[fn-58-P5878_1776676:595-nf] was confined to Israel, He properly commanded that pity should be shown only to a man's brethren; but when Christ had given to Him \"the Gentiles for His heritage, and the ends of the earth for His possession,\" then began to be accomplished what was said by Hosea: \"Ye are not my people, who were my people; ye have not obtained mercy, who once obtained mercy\"[fn-58-P5879_1777057:596-nf] -that is, the (Jewish) nation. Thenceforth Christ extended to all men the law of His Father's compassion, excepting none from His mercy, as He omitted none in His invitation. So that, whatever was the ampler scope of His teaching, He received it all in His heritage of the nations. \"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.\"[fn-58-P5880_1777469:597-nf] In this command is no doubt implied its counterpart: \"And as ye would not that men should do to you, so should ye also not do to them likewise.\" Now, if this were the teaching of the new and previously unknown and not yet fully proclaimed deity, who had favoured me with no instruction beforehand, whereby I might first learn what I ought to choose or to refuse for myself, and to do to others what I would wish done to myself, not doing to them what I should be unwilling to have done to myself, it would certainly be nothing else than the chance-medley of my own sentiments[fn-58-P5881_1778065:598-nf] which he would have left to me, binding me to no proper rule of wish or action, in order that I might do to others what I would like for myself, or refrain from doing to others what I should dislike to have done to myself. For he has not, in fact, defined what I ought to wish or not to wish for myself as well as for others, so that I shape my conduct[fn-58-P5882_1778455:599-nf] according to the law of my own will, and have it in my power[fn-58-P5883_1778537:600-nf] not to render[fn-58-P5884_1778566:601-nf] to another what I would like to have rendered to myself-love, obedience, consolation, protection, and such like blessings; and in like manner to do to another what I should be unwilling to have done to myself-violence, wrong, insult, deceit, and evils of like sort. Indeed, the heathen who have not been instructed by God act on this incongruous liberty of the will and the conduct.[fn-58-P5885_1778967:602-nf] For although good and evil are severally known by nature, yet life is not thereby spent[fn-58-P5886_1779119:603-nf] under the discipline of God, which alone at last teaches men the proper liberty of their will and action in faith, asin the fear of God. The god of Marcion, therefore, although specially revealed, was, in spite of his revelation, unable to publish any summary of the precept in question, which had hitherto been so confined,[fn-58-P5887_1779463:604-nf] and obscure, and dark, and admitting of no ready interpretation, except according to my own arbitrary thought,[fn-58-P5888_1779591:605-nf] because he had provided no previous discrimination in the matter of such a precept. This, however, was not the case with my God[fn-58-P5889_1779744:606-nf] for He always and everywhere enjoined that the poor, and the orphan, and the widow should be protected, assisted, refreshed; thus by Isaiah He says: \"Deal thy bread to the hungry, and them that are houseless bring into thine house; when thou seest the naked, cover him.\"[fn-58-P5890_1780054:607-nf] By Ezekiel also He thus describes the just man: \"His bread will he give to the hungry, and the naked will he cover with a garment.\"[fn-58-P5891_1780208:608-nf] That teaching was even then a sufficient inducement to me to do to others what I would that they should do unto me. Accordingly, when He uttered such denunciations as, \"Thou shalt do no murder; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness,\" He taught me to refrain from doing to others what I should be unwilling to have done to myself; and therefore the precept developed in the Gospel will belong to Him alone, who anciently drew it up, and gave it distinctive point, and arranged it after the decision of His own teaching, and has now reduced it, suitably to its importance,[fn-58-P5892_1780852:609-nf] to a compendious formula, because (as it was predicted in another passage) the Lord-that is, Christ\" was to make (or utter) a concise word on earth.\"[fn-58-P5893_1781017:610-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":18,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"ANF-03","text":"And now, on the subject of a loan, when He asks, \"And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? \"[fn-58-P5897_1781657:611-nf] compare with this the following words of Ezekiel, in which He says of the before-mentioned just man, \"He hath not given his money upon usury, nor will he take any increase\"[fn-58-P5898_1781892:612-nf] -meaning the redundance of interest,[fn-58-P5899_1782001:613-nf] which is usury. The first step was to eradicate the fruit of the money lent,[fn-59-P5900_1782123:614-nf] the more easily to accustom a man to the loss, should it happen, of the money itself, the interest of which he had learnt to lose. Now this, we affirm, was the function of the law as preparatory to the gospel. It was engaged in forming the faith of such as would learn,[fn-59-P5901_1782432:615-nf] by gradual stages, for the perfect light of the Christian discipline, through the best precepts of which it was capable,[fn-59-P5902_1782582:616-nf] inculcating a benevolence which as yet expressed itself but falteringly.[fn-59-P5903_1782691:617-nf] For in the passage of Ezekiel quoted above He says, \"And thou shalt restore the pledge of the loan \"[fn-59-P5904_1782850:618-nf] -to him, certainly, who is incapable of repayment, because, as a matter of course, He would not anyhow prescribe the restoration of a pledge to one who was solvent. Much more clearly is it enjoined in Deuteronomy: \"Thou shalt not sleep upon his pledge; thou shalt be sure to return to him his garment about sunset, and he shall sleep in his own garment.\"[fn-59-P5905_1783294:619-nf] Clearer still is a former passage: \"Thou shalt remit every debt which thy neighbour oweth thee; and of thy brother thou shalt not require it, because it is called the release of the Lord thy God.\"[fn-59-P5906_1783518:620-nf] Now, when He commands that a debt be remitted to a man who shall be unable to pay it (for it is a still stronger argument when He forbids its being asked for from a man who is even able to repay it), what else does He teach than that we should lend to those of whom we cannot receive again, inasmuch as He has imposed so great a loss on lending? \"And ye shall be the children of God.\"[fn-59-P5907_1783923:621-nf] What can be more shameless, than for him to be making us his children, who has not permitted us to make children for ourselves by forbidding marriage?[fn-59-P5908_1784148:622-nf] How does he propose to invest his followers with a name which he has already erased? I cannot be the son of a eunuch Especially when I have for my Father the same great Being whom the universe claims for its! For is not the Founder of the universe as much a Father, even of all men, as (Marcion's) castrated deity,[fn-59-P5909_1784546:623-nf] who is the maker of no existing thing? Even if the Creator had not united male and female, and if He had not allowed any living creature whatever to have children, I yet had this relation to Him[fn-59-P5910_1784760:624-nf] before Paradise, before the fall, before the expulsion, before the two became one.[fn-59-P5911_1784865:625-nf] I became His son a second time,[fn-59-P5912_1785018:626-nf] as soon as He fashioned me[fn-59-P5913_1785059:627-nf] with His hands, and gave me motion with His inbreathing. Now again He names me His son, not begetting me into natural life, but into spiritual life.[fn-59-P5914_1785230:628-nf] \"Because,\" says He, \"He is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.\"[fn-59-P5915_1785338:629-nf] Well done,[fn-59-P5916_1785369:630-nf] Marcion! how cleverly have you withdrawn from Him the showers and the sunshine, that He might not seem to be a Creator! But who is this kind being[fn-59-P5917_1785529:631-nf] which hitherto has not been even known? How can he be kind who had previously shown no evidences of such a kindness as this, which consists of the loan to us of sunshine and rain?-who is not destined to receive from the human race (the homage due to that) Creator,-who, up to this very moment, in return for His vast liberality in the gift of the elements, bears with men while they offer to idols, more readily than Himself, the due returns of His graciousness. But God is truly kind even in spiritual blessings. \"The utterances[fn-59-P5918_1786074:632-nf] of the Lord are sweeter than honey and honeycombs.\"[fn-59-P5919_1786142:633-nf] He then has taunted[fn-59-P5920_1786182:634-nf] men as ungrateful who deserved to have their gratitude-even He, whose sunshine and rain even you, O Marcion, have enjoyed, but without gratitude! Your god, however, had no right to complain of man's ingratitude, because he had used no means to make them grateful. Compassion also does He teach: \"Be ye merciful,\" says He, \"as your Father also that had mercy upon you.\"[fn-59-P5921_1786571:635-nf] This injunction will be of a piece with, \"Deal thy bread to the hungry; and if he be houseless, bring him into thine house; and if thou seest the naked, cover him; \"[fn-59-P5922_1786768:636-nf] also with, \"Judge the fatherless, plead with the widow.\"[fn-59-P5923_1786847:637-nf] I recognise here that ancient doctrine of Him who \"prefers mercy to sacrifice.\"[fn-59-P5924_1786946:638-nf] If, however, it be now some other being which teaches mercy, on the ground of his own mercifulness, how happens it that he has been wanting in mercy to me for so vast an age? \"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto you: good measure, pressed down, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye measure withal, it shall be measured to you again.\"[fn-59-P5925_1787462:639-nf] As it seems to me, this passage announces a retribution proportioned to the merits. But from whom shall come the retribution? If only from men, in that case he teaches a merely human discipline and recompense; and in everything we shall have to obey man: if from the Creator, as the Judge and the Recompenser of merits, then He compels our submission to Him, in whose hands[fn-59-P5926_1787860:640-nf] He has placed a retribution which will be acceptable or terrible according as every man shall have judged or condemned, acquitted or dealt with,[fn-59-P5927_1788023:641-nf] his neighbour; if from (Marcion's god) himself, he will then exercise a judicial function which Marcion denies. Let the Marcionites therefore make their choice: Will it not be just the same inconsistency to desert the prescription of their master, as to have Christ teaching in the interest of men or of the Creator? But \"a blind man will lead a blind man into the ditch.\"[fn-59-P5928_1788418:642-nf] Some persons believe Marcion. But \"the disciple is not above his master.\"[fn-59-P5929_1788512:643-nf] Apelles ought to have remembered this-a corrector of Marcion, although his disciple.[fn-59-P5930_1788617:644-nf] The heretic ought to take the beam out of his own eye, and then he may convict[fn-59-P5931_1788717:645-nf] the Christian, should he suspect a mote to be in his eye. Just as a good tree cannot produce evil fruit, so neither can truth generate heresy; and as a corrupt tree cannot yield good fruit, so heresy will not produce truth. Thus, Marcion brought nothing good out of Cerdon's evil treasure; nor Apelles out of Marcion's.[fn-59-P5932_1789054:646-nf] For in applying to these heretics the figurative words which Christ used of men in general, we shall make a much more suitable interpretation of them than if we were to deduce out of them two gods, according to Marcion's grievous exposition.[fn-59-P5933_1789399:647-nf] I think that I have the best reason possible for insisting still upon the position which I have all along occupied, that in no passage to be anywhere found has another God been revealed by Christ. I wonder that in this place alone Marcion's hands should have felt benumbed in their adulterating labour.[fn-59-P5934_1789833:648-nf] But even robbers have their qualms now and then. There is no wrong-doing without fear, because there is none without a guilty conscience. So long, then, were the Jews cognisant of no other god but Him, beside whom they knew none else; nor did they call upon any other than Him whom alone they knew. This being the case, who will He clearly be[fn-59-P5935_1790364:649-nf] that said, \"Why callest thou me Lord, Lord? \"[fn-59-P5936_1790428:650-nf] Will it be he who had as yet never been called on, because never yet revealed;[fn-59-P5937_1790527:651-nf] or He who was ever regarded as the Lord, because known from the beginning-even the God of the Jews? Who, again, could possibly have added, \"and do not the things which I say? \"Could it have been he who was only then doing his best[fn-59-P5938_1790773:652-nf] to teach them? Or He who from the beginning had addressed to them His messages[fn-59-P5939_1790906:653-nf] both by the law and the prophets? He could then upbraid them with disobedience, even if He had no ground at any time else for His reproof. The fact is, that He who was then imputing to them their ancient obstinacy was none other than He who, before the coming of Christ, had addressed to them these words, \"This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart standeth far off from me.\"[fn-59-P5940_1791314:654-nf] Otherwise, how absurd it were that a new god, a new Christ, the revealer of a new and so grand a religion should denounce as obstinate and disobedient those whom he had never had it in his power to make trial of!","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":18,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_25_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"19.

And consequently not only they, but all those too who agree with them, are to be rejected, and are rendered infamous. We hold that the same should also be the case with robbers, or with those who assault the elderly. The laws of the world, indeed, put such persons to death; but we, with whom mercy has the first place, receive them under the mark of infamy to repentance. That infamy also with which they are stained, we are not able to remove; but our desire is to heal their souls by public penitence, and by satisfaction made to the Church: for public sins are not to be purged by secret correction. Those, again, who are suspected in the matter of the right faith, should by no means be admitted to prefer charges against priests, and against those of whose faith there is no doubt; and such persons should be held of doubtful authority in matters of human testimony. Their voice, consequently, should bereckoned invalid whose faith is doubted; and no credit should be given to those who are ignorant of the right faith. Accordingly, in judgment, inquiry should be made as to the conversation and faith of the person who accuses, and of him who is accused; since those who are not of correct conversation and faith, and whose life is open to impeachment, are not allowed to accuse their eiders, neither can such permission be given to those whose faith and life and liberty are unknown. Nor should vile persons be admitted to accuse them. But a clear examination is to be made as to what kind of persons the accusers are (rimandoesunt enucleatim personaeaccusatorum); for they are not to be admitted readily without writing, and are never to be admitted as accusers on mere writing. For no one may either accuse or be accused by mere writing, but with the living voice; and every one must lay his accusation in the presence of him whom he seeks to accuse. And no credit should be given to any accuser in the absence of him whom he seeks to accuse. In like manner, witnesses must not prefer their evidence by writing only; but they must give their testimony truthfully in their own persons, and in matters which they have seen and do know. And they are not to give evidence in any other cases or matters but in those which are known to have happened in their presence. Accusers, moreover, of one blood, are not to bear witness against those who are not related to the family, nor is that to be the case with domestics (familiares) or those proceeding from the house; but if it is their wish, and they agree among themselves, the parents only should give evidence in such cases, and not others. Neither accusers nor witnesses should be admitted who are open to any suspicion; for the feeling of relationship, or friendship, or lordship, is wont to impede the truth. Carnal love, and fear, and avarice, commonly blunt the perceptions of men, and pervert their opinions; so that they look on gain as godliness, and on money as the reward of prudence. Let no one, then, speak deceitfully to his neighbour.[fn-90-P9008_2926670:10-nf] The mouth of the malevolent is a deep pit. The innocent man, while he believes easily, falls readily; but though he falls, he rises; and the shuffler, with all his arts, goes headlong to ruin, whence he can never rise or escape. Therefore let every one weigh well his words, and let him not say to another what he would not say to himself. Whence the sacred Scripture says well: \"Do not that to another which thou wouldest not have done to thyself.\"[fn-90-P9009_2927138:11-nf] For we need time to do anything perfectly (maturius); and let us not be precipitate in our counsels or our works, neither let us violate order. But if any one has fallen in anything, let us not consign him to ruin; but let us reprove him with brotherly affection, as the blessed apostle says: \"If a man be overtaken in any fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, test thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another's burden, and so will ye fulfil the law of Christ.\"[fn-90-P9010_2927683:12-nf] Furthermore, the sainted David had deadly crimes to repent of, and yet he was continued in honour. The blessed Peter also shed the bitterest tears when he repented of having denied the Lord; but still he abode an apostle. And the Lord by the prophet makes this promise to the sinning: \"In the day that the sinner is converted, and repenteth, I will not mention any more against him all his transgressions.\"[fn-90-P9011_2928110:13-nf] ","title":"The Second Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":18,"verse":32,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_121_the_second_epistle","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"ANF-08","text":"For those are in error who think that the priests of the Lord, after a lapse, although they may have exhibited true repentance, are not capable of ministering to the Lord, and engaging their honourable offices, though they may lead a good life thereafter, and keep their priesthood correctly. And those who hold this opinion are not only in error, but also seem to dispute and act in opposition to the power of the keys committed to the Church, whereof it is said: \"Whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.\"[fn-90-P9016_2928722:14-nf] And in short, this opinion either is not the Lord's, or it is true. But be that as it may, we believe without hesitation, that both the priests of the Lord and other believers may return to their honours after a proper satisfaction for their error, as the Lord Himself testifies by His prophet: \"Shall he who falls not also rise again? and shall he who turns away not return? \"[fn-90-P9017_2929122:15-nf] And in another passage the Lord says: \"I desire not the death of the sinner, but that he may turn, and live.\"[fn-90-P9018_2929251:16-nf] And the prophet David, on his repentance, said: \"Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and uphold me with Thy free Spirit.\"[fn-90-P9019_2929416:17-nf] And he indeed, after his repentance, taught others also, and offered sacrifice to God, giving thereby an example to the teachers of the holy Church, that if they have fallen, and thereafter have exhibited a right repentance to God, they may do both things in like manner. For he taught when he said: \"I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto Thee.\"[fn-90-P9020_2929814:18-nf] And he offered sacrifice for himself, while he said: \"The sacrifice for God is a broken spirit.\"[fn-90-P9021_2929928:19-nf] For the prophet, seeing his own transgressions purged by repentance, had no doubt as to healing those of others by preaching, and by making offering to God. Thus the shedding of tears moves the mind's feeling (passionem). And when the satisfaction is made good, the mind is turned aside from anger. For how does that man think that mercy will be shown to himself, who does not forgive his neighbour? If offences abound, then, let mercy also abound; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption.[fn-90-P9022_2930467:20-nf] In the Lord's hand there is abundance of all things, because He is the Lord of powers (virtutum) and the King of glory.[fn-90-P9023_2930605:21-nf] For the apostle says: \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, `I say, 'at this time His righteousness, that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.\"[fn-90-P9024_2931088:22-nf] And David says: \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.\"[fn-90-P9025_2931204:23-nf] Man, therefore, is cleansed of his sin, and rises again by the grace of God though he has fallen, and abides in his first position, according to the above-cited authorities. Let him see to it that he sin no more, that the sentence of the Gospel may abide in him: \"Go, and sin no more.\"[fn-90-P9026_2931509:24-nf] Whence the apostle says: \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof: neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. What then? shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. I speak after the manner of men.\"[fn-90-P9027_2932427:25-nf] For greater is the sin of him who judgeth, than of him who is judged. \"Thinkest thou,\" says the apostle, \"O man, that judgest them that do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? or despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering? Dost thou not know that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek: but glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good.\"[fn-90-P9028_2933421:26-nf] My brethren, shun not only the holding, but even the hearing, of the judgment that bans mercy; for better is mercy than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.[fn-90-P9029_2933604:27-nf] We have replied to your interrogations shortly, because your letter found us burdened overmuch, and preoccupied with other judgments.

And yet hath there arisen a case in which a just man thought it his duty to do this, when the Sodomites with nefarious onset of lust were rushing upon his guests.

For, when it shall be defined, that a man is to sin less, that another may not sin more; then, of l course, by our committing thefts shall other men's committing of lewdness be guarded against, and incest by lewdness; and if any impiety shall seem even worse than incest even incest shall be pronounced meet to be done by us, if in such wise it can be wrought that that impiety be not commuted by others: and in each several kind of sins, both thefts for thefts, and lewdness for lewdness, and incest for incest, shall be accounted meet to be done: our own sins for other men's, not only less for greater, but even if it come to the very highest and worst fewer for more; if the stress of affairs so turns, that otherwise other men would not abstain from sin unless by our sinning, somewhat less indeed, but still sinning; so that in every case where an enemy who shall have power of this sort shall say, \"Unless thou be wicked, I will be more wicked, or unless thou do this wickedness, I will do more such,\" we must seem to admit wickedness in ourselves, if we wish to refrain (others) from wickedness. To be wise in this sort, what is it but to lose one's wits, or rather, to be downright mad? Mine own iniquity, not another's, whether perpetrated upon me or upon others, is that from which I must beware of damnation.

By it also it comes to pass that the very good will, which has now begun to be, is enlarged, and made so great that it is able to fulfil the divine commandments which it shall wish, when it shall once firmly and perfectly wish.

But \"the Son of man shall come in the glory of His own Father\" not alone, but \"with His own angels.\" And if you can conceive of all those who are fellow-helpers in the glory of the Word, and in the revelation of the Wisdom which is Christ, coming along with Him, you will see in what way the Son of man comes in the glory of His own Father with His own angels. And consider whether you cad in this connection say that the prophets who formerly suffered in virtue of their word having \"no form or beauty\" had an analogous position to the Word who had \"no form or beauty.\" And, as the Son of man comes in the glory of His own Father, so the angels, who are the words in the prophets, are present with Him preserving the measure of their own glory.

Now I think they must, in the first place, be required to show, if they can, agreeably to their own definition, that the Creator is just in punishing according to their deserts, either those who perished at the time of the deluge, or the inhabitants of Sodom, or those who had quitted Egypt, seeing we sometimes behold committed crimes more wicked and detestable than those for which the above-mentioned persons were destroyed, while we do not yet sere every sinner paying the penalty of his misdeeds. Will they say that He who at one time was just has been made good? Or will they rather be of opinion that He is even now just, but is patiently enduring human offences, while that then He was not even just, inasmuch as He exterminated innocent and sucking children along with cruel and ungodly giants? Now, such are their opinions, because they know not how to understand anything beyond the letter; otherwise they would show how it is literal justice for sins to be visited upon the heads of children to the third and fourth generation, and on children's children after them. By us, however, such things are not understood literally; but, as Ezekiel taught[fn-65-P6553_1298568:56-nf] when relating the parable, we inquire what is the inner meaning contained in the parable itself. Moreover, they ought to explain this also, how He is just, and rewards every one according to his merits, who punishes earthly-minded persons and the devil, seeing they have done nothing worthy of punishment.[fn-65-P6554_1298895:57-nf] For they could not do any good if, according to them, they were of a wicked and ruined nature. For as they style Him a judge, He appears to be a judge not so much of actions as of natures; and if a bad nature cannot do good, neither can a good nature do evil. Then, in the next place, if He whom the), call good is good to all, He is undoubtedly good also to those who are destined to perish. And why does He not save them? If He does not desire to do so, He will be no longer good; if He does desire it, and cannot effect it, He will not be omnipotent. Why do they not rather hear the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospels, preparing fire for the devil and his angels? And how shall that proceeding, as penal as it is sad, appear to be, according to their view, the work of the good God? Even the Saviour Himself, the Son of the good God, protests in the Gospels, and declares that \"if signs and wonders had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented[fn-65-P6555_1299914:58-nf] long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.\" And when He had come near to those very cities, and had entered their territory, why, pray, does He avoid entering those cities, and exhibiting to them abundance of signs and wonders, if it were certain that they would have repented, after they had been performed, in sackcloth and ashes? But as He does not do this, He undoubtedly abandons to destruction those whom the language of the Gospel shows not to have been of a wicked or mined nature, inasmuch as it declares they were capable of repentance. Again, in a certain parable of the Gospel, where the king enters in to see the guests reclining at the banquet, he beheld a certain individual not clothed with wedding raiment, and said. to him, \"Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment? \"and then ordered his servants, \"Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"[fn-65-P6556_1300886:59-nf] Let them tell us who is that king who entered in to see the guests, and finding one amongst them with unclean garments, commanded him to be bound by his servants, and thrust out into outer darkness. Is he the same whom they call just? How then had he commanded good and bad alike to be invited, without directing their merits to be inquired into by his servants? By such procedure would be indicated, not the character of a just God who rewards according to men's deserts, as they assert, but of one who displays undiscriminating goodness towards all. Now, if this must necessarily be understood of the good God, i.e., either of Christ or of the Father of Christ, what other objection can they bring against the justice of God's judgment? Nay, what else is there so unjust charged by them against the God of the law as to order him who had been invited by His servants, whom He had sent to call good and bad alike, to be bound hand and foot, and to be thrown into outer darkness, because he had on unclean garments?","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":18,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"ANF-04","text":"3.

But it appears to some that this also may be added, that as the thing which was lost undoubtedly existed before it was lost, at which time it was something else than destroyed, so also will be the case when it is no longer in a ruined condition. In like manner also, the soul which is said to have perished will appear to have been something at one time, when as yet it had not perished, and on that account would be termed soul, and being again freed from destruction, it may become a second time what it was before it perished, and be called a soul. But from the very signification of the name soul which the Greek word conveys, it has appeared to a few curious inquirers that a meaning of no small importance may be suggested. For in sacred language God is called a fire, as when Scripture says,\" Our God is a consuming fire.\"[fn-66-P6656_1349244:134-nf] Respecting the substance of the angels also it speaks as follows: \"Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a burning fire; \"[fn-66-P6657_1349400:135-nf] and in another place, \"The angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire in the bush.\"[fn-66-P6658_1349521:136-nf] We have, moreover, received a commandment to be \"fervent in spirit; \"[fn-66-P6659_1349610:137-nf] by which expression undoubtedly the Word of God is shown to be hot and fiery. The prophet Jeremiah also hears from Him, who gave him his answers, \"Behold, I have given My words into thy mouth a fire.\"[fn-66-P6660_1349832:138-nf] As God, then, is a fire, and the angels a flame of fire, and all the saints are fervent in spirit, so, on the contrary, those who have fallen away from the love of God are undoubtedly said to have cooled in their affection for Him, and to have become cold. For the Lord also says, that, \"because iniquity has abounded, the love of many will grow cold.\"[fn-66-P6661_1350277:139-nf] Nay, all things, whatever they are, which in holy Scripture are compared with the hostile power, the devil is said to be perpetually finding cold; and what is found to be colder than he? In the sea also the dragon is said to reign. For the prophet[fn-66-P6662_1350548:140-nf] intimates that the serpent and dragon, which certainly is referred to one of the wicked spirits, is also in the sea. And elsewhere the prophet says, \"I will draw out my holy sword upon the dragon the flying serpent, upon the dragon the crooked serpent, and will slay him.\"[fn-66-P6663_1350853:141-nf] And again he says: \"Even though they hide from my eyes, and descend into the depths of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.\"[fn-66-P6664_1351030:142-nf] In the book of Job also, he is said to be the king of all things in the waters.[fn-66-P6665_1351129:143-nf] The prophet[fn-66-P6666_1351168:144-nf] threatens that evils will be kindled by the north wind upon all who inhabit the earth. Now the north wind is described in holy Scripture as cold, according to the statement in the book of Wisdom, \"That cold north wind; \"[fn-66-P6667_1351408:145-nf] which same thing also must undoubtedly be understood of the devil. If, then, those things which are holy are named fire, and light, and fervent, while those which are of an opposite nature are said to be cold; and if the love of many is said to wax cold; we have to inquire whether perhaps the name soul, which in Greek is termed yukh/, be so termed from growing cold[fn-66-P6668_1351802:146-nf] out of a betterand more divine condition, and be thence derived, because it seems to have cooled from thatnatural and divine warmth, and therefore has been placed in its present position, and called by its present name. Finally, see if you caneasily find a place in holy Scripture where thesoul is properly mentioned in terms of praise: it frequently occurs, on the contrary, accompanied with expressions of censure, as in the passage, \"An evil soul ruins him who possesses it; \"[fn-66-P6669_1352309:147-nf] and, \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\"[fn-66-P6670_1352376:148-nf] For after it has been said, \"All souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine,\"[fn-66-P6671_1352521:149-nf] it seemed to follow that He would say, \"The soul that doeth righteousness, it shall be saved,\" and \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\" But now we see that He has associated with the soul what is censurable, and has been silent as to that which was deserving of praise. We have therefore to see if, perchance, as we have said is declared by the name itself, it was called yukh/, i.e., anima, because it has waxed cold from the fervour of just things,[fn-66-P6672_1353002:150-nf] and from participation in the divine fire, and yet has not lost the power of restoring itself to that condition of fervour in which it was at the beginning. Whence the prophet also appears to point out some such state of things by the words, \"Return, O my soul, unto thy rest.\"[fn-66-P6673_1353622:151-nf] From all which this appears to be made out, that the understanding, falling away from its status and dignity, was made or named soul; and that, if repaired and corrected, it returns to the condition of the understanding.[fn-66-P6674_1353863:152-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":18,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"ANF-04","text":"3.

In the sea also the dragon is said to reign. For the prophet[fn-66-P6662_1350548:140-nf] intimates that the serpent and dragon, which certainly is referred to one of the wicked spirits, is also in the sea. And elsewhere the prophet says, \"I will draw out my holy sword upon the dragon the flying serpent, upon the dragon the crooked serpent, and will slay him.\"[fn-66-P6663_1350853:141-nf] And again he says: \"Even though they hide from my eyes, and descend into the depths of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.\"[fn-66-P6664_1351030:142-nf] In the book of Job also, he is said to be the king of all things in the waters.[fn-66-P6665_1351129:143-nf] The prophet[fn-66-P6666_1351168:144-nf] threatens that evils will be kindled by the north wind upon all who inhabit the earth. Now the north wind is described in holy Scripture as cold, according to the statement in the book of Wisdom, \"That cold north wind; \"[fn-66-P6667_1351408:145-nf] which same thing also must undoubtedly be understood of the devil. If, then, those things which are holy are named fire, and light, and fervent, while those which are of an opposite nature are said to be cold; and if the love of many is said to wax cold; we have to inquire whether perhaps the name soul, which in Greek is termed yukh/, be so termed from growing cold[fn-66-P6668_1351802:146-nf] out of a betterand more divine condition, and be thence derived, because it seems to have cooled from thatnatural and divine warmth, and therefore has been placed in its present position, and called by its present name. Finally, see if you caneasily find a place in holy Scripture where thesoul is properly mentioned in terms of praise: it frequently occurs, on the contrary, accompanied with expressions of censure, as in the passage, \"An evil soul ruins him who possesses it; \"[fn-66-P6669_1352309:147-nf] and, \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\"[fn-66-P6670_1352376:148-nf] For after it has been said, \"All souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine,\"[fn-66-P6671_1352521:149-nf] it seemed to follow that He would say, \"The soul that doeth righteousness, it shall be saved,\" and \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\" But now we see that He has associated with the soul what is censurable, and has been silent as to that which was deserving of praise. We have therefore to see if, perchance, as we have said is declared by the name itself, it was called yukh/, i.e., anima, because it has waxed cold from the fervour of just things,[fn-66-P6672_1353002:150-nf] and from participation in the divine fire, and yet has not lost the power of restoring itself to that condition of fervour in which it was at the beginning. Whence the prophet also appears to point out some such state of things by the words, \"Return, O my soul, unto thy rest.\"[fn-66-P6673_1353622:151-nf] From all which this appears to be made out, that the understanding, falling away from its status and dignity, was made or named soul; and that, if repaired and corrected, it returns to the condition of the understanding.[fn-66-P6674_1353863:152-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":18,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_47_on_repentance_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-03","text":"To all sins, then, committed whether by flesh or spirit, whether by deed or will, the same God who has destined penalty by means of judgment, has withal engaged to grant pardon by means of repentance, saying to the people, \"Repent thee, and I will save thee; \"[fn-112-P11296_3203617:21-nf] and again, \"I live, saith the Lord, and I will (have) repentance rather than death.\"[fn-112-P11297_3203734:22-nf] Repentance, then, is \"life,\" since it is preferred to \"death.\" That repentance, O sinner, like myself (nay, rather, less than myself, for pre-eminence in sins I acknowledge to be mine[fn-112-P11298_3203975:23-nf] ), do you so hasten to, so embrace, as a shipwrecked man the protection[fn-112-P11299_3204074:24-nf] of some plank.

Wherefore also Cleanthes, in the second book, On Pleasure, says that Socrates everywhere teaches that the just man and the happy are one and the same, and execrated the first man who separated the just from the useful, as having done an impious thing. For those are in truth impious who separate the useful from that which is tight according to the law. Plato himself says that happiness (eu0daimoni/a) is to possess rightly the daemon, and that the ruling faculty of the soul is called the daemon; and he terms happiness (eu0daimoni/a) the most perfect and complete good. Sometimes he calls it a consistent and harmonious life, sometimes the highest perfection in accordance with virtue; and this he places in the knowledge of the Good, and in likeness to God, demonstrating likeness to be justice and holiness with wisdom. For is it not thus that some of our writers have understood that man straightway on his creation received what is\"according to the image,\" but that what is according\"to the likeness\" he will receive afterwards on his perfection? Now Plato, teaching that the virtuous man shall have this likeness accompanied with humility, explains the following: \"He that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\"[fn-60-P6077_1854965:259-nf] He says, accordingly, in The Laws: \"God indeed, as the ancient saying has it, occupying the beginning, the middle, and the end of all things, goes straight through while He goes round the circumference. And He is always attended by Justice, the avenger of those who revolt from the divine law.\" You see how he connects fear with the divine law. He adds, therefore: \"To which he, who would be happy, cleaving, will follow lowly and beautified.\" Then, connecting what follows these words, and admonishing by fear, he adds: \"What conduct, then, is dear and conformable to God? That which is characterized by one word of old date: Like will be dear to like, as to what is in proportion; but things out of proportion are neither dear to one another, nor to those which are in proportion. And that therefore he that would be dear to God, must, to the best of his power, become such as He is. And in virtue of the same reason, our self-controlling man is dear to God. But he that has no self-control is unlike and diverse.\" In saying that it was an ancient dogma, he indicates the teaching which had come to him from the law. And having in the Theataetus admitted that evils make the circuit of mortal nature and of this spot, he adds: \"Wherefore we must try to flee hence as soon as possible. For flight is likeness to God as far as possible.

For to every one who has turned to God in truth, and with his whole heart, the doors are open, and the thrice-glad Father receives His truly repentant son. And true repentance is to be no longer bound in the same sins for which He denounced death against Himself, but to eradicate them completely from the soul. For on their extirpation God takes up His abode again in thee.

For many taking occasion by this saying, insist with crass intelligence that these things will be given carnally in the millennium, though they must certainly admit that age, which they say will be after the resurrection cannot possibly be understood as present. It is then more credible and much clearer that one, who at the persuasion of Christ has made light of any worldly affections or goods, receives from the brethren and partners of his life, who are joined to him by a spiritual tie, even in this life a love which is an hundred times better: since it is certain that among parents and children and brothers, wives and relations, where either the tie is merely formed by intercourse, or the bond of union by the claims of relationship, the love is tolerably short lived and easily broken. Finally even good and duteous children when they have grown up, are sometimes shut out by their parents from their homes and property, and sometimes for a really good reason the tie of matrimony is severed, and a quarrelsome division destroys the property of brothers. Monks alone maintain a lasting union in intimacy, and possess all things in common,as they hold that everything that belongs to their brethren is their own, and that everything which is their own is their brethren's. If then the grace of our love is compared to those affections where the bond of union is a carnal love, certainly it is an hundred times sweeter and finer. There will indeed also be gained from conjugal continence a pleasure that is an hundred times greater than that which arises from the union of the sexes. And instead of that joy, which a man experiences from the possession of a single field of house,he will enjoy a delight in riches a hundred times greater, if he passes over to the adoption of sons of God, and possesses as his own all things which belong to the eternal Father, and asserts in heart and soul after the fash- ion of that true Son: \"All things that the Father hath are mine;\"[fn-68-P6834_2447022:59-nf] and if no longer tried by that criminal anxiety in distractions and cares, but free from care and glad at heart he succeeds everywhere to his own, hearing daily the announcement made to him by the Apostle: \"For all things are yours, whether the world, or things present, or things to come;\" and by Solomon: \"The faithful man has a whole world of riches.\"[fn-68-P6835_2447401:60-nf] You have then that recompense of an hundredfold brought out by the greatness of the value, and the difference of the character that cannot be estimated. For if for a fixed weight of brass or iron or some still commoner metal, one had given in exchange the same weight only in gold, he would appear to have given much more than an hundredfold. And so when for the scorn of delights and earthly affections there is made a recompense of spiritual joy and the gladness of a most precious love, even if the actual amount be the same, yet it is an hundred times better and grander. And to make this plainer by frequent repetition: I used formerly to have a wife in the lustful passion of desire: I now have one in honourable sanctification and the true love of Christ. The woman is but one, but the value of the love has increased an hundredfold. But if instead of distrusting anger and wrath you have regard to constant gentleness and patience, instead of the stress of anxiety and trouble, peace and freedom from care, insteadof the fruitless and criminal vexation of this world the salutary fruits of sorrow, instead of the vanity of temporal joy the richness of spiritual delights, you will see in the change of these feelings a recompense of an hundredfold. And if we compare with the short-lived and fleeting pleasure of each sin the benefits of the opposite virtues the increased delights will prove that these are an hundred times better. For in counting on your fingers you transfer the number of an hundred from the left hand to the right and though you seem to keep the same arrangement of the fingers yet there is a great increase in the amount of the quantity.[fn-68-P6836_2449091:61-nf] For the result will be that we who seemed to bear the form of the goats on the left hand, will be removed and gain the reward of the sheep on the right hand. Now let us pass on to consider the nature of those things which Christ gives back to us in this world for our scorn of worldly advantages, more particularly according to the Gospel of Mark who says: \"There is no man who hath left house or brethren or sisters or mother or children or lands for My sake and the gospel's sake, who shall not receive an hundred times as much now in this time: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come life eternal.\"[fn-68-P6837_2449809:62-nf] For he who for the sake of Christ's name disregards the love of a single father or mother or child, and gives himself over to the purest love of all who serve Christ, will receive an hundred times the amount of brethren and kinsfolk; since instead of but one he will begin to have so many fathers and brethren bound to him by a still more fervent and admirable affection. He also will be enriched with an increased possession of lands, who has given up a single house for the love of Christ, and possesses countless homes in monasteries as his own, to whatever part of the world he may retire, as to his own house. For how can he fail to receive an hundredfold, and, if it is not wrong to add somewhat to our Lord's words, more than an hundredfold, who gives up the faithless and compulsory service of ten or twenty slaves and relies on the spontaneous attendance of so many noble and free born men? And that this is so you could prove by your own experience, as since you have each left but one father and mother and home, you have gained without any effort or care, in any part of the world to which you have come, countless fathers and mothers and brethren, as well as houses and lands and most faithful servants, who receive you as their masters, and welcome, and respect, and take care of you with the utmost attention. But, I say that deservedly and confidently will the saints enjoy this service, if they have first submitted themselves and everything they have by a voluntary offering for the service of the brethren. For, as the Lord says, they will freely receive back that which they themselves have bestowed on others. But if a man has not first offered this with true humility to his companions, how can he calmly endure to have it offered to him by others, when he knows that he is burdened rather than helped by their services, because he prefers to receive attention from the brethren rather than to give it to them?","title":"XXIV.

From both, then, men are in danger; both from hoping and despairing, from contrary things, from contrary affections. Who is deceived by hoping? He who says, God is good, God is merciful, let me do what I please, what I like; let me give loose reins to my lusts, let me gratify the desires of my soul. Why this? Because God is merciful, God is good, God is kind. These men are in danger by hope. And those are in danger from despair, who, having fallen into grievous sins, fancying that they can no more be pardoned upon repentance, and believing that they are without doubt doomed to damnation, do say with themselves, We are already destined to be damned, why not do what we please with the disposition of gladiators destined to the sword. This is the reason that desperate men are dangerous: for, having no longer aught to fear, they are to be feared exceedingly. Despair kills these; hope, those. The mind is tossed to and fro between hope and despair. Thou hast to fear lest hope slay thee; and, when thou hopest much from mercy, test thou fall into judgment: again, thou hast to fear lest despair slay thee, and, when thou thinkest that the grievous sins which thou hast committed cannot be forgiven thee, thou dost not repent, and thou incurrest the sentence of Wisdom, which says, \"I also will laugh at your perdition.\"[fn-15-P1505_951617:7-nf] How then does the Lord treat those who are in danger from both these maladies?

Thou knowest not when thy last day may come. Art thou ungrateful because thou hast to-day on which thou mayest be improved? Thus therefore said He to the woman, \"Neither will I condemn thee;\" but, being made secure concerning the past, beware of the future. \"Neither will I condemn thee:\" I have blotted out what thou hast done; keep what I have commanded thee, that thou mayest find what I have promised.","title":"Tractate XXXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":18,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_74_letter_iii_for_331_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"4.

Neither let the new heretics flatter themselves in this, that they say that they do not communicate with idolaters; although among them there are both adulterers and fraudulent persons, who are held guilty of the crime of idolatry, according to the saying of the apostle: \"For know this with understanding, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, whose guilt is that of idolatry, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.\"[fn-56-P5648_1736248:55-nf] And again: \"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; putting off fornication, uncleanness, and evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which are the service of idols: for which things' sake cometh the wrath of God.\"[fn-56-P5649_1736494:56-nf] For as our bodies are members of Christ, and we are each a temple of God, whosoever violates the temple of God by adultery, violates God; and he who, in committing sins, does the will of the devil, serves demons and idols. For evil deeds do not come from the Holy Spirit, but from the prompting of the adversary, and lusts born of the unclean spirit constrain men to act against God and to obey the devil. Thus it happens that if they say that one is polluted by another's sin, and if they con tend, by their own asseveration, that the idolatry of the delinquent passes over to one who is not guilty according to their own word; they cannot be excused from the crime of idolatry, since from the apostolic proof it is evident that the adulterers and defrauders with whom they communicate are idolaters. But with us, according to our faith and the given rule of divine preaching, agrees the principle of truth, that every one is himself held fast in his own sin; nor can one become guilty for another, since the Lord forewarns us, saying, \"The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.\"[fn-56-P5650_1737660:57-nf] And again: \"The fathers shall not die for the children, and the children shall not die for the fathers. Every one shall die in his own sin.\"[fn-56-P5651_1737823:58-nf] Reading and observing this, we certainly think that no one is to be restrained from the fruit of satisfaction, and the hope of peace, since we know, according to the faith of the divine Scriptures, God Himself being their author, and exhorting in them, both that sinners are brought back to repentance, and that pardon and mercy are not denied to penitents.[fn-56-P5652_1738203:59-nf] ","title":"Epistle LI.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":18,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_241_letter_ccxxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"What evidence of my frame of mind ought you to have preferred to your own? Has there been the slightest want of harmony in my utterances about the faith at Chalcedon, again and again at Heraclea, and at an earlier period in the suburb of Caesarea? Are they not all mutually consistent? I only except the increase in force of which I spoke just now, resulting from advance, and which is not to be regarded as a change from worse to better, but rather as a filling up of what was wanting in the addition of knowledge. How can you fail to bear in mind that the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son, nor the son bear the iniquity of the father, but each shall die in his own sin?[fn-53-P5325_1670939:21-nf] I have neither father nor son slandered by you; I have had neither teacher nor disciple.

If on the other hand it is unjust for any one to be accused for their sakes, it is far more unjust that I should be held responsible for the sake of men with whom I have nothing to do, even if they were in every respect sinners, and something worthy of condemnation has been written by them.

Vain then is the labour of the righteous man, and free from blame is the way of the sinner, if a change befall, and the former turn from the better to the worse, and the latter from the worse to the better. So we hear from Ezekiel teaching as it were in the name of the Lord, when he says, \"if the righteous turneth away and committeth iniquity, I will not remember the righteousness which he committed before; in his sin he shall die,\"[fn-31-P3177_1041989:4-nf] and so too about the sinner; if he turn away from his wickedness, and do that which is right, he shall live. Where were all the labours of God's servant Moses, when the gainsaying of one moment shut him out from entering into the promised land? What became of the companionship of Gehazi with Elissaeus, when he brought leprosy on himself by his covetousness? What availed all Solomon's vast wisdom, and his previous regard for God, when afterwards from his mad love of women he fell into idolatry? Not even the blessed David was blameless, when his thoughts went astray and he sinned against the wife of Uriah. One example were surely enough for keeping safe one who is living a godly life, the fall from the better to the worse of Judas, who, after being so long Christ's disciple, for a mean gain sold his Master and got a halter for himself. Learn then, brother, that it is not he who begins well who is perfect. It is he who ends well who is approved in God's sight. Give then no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids[fn-31-P3178_1043044:5-nf] that you may be delivered \"as a roe from the net and a bird from the snare.\"[fn-31-P3179_1043143:6-nf] For, behold, you are passing through the midst of snares; you are treading on the top of a high wall whence a fall is perilous to the fuller; wherefore do not straightway attempt extreme discipline; above all things beware of confidence in yourself, lest you fall from a height of discipline through want of training. It is better to advance a little at a time. Withdraw then by degrees from the pleasures of life, gradually destroying all your wonted habits, lest you bring on yourself a crowd of temptations by irritating all your passions at once. When you have mastered one passion, then begin to wage war against another, and in this manner you will in good time get the better of all. Indulgence, so far as the name goes, is one, but its practical workings are diverse. First then, brother, meet every temptation with patient endurance. And by what various temptations the faithful man is proved; by worldly loss, by accusations, by lies, by opposition, by calumny, by persecution! These and the like are the tests of the faithful. Further, be quiet, not rash in speech, not quarrelsome, not disputatious, not covetous of vain glory, not more anxious to get than to give knowledge,[fn-31-P3180_1044352:7-nf] not a man of many words, but always more ready to learn than to teach. Do not trouble yourself about worldly life; from it no good can come to you. It is said, \"That my mouth speak not the works of men.\"[fn-31-P3181_1044638:8-nf] The man who is fond of talking about sinners' doings, soon rouses the desire for self indulgence; much better busy yourself about the lives of good men for so you will get some profit for yourself. Do not be anxious to go travelling about[fn-31-P3182_1044897:9-nf] from village to village anti house to house; rather avoid them as traps for souls. If any one, for true pity's sake, invite you with many pleas to enter his house, let him be told to follow the faith of the centurion, who, when Jesus was hastening to him to perform an act of healing, besought him not to do so in the words, \"Lord I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed,\"[fn-31-P3183_1045387:10-nf] and when Jesus had said to him \"Go thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee,\"[fn-31-P3184_1045500:11-nf] his servant was healed from that hour. Learn then, brother, that it was the faith of the suppliant, not the presence of Christ, which delivered the sick man. So too now, if you pray, in whatever place you be, and the sick man believes that he will be aided by your prayers, all will fall out as he desires.","title":"Letter XLII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":18,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_62_letter_xliv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2.

Do not sink back. Remember the days of old. There is salvation; there is amendment. Be of good cheer; do not despair. It is not a law condemning to death without pity, but mercy remitting punishment and awaiting improvement. The doors are not yet shut; the bridegroom hears; sin is not the master. Make another effort, do not hesitate, havepity on yourself and on all of us in Jesus Christ our Lord, to Whom be glory and might now and for ever and ever.
