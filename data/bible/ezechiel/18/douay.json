{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:  What is the meaning?","That you use among you this parable as a proverb in the land of\nIsrael, saying:  The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of\nthe children are set on edge.","As I live, saith the Lord God, this parable shall be no more to\nyou a proverb in Israel.","Behold all souls are mine:  as the soul of the father, so also the\nsoul of the son is mine:  the soul that sinneth, the same shall die.","And if a man be just, and do judgment and justice,","And hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to\nthe idols of the house of Israel:  and hath not defiled his neighbour's\nwife, nor come near to a menstruous woman:","And hath not wronged any man:  but hath restored the pledge to the\ndebtor, hath taken nothing away by violence:  hath given his bread to\nthe hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment:","Hath not lent upon usury, nor taken any increase:  hath withdrawn\nhis hand from iniquity, and hath executed true judgment between man and\nman:","Hath walked in my commandments, and kept my judgments, to do\ntruth:  he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord God.","And if he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and\nthat hath done some one of these things:","Though he doth not all these things, but that eateth upon the\nmountains, and that defileth his neighbour's wife:","That grieveth the needy and the poor, that taketh away by\nviolence, that restoreth not the pledge, and that lifteth up his eyes\nto idols, that comitteth abomination:","That giveth upon usury, and that taketh an increase:  shall such\na one live?  he shall not live.  Seeing he hath done all these detestable\nthings, he shall surely die, his blood shall be upon him.","But if he beget a son, who, seeing all his father's sins, which\nhe hath done, is afraid, and shall not do the like to them:","That hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes\nto the idols of the house of Israel, and hath not defiled his\nneighbour's wife:","And hath not grieved any man, nor withholden the pledge, nor\ntaken away with violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and\ncovered the naked with a garment:","That hath turned away his hand from injuring the poor, hath not\ntaken usury and increase, but hath executed my judgments, and hath\nwalked in my commandments:  this man shall not die for the iniquity of\nhis father, but living he shall live.","As for his father, because he oppressed and offered violence to\nhis brother, and wrought evil in the midst of his people, behold he is\ndead in his own iniquity.","And you say:  Why hath not the son borne the iniquity of his\nfather?  Verily, because the son hath wrought judgment and justice, hath\nkept all my commandments, and done them, living, he shall live.","The soul that sinneth, the same shall die:  the son shall not\nbear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the\niniquity of the son:  the justice of the just shall be upon him, and the\nwickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.","But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath\ncommitted, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice,\nliving he shall live, and shall not die.","I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done:  in his\njustice which he hath wrought, he shall live.","Is it my will that a sinner should die, saith the Lord God, and\nnot that he should be converted from his ways, and live?","But if the just man turn himself away from his justice, and do\niniquity according to all the abominations which the wicked man useth\nto work, shall he live?  all his justices which he hath done, shall not\nbe remembered:  in the prevarication, by which he hath prevaricated, and\nin his sin, which he hath committed, in them he shall die.","And you have said:  The way of the Lord is not right.  Hear ye,\ntherefore, O house of Israel:  Is it my way that is not right, and are\nnot rather your ways perverse?","For when the just turneth himself away from his justice, and\ncomitteth iniquity, he shall die therein:  in the injustice that he hath\nwrought he shall die.","And when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness,\nwhich he hath wrought, and doeth judgment, and justice:  he shall save\nhis soul alive.","Because he considereth and turneth away himself from all his\niniquities which he hath wrought, he shall surely live, and not die.","And the children of Israel say:  The way of the Lord is not\nright.  Are not my ways right, O house of Israel, and are not rather\nyour ways perverse?","Therefore will I judge every man according to his ways, O house\nof Israel, saith the Lord God.  Be converted, and do penance for all\nyour iniquities:  and iniquity shall not be your ruin.","Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which you have\ntransgressed, and make to yourselves a new heart, and a new spirit:  and\nwhy will you die, O house of Israel?","For I desire not the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord\nGod, return ye and live."]}
