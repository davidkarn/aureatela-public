How then can you say that all sins are drowned in the baptismal layer if a man's wife is still to swim on the surface as evidence against him? The psalmist says:-\"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.\"[fn-29-P2921_769527:2092-nf] It would seem that we must add something to this song and say \"Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not a wife.\" Let us hear also the declaration which Ezekiel the so called\"son of man\"[fn-29-P2922_769746:2093-nf] makes concerning the virtueof him who is to be the true son of man, theChristian: \"I will take you,\" he says, \"from among the heathen ...then will I sprinkleclean water upon you, and ye shall be cleanfrom all your filthinessa new heart also will I give you and a new spirit.\"[fn-29-P2923_770042:2094-nf] \"From all your filthiness\" he says, \"will I cleanse you.\" If all is taken away nothing can be left.

And \"when we were dead in our sins and in the uncircumcision of our flesh, God hath quickened us together with Him, having forgiven us all trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way nailing it to His cross.\"[fn-29-P2930_771727:2101-nf] Can it be that when our whole being is dead with Christ and when all the sins noted down in the old \"handwriting\" are blotted out, the one word \"wife\" alone lives on?

You have asked also, dearest son, what I thought of those who obtain God's grace in sickness and weakness, whether they are to be accounted legitimate Christians, for that they are not to be washed, but sprinkled, with the saving water. In this point, my diffidence and modesty prejudges none, so as to prevent any from feeling what he thinks right, and from doing what he feels to be right.[fn-65-P6512_2103361:26-nf] As far as my poor understanding conceives it, I think that the divine benefits can in no respect be mutilated and weakened; nor can anything less occur in that case, where, with full and entire faith both of the giver and receiver, is accepted what is drawn from the divine gifts. For in the sacrament of salvation the contagion of sins is not in such wise washed away, as the filth of the skin and of the body is washed away in the carnal and ordinary washing, as that there should be need of saltpetre and other appliances also, and a bath and a basin wherewith this vile body must be washed and purified. Otherwise is the breast of the believer washed; otherwise is the mind of man purified by the merit of faith. In the sacraments of salvation, when necessity compels, and God bestows His mercy, the divine methods confer the whole benefit on believers; nor ought it to trouble any one that sick people seem to be sprinkled or affused, when they obtain the Lord's grace, when Holy Scripture speaks by the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel, and says, \"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from alI your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you.\"[fn-65-P6513_2104816:27-nf] Also in Numbers: \"And the man that shall be unclean until the evening shall be purified on the third day, and on the seventh day shall be clean: but if he shall not be purified on the third day, on the seventh day he shall not be clean. And that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of sprinkling hath not been sprinkled upon him.\"[fn-65-P6514_2105190:28-nf] And again: \"And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: thou shall sprinkle them with the water of purification.\"[fn-65-P6515_2105445:29-nf] And again: \"The water of sprinkling is a purification.\"[fn-65-P6516_2105523:30-nf] Whence it appears that the sprinkling also of water prevails equally with the washing of salvation; and that when this is done in the Church, where the faith both of receiver and giver is sound, all things hold and may be consummated and perfected by the majesty of the Lord and by the truth of faith.","title":"Epistle LXXV.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":36,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_09_homily_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"8. Let us beware therefore of saying anything about ourselves, for this renders us both odious with men and abominable to God. For this reason, the greater the good works we do, the less let us say of ourselves; this being the way to reap the greatest glory both with men and with God. Or rather, not only glory from God, but a reward, yea, a great recompense. Demand not therefore a reward that thou mayest receive a reward. Confess thyself to be saved by grace, that He may profess Himself a debtor to thee; and not for thy good works only, but also for such rightness of mind. For when we do good works, we have Him debtor for our good works only; but when we do not so much as think we have done any good work, then also for this disposition itself; and more for this, than for the other things: so that this is equivalent to our good works.

Now the species is not always overstepped, for things are often said of such a kind as evidently apply to it also, or perhaps even to it exclusively. But when Scripture, having up to a certain point been speaking about the species, makes a transition at that point from the species to the genus, the reader must then be carefully on his guard against seeking in the species what he can find much better and more surely in the genus. Take, for example, what the prophet Ezekiel says: \"When the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way, and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman. Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it: and I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way, and according to their doings, I judged them.\"[fn-52-P5243_2783897:78-nf] Now it is easy to understand that this applies to that house of Israel of which the apostle says, \"Behold Israel after the flesh;\"[fn-52-P5244_2784053:79-nf] because the people of Israel after the flesh did both perform and endure all that is here referred to. What immediately follows, too, may be understood as applying to the same people. But when the prophet begins to say, \"And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord,\"[fn-52-P5245_2784459:80-nf] the reader ought now carefully to observe the way in which the species is overstepped and the genus taken in. For he goes on to say: \"And I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put y Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my commandments, and do them. And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. I will also save you from all your uncleannesses.\"[fn-52-P5246_2785375:81-nf] Now that this is a prophecy of the New Testament, to which pertain not only the remnant of that one nation of which it is elsewhere said, \"For though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall be saved,\"[fn-52-P5247_2785653:82-nf] but also the other nations which were promised to their fathers and our fathers; and that there is here a promise of that washing of regeneration which, as we see, is now imparted to all nations, no one who looks into the matter can doubt. And that saying of the apostle, when he is commending the grace of the New Testament and its excellence in comparison with the Old, \"Ye are our epistle . . . written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart,\"[fn-52-P5248_2786189:83-nf] has an evident reference to this place where the prophet says, \"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.\"[fn-52-P5249_2786446:84-nf] Now the heart of flesh from which the apostle's expression, \"the fleshy tables of the heart,\" is drawn, the prophet intended to point out as distinguished from the stony heart by the possession of sentient life; and by sentient he understood intelligent life.

And God changed him, and converted his indignation into mildness.\"[fn-52-P5225_2048437:86-nf] Now what need is there to relate what follows, where the divine Scripture testifies that God fulfilled what she had asked for by working in the heart of the king nothing other than the will by which he commanded, and it was done as the queen had asked of him? And now God had heard her that it should be done, who changed the heart of the king by a most secret and efficacious power before he had heard the address of the woman beseeching him, and moulded it from indignation to mildness,-that is, from the will to hurt, to the will to favour,-according to that word of the apostle, \"God worketh in you to will also.\" Did the men of God who wrote these things-nay, did the Spirit of God Himself, under whose guidance such things were written by them-assail the free will of man? Away with the notion! But He has commended both the most righteous judgment and the most merciful aid of the Omnipotent in all cases. For it is enough for man to know that there is no unrighteousness with God. But how He dispenses those benefits, making some deservedly vessels of wrath, others graciously vessels of mercy,-who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counsellor? If, then, we attain to the honour of grace, let us not be ungrateful by attributing to ourselves what we have received. \"For what have we which we have not received?\"[fn-52-P5226_2049797:87-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":36,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_39_book_iv_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"For that very pride has so stopped the ears of their heart that they do not hear, \"For what hast thou that thou hast not received?\"[fn-56-P5647_2218162:39-nf] They do not hear, \"Without me ye can do nothing;\"[fn-56-P5648_2218231:40-nf] they do not hear, \"Love is of God;\"[fn-56-P5649_2218284:41-nf] they do not hear, \"God hath dealt the measure of faith;\"[fn-56-P5650_2218360:42-nf] they do not hear, \"The Spirit breatheth where it will,\"[fn-56-P5651_2218434:43-nf] and, \"They who are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God;\"[fn-56-P5652_2218524:44-nf] they do not hear, \"No one can come unto me, unless it were given him of my Father;\"[fn-56-P5653_2218628:45-nf] they do not hear what Esdras writes, \"Blessed is the Lord of our fathers, who hath put into the heart of the king to glorify His house which is in Jerusalem;\"[fn-56-P5654_2218805:46-nf] they do not hear what the Lord says by Jeremiah, \"And I will put my fear into their heart, that they depart not from me; and I will visit them to make them good;\"[fn-56-P5655_2218992:47-nf] and specially that word by Ezekiel the prophet, where God fully shows that He is induced by no good deservings of men to make them good, that is, obedient to His commands, but rather that He repays to them good for evil, by doing this for His own sake, and not for theirs.

Now why did He say \"It is I that do it, but for my holy name's sake,\" were it not that they should not think that it was owing to their own good merits that these things were happening, as the Pelagians hesitate not unblushingly to say? But there were not only no good merits of theirs, but the Lord shows that evil ones actually preceded; for He says, \"But for my holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen.\" Who can fail to observe how dreadful is the evil of profaning the Lord's own holy name? And yet, for the sake of this very name of mine, says He, which ye have profaned, I, even I, will make you good but not for your own sakes; and, as He adds \"I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them.\" He says that He sanctifies His name, which He had already declared to be holy.

There is, however, always within us a free will,-but it is not always good; for it is either free from righteousness when it serves sin,-and then it is evil,-or else it is free from sin when it serves righteousness,-and then it is good. But the grace of God is always I good; and by it it comes to pass that a man is of a good will, though he was before of an evil one. By it also it comes to pass that the very good will, which has now begun to be, is enlarged, and made so great that it is able to fulfil the divine commandments which it shall wish, when it shall once firmly and perfectly wish. This is the purport of what the Scripture says: \"If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments;\"[fn-61-P6141_2379283:166-nf] so that the man who wills but is not able knows that he does not yet fully will, and prays that he may have so great a will that it may suffice for keeping the commandments. And thus, indeed, he receives assistance to perform what he is commanded. Then is the will of use when we have ability; just as ability is also then of use when we have the will.

But God commands some things which we cannot do, in order that we may know what we ought to ask of Him. For this is faith itself, which obtains by prayer what the law commands. He, indeed, who said, \"If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments,\" did in the same book of Ecclesiasticus afterwards say, \"Who shall give a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips, that I fall not suddenly thereby, and that my tongue destroy me not.\"[fn-61-P6145_2380484:167-nf] Now he had certainly heard and received these commandments: \"Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.\"[fn-61-P6146_2380632:168-nf] Forasmuch, then, as what he said is true: \"If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments,\" why does he want a watch to be given before his mouth, like him who says in the Psalm, \"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth \"?[fn-61-P6147_2380874:169-nf] Why is he not satisfied with God's commandment and his own will; since, if he has the will, he shall keep the commandments How many of God's commandments are directed against pride!

Why, therefore, does he afterwards say, \"Turn away from me concupiscence\"?[fn-61-P6150_2381531:172-nf] Against luxury, too, how many commandments has God enjoined!

It is certain that it is we that will when we will, but it is He who makes us will what is good, of whom it is said (as he has just now expressed it), \"The will is prepared by the Lord.\"[fn-61-P6152_2382471:174-nf] Of the same Lord it is said, \"The steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and his way doth He will.\"[fn-61-P6153_2382595:175-nf] Of the same Lord again it is said, \"It is God who worketh inyou, even to will!\"[fn-61-P6154_2382698:176-nf] It is certain that it is we that act when we act; but it is He who makes us act, by applying efficacious powers to our will, who has said, \"I will make you to walk in my statutes, and to observe my judgments, and to do them.\"[fn-61-P6155_2382945:177-nf] When he says, \"I will make you . . . to do them,\" what else does He say in fact than, \"I will take away from you your heart of stone,\"[fn-61-P6156_2383104:178-nf] from which used to arise your inability to act, \"and I will give you a heart of flesh,\"[fn-61-P6157_2383228:179-nf] in order that you may act?

But God commands some things which we cannot do, in order that we may know what we ought to ask of Him. For this is faith itself, which obtains by prayer what the law commands. He, indeed, who said, \"If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments,\" did in the same book of Ecclesiasticus afterwards say, \"Who shall give a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips, that I fall not suddenly thereby, and that my tongue destroy me not.\"[fn-61-P6145_2380484:167-nf] Now he had certainly heard and received these commandments: \"Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.\"[fn-61-P6146_2380632:168-nf] Forasmuch, then, as what he said is true: \"If thou wilt, thou shalt keep the commandments,\" why does he want a watch to be given before his mouth, like him who says in the Psalm, \"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth \"?[fn-61-P6147_2380874:169-nf] Why is he not satisfied with God's commandment and his own will; since, if he has the will, he shall keep the commandments How many of God's commandments are directed against pride! He is quite aware of them; if he will, he may keep them. Why, therefore, does he shortly afterwards say, \"O God, Father and God of my life, give me not a proud look\"?[fn-61-P6148_2381243:170-nf] The law had long ago said to him, \"Thou shalt not covet;\"[fn-61-P6149_2381326:171-nf] let him then only will, and do what he is bidden, because, if he has the will, he shall keep the commandments. Why, therefore, does he afterwards say, \"Turn away from me concupiscence\"?[fn-61-P6150_2381531:172-nf] Against luxury, too, how many commandments has God enjoined! Let a man observe them; because, if he will, he may keep the commandments.

It is certain that it is we that will when we will, but it is He who makes us will what is good, of whom it is said (as he has just now expressed it), \"The will is prepared by the Lord.\"[fn-61-P6152_2382471:174-nf] Of the same Lord it is said, \"The steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and his way doth He will.\"[fn-61-P6153_2382595:175-nf] Of the same Lord again it is said, \"It is God who worketh inyou, even to will!\"[fn-61-P6154_2382698:176-nf] It is certain that it is we that act when we act; but it is He who makes us act, by applying efficacious powers to our will, who has said, \"I will make you to walk in my statutes, and to observe my judgments, and to do them.\"[fn-61-P6155_2382945:177-nf] When he says, \"I will make you . . . to do them,\" what else does He say in fact than, \"I will take away from you your heart of stone,\"[fn-61-P6156_2383104:178-nf] from which used to arise your inability to act, \"and I will give you a heart of flesh,\"[fn-61-P6157_2383228:179-nf] in order that you may act?

For He is asked to give what He commands. Believers ask that their faith may be increased;they ask on behalf of those who do not believe, that faith may be given tothem; therefore both in its increase and in its beginnings, faith is the gift of God. But it is said thus: \"If thou believest, thou shalt be saved,\" in the same way that it is said, \"If by the Spirit ye shall mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.\"[fn-68-P6805_2592994:85-nf] For in this case also, of these two things one is required, the other is offered. It is said, \"If by the Spirit ye shall mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live.\" Therefore, that we mortify the deeds of the flesh is required, but that we may live is offered. Is it, then, fitting for us to say, that to mortify the deeds of the flesh is not a gift of God, and not to confess it to be a gift of God, because we hear it required of us, with the offer of life as a reward if we shall do it? Away with this being approved by the partakers and champions of grace! This is the condemnable error of the Pelagians, whose mouths the apostle immediately stopped when he added,\" For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God;\"[fn-68-P6806_2593760:86-nf] lest we should believe that we mortify the deeds of the flesh, not by God's Spirit, but by our own.

As, therefore, although it is the gift of God to mortify the deeds of the flesh, yet it is required of us, and life is set before us as a reward; so also faith is the gift of God, although when it is said, \"If thou believest, thou shalt be saved,\" faith is required of us, and salvation is proposed to us as a reward. For these things are both commanded us, and are shown to be God's gifts, in order that we may understand both that we do them, and that God makes us to do them, as He most plainly says by the prophet Ezekiel. For what is plainer than when He says,\" I will cause you to do\"?[fn-68-P6808_2594750:88-nf] Give heed to that passage of Scripture, and you will see that God promises that He will make them to do those things which He commands to be done. He truly is not silent as to the merits but as to the evil deeds, of those to whom He shows that He is returning good for evil, by the very fact that He causeth them thenceforth to have good works, in causing them to do the divine commands.","title":"The First Book.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":36,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_43_the_first_book_","source_chapter":44,"source_paragraph":"131","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Therefore also it is in vain that objectors have alleged, that what we have proved by Scripture testimony from the books of Kings and Chronicles is not pertinent to the subject of which we are discoursing:[fn-69-P6917_2644284:137-nf] such, for instance, as that when God wills that to be done which ought only to be done by the wiling men, their hearts are inclined to will this,-inclined, that is to say, by His power, who, in a marvellous and ineffable manner, worketh in us also to will. What else is this than to say nothing, and yet to contradict? Unless perchance, they have given some reason to you for the view that they have taken, which reason you have preferred to say nothing about in your letters.

And so do they suppose that God inclines the wills of those whom He pleases to the attainment of earthly kingdoms, but does not incline them to the attainment of a heavenly kingdom?

Besides, it is ridiculous for you to imagine that the eyes of the proselytes are to be opened while your own are not, and that you be understood as blind and deaf while they are enlightened. And it will be still more ridiculous for you, if you say that the law has been given to the nations, but you have not known it. For you would have stood in awe of God's wrath, and would not have been lawless, wandering sons; being much afraid of hearing God always say, `Children in whom is no faith. And who are blind, but my servants? and deaf, but they that rule over them? And the servants of God have been made blind. You see often, but have not observed; your ears have been opened, and you have not heard.'[fn-50-P5083_1147741:478-nf] Is God's commendation of you honourable? and is God's testimony seemly for His servants? You are not ashamed though you often hear these words.

The people of the Hebrews, as we learn, after many sufferings, and after accomplishing their weary course in the desert, did not enter the land of promise until it had first been brought, with Joshua for its guide and the pilot of its life, to the passage of the Jordan[fn-41-P4181_2762977:25-nf] . But it is clear that Joshua also, who set up the twelve stones in the stream[fn-41-P4182_2763076:26-nf] , was anticipating the coming of the twelve disciples, the ministers of Baptism. Again, that marvellous sacrifice of the old Tishbite[fn-41-P4183_2763229:27-nf] , that passes all human understanding, what else does it do but prefigure in action the Faith in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and redemption? For when all the people of the Hebrews had trodden underfoot the religion of their fathers, and fallen into the error of polytheism, and their king Ahab was deluded by idolatry, with Jezebel, of ill-omened name, as the wicked partner of his life, and the vile prompter of his impiety, the prophet, filled with the grace of the Spirit, coming to a meeting with Ahab, withstood the priests of Baal in a marvellous and wondrous contest in the sight of the king and all the people; and by proposing to them the task of sacrificing the bullock without fire, he displayed them in a ridiculous and wretched plight, vainly praying and crying aloud to gods that were not. At last, himself invoking his own and the true God, he accomplished the test proposed with further exaggerations and additions. For he did not simply by prayer bring down the fire from heaven upon the wood when it was dry, but exhorted and enjoined the attendants to bring abundance of water. And when he had thrice poured out the barrels upon the cleft wood, he kindled at his prayer the fire from out of the water, that by the contrariety of the elements, so concurring in friendly cooperation, he might show with superabundant force the power of his own God. Now herein, I by that wondrous sacrifice, Elijah clearly proclaimed to us the sacramental rite of Baptism that should afterwards be instituted. For the fire was kindled by water thrice poured upon it, so that it is clearly shown that where the mystic water is, there is the kindling, warm, and fiery Spirit, that burns up the ungodly, and illuminates the faithful. Yes, and yet again his disciple Elisha, when Naaman the Syrian, who was diseased with leprosy, had come to him as a suppliant, cleanses the sick man by washing him in Jordan[fn-41-P4184_2765171:28-nf] , clearly indicating what should come, both by the use of water generally, and by the dipping in the river in particular. For Jordan alone of rivers, receiving in itself the first-fruits of sanctification and benediction, conveyed in its channel to the whole world, as it were from some fount in the type afforded by itself, the grace of Baptism. These then are indications in deed and act of regeneration by Baptism. Let us for the rest consider the prophecies of it in words and language. Isaiah cried saying, \"Wash you, make you clean, put away evil from your souls[fn-41-P4185_2765760:29-nf] ;\" and David, \"Draw nigh to Him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed[fn-41-P4186_2765871:30-nf] .\" And Ezekiel, writing more clearly and plainly than them both, says, \"And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I give you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh, and my Spirit will I put within you[fn-41-P4187_2766307:31-nf] .\" Most manifestly also does Zechariah prophesy of Joshua[fn-41-P4188_2766410:32-nf] , who was clothed with the filthy garment (to wit, the flesh of a servant, even ours), and stripping him of his ill-favoured raiment adorns him with the clean arid fair apparel; teaching us by the figurative illustration that verily in the Baptism of Jesus[fn-41-P4189_2766795:33-nf] all we, putting off our sins like some poor and patched garment, are clothed in the holy and most fair garment of regeneration. And where shall we place that oracle of Isaiah, which cries to the wilderness, \"Be glad, O thirsty wilderness: let the desert rejoice and blossom as a lily: and the desolate places of Jordan shall blossom and shall rejoice[fn-41-P4190_2767454:34-nf] \"? For it is clear that it is not to places without soul or sense that he proclaims the good tidings of joy: but he speaks, by the figure of the desert, of the soul that is parched and unadorned, even as David also, when he says, \"My soul is unto Thee as a thirsty land[fn-41-P4191_2767762:35-nf] ,\" and, \"My soul is athirst for the mighty, for the living God[fn-41-P4192_2767852:36-nf] .\" So again the Lord says in the Gospels, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink[fn-41-P4193_2767977:37-nf] ;\" and to the woman of Samaria, \"Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst[fn-41-P4194_2768162:38-nf] .\" And \"the excellency of Carmel\"[fn-41-P4195_2768229:39-nf] is given to the soul that bears the likeness to the desert, that is, the grace bestowed through the Spirit. For since Elijah dwelt in Carmel, and the mountain became famous and renowned by the virtue of him who dwelt there, and since moreover John the Baptist, illustrious in the spirit of Elijah, sanctified the Jordan, therefore the prophet foretold that \"the excellency of Carmel\" should be given to the river. And \"the glory of Lebanon[fn-41-P4196_2768687:40-nf] ,\" from the similitude of its lofty trees, he transfers to the river. For as great Lebanon presents a sufficient cause of wonder in the very trees which it brings forth and nourishes, so is the Jordan glorified by regenerating men and planting them in the Paradise of God: and of them, as the words of the Psalmist say, ever blooming and bearing the foliage of virtues, \"the leaf shall not wither[fn-41-P4197_2769099:41-nf] ,\" and God shall be glad, receiving their fruit in due season, rejoicing, like a good planter, in his own works. And the inspired David, foretelling also the voice which the Father uttered from heaven upon the Son at His Baptism, that He might lead the hearers, who till then had looked upon that low estate of His Humanity which was perceptible by their senses, to the dignity of nature that belongs to the Godhead, wrote in his book that passage, \"The voice of the Lord is upon the waters, the voice of the Lord in majesty[fn-41-P4198_2769663:42-nf] .\" But here we must make an end of the testimonies from the Divine Scriptures: for the discourse would extend to an infinite length if one should seek to select every passage in detail, and set them forth in a single book.","title":"On the Baptism of Christ","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":36,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_138_homily_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"6.

Say unto them, I live, saith the Lord: for I do not desire the death of the sinner; but I desire that the sinner should turn from his evil way, and live: therefore return ye from your evil way: why do ye give yourselves over to death, O house of Israel? \"[fn-106-P10646_3353614:31-nf] So, too, by Isaiah the prophet: \"I will not be angry with you for ever, nor will I abstain from defending you always.\"[fn-106-P10647_3353760:32-nf] And because Jeremiah the prophet, in the person of the sinful people, prays to the Lord, saying, \"Amend us, O Lord, but in judgment, and not in anger, lest Thou make us few; \"[fn-106-P10648_3353956:33-nf] Isaiah also added, and said, \"For his sin I have slightly afflicted him; and I have stricken him, and have turned away my face from him: and he was afflicted, and went away sadly in his ways.\"[fn-106-P10649_3354166:34-nf] And because he labours, he added and said, \"I have seen his ways, and I have healed him; and I have given him a true exhortation, peace upon peace; \"[fn-106-P10650_3354336:35-nf] that to those who repent, and pray, and labour, restoration is possible, because they would miserably perish, and because they would decline from Christ.","title":"A Treatise Against the Heretic Novatian by an Anonymous Bishop.","author":"Appendix"},{"chapter":36,"verse":25,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_94_epistle_lxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"ANF-05","text":"1.

When we were together in council, dearest brethren, we read your letter which you wrote to us concerning those who seem to be baptized by heretics and schismatics, (asking) whether, when the), come to the Catholic Church, which is one,[fn-62-P6203_1962431:4-nf] they ought to be baptized. On which matter, although you yourselves hold thereupon the truth and certainty of the Catholic rule, yet since you have thought that of our mutual love we ought to be consulted, we put forward our opinion, not as a new one,[fn-62-P6204_1962698:5-nf] but we join with you in equal agreement, in an opinion long since decreed by our predecessors, and observed by us,-judging, namely, and holding it for certain that no one can be baptized abroad outside the Church, since there is one baptism appointed in the holy Church. And it is written in the words of the Lord, \"They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out broken cisterns, which can hold no water.\"[fn-62-P6205_1963313:6-nf] And again, sacred Scripture warns, and says, \"Keep thee from the strange water, and drink not from a fountain of strange water.\"[fn-62-P6206_1963458:7-nf] It is required, then, that the water should first be cleansed and sanctified by the priest,[fn-62-P6207_1963574:8-nf] that it may wash away by its baptism the sins of the man who is baptized; because the Lord says by Ezekiel the prophet: \"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed from all your filthiness; and from all your idols will I cleanse you: a new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.\"[fn-62-P6208_1964101:9-nf] But how can he cleanse and sanctify the water who is himself unclean, and in whom the Holy Spirit is not? since the Lord says in the book of Numbers, \"And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean.\"[fn-62-P6209_1964339:10-nf] Or how can he who baptizes give to another remission of sins who himself, being outside the Church, cannot put away his own sins?","title":"Epistle LXIX.","author":"Cyprian"}]
