{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a provoking house:  who\nhave eyes to see, and see not:  and ears to hear, and hear not:  for they\nare a provoking house.","Thou, therefore, O son of man, prepare thee all necessaries for\nremoving, and remove by day into their sight:  and thou shalt remove out\nof thy place to another place in their sight, if so be they will regard\nit:  for they are a provoking house.","And thou shalt bring forth thy furniture as the furniture of one\nthat is removing by day in their sight:  and thou shalt go forth in the\nevening in their presence, as one goeth forth that removeth his\ndwelling.","Dig thee a way through the wall before their eyes:  and thou shalt\ngo forth through it.","In their sight thou shalt be carried out upon men's shoulders,\nthou shalt be carried out in the dark:  thou shalt cover thy face, and\nshalt not see the ground:  for I have set thee for a sign of things to\ncome to the house of Israel.","I did therefore as he had commanded me:  I brought forth my goods\nby day, as the goods of one that removeth:  and in the evening I digged\nthrough the wall with my hand, and I went forth in the dark, and was\ncarried on men's shoulders in their sight.","And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying:","Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the provoking house,\nsaid to thee:  What art thou doing?","Say to them:  Thus saith the Lord God:  This burden concerneth my\nprince that is in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel, that are\namong them.","Say:  I am a sign of things to come to you:  as I have done, so\nshall it be done to them:  they shall be removed from their dwellings,\nand go into captivity.","And the prince that is in the midst of them, shall be carried on\nshoulders, he shall go forth in the dark:  they shall dig through the\nwall to bring him out:  his face shall be covered, that he may not see\nthe ground with his eyes.","And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my\nnet:  and I will bring him into Babylon, into the land of the Chaldeans,\nand he shall not see it, and there he shall die.","And all that are about him, his guards, and his troops I will\nscatter into every wind:  and I will draw out the sword after them.","And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have\ndispersed them among the nations, and scattered them in the countries.","And I will leave a few men of them from the sword, and from the\nfamine, and from the pestilence:  that they may declare all their wicked\ndeeds among the nations whither they shall go:  and they shall know that\nI am the Lord.","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, eat thy bread in trouble and drink thy water in\nhurry and sorrow.","And say to the people of the land:  Thus saith the Lord God to\nthem that dwell in Jerusalem in the land of Israel:  They shall eat\ntheir bread in care, and drink their water in desolation:  that the land\nmay become desolate from the multitude that is therein, for the\niniquity of all that dwell therein.","And the cities that are now inhabited shall be laid waste, and\nthe land shall be desolate:  and you shall know that I am the Lord.","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of\nIsrael?  saying:  The days shall be prolonged, and every vision shall\nfail.","Say to them therefore:  Thus saith the Lord God:  I will make this\nproverb to cease, neither shall it be any more a common saying in\nIsrael:  and tell them that the days are at hand, and the effect of\nevery vision.","For there shall be no more any vain visions, nor doubtful\ndivination in the midst of the children of Israel.","For I the Lord will speak:  and what word soever I shall speak,\nit shall come to pass, and shall not be prolonged any more:  but in your\ndays, ye provoking house, I will speak the word, and will do it, saith\nthe Lord God.","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, behold the house of Israel, they that say:  The\nvisions that this man seeth, is for many days to come:  and this man\nprophesieth of times afar off.","Therefore say to them:  Thus saith the Lord God:  not one word of\nmine shall be prolonged any more:  the word that I shall speak shall be\naccomplished, saith the Lord God."]}
