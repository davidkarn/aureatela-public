{"verses":["In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning\nof the year, the tenth day of the month, the fourteenth year after the\ncity was destroyed:  in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord was upon\nme, and he brought me thither.","In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and\nset me upon a very high mountain:  upon which there was as the building\nof a city, bending towards the south.","And he brought me in thither, and behold a man, whose appearance\nwas like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and\na measuring reed in his hand, and he stood in the gate.","And this man said to me:  Son of man, see with thy eyes, and hear\nwith thy ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall shew thee:  for\nthou art brought hither that they may be shewn to thee:  declare all\nthat thou seest, to the house of Israel.","And behold there was a wall on the outside of the house round\nabout, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits and a\nhandbreadth:  and he measured the breadth of the building one reed, and\nthe height one reed.","And he came to the gate that looked toward the east, and he went\nup the steps thereof:  and he measured the breadth of the threshold of\nthe gate one reed, that is, one threshold was one reed broad;","And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad:\nand between the little chambers were five cubits:","And the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within,\nwas one reed.","And he measured the porch of the gate eight cubits, and the front\nthereof two cubits:  and the porch of the gate was inward.","And the little chambers of the gate that looked eastward were\nthree on this side, and three on that side:  all three were of one\nmeasure, and the fronts of one measure, on both parts.","And he measured the breadth of the threshold of the gate ten\ncubits:  and the length of the gate thirteen cubits:","And the border before the little chambers one cubit:  and one\ncubit was the border on both sides:  and the little chambers were six\ncubits on this side and that side.","And he measured the gate from the roof of one little chamber to\nthe roof of another, in breadth five and twenty cubits:  door against\ndoor.","He made also fronts of sixty cubits:  and to the front the court\nof the gate on every side round about.","And before the face of the gate which reached even to the face\nof the porch of the inner gate, fifty cubits.","And slanting windows in the little chambers, and in their\nfronts, which were within the gate on every side round about:  and in\nlike manner there were also in the porches windows round about within,\nand before the fronts the representation of palm trees.","And he brought me into the outward court, and behold there were\nchambers, and a pavement of stone in the court round about:  thirty\nchambers encompassed the pavement.","And the pavement in the front of the gates according to the\nlength of the gates was lower.","And he measured the breadth from the face of the lower gate to\nthe front of the inner court without, a hundred cubits to the east, and\nto the north.","He measured also both the length and the breadth of the gate of\nthe outward court, which looked northward.","And the little chambers thereof three on this side, and three on\nthat side:  and the front thereof, and the porch thereof according to\nthe measure of the former gate, fifty cubits long, and five and twenty\ncubits broad.","And the windows thereof, and the porch, and the gravings\naccording to the measure of the gate that looked to the east, and they\nwent up to it by seven steps, and a porch was before it.","And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate of the\nnorth, and that of the east:  and he measured from gate to gate a\nhundred cubits.","And he brought me out to the way of the south, and behold the\ngate that looked to the south:  and he measured the front thereof, and\nthe porch thereof according to the former measures.","And the windows thereof, and the porches round about, as the\nother windows:  the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and\ntwenty cubits.","And there were seven steps to go up to it:  and a porch before\nthe doors thereof:  and there were graven palm trees, one on this side,\nand another on that side in the front thereof.","And there was a gate of the inner court towards the south:  and\nhe measured from gate to gate towards the south, a hundred cubits.","And he brought me into the inner court at the south gate:  and he\nmeasured the gate according to the former measures.","The little chamber thereof, and the front thereof, and the porch\nthereof with the same measures:  and the windows thereof, and the porch\nthereof round about it was fifty cubits in length, and five and twenty\ncubits in breadth.","And the porch round about was five and twenty cubits long, and\nfive cubits broad.","And the porch thereof to the outward court, and the palm trees\nthereof in the front:  and there were eight steps to go up to it.","And he brought me into the inner court by the way of the east:\nand he measured the gate according to the former measures.","The little chamber thereof, and the front thereof, and the porch\nthereof as before:  and the windows thereof, and the porches thereof\nround about it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.","And the porch thereof, that is, of the outward court:  and the\ngraven palm trees in the front thereof on this side and on that side:\nand the going up thereof was by

porch\nthereof, and the windows thereof round about it was fifty cubits long,\nand five and twenty cubits broad.","And the porch thereof looked to the outward court:  and the\ngraving of palm trees in the front thereof was on this side and on that\nside:  and the going up to it was by eight steps.","And at every chamber was a door in the forefronts of the gates:\nthere they washed the holocaust.","And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and\ntwo tables on that side:  that the holocaust, and the sin offering, and\nthe trespass offering might be slain thereon.","And on the outward side, which goeth up to the entry of the gate\nthat looketh toward the north, were two tables:  and at the other side\nbefore the porch of the gate were two tables,","Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side at\nthe sides of the gate were eight tables, upon which they slew the\nvictims.","And the four tables for the holocausts were made of square\nstones:  one cubit and a half long, and one cubit and a half broad, and\none cubit high:  to lay the vessels upon, in which the holocaust and the\nvictim is slain.","And the borders of them were of one handbreadth, turned inwards\nround about:  and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.","And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singing men\nin the inner court, which was on the side of the gate that looketh to\nthe north:  and their prospect was towards the south, one at the side of\nthe east gate, which looketh toward the north.","And he said to me:  This chamber, which looketh toward the south\nshall be for the priests that watch in the wards of the temple.","But the chamber that looketh towards the north shall be for the\npriests that watch over the ministry of the altar.  These are the sons\nof Sadoc, who among the sons of Levi, come near to the Lord, to\nminister to him.","And he measured the court a hundred cubits long, and a hundred\ncubits broad foursquare:  and the altar that was before the face of the\ntemple.","And he brought me into the porch of the temple:  and he measured\nthe porch five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side:  and\nthe breadth of the gate three cubits on this side, and three cubits on\nthat side.","And the length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth\neleven cubits, and there were eight steps to go up to it.
