The medical men called surgeons pass for being cruel, but really deserve pity. For is it not pitiful to cut away the dead flesh of another man with merciless knives without being moved by his pangs? Is it not pitiful that the man who is curing the patient is callous to his sufferings, and has to appear as his enemy? Yet such is the order of nature. While truth is always bitter, pleasantness waits upon evil-doing. Isaiah goes naked without blushing as a type of captivity to come.[fn-12-P1271_279060:857-nf] Jeremiah is sent from Jerusalem to the Euphrates (a river in Mesopotamia), and leaves his girdle to be marred in the Chaldaean camp, among the Assyrians hostile to his people.[fn-12-P1272_279255:858-nf] Ezekiel is told to eat bread made of mingled seeds and sprinkled with the dung of men and cattle.[fn-12-P1273_279388:859-nf] He has to see his wife die without shedding a tear.[fn-12-P1274_279463:860-nf] Amos is driven from Samaria.[fn-12-P1275_279518:861-nf] Why is he driven from it? Surely in this case as in the others, because he was a spiritual surgeon, who cut away the parts diseased by sin and urged men to repentance. The apostle Paul says: \"Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?\"[fn-12-P1276_279809:862-nf] And so the Saviour Himself found it, from whom many of the disciples went back because His sayings seemed hard.[fn-12-P1277_279941:863-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_43_homily_xxxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And if the similitudes be mean, and of an ill sound, marvel not, for He was discoursing with a view to the weakness of His hearers.

And the first after the flesh was in humiliation, because He was manifested in lowly estate. So then His second advent is declared to be in glory; for He comes from heaven with power, and angels, and the glory of His Father. His first advent had John the Baptist as its forerun-her; and His second, in which He is to come in glory, will exhibit Enoch, and Elias, and John the Divine.[fn-42-P4216_1297059:66-nf] Behold, too, the Lord's kindness to man; how even in the last times He shows His care for mortals, and pities them. For He will not leave us even then without prophets, but will send them to us for our instruction and assurance, and to make us give heed to the advent of the adversary, as He intimated also of old in this Daniel. For he says, \"I shall make a covenant of one week, and in the midst of the week my sacrifice and libation will be removed.\" For by one week he indicates the showing forth of the seven years which shall be in the last times.[fn-42-P4217_1298358:67-nf] And the half of the week the two prophets, along with John, will take for the purpose of proclaiming to all the world the advent of Antichrist, that is to say, for a \"thousand two hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth; \"[fn-42-P4218_1298706:68-nf] and they will work signs and wonders with the object of making men ashamed and repentant, even by these means, on account of their surpassing lawlessness and impiety. \"And if any man will hurt them, fire will proceed out of their mouth, and devour their enemies. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of the advent of Antichrist, and to turn waters into blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will.\"[fn-42-P4219_1299172:69-nf] And when they have proclaimed all these things they will fall on the sword, cut off by the accuser[fn-42-P4220_1299327:70-nf] . And they will fulfil their testimony, as Daniel also says; for he foresaw that the beast that came up out of the abyss would make war with them, namely with Enoch, Elias, and John, and would overcome them, and kill them, because of their refusal to give glory to the accuser. that is the little horn that sprang up.[fn-42-P4221_1299694:71-nf] And he, being lifted up in heart, begins in the end to, exalt himself and glorify himself as God, persecuting the saints and blaspheming Christ.","title":"Appendix to the Works of Hippolytus.","author":"Hippolytus"}]
