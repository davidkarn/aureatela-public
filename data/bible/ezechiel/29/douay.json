{"verses":["In the tenth year, the tenth month, the eleventh day of the\nmonth, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, set thy face against Pharao king of Egypt:  and thou\nshalt prophesy of him, and of all Egypt:","Speak, and say:  Thus saith the Lord God:  Behold, I come against\nthee, Pharao king of Egypt, thou great dragon that liest in the midst\nof thy rivers, and sayest:  The river is mine, and I made myself.","But I will put a bridle in thy jaws:  and I will cause the fish of\nthy rivers to stick to thy scales:  and I will draw thee out of the\nmidst of thy rivers, and all thy fish shall stick to thy scales.","And I will cast thee forth into the desert, and all the fish of\nthy river:  thou shalt fall upon the face of the earth, thou shalt not\nbe taken up, nor gathered together:  I have given thee for meat to the\nbeasts of the earth, and to the fowls of the air.","And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord:\nbecause thou hast been a staff of a reed to the house of Israel.","When they took hold of thee with the hand thou didst break, and\nrent all their shoulder:  and when they leaned upon thee, thou brokest,\nand weakenest all their loins.","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Behold, I will bring the sword\nupon thee:  and cut off man and beast out of thee.","And the land of Egypt shall become a desert, and a wilderness:\nand they shall know that I am the Lord, because thou hast said:  The\nriver is mine, and I made it.","Therefore, behold I come against thee, and thy rivers:  and I\nwill make the land of Egypt utterly desolate, and wasted by the sword,\nfrom the tower of Syene, even to the borders of Ethiopia.","The foot of man shall not pass through it, neither shall the\nfoot of beasts go through it:  nor shall it be inhabited during forty\nyears.","And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the\nlands that are desolate, and the cities thereof in the midst of the\ncites that are destroyed, and they shall be desolate for forty years:\nand I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse\nthem through the countries.","For thus saith the Lord God:  At the end of forty years I will\ngather the Egyptians from the people among whom they had been\nscattered.","And I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will place\nthem in the land of Phatures, in the land of their nativity, and they\nshall be there a low kingdom:","It shall be the lowest among other kingdoms, and it shall no\nmore be exalted over the nations, and I will diminish them that they\nshall rule no more over the nations.","And they shall be no more a confidence to the house of Israel,\nteaching iniquity, that they may flee, and follow them:  and they shall\nknow that I am the Lord God.","And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the first\nmonth, in the first of the month:  that the word of the Lord came to me,\nsaying:","Son of man, Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath made his army to\nundergo hard service against Tyre:  every head was made bald, and every\nshoulder was peeled and there hath been no reward given him, nor his\narmy for Tyre, for the service that he rendered me against it.","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Behold, I will set\nNabuchodonosor the king of Babylon in the land of Egypt:  and he shall\ntake her multitude, and take the booty thereof for a prey, and rifle\nthe spoils thereof:  and it shall be wages for his army.","And for the service that he hath done me against it:  I have\ngiven him the land of Egypt, because he hath laboured for me, saith the\nLord God.","In that day a horn shall bud forth to the house of Israel, and I\nwill give thee an open mouth in the midst of them:  and they shall know\nthat I am the Lord."]}
