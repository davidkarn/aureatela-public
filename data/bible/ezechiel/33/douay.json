{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say to them:\nWhen I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a\nman, one of their meanest, and make him a watchman over them:","And he sees the sword coming upon the land, and sound the\ntrumpet, and tell the people:","Then he that heareth the sound of the trumpet, whosoever he be,\nand doth not look to himself, if the sword come, and cut him off:  his\nblood shall be upon his own head.","He heard the sound of the trumpet, and did not look to himself,\nhis blood shall be upon him:  but if he look to himself, he shall save\nhis life.","And if the watchman see the sword coming, and sound not the\ntrumpet:  and the people look not to themselves, and the sword come, and\ncut off a soul from among them:  he indeed is taken away in his\niniquity, but I will require his blood at the hand of the watchman.","So thou, O son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house\nof Israel:  therefore thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and shalt\ntell it them from me.","When I say to the wicked:  O wicked man, thou shalt surely die:  if\nthou dost not speak to warn the wicked man from his way:  that wicked\nman shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy\nhand.","But if thou tell the wicked man, that he may be converted from\nhis ways, and he be not converted from his way he shall die in his\niniquity:  but thou hast delivered thy soul.","Thou therefore, O son of man, say to the house of Israel:  Thus\nyou have spoken, saying:  Our iniquities, and our sins are upon us, and\nwe pine away in them:  how then can we live?","Say to them:  As I live, saith the Lord God, I desire not the\ndeath of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live.\nTurn ye, turn ye from your evil ways:  and why will you die, O house of\nIsrael?","Thou therefore, O son of man, say to the children of thy people:\nThe justice of the just shall not deliver him, in what day soever he\nshall sin:  and the wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him, in what\nday soever he shall turn from his wickedness:  and the just shall not be\nable to live in his justice, in what day soever he shall sin.","Yea, if I shall say to the just that he shall surely live, and\nhe, trusting in his justice, commit iniquity:  all his justices shall be\nforgotten, and his iniquity, which he hath committed, in the same shall\nhe die.","And it I shall say to the wicked:  Thou shalt surely die:  and he\ndo penance for his sin, and do judgment and justice,","And if that wicked man restore the pledge, and render what he\nhad robbed, and walk in the commandments of life, and do no unjust\nthing:  he shall surely live, and shall not die.","None of his sins, which he hath committed, shall be imputed to\nhim:  he hath done judgment and justice, he shall surely live.","And the children of thy people have said:  The way of the Lord is\nnot equitable:  whereas their own way is unjust.","For when the just shall depart from his justice, and commit\niniquities, he shall die in them.","And when the wicked shall depart from his wickedness, and shall\ndo judgments, and justice, he shall live in them.","And you say:  The way of the Lord is not right, I will judge\nevery one of you according to his ways, O house of Israel.","And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the\ntenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that there came to me one\nthat was fled from Jerusalem, saying:  The city is laid waste.","And the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening, before\nhe that was fled came:  and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the\nmorning, and my mouth being opened, I was silent no more.","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, they that dwell in these ruinous places in the land\nof Israel, speak, saying:  Abraham was one, and he inherited the land,\nbut we are many, the land is given us in possession.","Therefore say to them:  Thus saith the Lord God:  You that eat\nwith the blood and lift up your eyes to your uncleannesses, and that\nshed blood:  shall you possess the land by inheritance?","You stood on your swords, you have committed abominations, and\nevery one hath defiled his neighbours wife; and shall you possess the\nland by inheritance?","Say thou thus to them:  Thus saith the Lord God:  As I live, they\nthat dwell in the ruinous places, shall fall by the sword:  and he that\nis in the field, shall be given to the beasts to be devoured:  and they\nthat are in holds, and caves, shall die of the pestilence.","And I will make the land a wilderness, and a desert, and the\nproud strength thereof shall fail, and the mountains of Israel shall be\ndesolate, because there is none to pass by them,","And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have made\ntheir land waste and desolate, for all their abominations which they\nhave committed.","And thou son of man:  the children of thy people, that talk of\nthee by the walls, and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to\nanother each man to his neighbour, saying:  Come, and let us hear what\nis the word that cometh forth from the Lord.","And they come to thee, as if people were coming in, and my\npeople sit before thee:  and hear thy words, and do them not:  for they\nturn them into a song of their mouth, and their heart goeth after their\ncovetousness.","And thou art to them as a musical song which is sung with a\nsweet and agreeable voice:  and they hear thy words, and do them not.","And when that which was foretold shall come to pass, for behold\nit is coming, then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them."]}
