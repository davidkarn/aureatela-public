{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house\nof Israel,","And say:  Thus saith the Lord God; A large eagle with great wings,\nlong-limbed, full of feathers, and of variety, came to Libanus, and\ntook away the marrow of the cedar.","He cropped off the top of the twigs thereof:  and carried it away\ninto the land of Chanaan, and he set it in a city of merchants.","And he took of the seed of the land, and put it in the ground for\nseed, that it might take a firm root over many waters:  he planted it on\nthe surface of the earth.","And it sprung up and grew into a spreading vine of low stature,\nand the branches thereof looked towards him:  and the roots thereof were\nunder him.  So it became a vine, and grew into branches, and shot forth\nsprigs.","And there was another large eagle, with great wings, and many\nfeathers:  and behold this vine, bending as it were her roots towards\nhim, stretched forth her branches to him, that he might water it by the\nfurrows of her plantation.","It was planted in a good ground upon many waters, that it might\nbring forth branches, and bear fruit, that it might become a large\nvine.","Say thou:  Thus saith the Lord God:  Shall it prosper then?  shall\nhe not pull up the roots thereof, and strip off its fruit, and dry up\nall the branches it hath shot forth, and make it wither:  and this\nwithout a strong arm, or many people to pluck it up by the root?","Behold, it is planted:  shall it prosper then?  shall it not be\ndried up when the burning wind shall touch it, and shall it not wither\nin the furrows where it grew?","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Say to the provoking house:  Know you not what these things mean?\nTell them:  Behold the king of Babylon cometh to Jerusalem:  and he shall\ntake away the king and the princes thereof and carry them with him to\nBabylon.","And he shall take one of the king's seed, and make a covenant\nwith him, and take an oath of him.  Yea, and he shall take away the\nmighty men of the land,","That it may be a low kingdom and not lift itself up, but keep\nhis covenant and observe it.","But he hath revolted from him and sent ambassadors to Egypt,\nthat it might give him horses, and much people.  And shall he that hath\ndone thus prosper, or be saved?  and shall he escape that hath broken\nthe covenant?","As I live, saith the Lord God:  In the place where the king\ndwelleth that made him king, whose oath he hath made void, and whose\ncovenant he broke, even in the midst of Babylon shall he die.","And not with a great army, nor with much people shall Pharao\nfight against him:  when he shall cast up mounts, and build forts, to\ncut off many souls.","For he had despised the oath, breaking his covenant, and behold\nhe hath given his hand:  and having done all these things, he shall not\nescape.","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  As I live, I will lay upon\nhis head the oath he hath despised, and the covenant he hath broken.","And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my\nnet:  and I will bring him into Babylon, and will judge him there for\nthe transgression by which he hath despised me.","And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the\nsword:  and the residue shall be scattered into every wind:  and you\nshall know that I the Lord have spoken.","Thus saith the Lord God:  I myself will take of the marrow of the\nhigh cedar, and will set it:  I will crop off a tender twig from the top\nof the branches thereof, and I will plant it on a mountain high and\neminent.","On the high mountains of Israel will I plant it, and it shall\nshoot forth into branches and shall bear fruit, and it shall become a\ngreat cedar:  and all birds shall dwell under it, and every fowl shall\nmake its nest under the shadow of the branches thereof.","And all the trees of the country shall know that I the Lord have\nbrought down the high tree, and exalted the low tree:  and have dried up\nthe green tree, and have caused the dry tree to flourish.  I the Lord\nhave spoken and have done it."]}
