{"verses":["And some of the ancients of Israel came to me, and sat before me.","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, these men have placed their uncleannesses in their\nhearts, and have set up before their face the stumblingblock of their\niniquity:  and shall I answer when they inquire of me?","Therefore speak to them, and say to them:  Thus saith the Lord\nGod:  Man, man of the house of Israel that shall place his uncleannesses\nin his heart, and set up the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his\nface, and shall come to the prophet inquiring of me by him:  I the Lord\nwill answer him according to the multitude of his uncleannesses:","That the house of Israel may be caught in their own heart, with\nwhich they have departed from me through all their idols.","Therefore say to the house of Israel:  Thus saith the Lord God:  Be\nconverted, and depart from your idols, and turn away your faces from\nall your abominations.","For every man of the house of Israel, and every stranger among\nthe proselytes in Israel, if he separate himself from me, and place his\nidols in his heart, and set the stumblingblock of his iniquity before\nhis face, and come to the prophet to inquire of me by him:  I the Lord\nwill answer him by myself.","And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an\nexample, and a proverb, and will cut him off from the midst of my\npeople:  and you shall know that I am the Lord.","And when the prophet shall err, and speak a word:  I the Lord have\ndeceived that prophet:  and I will stretch forth my hand upon him, and\nwill cut him off from the midst of my people Israel.","And they shall bear their iniquity:  according to the iniquity of\nhim that inquireth, so shall the iniquity of the prophet be.","That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, nor be\npolluted with all their transgressions:  but may be my people, and I may\nbe their God, saith the Lord of hosts.","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, when a land shall sin against me, so as to\ntransgress grievously, I will stretch forth my hand upon it, and will\nbreak the staff of the bread thereof:  and I will send famine upon it,\nand will destroy man and beast out of it.","And if these three men, Noe, Daniel, and Job, shall be in it:\nthey shall deliver their own souls by their justice, saith the Lord of\nhosts.","And if I shall bring mischievous beasts also upon the land to\nwaste it, and it be desolate, so that there is none that can pass\nbecause of the beasts:","If these three men shall be in it, as I live, saith the Lord,\nthey shall deliver neither sons nor daughters:  but they only shall be\ndelivered, and the land shall be made desolate.","Or if I bring the sword upon that land, and say to the sword:\nPass through the land:  and I destroy man and beast out of it:","And these three men be in the midst thereof:  as I live, saith\nthe Lord God, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they\nthemselves alone shall be delivered.","Or if I also send the pestilence upon that land, and pour out my\nindignation upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:","And Noe, and Daniel, and Job be in the midst thereof:  as I live,\nsaith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter:  but\nthey shall only deliver their own souls by their justice.","For thus saith the Lord:  Although I shall send in upon Jerusalem\nmy four grievous judgments, the sword, and the famine, and the\nmischievous beasts, and the pestilence, to destroy out of it man and\nbeast,","Yet there shall be left in it some that shall be saved, who\nshall bring away their sons and daughters:  behold they shall come among\nyou, and you shall see their way, and their doings:  and you shall be\ncomforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, in\nall things that I have brought upon it.","And they shall comfort you, when you shall see their ways, and\ntheir doings:  and you shall know that I have not done without cause all\nthat I have done in it, saith the Lord God."]}
