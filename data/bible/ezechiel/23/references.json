He evidently wished to shew them that he was not so much anxious that they should take husbands as that they should avoid paramours. These things, dearest daughter in Christ, I impress upon you and frequently repeat, that you may forget those things which are behind and reach forth unto those things which are before.[fn-34-P3406_894046:2474-nf] You have widows like yourself worthy to be your models, Judith renowned in Hebrew story and Anna the daughter of Phanuel famous in the gospel.

Just as in a plague, men of the most regular lives suffer from the same sickness as the rest, because they catch the disease by communication with the infected, so nowadays by the evil rivalry which possesses our souls we are carried away to an emulation in wickedness, and are all of us each as bad as the others. Hence merciless and sour sit the judges of the erring; unfeeling and hostile are the critics of the well disposed. And to such a depth is this evil rooted among us that we have become more brutish than the brutes; they do at least herd with their fellows, but our most savage warfare is with our own people.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":23,"verse":40,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_13_book_iv_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"127","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"A boy who had forsworn his sex and would pass for a girl, with eyes, as it is written, smeared with antimony,[fn-20-P2090_658805:73-nf] and face reddened with rouge like their idols, in woman's dress, was set up to dance and wave his hands about and whirl round as though he had been at the front of some disreputable stage, on the holy altar itself where we call on the coming of the Holy Ghost, while the by-standers laughed aloud and rudely raised unseemly shouts.
