{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother.","And they committed fornication in Egypt, in their youth they\ncommitted fornication:  there were their breasts pressed down, and the\nteats of their virginity were bruised.","And their names were Oolla the elder, and Ooliba her younger\nsister:  and I took them, and they bore sons and daughters.  Now for\ntheir names, Samaria is Oolla, and Jerusalem is Ooliba.","And Oolla committed fornication against me, and doted on her\nlovers, on the Assyrians that came to her,","Who were clothed with blue, princes, and rulers, beautiful\nyouths, all horsemen, mounted upon horses.","And she committed her fornications with those chosen men, all\nsons of the Assyrians:  and she defiled herself with the uncleanness of\nall them on whom she doted.","Moreover also she did not forsake her fornications which she had\ncommitted in Egypt:  for they also lay with her in her youth, and they\nbruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured out their fornication\nupon her.","Therefore have I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into\nthe hands of the sons of the Assyrians, upon whose lust she doted.","They discovered her disgrace, took away her sons and daughters,\nand slew her with the sword:  and they became infamous women, and they\nexecuted judgments in her.","And when her sister Ooliba saw this, she was mad with lust more\nthan she:  and she carried her fornication beyond the fornication of her\nsister.","Impudently prostituting herself to the children of the\nAssyrians, the princes, and rulers that came to her, clothed with\ndivers colours, to the horsemen that rode upon horses, and to young men\nall of great beauty.","And I saw that she was defiled, and that they both took one way.","And she increased her fornications:  and when she had seen men\npainted on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans set forth in colours,","And girded with girdles about their reins, and with dyed turbans\non their heads, the resemblance of all the captains, the likeness of\nthe sons of Babylon, and of the land of the Chaldeans wherein they were\nborn,","She doted upon them with the lust of her eyes, and she sent\nmessengers to them into Chaldea.","And when the sons of Babylon were come to her to the bed of\nlove, they defiled her with their fornications, and she was polluted by\nthem, and her soul was glutted with them.","And she discovered her fornications, and discovered her\ndisgrace:  and my soul was alienated from her, as my soul was alienated\nfrom her sister.","For she multiplied her fornications, remembering the days of her\nyouth, in which she played the harlot in the land of Egypt.","And she was mad with lust after lying with them whose flesh is\nas the flesh of asses:  and whose issue as the issue of horses.","And thou hast renewed the wickedness of thy youth, when thy\nbreasts were pressed in Egypt, and the paps of thy virginity broken.","Therefore, Ooliba, thus saith the Lord God:  Behold I will raise\nup against thee all thy lovers with whom thy soul hath been glutted:\nand I will gather them together against thee round about.","The children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, the nobles, and\nthe kings, and princes, all the sons of the Assyrians, beautiful young\nmen, all the captains, and rulers, the princes of princes, and the\nrenowned horsemen.","And they shall come upon thee well appointed with chariot and\nwheel, a multitude of people:  they shall be armed against thee on every\nside with breastplate, and buckler, and helmet:  and I will set judgment\nbefore them, and they shall judge thee by their judgments.","And I will set my jealousy against thee, which they shall\nexecute upon thee with fury:  they shall cut off thy nose and thy ears:\nand what remains shall fall by the sword:  they shall take thy sons, and\nthy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by fire.","And they shall strip thee of thy garments, and take away the\ninstruments of thy glory.","And I will put an end to thy wickedness in thee, and thy\nfornication brought out of the land of Egypt:  neither shalt thou lift\nup thy eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.","For thus saith the Lord God:  Behold, I will deliver thee into\nthe hands of them whom thou hatest, into their hands with whom thy soul\nhath been glutted.","And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and they shall take\naway all thy labours, and shall let thee go naked, and full of\ndisgrace, and the disgrace of thy fornication shall be discovered, thy\nwickedness, and thy fornications.","They have done these things to thee, because thou hast played\nthe harlot with the nations among which thou wast defiled with their\nidols.","Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister and I will give her\ncup into thy hand.","Thus saith the Lord God:  Thou shalt drink thy sister's cup, deep\nand wide:  thou shalt be had in derision and scorn, which containeth\nvery much.","Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness, and sorrow:  with the cup\nof grief and sadness, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.","And thou shalt drink it, and shalt drink it up even to the\ndregs, and thou shalt devour the fragments thereof, thou shalt rend thy\nbreasts:  because I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Because thou hast forgotten\nme, and hast cast me off behind thy back, bear thou also thy\nwickedness, and thy fornications.","And the Lord spoke to me, saying:  Son of man, dost thou judge\nOolla, and Ooliba, and dost thou declare to them their wicked deeds?","Because they have committed adultery, and blood is in their\nhands, and they have committed fornication with their idols:  moreover\nalso their children, whom they bore to me, they have offered to them to\nbe devoured.","Yea, and they have done this to me.  They polluted my sanctuary\non the same day, and profaned my sabbaths.","And when they sacrificed their children to their idols, and went\ninto my sanctuary the same day to profane it:  they did these things\neven in the midst of my house.","They sent for men coming from afar, to whom they had sent a\nmessenger:  and behold they came:  for whom thou didst wash thyself, and\ndidst paint thy eyes, and wast adorned with women's ornaments.","Thou sattest on a very fine bed, and a table was decked before\nthee:  whereupon thou didst set my incense, and my ointment.","And there was in her the voice of a multitude rejoicing:  and to\nsome that were brought of the multitude of men, and that came from the\ndesert, they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on\ntheir heads.","And I said to her that was worn out in her adulteries:  Now will\nthis woman still continue in her fornication.","And they went in to her, as to a harlot:  so went they in unto\nOolla, and Ooliba, wicked women.","They therefore are just men:  these shall judge them as\nadulteresses are judged, and as shedders of blood are judged:  because\nthey are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.","For thus saith the Lord God:  Bring a multitude upon them, and\ndeliver them over to tumult and rapine:","And let the people stone them with stone, and let them be\nstabbed with their swords:  they shall kill their sons and daughters,\nand their houses they shall burn with fire.","And I will take away wickedness out of the land:  and all women\nshall learn, not to do according to the wickedness of them.","And they shall render your wickedness upon you, and you shall\nbear the sins of your idols:  and you shall know that I am the Lord God."]}
