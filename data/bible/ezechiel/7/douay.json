{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","And thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God to the land of\nIsrael:  The end is come, the end is come upon the four quarters of the\nland.","Now is an end come upon thee, and I will send my wrath upon thee,\nand I will judge thee according to thy ways:  and I will set all thy\nabominations against thee.","And my eye shall not spare thee, and I will shew thee no pity:  but\nI will lay thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the\nmidst of thee:  and you shall know that I am the Lord.","Thus saith the Lord God:  One affliction, behold an affliction is\ncome.","An end is come, the end is come, it hath awaked against thee:\nbehold it is come.","Destruction is come upon thee that dwellest in the land:  the time\nis come, the day of slaughter is near, and not of the joy of mountains.","Now very shortly I will pour out my wrath upon thee, and I will\naccomplish my anger in thee:  and I will judge thee according to thy\nways, and I will lay upon thee all thy crimes.","And my eye shall not spare, neither will I shew mercy:  but I will\nlay thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of\nthee:  and you shall know that I am the Lord that strike.","Behold the day, behold it is come:  destruction is gone forth, the\nrod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.","Iniquity is risen up into a rod of impiety:  nothing of them shall\nremain, nor of their people, nor of the noise of them:  and there shall\nbe no rest among them.","The time is come, the day is at hand:  let not the buyer rejoice:\nnor the seller mourn:  for wrath is upon all the people thereof.","For the seller shall not return to that which he hath sold,\nalthough their life be yet among the living.  For the vision which\nregardeth all the multitude thereof, shall not go back:  neither shall\nman be strengthened in the iniquity of his life.","Blow the trumpet, let all be made ready, yet there is none to go\nto the battle:  for my wrath shall be upon all the people thereof.","The sword without:  and the pestilence, and the famine within:  he\nthat is in the field shall die by the sword:  and they that are in the\ncity, shall be devoured by the pestilence, and the famine.","And such of them as shall flee shall escape:  and they shall be in\nthe mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them trembling, every\none for his iniquity.","All hands shall be made feeble, and all knees shall run with\nwater.","And they shall gird themselves with haircloth, and fear shall\ncover them and shame shall be upon every face, and baldness upon all\ntheir heads.","Their silver shall be cast forth, and their gold shall become a\ndunghill.  Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them\nin the day of the wrath of the Lord.

I\nwill do to them according to their way, and will judge them according\nto their judgments:  and they shall know that I am the Lord."]}
