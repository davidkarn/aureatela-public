{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the\ntenth month, the tenth day of the month, saying:","Son of man, write thee the name of this day, on which the king of\nBabylon hath set himself against Jerusalem to day.","And thou shalt speak by a figure a parable to the provoking\nhouse, and say to them:  Thus saith the Lord God:  Set on a pot, set it\non, I say, and put water in it.","Heap together into it the pieces thereof, every good piece, the\nthigh and the shoulder, choice pieces and full of bones.","Take the fattest of the flock, and lay together piles of bones\nunder it:  the seething thereof is boiling hot, and the bones thereof\nare thoroughly sodden in the midst of it.","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Woe to the bloody city, to the\npot whose rust is in it, and its rust is not gone out of it:  cast it\nout piece by piece, there hath no lot fallen upon it.","For her blood is in the midst of her, she hath shed it upon the\nsmooth rock:  she hath not shed it upon the ground, that it might be\ncovered with dust.","And that I might bring my indignation upon her, and take my\nvengeance:  I have shed her blood upon the smooth rock, that it should\nnot be covered.","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Woe to the bloody city, of\nwhich I will make a great bonfire.","Heap together the bones, which I will burn with fire:  the flesh\nshall be consumed, and the whole composition shall be sodden, and the\nbones shall be consumed.","Then set it empty upon burning coals, that it may be hot, and\nthe brass thereof may be melted:  and let the filth of it be melted in\nthe midst thereof, and let the rust of it be consumed.","Great pains have been taken, and the great rust thereof is not\ngone out, not even by fire.","Thy uncleanness is execrable:  because I desired to cleanse thee,\nand thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness:  neither shalt thou be\ncleansed, before I cause my indignation to rest in thee.","I the Lord have spoken:  it shall come to pass, and I will do it:\nI will not pass by, nor spare, nor be pacified:  I will judge thee\naccording to thy ways, and according to thy doings, saith the Lord.","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, behold I take from thee the desire of thy eyes with\na stroke, and thou shall not lament, nor weep; neither shall thy tears\nrun down.","Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead:  let the tire of\nthy head be upon thee, and thy shoes on thy feet, and cover not thy\nface, nor eat the meat of mourners.","So I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the\nevening:  and I did in the morning as he had commanded me.","And the people said to me:  Why dost thou not tell us what these\nthings mean that thou doest?","And I said to them:  The word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Speak to the house of Israel:  Thus saith the Lord God:  Behold I\nwill profane my sanctuary, the glory of your realm, and the thing that\nyour eyes desire, and for which your soul feareth:  your sons, and your\ndaughters, whom you have left, shall fall by the sword.","And you shall do as I have done:  you shall not cover your faces,\nnor shall you eat the meat of mourners.","You shall have crowns on your heads, and shoes on your feet:  you\nshall not lament nor weep, but you shall pine away for your iniquities,\nand every one shall sigh with his brother.","And Ezechiel shall be unto you for a sign of things to come:\naccording to all that he hath done, so shall you do, when this shall\ncome to pass:  and you shall know that I am the Lord God.","And thou, O son of man, behold in the day wherein I will take\naway from them their strength, and the joy of their glory, and the\ndesire of their eyes, upon which their souls rest, their sons and their\ndaughters.","In that day when he that escapeth shall come to thee, to tell\nthee:","In that day, I say, shall thy mouth be opened to him that hath\nescaped, and thou shalt speak, and shalt be silent no more:  and thou\nshalt be unto them for a sign of things to come, and you shall know\nthat I am the Lord."]}
