{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man set thy face towards the mountains of Israel, and\nprophesy against them.","And say:  Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God:\nThus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the\nrocks, and the valleys:  Behold, I will bring upon you the sword, and I\nwill destroy your high places.","And I will throw down your altars, and your idols shall be broken\nin pieces:  and I will cast down your slain before your idols.","And I will lay the dead carcasses of the children of Israel before\nyour idols:  and I will scatter your bones round about your altars,","In all your dwelling places.  The cities shall be laid waste, and\nthe high places shall be thrown down, and destroyed, and your altars\nshall be abolished, and shall be broken in pieces:  and your idols shall\nbe no more, and your temples shall be destroyed, and your works shall\nbe defaced.","And the slain shall fall in the midst of you:  and you shall know\nthat I am the Lord.","And I will leave in you some that shall escape the sword among the\nnations, when I shall have scattered you through the countries.","And they that are saved of you shall remember me amongst the\nnations, to which they are carried captives:  because I have broken\ntheir heart that was faithless, and revolted from me:  and their eyes\nthat went a fornicating after their idols:  and they shall be displeased\nwith themselves because of the evils which they have committed in all\ntheir abominations.","And they shall know that I the Lord have not spoken in vain that\nI would do this evil to them.","Thus saith the Lord God:  Strike with thy hand and stamp with thy\nfoot, and say:  Alas, for all the abominations of the evils of the house\nof Israel:  for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the\npestilence.","He that is far off shall die of the pestilence:  and he that is\nnear, shall fall by the sword:  and he that remaineth, and is besieged,\nshall die by the famine:  and I will accomplish my indignation upon\nthem.","And you shall know that I am the Lord, when your slain shall be\namongst your idols, round about your altars, in every high hill, and on\nall the tops of mountains, and under every woody tree, and under every\nthick oak, the place where they burnt sweet smelling frankincense to\nall their idols.","And I will stretch forth my hand upon them:  and I will make the\nland desolate, and abandoned from the desert of Deblatha in all their\ndwelling places:  and they shall know that I am the Lord."]}
