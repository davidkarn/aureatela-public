{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, prophesy thou against the prophets of Israel that\nprophesy:  and thou shalt say to them that prophesy out of their own\nheart:  Hear ye the word of the Lord:","Thus saith the Lord God:  Woe to the foolish prophets that follow\ntheir own spirit, and see nothing.","Thy prophets, O Israel, were like foxes in the deserts.","You have not gone up to face the enemy, nor have you set up a\nwall for the house of Israel, to stand in battle in the day of the\nLord.","They see vain things, and they foretell lies, saying:  The Lord\nsaith:  whereas the Lord hath not sent them:  and they have persisted to\nconfirm what they have said.","Have you not seen a vain vision and spoken a lying divination:\nand you say:  The Lord saith:  whereas I have not spoken.","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Because you have spoken vain\nthings, and have seen lies:  therefore behold I come against you, saith\nthe Lord God.","And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vain things, and\nthat divine lies:  they shall not be in the council of my people, nor\nshall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither\nshall they enter into the land of Israel, and you shall know that I am\nthe Lord God.","Because they have deceived my people, saying:  Peace, and there\nis no peace:  and the people built up a wall, and they daubed it with\ndirt without straw.","Say to them that daub without tempering, that it shall fall:  for\nthere shall be an overflowing shower, and I will cause great hailstones\nto fall violently from above, and a stormy wind to throw it down.","Behold, when the wall is fallen:  shall it not be said to you:\nWhere is the daubing wherewith you have daubed it?","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Lo, I will cause a stormy\nwind to break forth in my indignation, and there shall be an\noverflowing shower in my anger:  and great hailstones in my wrath to\nconsume.","And I will break down the wall that you have daubed with\nuntempered mortar:  and I will make it even with the ground, and the\nfoundation thereof shall be laid bare:  and it shall fall, and shall be\nconsumed in the midst thereof:  and you shall know that I am the Lord.","And I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that\ndaub it without tempering the mortar, and I will say to you:  The wall\nis no more, and they that daub it are no more.","Even the prophets of Israel that prophesy to Jerusalem, and that\nsee visions of peace for her:  and there is no peace, saith the Lord\nGod.","And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy\npeople that prophesy out of their own heart:  and do thou prophesy\nagainst them,","And say:  Thus saith the Lord God:  Woe to them that sew cushions\nunder every elbow:  and make pillows for the heads of persons of every\nage to catch souls:  and when they caught the souls of my people, they\ngave life to their souls.","And they violated me among my people, for a handful of barley,\nand a piece of bread, to kill souls which should not die, and to save\nsouls alive which should not live, telling lies to my people that\nbelieve lies.","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Behold I declare against your\ncushions, wherewith you catch flying souls:  and I will tear them off\nfrom your arms:  and I will let go the soul that you catch, the souls\nthat should fly.","And I will tear your pillows, and will deliver my people out of\nyour hand, neither shall they be any more in your hands to be a prey:\nand you shall know that I am the Lord.","Because with lies you have made the heart of the just to mourn,\nwhom I have not made sorrowful:  and have strengthened the hands of the\nwicked, that he should not return from his evil way, and live.","Therefore you shall not see vain things, nor divine divinations\nany more, and I will deliver my people out of your hand:  and you shall\nknow that I am the Lord."]}
