{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, what shall be made of the wood of the vine, out of\nall the trees of the woods that are among the trees of the forests?","Shall wood be taken of it, to do any work, or shall a pin be made\nof it for any vessel to hang thereon?","Behold it is cast into the fire for fuel:  the fire hath consumed\nboth ends thereof, and the midst thereof is reduced to ashes:  shall it\nbe useful for any work?","Even when it was whole it was not fit for work:  how much less,\nwhen the fire hath devoured and consumed it, shall any work be made of\nit?","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  As the vine tree among the\ntrees of the forests which I have given to the fire to be consumed, so\nwill I deliver up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.","And I will set my face against them:  they shall go out from fire,\nand fire shall consume them:  and you shall know that I am the Lord,\nwhen I shall have set my face against them.","And I shall have made their land a wilderness, and desolate,\nbecause they have been transgressors, saith the Lord God."]}
