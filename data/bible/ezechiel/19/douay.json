{"verses":["Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,","And say:  Why did thy mother the lioness lie down among the lions,\nand bring up her whelps in the midst of young lions?","And she brought out one of her whelps, and he became a lion:  and\nhe learned to catch the prey, and to devour men.","And the nations heard of him, and took him, but not without\nreceiving wounds:  and they brought him in chains into the land of\nEgypt.","But she seeing herself weakened, and that her hope was lost, took\none of her young lions, and set him up for a lion.","And he went up and down among the lions, and became a lion:  and\nhe learned to catch the prey, and to devour men.","He learned to make widows, and to lay waste their cities:  and the\nland became desolate, and the fulness thereof by the noise of his\nroaring.","And the nations came together against him on every side out of\nthe provinces, and they spread their net over him, in their wounds he\nwas taken.","And they put him into a cage, they brought him in chains to the\nking of Babylon:  and they cast him into prison, that his voice should\nno more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.","Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the water:  her\nfruit and her branches have grown out of many waters.","And she hath strong rods to make sceptres for them that bear\nrule, and her stature was exalted among the branches:  and she saw her\nheight in the multitude of her branches.","But she was plucked up in wrath, and cast on the ground, and the\nburning wind dried up her fruit:  her strong rods are withered, and\ndried up:  the fire hath devoured her.","And now she is transplanted into the desert, in a land not\npassable, and dry.","And a fire is gone out from a rod of her branches, which hath\ndevoured her fruit:  so that she now hath no strong rod, to be a sceptre\nof rulers.  This is a lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation."]}
