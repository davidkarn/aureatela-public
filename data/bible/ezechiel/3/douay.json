{"verses":["And he said to me:  Son of man, eat all that thou shalt find:  eat\nthis book, and go speak to the children of Israel.","And I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that book:","And he said to me:  Son of man, thy belly shall eat, and thy bowels\nshall be filled with this book, which I give thee, and I did eat it:\nand it was sweet as honey in my mouth.","And he said to me:  Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and thou\nshalt speak my words to them.","For thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech, and of an\nunknown tongue, but to the house of Israel:","Nor to many nations of a strange speech, and of an unknown tongue,\nwhose words thou canst not understand:  and if thou wert sent to them,\nthey would hearken to thee.","But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee:  because they\nwill not hearken to me:  for all the house of Israel are of a hard\nforehead and an obstinate heart.","Behold I have made thy face stronger than their faces:  and thy\nforehead harder than their foreheads.","I have made thy face like an adamant and like flint:  fear them\nnot, neither be thou dismayed at their presence:  for they are a\nprovoking house.","And he said to me:  Son of man, receive in thy heart, and hear\nwith thy ears, all the words that I speak to thee:","And go get thee in to them of the captivity, to the children of\nthy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and shalt say to them:  Thus\nsaith the Lord:  If so be they will hear, and will forbear.","And the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a\ngreat commotion, saying:  Blessed be the glory of the Lord, from his\nplace.","The noise of the wings of the living creatures striking one\nagainst another, and the noise of the wheels following the living\ncreatures, and the noise of a great commotion.","The spirit also lifted me, and took me up:  and I went away in\nbitterness in the indignation of my spirit:  for the hand of the Lord\nwas with me, strengthening me.","And I came to them of the captivity, to the heap of new corn, to\nthem that dwelt by the river Chobar, and I sat where they sat:  and I\nremained there seven days mourning in the midst of them.","And at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me,\nsaying:","Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel:\nand thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and shalt tell it them\nfrom me.","If, when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die:  thou declare\nit not to him, nor speak to him, that he may be converted from his\nwicked way, and live:  the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity,\nbut I will require his blood at thy hand.","But if thou give warning to the wicked, and he be not converted\nfrom his wickedness, and from his evil way:  he indeed shall die in his\niniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.","Moreover if the just man shall turn away from his justice, and\nshall commit iniquity:  I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall\ndie, because thou hast not given him warning:  he shall die in his sin,\nand his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered:  but I\nwill require his blood at thy hand.","But if thou warn the just man, that the just may not sin, and he\ndoth not sin:  living he shall live, because thou hast warned him, and\nthou hast delivered thy soul.","And the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he said to me:  Rise and\ngo forth into the plain, and there I will speak to thee.","And I rose up, and went forth into the plain:  and behold the\nglory of the Lord stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river\nChobar:  and I fell upon my face.","And the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet:  and he\nspoke to me, and said to me:  Go in; and shut thyself up in the midst of\nthy house.","And thou, O son of man, behold they shall put bands upon thee,\nand they shall bind thee with them:  and thou shalt not go forth from\nthe midst of them.","And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth,\nand thou shalt be dumb, and not as a man that reproveth:  because they\nare a provoking house.","But when I shall speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou\nshalt say to them:  Thus saith the Lord God:  He that heareth, let him\nhear:  and he that forbeareth, let him forbear:  for they are a provoking\nhouse."]}
