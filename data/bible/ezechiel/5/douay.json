{"verses":["And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife that shaveth the\nhair:  and cause it to pass over thy head, and over thy beard:  and take\nthee a balance to weigh in, and divide the hair.","A third part thou shalt burn with fire in the midst of the city,\naccording to the fulfilling of the days of the siege:  and thou shalt\ntake a third part, and cut it in pieces with the knife all round about:\nand the other third part thou shalt scatter in the wind, and I will\ndraw out the sword after them.","And thou shalt take thereof a small number:  and shalt bind them in\nthe skirt of thy cloak.","And thou shalt take of them again, and shalt cast them in the\nmidst of the fire, and shalt burn them with fire:  and out of it shall\ncome forth a fire into all the house of Israel.","Thus saith the Lord God:  This is Jerusalem, I have set her in the\nmidst of the nations, and the countries round about her.","And she hath despised my judgments, so as to be more wicked than\nthe Gentiles; and my commandments, more than the countries that are\nround about her:  for they have cast off my judgments, and have not\nwalked in my commandments.","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Because you have surpassed the\nGentiles that are round about you, and have not walked in my\ncommandments, and have not kept my judgments, and have not done\naccording to the judgments of the nations that are round about you:","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Behold I come against thee, and\nI myself will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of\nthe Gentiles.","And I will do in thee that which I have not done:  and the like to\nwhich I will do no more, because of all thy abominations.","Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee,\nand the sons shall eat their fathers:  and I will execute judgments in\nthee, and I will scatter thy whole remnant into every wind.","Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God:  Because thou hast\nviolated my sanctuary with all thy offences, and with all thy\nabominations:  I will also break thee in pieces, and my eye shall not\nspare, and I will not have any pity.","A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and shall be\nconsumed with famine in the midst of thee:  and a third part of thee\nshall fall by the sword round about thee:  and a third part of thee will\nI scatter into every wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.","And I will accomplish my fury, and will cause my indignation to\nrest upon them, and I will be comforted:  and they shall know that I the\nLord have spoken it in my zeal, when I shall have accomplished my\nindignation in them.","And I will make thee desolate, and a reproach among the nations\nthat are round about thee, in the sight of every one that passeth by.","And thou shalt be a reproach, and a scoff, an example, and an\nastonishment amongst the nations that are round about thee, when I\nshall have executed judgments in thee in anger, and in indignation, and\nin wrathful rebukes.","I the Lord have spoken it:  When I shall send upon them the\ngrievous arrows of famine, which shall bring death, and which I will\nsend to destroy you:  and I will gather together famine against you:  and\nI will break among you the staff of bread.","And I will send in upon you famine, and evil beasts unto utter\ndestruction:  and pestilence, and blood shall pass through thee, and I\nwill bring in the sword upon thee.  I the Lord have spoken it."]}
