{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","And thou son of man, dost thou not judge, dost thou not judge the\ncity of blood?","And thou shalt shew her all her abominations, and shalt say:  Thus\nsaith the Lord God:  This is the city that sheddeth blood in the midst\nof her, that her time may come:  and that hath made idols against\nherself, to defile herself.","Thou art become guilty in thy blood which thou hast shed:  and\nthou art defiled in thy idols which thou hast made:  and thou hast made\nthy days to draw near, and hast brought on the time of thy years:\ntherefore have I made thee a reproach to the Gentiles, and a mockery to\nall countries.","Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall\ntriumph over thee:  thou filthy one, infamous, great in destruction.","Behold the princes of Israel, every one hath employed his arm in\nthee to shed blood.","They have abused father and mother in thee, they have oppressed\nthe stranger in the midst of thee, they have grieved the fatherless and\nwidow in thee.","Thou hast despised my sanctuaries, and profaned my sabbaths.","Slanderers have been in thee to shed blood, and they have eaten\nupon the mountains in thee, they have committed wickedness in the midst\nof thee.","They have discovered the nakedness of their father in thee, they\nhave humbled the uncleanness of the menstruous woman in thee.","And every one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's\nwife, and the father in law hath wickedly defiled his daughter in law,\nthe brother hath oppressed his sister the daughter of his father in\nthee.","They have taken gifts in thee to shed blood:  thou hast taken\nusury and increase, and hast covetously oppressed thy neighbours:  and\nthou hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God.","Behold, I have clapped my hands at thy covetousness, which thou\nhast exercised:  and at the blood that hath been shed in the midst of\nthee.","Shall thy heart endure, or shall thy hands prevail in the days\nwhich I will bring upon thee:  I the Lord have spoken, and will do it.","And I will disperse thee in the nations, and will scatter thee\namong the countries, and I will put an end to thy uncleanness in thee.","And I will possess thee in the sight of the Gentiles, and thou\nshalt know that I am the Lord.","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, the house of Israel is become dross to me:  all these\nare brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace:\nthey are become the dross of silver.","Therefore thus saith the Lord God:  Because you are all turned\ninto dross, therefore behold I will gather you together in the midst of\nJerusalem.","As they gather silver, and brass, and tin, and iron, and lead in\nthe midst of the furnace:  that I may kindle a fire in it to melt it:  so\nwill I gather you together in my fury and in my wrath, and will take my\nrest, and I will melt you down.","And will gather you together, and will burn you in the fire of\nmy wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst thereof.","As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall you be\nin the midst thereof:  and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I\nhave poured out my indignation upon you.","And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, say to her:  Thou art a land that is unclean, and not\nrained upon in the day of wrath.","There is a conspiracy of prophets in the midst thereof:  like a\nlion that roareth and catcheth the prey, they have devoured souls, they\nhave taken riches and hire, they have made many widows in the midst\nthereof.","Her priests have despised my law, and have defiled my\nsanctuaries:  they have put no difference between holy and profane:  nor\nhave distinguished between the polluted and the clean:  and they have\nturned away their eyes from my sabbaths, and I was profaned in the\nmidst of them.","Her princes in the midst of her, are like wolves ravening the\nprey to shed blood, and to destroy souls, and to run after gains\nthrough covetousness.","And her prophets have daubed them without tempering the mortar,\nseeing vain things, and divining lies unto them, saying:  Thus saith the\nLord God:  when the Lord hath not spoken.","The people of the land have used oppression, and committed\nrobbery:  they afflicted the needy and poor, and they oppressed the\nstranger by calumny without judgment.","And I sought among them for a man that might set up a hedge, and\nstand in the gap before me in favour of the land, that I might not\ndestroy it:  and I found none.","And I poured out my indignation upon them, in the fire of my\nwrath I consumed them:  I have rendered their way upon their own head,\nsaith the Lord God."]}
