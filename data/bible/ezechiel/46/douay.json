{"verses":["Thus saith the Lord God:  The gate of the inner court that looketh\ntoward the east, shall be shut the six days, on which work is done; but\non the sabbath day it shall be opened, yea and on the day of the new\nmoon it shall be opened.","And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate\nfrom without, and he shall stand at the threshold of the gate:  and the\npriests shall offer his holocaust, and his peace offerings:  and he\nshall adore upon the threshold of the gate, and shall go out:  but the\ngate shall not be shut till the evening.","And the people of the land shall adore at the door of that gate\nbefore the Lord on the sabbaths, and on the new moons.","And the holocaust that the prince shall offer to the Lord on the\nsabbath day, shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without\nblemish.","And the sacrifice of all ephi for a ram:  but for the lambs what\nsacrifice his hand shall allow:  and a hin of oil for every ephi.","And on the day of the new moon a calf of the herd without\nblemish:  and the six lambs, and the rams shall be without blemish.","And he shall offer in sacrifice an ephi for calf, an ephi also\nfor a ram:  but for the lambs, as his hand shall find:  and a hin of oil\nfor every ephi.","And when the prince is to go in, let him go in by the way of the\nporch of the gate, and let him go out the same way.","But when the people of the land shall go in before the Lord in\nthe solemn feasts, he that goeth in by the north gate to adore, shall\ngo out by the way of the south gate; and he that goeth in by the way of\nthe south gate, shall go out by the way of the north gate:  he shall not\nreturn by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go out at\nthat over against it.","And the prince in the midst of them, shall go in when they go\nin, and go out when they go out.","And in the fairs, and in the solemnities there shall be the\nsacrifice of an ephi to a calf, and an ephi to a ram:  and to the lambs,\nthe sacrifice shall be as his hand shall find:  and a hin of oil to\nevery ephi.","But when the prince shall offer a voluntary holocaust, or\nvoluntary peace offering to the Lord:  the gate that looketh towards the\neast shall be opened to him, and he shall offer his holocaust, and his\npeace offerings, as it is wont to be done on the sabbath day:  and he\nshall go out, and the gate shall be shut after he is gone forth.","And he shall offer every day for a holocaust to the Lord, a lamb\nof the same year without blemish:  he shall offer it always in the\nmorning.","And he shall offer the sacrifice for it morning by morning, the\nsixth part of an ephi:  and the third part of a hin of oil to be mingled\nwith the fine flour:  a sacrifice to the Lord by ordinance continual and\neverlasting.","He shall offer the lamb, and the sacrifice, and the oil morning\nby morning:  an everlasting holocaust.","Thus saith the Lord God:  If the prince give a gift to any of his\nsons:  the inheritance of it shall go to his children, they shall\npossess it by inheritance.","But if he give a legacy out of his inheritance to one of his\nservants, it shall be his until the year of release, and it shall\nreturn to the prince:  but his inheritance shall go to his sons.","And the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by\nviolence, nor of their possession:  but out of his own possession he\nshall give an inheritance to his sons:  that my people be not dispersed\nevery man from his possession.","And he brought me in by the entry that was at the side of the\ngate, into the chambers of the sanctuary that were for the priests,\nwhich looked toward the north.  And there was a place bending to the\nwest.","And he said to me:  This is the place where the priests shall\nboil the sin offering, and the trespass offering:  where they shall\ndress the sacrifice, that they may not bring it out into the outward\ncourt, and the people be sanctified.","And he brought me into the outward court, and he led me about by\nthe four corners of the court:  and behold there was a little court in\nthe corner of the court, to every corner of the court there was a\nlittle court.","In the four corners of the court were little courts disposed,\nforty cubits long, and thirty broad, all the four were of one measure.","And there was a wall round about compassing the four little\ncourts, and there were kitchens built under the rows round about.","And he said to me:  This is the house of the kitchens wherein the\nministers of the house of the Lord shall boil the victims of the\npeople."]}
