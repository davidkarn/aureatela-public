{"verses":["And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:","Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations.","And thou shalt say:  Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem:  Thy\nroot, and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan, thy father was an\nAmorrhite, and thy mother a Cethite.","And when thou wast born, in the day of thy nativity thy navel was\nnot cut, neither wast thou washed with water for thy health, nor salted\nwith salt, nor swaddled with clouts.","No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee, out\nof compassion to thee:  but thou wast cast out upon the face of the\nearth in the abjection of thy soul, in the day that thou wast born.","And passing by thee, I saw that thou wast trodden under foot in\nthy own blood:  and I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood:  Live:  I\nhave said to thee:  Live in thy blood.","I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field:  and thou didst\nincrease and grow great, and advancedst, and camest to woman's\nornament:  thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair grew:  and thou was\nnaked, and full of confusion.","And I passed by thee, and saw thee:  and behold thy time was the\ntime of lovers:  and I spread my garment over thee, and covered thy\nignominy.  and I swore to thee, and I entered into a covenant with thee,\nsaith the Lord God:  and thou becamest mine.","And I washed thee with water, and cleansed away thy blood from\nthee:  and I anointed thee with oil.","And I clothed thee with embroidery, and shod thee with violet\ncoloured shoes:  and I girded thee about with fine linen, and clothed\nthee with fine garments.","I decked thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets on thy\nhands, and a chain about thy neck.","And I put a jewel upon thy forehead and earrings in thy ears,\nand a beautiful crown upon thy head.","And thou wast adorned with gold, and silver, and wast clothed\nwith fine linen, and embroidered work, and many colours:  thou didst eat\nfine flour, and honey, and oil, and wast made exceeding beautiful:  and\nwast advanced to be a queen.","And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty:  for\nthou wast perfect through my beauty, which I had put upon thee, saith\nthe Lord God.","But trusting in thy beauty, thou playedst the harlot because of\nthy renown, and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger, to be\nhis.","And taking of thy garments thou hast made thee high places sewed\ntogether on each side:  and hast played the harlot upon them, as hath\nnot been done before, nor shall be hereafter.","And thou tookest thy beautiful vessels, of my gold, and my\nsilver, which I gave thee, and thou madest thee images of men, and hast\ncommitted fornication with them.","And thou tookest thy garments of divers colours, and coveredst\nthem:  and settest my oil and my sweet incense before them.","And my bread which I gave thee, the fine flour, and oil, and\nhoney, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast set before them for a sweet\nodour; and it was done, saith the Lord God.","And thou hast taken thy sons, and thy daughters, whom thou hast\nborne to me:  and hast sacrificed the same to them to be devoured.  Is\nthy fornication small?","Thou hast sacrificed and given my children to them, consecrating\nthem by fire.","And after all thy abominations, and fornications, thou hast not\nremembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked, and full of\nconfusion, trodden under foot in thy own blood.","And it came to pass after all thy wickedness (woe, woe to thee,\nsaith the Lord God)","That thou didst also build thee a common stew, and madest thee a\nbrothel house in every street.","At every head of the way thou hast set up a sign of thy\nprostitution:  and hast made thy beauty to be abominable:  and hast\nprostituted thyself to every one that passed by, and hast multiplied\nthy fornications.","And thou hast committed fornication with the Egyptians thy\nneighbours, men of large bodies, and hast multiplied thy fornications\nto provoke me.","Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will take away\nthy justification:  and I will deliver thee up to the will of the\ndaughters of the Philistines that hate thee, that are ashamed of thy\nwicked way.","Thou hast also committed fornication with the Assyrians, because\nthou wast not yet satisfied:  and after thou hadst played the harlot\nwith them, even so thou wast not contented.","Thou hast also multiplied thy fornications in the land of\nChanaan with the Chaldeans:  and neither so wast thou satisfied.","Wherein shall I cleanse thy heart, saith Lord God:  seeing thou\ndost all these the works of a shameless prostitute?","Because thou hast built thy brothel house at the head of every\nway, and thou hast made thy high place in every street:  and wast not as\na harlot that by disdain enhanceth her price,","But is an adulteress, that bringeth in strangers over her\nhusband.","Gifts are given to all harlots:  but thou hast given hire to all\nthy lovers, and thou hast given them gifts to come to thee from every\nside, to commit fornication with thee.","And it hath happened in thee contrary to the custom of women in\nthy fornications, and after thee there shall be no such fornication,\nfor in that thou gavest rewards, and didst not take rewards, the\ncontrary hath been done in thee.","Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord.","Thus saith the Lord God:  Because thy money hath been poured out,\nand thy shame discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers, and\nwith the idols of thy abominations, by the blood of thy children whom\nthou gavest them:","Behold, I will gather together all thy lovers with whom thou\nhast taken pleasure, and all whom thou hast loved, with all whom thou\nhast hated:  and I will gather them together against thee on every side,\nand will discover thy shame in their sight, and they shall see all thy\nnakedness.","And I will judge thee as adulteresses, and they that shed blood\nare judged:  and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.","And I will deliver thee into their hands, and they shall destroy\nthy brothel house, and throw down thy stews:  and they shall strip thee\nof thy garments, and shall take away the vessels of thy beauty:  and\nleave thee naked, and full of disgrace.","And they shall bring upon thee a multitude, and they shall stone\nthee with stones, and shall slay thee with their swords.","And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and shall execute\njudgments upon thee in the sight of many women:  and thou shalt cease\nfrom fornication, and shalt give no hire any more.","And my indignation shall rest in thee:  and my jealousy shall\ndepart from thee, and I will cease and be angry no more.","Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast\nprovoked me in all these things:  wherefore I also have turned all thy\nways upon thy head, saith the Lord God, and I have not done according\nto thy wicked deeds in all thy abominations.","Behold every one that useth a common proverb, shall use this\nagainst thee, saying:  As the mother was, so also is her daughter.","Thou art thy mother's daughter, that cast off her husband, and\nher children:  and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who cast off\ntheir husbands, and their children:  your mother was a Cethite, and your\nfather an Amorrhite.","And thy elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that\ndwell at thy left hand:  and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy\nright hand is Sodom, and her daughters.","But neither hast thou walked in their ways, nor hast thou done a\nlittle less than they according to their wickednesses:  thou hast done\nalmost more wicked things than they in all thy ways.","As I live, saith the Lord God, thy sister Sodom herself, and her\ndaughters, have not done as thou hast done, and thy daughters.","Behold this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister, pride, fulness\nof bread, and abundance, and the idleness of her, and of her daughters:\nand they did not put forth their hand to the needy, and the poor.","And they were lifted up, and committed abominations before me:\nand I took them away as thou hast seen.","And Samaria committed not half thy sins:  but thou hast surpassed\nthem with thy crimes, and hast justified thy sisters by all thy\nabominations which thou hast done.","Therefore do thou also bear thy confusion, thou that hast\nsurpassed thy sisters with thy sins, doing more wickedly than they:  for\nthey are justified above thee, therefore be thou also confounded, and\nbear thy shame, thou that hast justified thy sisters.","And I will bring back and restore them by bringing back Sodom,\nwith her daughters, and by bringing back Samaria, and her daughters:\nand I will bring those that return of thee in the midst of them.","That thou mayest bear thy shame, and mayest be confounded in all\nthat thou hast done, comforting them.","And thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall return to their\nancient state:  and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their\nancient state:  and thou and thy daughters shall return to your ancient\nstate.","And Sodom thy sister was not heard of in thy mouth, in the day\nof thy pride,","Before thy malice was laid open:  as it is at this time, making\nthee a reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all the daughters of\nPalestine round about thee, that encompass thee on all sides.","Thou hast borne thy wickedness, and thy disgrace, saith the Lord\nGod.","For thus saith the Lord God:  I will deal with thee, as thou hast\ndespised the oath, in breaking the covenant:","And I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy\nyouth:  and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant.","And thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed:  when thou\nshalt receive thy sisters, thy elder and thy younger:  and I will give\nthem to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.","And I will establish my covenant with thee:  and thou shalt know\nthat I am the Lord,","That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and mayest no more\nopen thy mouth because of thy confusion, when I shall be pacified\ntoward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God."]}
