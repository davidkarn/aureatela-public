{"verses":["And Jonathan saw that the time served him, and he chose certain\nmen, and sent them to Rome, to confirm and to renew the amity with\nthem:","And he sent letters to the Spartans, and to other places,\naccording to the same form.","And they went to Rome, and entered into the senate house, and\nsaid:  Jonathan, the high priest, and the nation of the Jews, have sent\nus to renew the amity, and alliance, as it was before.","And they gave them letters to their governors in every place, to\nconduct them into the land of Juda with peace.","And this is a copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote to the\nSpartans:","Jonathan, the high priest, and the ancients of the nation, and\nthe priests, and the rest of the people of the Jews, to the Spartans,\ntheir brethren, greeting.","There were letters sent long ago to Onias the high priest, from\nArius, who reigned then among you to signify that you are our brethren,\nas the copy here underwritten doth specify.","And Onias received the ambassador with honour and received the\nletters, wherein there was mention made of the alliance, and amity.","We, though we needed none of these things having for our comfort\nthe holy books that are in our hands,","Chose rather to send to you to renew the brotherhood and\nfriendship, lest we should become stranger to you altogether:  for there\nis a long time passed since you sent to us.","We, therefore, at all times without ceasing, both in our\nfestivals, and other days wherein it is convenient, remember you in the\nsacrifices that we offer, and in our observances, as it is meet and\nbecoming to remember brethren.","And we rejoice at your glory.","But we have had many troubles and wars on every side; and the\nkings that are round about us have fought against us.","But we would not be troublesome to you, nor to the rest of our\nallies and friends, in these wars.","For we have had help from heaven, and we have been delivered,\nand our enemies are humbled.","We have chosen, therefore, Numenius the son of Antiochus, and\nAntipater, the son of Jason, and have sent them to the Romans, to renew\nwith them the former amity and alliance.","And we have commanded them to go also to you, and salute you,\nand to deliver you our letters, concerning the renewing of our\nbrotherhood.","And now you shall do well to give us an answer hereto.","And this is the copy of the letter which he had sent to Onias:","Arius, king of the Spartans, to Onias, the high priest,\ngreeting.","It is found in writing concerning the Spartans, and the Jews,\nthat they are brethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham.","And now since this is come to our knowledge, you do well to\nwrite to us of your prosperity.","And we also have written back to you, That our cattle, and our\npossessions, are yours:  and yours, ours.  We, therefore, have commanded\nthat these things should be told you.","Now Jonathan heard that the generals of Demetrius were come\nagain with a greater army than before to fight against him.","So he went out from Jerusalem, and met them in the land of\nAmath:  for he gave them no time to enter into his country.","And he sent spies into their camp, and they came back, and\nbrought him word that they designed to come upon them in the night.","And when the sun was set, Jonathan commanded his men to watch,\nand to be in arms all night long ready to fight, and he set sentinels\nround about the camp.","And the enemies heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for\nbattle:  and they were struck with fear and dread in their heart:  and\nthey kindled fires in their camp.","But Jonathan, and they that were with him, knew it not till the\nmorning:  for they saw the lights burning.","And Jonathan pursued after them, but overtook them not:  for they\nhad passed the river Eleutherus.","And Jonathan turned upon the Arabians, that are called\nZabadeans:  and he defeated them, and took the spoils of them.","And he went forward, and came to Damascus, and passed through\nall that country.","Simon also went forth, and came as far as Ascalon, and the\nneighbouring fortresses, and he turned aside to Joppe, and took\npossession of it,","(For he heard that they designed to deliver the hold to them\nthat took part with Demetrius) and he put a garrison there to keep it.","And Jonathan came back, and called together the ancients of the\npeople; and he took a resolution with them to build fortresses in\nJudea,","And to build up walls in Jerusalem, and raise a mount between\nthe castle and the city, to separate it from the city, that so it might\nhave no communication, and that they might neither buy nor sell.","And they came together to build up the city:  for the wall that\nwas upon the brook, towards the east, was broken down, and he repaired\nthat which is called Caphetetha:","And Simon built Adiada in Sephela, and fortified it, and set up\ngates and bars.","Now when Tryphon had conceived a design to make himself king of\nAsia and to take the crown, and to stretch out his hand against king\nAntiochus:","Fearing lest Jonathan would not suffer him, but would fight\nagainst him:  he sought to seize upon him, and to kill him.  So he rose\nup and came to Bethsan.","And Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen\nfor battle, and came to Bethsan.","Now when Tryphon saw that Jonathan came with a great army, he\ndurst not stretch forth his hand against him.","But received him with honour, and commended him to all his\nfriends, and gave him presents:  and he commanded his troops to obey\nhim, as himself.","And he said to Jonathan:  Why hast thou troubled all the people,\nwhereas we have no war?","Now, therefore, send them back to their own houses:  and choose\nthee a few men that may be with thee, and come with me to Ptolemais,\nand I will deliver it to thee, and the rest of the strong holds, and\nthe army, and all that have any charge, and I will return and go away:\nfor this is the cause of my coming.","And Jonathan believed him, and did as he said:  and sent away his\narmy, and they departed into the land of Juda:","But he kept with him three thousand men:  of whom he sent two\nthousand into Galilee, and one thousand went with him.","Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of\nPtolemais shut the gates of the city, and took him:  and all them that\ncame in with him they slew with the sword.","Then Tryphon sent an army and horsemen into Galilee, and into\nthe great plain, to destroy all Jonathan's company.","But they, when they understood that Jonathan, and all that were\nwith him, were taken and slain, encouraged one another, and went out\nready for battle.","Then they that had come after them, seeing that they stood for\ntheir lives, returned back.","Whereupon they all came peaceably into the land of Juda and they\nbewailed Jonathan, and them that had been with him, exceedingly:  and\nIsrael mourned with great lamentation.","Then all the heathens that were round about them, sought to\ndestroy them.  For they said:","They have no prince, nor any to help them:  now therefore, let us\nmake war upon them, and take away the memory of them from amongst men."]}
