{"verses":["Now in the hundred and sixtieth year, Alexander, the son of\nAntiochus, surnamed the Illustrious, came up and took Ptolemais, and\nthey received him, and he reigned there.","And king Demetrius heard of it, and gathered together an\nexceeding great army, and went forth against him to fight.","And Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan, with peaceable words, to\nmagnify him.","For he said:  Let us first make a peace with him, before he make\none with Alexander against us.","For he will remember all the evils that we have done against him,\nand against his brother, and against his nation.","And he gave him authority to gather together a army, and to make\narms, and that he should be his confederate:  and the hostages that were\nin the castle, he commanded to be delivered to him.","And Jonathan came to Jerusalem, and read the letters in the\nhearing of all the people, and of them that were in the castle.","And they were struck with great fear, because they heard that the\nking had given him authority to gather together an army.","And the hostages were delivered to Jonathan, and he restored them\nto their parents.","And Jonathan dwelt in Jerusalem, and began to build, and to\nrepair the city.","And he ordered workmen to build the walls, and mount Sion round\nabout with square stones for fortification:  and so they did.","Then the strangers that were in the strong holds, which\nBacchides had built, fled away.","And every man left his place, and departed into his own country:","Only in Bethsura there remained some of them, that had forsaken\nthe law, and the commandments of God:  for this was a place of refuge\nfor them.","And king Alexander heard of the promises that Demetrius had made\nJonathan:  and they told him of the battles, and the worthy acts that he\nand his brethren had done, and the labours that they had endured.","And he said:  Shall we find such another man?  now, therefore, we\nwill make him our friend and our confederate.","So he wrote a letter, and sent it to him according to these\nwords, saying:","King Alexander to his brother, Jonathan, greetings.","We have heard of thee, that thou art a man of great power, and\nfit to be our friend:","Now therefore, we make thee this day high priest of thy nation,\nand that thou be called the king's friend, (and he sent him a purple\nrobe, and a crown of gold) and that thou be of one mind with us in our\naffairs, and keep friendship with us.","Then Jonathan put on the holy vestment in the seventh month, in\nthe year one hundred and threescore, at the feast day of the\ntabernacles:  and he gathered together an army, and made a great number\nof arms.","And Demetrius heard these words, and was exceeding sorry, and\nsaid:","What is this that we have done, that Alexander hath prevented us\nto gain the friendship of the Jews to strengthen himself?","I also will write to them words of request, and offer dignities,\nand gifts:  that they may be with me to aid me.","And he wrote to them in these words:  King Demetrius to the\nnation of the Jews, greeting.","Whereas you have kept covenant with us, and have continued in\nour friendship, and have not joined with our enemies, we have heard of\nit, and are glad.","Wherefore now continue still to keep fidelity towards us, and we\nwill reward you with good things, for what you have done in our behalf.","And we will remit to you many charges, and will give you gifts.","And now I free you, and all the Jews, from tributes, and I\nrelease you from the customs of salt, and remit the crowns, and the\nthirds of the seed:","And the half of the fruit of trees, which is my share, I leave\nto you from this day forward, so that it shall not be taken of the land\nof Juda, and of the three cities that are added thereto out of Samaria\nand Galilee, from this day forth, and for ever:","And let Jerusalem be holy and free, with the borders thereof:\nand let the tenths, and tributes be for itself.","I yield up also the power of the castle that is in Jerusalem,\nand I give it to the high priest, to place therein such men as he shall\nchoose, to keep it.","And every soul of the Jews that hath been carried captive from\nthe land of Juda in all my kingdom, I set at liberty freely, that all\nbe discharged from tributes, even of their cattle.","And I will that all the feasts, and the sabbaths, and the new\nmoons, and the days appointed, and three days before the solemn day,\nand three days after the solemn day, be all days of immunity and\nfreedom, for all the Jews that are in my kingdom:","And no man shall have power to do any thing against them, or to\nmolest any of them, in any cause.","And let there be enrolled in the king's army to the number of\nthirty thousand of the Jews:  and allowance shall be made them, as is\ndue to all the king's forces and certain of them shall be appointed to\nbe in the fortresses of the great king:","And some of them shall be set over the affairs of the kingdom,\nthat are of trust, and let the governors be taken from among\nthemselves, and let them walk in their own laws, as the king hath\ncommanded in the land of Juda.","And the three cities that are added to Judea, out of the country\nof Samaria, let them be accounted with Judea:  that they may be under\none, and obey no other authority but that of the high priest:","Ptolemais and the confines thereof, I give as a free gift to the\nholy places that are in Jerusalem, for the necessary charges of the\nholy things.","And I give every year fifteen thousand sickles of silver out of\nthe king's accounts, of what belongs to me:","And all that is above, which they that were over the affairs the\nyears before, had not paid, from this time they shall give it to the\nworks of the house.","Moreover, the five thousand sickles of silver, which they\nreceived from the account of the holy places, every year, shall also\nbelong to the priests that execute the ministry.","And whosoever shall flee into the temple that is in Jerusalem,\nand in all the borders thereof, being indebted to the king for any\nmatter, let them be set at liberty, and all that they have in my\nkingdom, let them have it free.","For the building also, or repairing the works of the holy\nplaces, the charges shall be given out of the king's revenues:","For the building also of the walls of Jerusalem, and the\nfortifying thereof round about, the charges shall be given out of the\nking's account, as also for the building of the walls in Judea.","Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, they gave no\ncredit to them, nor received them because they remembered the great\nevil that he had done in Israel, for he had afflicted them exceedingly.","And their inclinations were towards Alexander, because he had\nbeen the chief promoter of peace in their regard, and him they always\nhelped.","And king Alexander gathered together a great army, and moved his\ncamp near to Demetrius.","And the two kings joined battle, and the army of Demetrius fled\naway, and Alexander pursued after him, and pressed them close.","And the battle was hard fought, till the sun went down:  and\nDemetrius was slain that day.","And Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemee king of Egypt, with\nwords to this effect, saying:","Forasmuch as I am returned into my kingdom and am set in the\nthrone of my ancestors, and have gotten the dominion, and have\noverthrown Demetrius and possessed our country,","And have joined battle with him, and both he and his army have\nbeen destroyed by us, and we are placed in the throne of his kingdom:","Now, therefore, let us make friendship one with another:  and\ngive me now thy daughter to wife, and I will be thy son in law, and I\nwill give both thee and her gifts worthy of thee.","And king Ptolomee answered, saying:  Happy is the day wherein\nthou didst return to the land of thy fathers, and sattest in the throne\nof their kingdom.","And now I will do to thee as thou hast written but meet me at\nPtolemais, that we may see one another, and I may give her to thee as\nthou hast said.","So Ptolemee went out of Egypt, with Cleopatra his daughter, and\nhe came to Ptolemais, in the hundred and sixty-second year.","And king Alexander met him, and he gave him his daughter,\nCleopatra:  and he celebrated her marriage at Ptolemais with great\nglory, after the manner of kings.","And king Alexander wrote to Jonathan, that he should come and\nmeet him.","And he went honourably to Ptolemais, and he met there the two\nkings, and he gave them much silver, and gold, and presents:  and he\nfound favour in their sight.","And some pestilent men of Israel, men of a wicked life,\nassembled themselves against him, to accuse him:  and the king gave no\nheed to them.","And he commanded that Jonathan's garments should be taken off,\nand that he should be clothed with purple:  and they did so.  And the\nking made him sit by himself.","And he said to his princes:  Go out with him into the midst of\nthe city, and make proclamation, that no man complain against him of\nany matter, and that no man trouble him for any manner of cause.","So when his accusers saw his glory proclaimed, and him clothed\nwith purple, they all fled away.","And the king magnified him, and enrolled him amongst his chief\nfriends, and made him governor, and partaker of his dominion.","And Jonathan returned into Jerusalem with peace and joy.","In the year one hundred and sixty-five, Demetrius, the son of\nDemetrius, came from Crete into the land of his fathers.","And king Alexander heard of it, and was much troubled, and\nreturned to Antioch.","And king Demetrius made Apollonius his general, who was governor\nof Celesyria:  and he gathered together a great army, and came to\nJamnia:  and he sent to Jonathan, the high priest,","Saying:  Thou alone standest against us, and I am laughed at and\nreproached, because thou shewest thy power against us in the mountains.","Now, therefore, if thou trustest in thy forces, come down to us\ninto the plain, and there let us try one another:  for with me is the\nstrength of war.","Ask, and learn who I am, and the rest that help me, who also say\nthat your foot cannot stand before our face, for thy fathers have twice\nbeen put to flight in their own land:","And now how wilt thou be able to abide the horsemen, and so\ngreat an army in the plain, where there is no stone, nor rock, nor\nplace to flee to?","Now when Jonathan heard the words of Apollonius, he was moved in\nhis mind:  and he chose ten thousand men, and went out of Jerusalem, and\nSimon, his brother, met him to help him.","And they pitched their tents near Joppe, but they shut him out\nof the city:  because a garrison of Apollonius was in Joppe, and he laid\nsiege to it.","And they that were in the city being affrighted, opened the\ngates to him:  so Jonathan took Joppe.","And Apollonius heard of it, and he took three thousand horsemen,\nand a great army.","And he went to Azotus, as one that was making a journey, and\nimmediately he went forth into the plain:  because he had a great number\nof horsemen, and he trusted in them.  And Jonathan followed after him to\nAzotus, and they joined battle.","And Apollonius left privately in the camp a thousand horsemen\nbehind them.","And Jonathan knew that there was an ambush behind him, and they\nsurrounded his army, and cast darts at the people from morning till\nevening.","But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them:  and\nso their horses were fatigued.","Then Simon drew forth his army, and attacked the legion:  for the\nhorsemen were wearied:  and they were discomfited by him, and fled.","And they that were scattered about the plain fled into Azotus,\nand went into Bethdagon, their idol's temple, there to save themselves.","But Jonathan set fire to Azotus, and the cities that were round\nabout it, and took the spoils of them and the temple of Dagon:  and all\nthem that were fled into it, he burnt with fire.","So they that were slain by the sword, with them that were burnt,\nwere almost eight thousand men.","And Jonathan, removed his army from thence and camped against\nAscalon:  and they went out of the city to meet him with great honour.","And Jonathan returned into Jerusalem with his people, having\nmany spoils.","And it came to pass, when Alexander, the king heard these words,\nthat he honoured Jonathan yet more.","And he sent him a buckle of gold, as the custom is, to be given\nto such as are of the royal blood.  And he gave him Accaron, and all the\nborders thereof, in possession."]}
