{"verses":["Now king Antiochus was going through the higher countries, and he\nheard that the city of Elymais in Persia, was greatly renowned, and\nabounding in silver and gold,","And that there was in it a temple exceeding rich; and coverings of\ngold, and breastplates, and shields, which king Alexander, son of\nPhilip, the Macedonian, that reigned first in Greece, had left there.","So he came, and sought to take the city and to pillage it; but he\nwas not able, because the design was known to them that were in the\ncity.","And they rose up against him in battle, and he fled away from\nthence, and departed with great sadness, and returned towards\nBabylonia.","And whilst he was in Persia there came one that told him how the\narmies that were in the land of Juda were put to flight:","And that Lysias went with a very great power, and was put to\nflight before the face of the Jews, and that they were grown strong by\nthe armour, and power, and store of spoils which they had gotten out of\nthe camps which they had destroyed:","And that they had thrown down the abomination which he had set up\nupon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassed about the\nsanctuary with high walls as before, and Bethsura also, his city.","And it came to pass, when the king heard these words, that he was\nstruck with fear, and exceedingly moved:  and he laid himself down upon\nhis bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not fallen out to him\nas he imagined.","And he remained there many days:  for great grief came more and\nmore upon him, and he made account that he should die.","And he called for all his friends, and said to them:  Sleep is\ngone from my eyes, and I am fallen away, and my heart is cast down for\nanxiety:","And I said in my heart:  Into how much tribulation am I come, and\ninto what floods of sorrow wherein now I am:  I that was pleasant and\nbeloved in my power!","But now I remember the evils that I did in Jerusalem, from whence\nalso I took away all the spoils of gold, and of silver, that were in\nit, and I sent to destroy the inhabitants of Juda without cause.","I know, therefore, that for this cause these evils have found me:\nand behold I perish with great grief in a strange land.","Then he called Philip, one of his friends, and he made him regent\nover all his kingdom.","And he gave him the crown, and his robe, and his ring, that he\nshould go to Antiochus, his son, and should bring him up for the\nkingdom.","So king Antiochus died there in the year one hundred and\nforty-nine.","And Lysias understood that the king was dead, and he set up\nAntiochus, his son, to reign, whom he had brought up young:  and he\ncalled his name Eupator.","Now they that were in the castle, had shut up the Israelites\nround about the holy places:  and they were continually seeking their\nhurt, and to strengthen the Gentiles.","And Judas purposed to destroy them:  and he called together all\nthe people, to besiege them.","And they came together, and besieged them in the year one hundred\nand fifty, and they made battering slings and engines.","And some of the besieged got out:  and some wicked men of Israel\njoined themselves unto them.","And they went to the king, and said:  How long dost thou delay to\nexecute judgment, and to revenge our brethren?","We determined to serve thy father, and to do according to his\norders, and obey his edicts:","And for this they of our nation are alienated from us, and have\nslain as many of us as they could find, and have spoiled our\ninheritances.","Neither have they put forth their hand against us only, but also\nagainst all our borders.","And behold they have approached this day to the castle of\nJerusalem to take it, and they have fortified the strong hold of\nBethsura:","And unless thou speedily prevent them, they will do greater\nthings than these, and thou shalt not be able to subdue them.","Now when the king heard this, he was angry:  and he called\ntogether all his friends, and the captains of his army, and them that\nwere over the horsemen.","There came also to him from other realms, and from the islands of\nthe sea, hired troops.","And the number of his army was an hundred thousand footmen, and\ntwenty thousand horsemen, and thirty-two elephants trained to battle.","And they went through Idumea, and approached to Bethsura, and\nfought many days, and they made engines:  but they sallied forth, and\nburnt them with fire, and fought manfully.","And Judas departed from the castle, and removed the camp to\nBethzacharam, over against the king's camp.","And the king rose before it was light, and made his troops march\non fiercely towards the way of Bethzacharam:  and the armies made\nthemselves ready for the battle, and they sounded the trumpets:","And they shewed the elephants the blood of grapes, and\nmulberries, to provoke them to fight.","And they distributed the beasts by the legions:  and there stood\nby every elephant a thousand men in coats of mail, and with helmets of\nbrass on their heads:  and five hundred horsemen set in order were\nchosen for every beast.","These before the time wheresoever the beast was they were there:\nand whithersoever it went, they went, and they departed not from it.","And upon the beast, there were strong wooden towers which covered\nevery one of them:  and engines upon them, and upon every one thirty-two\nvaliant men, who fought from above:  and an Indian to rule the beast.","And the rest of the horsemen he placed on this side and on that\nside, at the two wings, with trumpets to stir up the army, and to\nhasten them forward that stood thick together in the legions thereof.","Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold, and of brass,\nthe mountains glittered therewith, and they shone like lamps of fire.","And part of the king's army was distinguished by the high\nmountains, and the other part by the low places:  and they marched on\nwarily and orderly.","And all the inhabitants of the land were moved at the noise of\ntheir multitude, and the marching of the company, and the rattling of\nthe armour, for the army was exceeding great and strong.","And Judas and his army drew near for battle:  and there fell of\nthe king's army six hundred men.","And Eleazar, the son of Saura, saw one of the beasts harnessed\nwith the king's harness:  and it was higher than the other beasts; and\nit seemed to him that the king was on it:","And he exposed himself to deliver his people, and to get himself\nan everlasting name.","And he ran up to it boldly in the midst of the legion, killing on\nthe right hand, and on the left, and they fell by him on this side and\nthat side.","And he went between the feet of the elephant, and put himself\nunder it:  and slew it, and it fell to the ground upon him, and he died\nthere.","Then they seeing the strength of the king and the fierceness of\nhis army, turned away from them.","But the king's army went up against them to Jerusalem:  and the\nking's army pitched their tents against Judea and Mount Sion.","And he made peace with them that were in Bethsura:  and they came\nforth out of the city, because they had no victuals, being shut up\nthere, for it was the year of rest to the land.","And the king took Bethsura:  and he placed there a garrison to\nkeep it.","And he turned his army against the sanctuary for many days:  and\nhe set up there battering slings, and engines, and instruments to cast\nfire, and engines to cast stones and javelins, and pieces to shoot\narrows, and slings.","And they also made engines against their engines, and they fought\nfor many days.","But there were no victuals in the city, because it was the\nseventh year:  and such as had stayed in Judea of them that came from\namong the nations, had eaten the residue of all that which had been\nstored up.","And there remained in the holy places but a few, for the famine\nhad prevailed over them:  and they were dispersed every man to his own\nplace.","Now Lysias heard that Philip; whom king Antiochus while he lived\nhad appointed to bring up his son, Antiochus, and to reign,","Was returned from Persia, and Media, with the army that went with\nhim and that he sought to take upon him the affairs of the kingdom:","Wherefore he made haste to go, and say to the king and to the\ncaptains of the army:  We decay daily, and our provision of victuals is\nsmall, and the place that we lay siege to is strong, and it lieth upon\nus to take order for the affairs of the kingdom.","Now, therefore, let us come to an agreement with these men, and\nmake peace with them and with all their nation.","And let us covenant with them, that they may live according to\ntheir own laws, as before.  For because of our despising their laws,\nthey have been provoked, and have done all these things.","And the proposal was acceptable in the sight of the king, and of\nthe princes:  and he sent to them to make peace:  and they accepted of\nit.","And the king and the princes swore to them:  and they came out of\nthe strong hold.","Then the king entered into Mount Sion, and saw the strength of\nthe place:  and he quickly broke the oath that he had taken, and gave\ncommandment to throw down the wall round about.","And he departed in haste and returned to Antioch, where he found\nPhilip master of the city:  and he fought against him, and took the\ncity."]}
