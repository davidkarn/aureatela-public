{"verses":["And king Antiochus, the son of Demetrius, sent letters from the\nisles of the sea to Simon, the priest, and prince of the nation of the\nJews, and to all the people:","And the contents were these:  King Antiochus to Simon, the high\npriest, and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.","Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of\nour fathers, and my purpose is to challenge the kingdom, and to restore\nit to its former estate; and I have chosen a great army, and have built\nships of war.","And I design to go through the country, that I may take revenge\nof them that have destroyed our country, and that have made many cities\ndesolate in my realm.","Now, therefore, I confirm unto thee all the oblations which all\nthe kings before me remitted to thee, and what other gifts soever they\nremitted to thee:","And I give thee leave to coin thy own money in thy country:","And let Jerusalem be holy and free, and all the armour that hath\nbeen made, and the fortresses which thou hast built, and which thou\nkeepest in thy hands, let them remain to thee.","And all that is due to the king, and what should be the king's\nhereafter, from this present and for ever, is forgiven thee.","And when we shall have recovered our kingdom, we will glorify\nthee, and thy nation, and the temple, with great glory, so that your\nglory shall be made manifest in all the earth.","In the year one hundred and seventy-four, Antiochus entered into\nthe land of his fathers, and all the forces assembled to him, so that\nfew were left with Tryphon.","And king Antiochus pursued after him, and he fled along by the\nsea coast and came to Dora.","For he perceived that evils were gathered together upon him, and\nhis troops had forsaken him.","And Antiochus camped above Dora with a hundred and twenty\nthousand men of war, and eight thousand horsemen:","And he invested the city, and the ships drew near by sea:  and\nthey annoyed the city by land, and by sea, and suffered none to come\nin, or to go out.","And Numenius, and they that had been with him, came from the\ncity of Rome, having letters written to the kings, and countries, the\ncontents whereof were these:","Lucius, the consul of the Romans, to king Ptolemee, greeting.","The ambassadors of the Jews, our friends, came to us, to renew\nthe former friendship and alliance, being sent from Simon, the high\npriest, and the people of the Jews.","And they brought also a shield of gold of a thousand pounds.","It hath seemed good therefore to us, to write to the kings and\ncountries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against them,\ntheir cities, or countries:  and that they should give no aid to them\nthat fight against them.","And it hath seemed good to us to receive the shield of them.","If, therefore, any pestilent men are fled out of their country\nto you, deliver them to Simon, the high priest, that he may punish them\naccording to their law.","These same things were written to king Demetrius, and to\nAttalus, and to Ariarathes, and to Arsaces,","And to all the countries:  and to Lampsacus and to the Spartans,\nand to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria, and Samus, and\nPamphylia, and Lycia, and Alicarnassus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus,\nand Rhodes, and Phaselis, and Gortyna, and Gnidus, and Cyprus, and\nCyrene.","And they wrote a copy thereof to Simon, the high priest, and to\nthe people of the Jews.","But king Antiochus moved his camp to Dora the second time,\nassaulting it continually, and making engines:  and he shut up Tryphon,\nthat he could not go out.","And Simon sent to him two thousand chosen men to aid him, silver\nalso, and gold, and abundance of furniture.","And he would not receive them, but broke all the covenant that\nhe had made with him before, and alienated himself from him.","And he sent to him Athenobius, one of his friends, to treat with\nhim, saying:  You hold Joppe and Gazara, and the castle that is in\nJerusalem, which are cities of my kingdom:","Their borders you have wasted, and you have made great havoc in\nthe land, and have got the dominion of many places in my kingdom.","Now, therefore, deliver up the cities that you have taken, and\nthe tributes of the places whereof you have gotten the dominion without\nthe borders of Judea.","But if not, give me for them five hundred talents of silver, and\nfor the havoc that you have made, and the tributes of the cities, other\nfive hundred talents:  or else we will come and fight against you.","So Athenobius, the king's friend came to Jerusalem, and saw the\nglory of Simon and his magnificence in gold, and silver, and his great\nequipage, and he was astonished, and told him the king's words.","And Simon answered him, and said to him:  We have neither taken\nother men's land, neither do we hold that which is other men's, but the\ninheritance of our fathers, which was for some time unjustly possessed\nby our enemies.","But we having opportunity, claim the inheritance of our fathers.","And as to thy complaints concerning Joppe and Gazara, they did\ngreat harm to the people, and to our country:  yet for these we will\ngive a hundred talents.  And Athenobius answered him not a word.","But returning in a rage to the king, made report to him of these\nwords, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that he had seen, and the\nking was exceeding angry.","And Tryphon fled away by ship to Orthosias.","And the king appointed Cendebeus captain of the sea coast, and\ngave him an army of footmen and horsemen.","And he commanded him to march with his army towards Judea:  and\nhe commanded him to build up Gedor, and to fortify the gates of the\ncity, and to war against the people.  But the king himself pursued after\nTryphon.","And Cendebeus came to Jamnia, and began to provoke the people,\nand to ravage Judea, and to take the people prisoners, and to kill, and\nto build Gedor.","And he placed there horsemen, and an army:  that they might issue\nforth, and make incursions upon the ways of Judea, as the king had\ncommanded him."]}
