{"verses":["In the hundred and fifty-first year, Demetrius, the son of\nSeleucus, departed from the city of Rome, and came up with few men into\na city of the sea coast, and reigned there.","And it came to pass as he entered into the house of the kingdom of\nhis fathers, that the army seized upon Antiochus, and Lysias, to bring\nthem unto him.","And when he knew it, he said:  Let me not see their face.","So the army slew them.  And Demetrius sat upon the throne of his\nkingdom:","And there came to him the wicked and ungodly men of Israel:  and\nAlcimus was at the head of them, who desired to be made high priest.","And they accused the people to the king, saying:  Judas and his\nbrethren have destroyed all thy friends, and he hath driven us out of\nour land.","Now, therefore, send some men whom thou trustest, and let him go,\nand see all the havoc he hath made amongst us, and in the king's lands:\nand let him punish all his friends and their helpers.","Then the king chose Bacchides, one of his friends, that ruled\nbeyond the great river in the kingdom, and was faithful to the king:\nand he sent him,","To see the havoc that Judas had made:  and the wicked Alcimus he\nmade high priest, and commanded him to take revenge upon the children\nof Israel.","And they arose, and came with a great army into the land of Juda:\nand they sent messengers, and spoke to Judas and his brethren with\npeaceable words, deceitfully.","But they gave no heed to their words:  for they saw that they were\ncome with a great army.","Then there assembled to Alcimus and Bacchides a company of the\nscribes, to require things that are just:","And first the Assideans, that were among the children of Israel,\nand they sought peace of them.","For they said:  One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come,\nhe will not deceive us.","And he spoke to them peaceably:  and he swore to them, saying:  We\nwill do you no harm, nor your friends.","And they believed him.  And he took threescore of them, and slew\nthem in one day, according to the word that is written:","The flesh of thy saints, and the blood of them they have shed round\nabout Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.","Then fear and trembling fell upon all the people:  for they said:\nThere is no truth, nor justice among them:  for they have broken the\ncovenant, and the oath which they made.","And Bacchides removed the camp from Jerusalem, and pitched in\nBethzecha:  and he sent, and took many of them that were fled away from\nhim, and some of the people he killed, and threw them into a great pit.","Then he committed the country to Alcimus, and left with him\ntroops to help him.

And he went out in a great rage.","And the priests went in, and stood before the face of the altar\nand the temple:  and weeping, they said:","Thou, O Lord, hast chosen this house for thy name to be called\nupon therein, that it might be a house of prayer and supplication for\nthy people.","Be avenged of this man, and his army, and let them fall by the\nsword:  remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue any\nlonger.","Then Nicanor went out from Jerusalem, and encamped near to\nBethoron:  and an army of Syria joined him.","But Judas pitched in Adarsa with three thousand men:  and Judas\nprayed, and said:","O Lord, when they that were sent by king Sennacherib blasphemed\nthee, an angel went out, and slew of them a hundred and eighty-five\nthousand:","Even so destroy this army in our sight today and let the rest\nknow that he hath spoken ill against thy sanctuary:  and judge thou him\naccording to his wickedness.","And the armies joined battle on the thirteenth day of the month,\nAdar:  and the army of Nicanor was defeated, and he himself was first\nslain in the battle.","And when his army saw that Nicanor was slain they threw away\ntheir weapons, and fled:","And they pursued after them one day's journey from Adazer, even\ntill ye come to Gazara, and they sounded the trumpets after them with\nsignals.","And they went forth out of all the towns of Judea round about,\nand they pushed them with the horns, and they turned again to them, and\nthey were all slain with the sword, and there was not left of them so\nmuch as one.","And they took the spoils of them for a booty, and they cut off\nNicanor's head, and his right hand, which he had proudly stretched out,\nand they brought it, and hung it up over against Jerusalem.","And the people rejoiced exceedingly, and they spent that day with\ngreat joy.","And he ordained that this day should be kept every year, being\nthe thirteenth of the month of Adar","And the land of Juda was quiet for a short time."]}
