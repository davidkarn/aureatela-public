{"verses":["And the king of Egypt gathered together an army, like the sand\nthat lieth upon the sea shore, and many ships:  and he sought to get the\nkingdom of Alexander by deceit, and join it to his own kingdom.","And he went out into Syria with peaceable words and they opened\nto him the cities, and met him:  for king Alexander had ordered them to\ngo forth to meet him, because he was his father in law.","Now when Ptolemee entered into the cities, he put garrisons of\nsoldiers in every city.","And when he came near to Azotns, they shewed him the temple of\nDagon that was burnt with fire, and Azotus, and the suburbs thereof,\nthat were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad, and the\ngraves of them that were slain in the battle, which they had made near\nthe way.","And they told the king that Jonathan had done these things, to\nmake him odious:  but the king held his peace.","And Jonathan came to meet the king at Joppe with glory, and they\nsaluted one another, and they lodged there.","And Jonathan went with the king as far as the river, called\nEleutherus:  and he returned into Jerusalem.","And king Ptolemee got the dominion of the cities by the sea side,\neven to Seleucia, and he devised evil designs against Alexander.","And he sent ambassadors to Demetrius, saying:  Come, let us make a\nleague between us, and I will give thee my daughter whom Alexander\nhath, and thou shalt reign in the kingdom of thy father.","For I repent that I have given him my daughter:  for he hath\nsought to kill me.","And he slandered him, because he coveted his kingdom,","And he took away his daughter, and gave her to Demetrius, and\nalienated himself from Alexander, and his enmities were made manifest.","And Ptolemee entered into Antioch, and set two crowns upon his\nhead, that of Egypt, and that of Asia.","Now king Alexander was in Cilicia at that time:  because they\nthat were in those places had rebelled.","And when Alexander heard of it, he came to give him battle:  and\nking Ptolemee brought forth his army, and met him with a strong power,\nand put him to flight.","And Alexander fled into Arabia, there to be protected:  and king\nPtolemee was exalted.","And Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander's head, and sent it\nto Ptolemee.","And king Ptolemee died the third day after:  and they that were\nin the strong holds were destroyed by them that were within the camp.","And Demetrius reigned in the hundred and sixty-seventh year.","In those days Jonathan gathered together them that were in\nJudea, to take the castle that was in Jerusalem:  and they made many\nengines of war against it.","Then some wicked men that hated their own nation, went away to\nking Demetrius, and told him that Jonathan was besieging the castle.","And when he heard it, he was angry:  and forthwith he came to\nPtolemais, and wrote to Jonathan that he should not besiege the castle,\nbut should come to him in haste, and speak to him.","But when Jonathan heard this, he bade them besiege it still:  and\nhe chose some of the ancients of Israel, and of the priests, and put\nhimself in danger","And he took gold, and silver, and raiment, and many other\npresents, and went to the king to Ptolemais and he found favour in his\nsight.","And certain wicked men of his nation made complaints against\nhim.","And the king treated him as his predecessors had done before:\nand he exalted him in the sight of all his friends.","And he confirmed him in the high priesthood and all the honours\nhe had before, and he made him the chief of his friends.","And Jonathan requested of the king that he would make Judea free\nfrom tribute, and the three governments, and Samaria, and the confines\nthereof:  and he promised him three hundred talents.","And the king consented:  and he wrote letters to Jonathan of all\nthese things, to this effect.","King Demetrius to his brother, Jonathan, and to the nation of\nthe Jews, greeting.","We send you here a copy of the letter which we have written to\nLasthenes, our parent, concerning you, that you might know it.","King Demetrius to Lasthenes, his parent, greetings.","We have determined to do good to the nation of the Jews, who are\nour friends, and keep the things that are just with us, for their good\nwill which they bear towards us.","We have ratified, therefore, unto them all the borders of Judea,\nand the three cities, Apherema, Lydda, and Ramatha, which are added to\nJudea, out of Samaria, and all their confines, to be set apart to all\nthem that sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the payments which the\nking received of

saltpans\nalso, and the crowns that were presented to us.","We give all to them, and nothing hereof shall be revoked from\nthis time forth and for ever.","Now, therefore, see that thou make a copy of these things, and\nlet it be given to Jonathan, and set upon the holy mountain, in a\nconspicuous place.","And king Demetrius, seeing that the land was quiet before him,\nand nothing resisted him, sent away all his forces, every man to his\nown place, except the foreign army, which he had drawn together from\nthe islands of the nations:  so all the troops of his fathers hated him.","Now there was one Tryphon who had been of Alexander's party\nbefore:  who seeing that all the army murmured against Demetrius, went\nto Emalchuel, the Arabian, who brought up Antiochus, the son of\nAlexander:","And he pressed him much to deliver him to him, that he might be\nking in his father's place:  and he told him all that Demetrius had\ndone, and how his soldiers hated him.  And he remained there many days.","And Jonathan sent to king Demetrius, desiring that he would cast\nout them that were in the castle in Jerusalem, and those that were in\nthe strong holds:  because they fought against Israel.","And Demetrius sent to Jonathan, saying:  I will not only do this\nfor thee, and for thy people, but I will greatly honour thee, and thy\nnation, when opportunity shall serve.","Now, therefore, thou shalt do well if thou send me men to help\nme:  for all my army is gone from me.","And Jonathan sent him three thousand valiant men to Antioch:  and\nthey came to the king, and the king was very glad of their coming.","And they that were of the city assembled themselves together, to\nthe number of a hundred and twenty thousand men, and would have killed\nthe king.","And the king fled into the palace:  and they of the city kept the\npassages of the city, and began to fight.","And the king called the Jews to his assistance:  and they came to\nhim all at once, and they all dispersed themselves through the city.","And they slew in that day a hundred thousand men, and they set\nfire to the city, and got many spoils that day, and delivered the king.","And they that were of the city saw that the Jews had got the\ncity as they would:  and they were discouraged in their mind, and cried\nto the king, making supplication, and saying","And they threw down their arms, and made peace, and the Jews\nwere glorified in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that\nwere in his realm, and were renowned throughout the kingdom, and\nreturned to Jerusalem with many spoils.","So king Demetrius sat in the throne of his kingdom:  and the land\nwas quiet before him.","And he falsified all whatsoever he had said, and alienated\nhimself from Jonathan, and did not reward him according to the benefits\nhe had received from him, but gave him great trouble.","And after this Tryphon returned, and with him Antiochus, the\nyoung boy, who was made king, and put on the diadem.","And there assembled unto him all the hands which Demetrius had\nsent away, and they fought against Demetrius who turned his back and\nfled.","And Tryphon took the elephants, and made himself master of\nAntioch.","And young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying:  I confirm thee in\nthe high priesthood, and I appoint thee ruler over the four cities, and\nto be one of the king's friends.","And he sent him vessels of gold for his service, and he gave him\nleave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a\ngolden buckle:","And he made his brother, Simon, governor, from the borders of\nTyre even to the confines of Egypt.","Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the cities beyond\nthe river, and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves to him to\nhelp him, and he came to Ascalon, and they met him honourably out of\nthe city.","And he went from thence to Gaza:  and they that were in Gaza shut\nhim out:  and he besieged it, and burnt all the suburbs round about, and\ntook the spoils.","And the men of Gaza made supplication to Jonathan, and he gave\nthem the right hand:  and he took their sons for hostages, and sent them\nto Jerusalem:  and he went through the country, as far as Damascus.","And Jonathan heard that the generals of Demetrius were come\ntreacherously to Cades, which is in Galilee, with a great army,\npurposing to remove him from the affairs of the kingdom.","And he went against them:  but left his brother, Simon, in the\ncountry.","And Simon encamped against Bethsura, and assaulted it many days,\nand shut them up.","And they desired him to make peace, and he granted it them:  and\nhe cast them out from thence, and took the city, and placed a garrison\nin it.","And Jonathan and his army encamped by the water of Genesar, and\nbefore it was light they were ready in the plain of Asor.","And behold the army of the strangers met him in the plain, and\nthey laid an ambush for him in the mountains:  but he went out against\nthem.","And they that lay in ambush rose out of their places, and joined\nbattle.","And all that were on Jonathan's side fled, and none was left of\nthem, but Mathathias, the son of Absalom, and Judas, the son of Calphi,\nchief captain of the army.","And Jonathan rent his garments, and cast earth upon his head,\nand prayed.","And Jonathan turned again to them to battle, and he put them to\nflight, and they fought.","And they of his part that fled saw this, and they turned again\nto him, and they all with him pursued the enemies, even to Cades, to\ntheir own camp, and they came even thither.","And there fell of the aliens in that day three thousand men:  and\nJonathan returned to Jerusalem."]}
