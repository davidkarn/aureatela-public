{"verses":["Then Gorgias took five thousand men, and a thousand of the best\nhorsemen; and they removed out of the camp by night.","That they might come upon the camp of the Jews and strike them\nsuddenly:  and the men that were of the castle were their guides.","And Judas heard of it, and rose up, he and the valiant men, to\nattack the king's forces that were in Emmaus.","For as yet the army was dispersed from the camp","And Gorgias came by night into the camp of Judas, and found no\nman; and he sought them in the mountains:  for he said:  These men flee\nfrom us.","And when it was day, Judas shewed himself in the plain with three\nthousand men only, who neither had armour nor swords:","And they saw the camp of the Gentiles that it was strong, and the\nmen in breastplates, and the horsemen round about them, and these were\ntrained up to war.","And Judas said to the men that were with him:  Fear ye not their\nmultitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault.","Remember in what manner our fathers were saved in the Red Sea,\nwhen Pharaoh pursued them with a great army.","And now let us cry to heaven, and the Lord will have mercy on us,\nand will remember the covenant of our fathers, and will destroy this\narmy before our face this day:","And all nations shall know that there is one that redeemeth and\ndelivereth Israel.","And the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them coming\nagainst them.","And they went out of the camp to battle, and they that were with\nJudas sounded the trumpet.","And they joined battle:  and the Gentiles were routed, and fled\ninto the plain.","But all the hindmost of them fell by the sword and they pursued\nthem as far as Gezeron, and even to the plains of Idumea, and of\nAzotus, and of Jamnia:  and there fell of them to the number of three\nthousand men.","And Judas returned again with his army that followed him.","And he said to the people:  Be not greedy of the spoils; for there\nis war before us:","And Gorgias and his army are near us in the mountain:  but stand\nye now against our enemies, and overthrow them, and you shall take the\nspoils afterwards with safety.","And as Judas was speaking these words, behold part of them\nappeared, looking forth from the mountain.","And Gorgias saw that his men were put to flight, and that they\nhad set fire to the camp:  for the smoke that was seen declared what was\ndone.","And when they had seen this, they were seized with great fear,\nseeing at the same time Judas and his army in the plain ready to fight.","So they all fled away into the land of the strangers.","And Judas returned to take the spoils of the camp, and they got\nmuch gold, and silver, and blue silk, and purple of the sea, and great\nriches.","And returning home, they sung a hymn, and blessed God in heaven,\nbecause he is good, because his mercy endureth for ever.","So Israel had a great deliverance that day.","And such of the strangers as escaped, went and told Lysias all\nthat had happened.","And when he heard these things, he was amazed and discouraged:\nbecause things had not succeeded in Israel according to his mind, and\nas the king had commanded.","So the year following, Lysias gathered together threescore\nthousand chosen men, and five thousand horsemen, that he might subdue\nthem.","And they came into Judea, and pitched their tents in Bethoron,\nand Judas met them with ten thousand men.","And they saw that the army was strong, and he prayed and said:\nBlessed art thou, O Saviour of Israel, who didst break the violence of\nthe mighty by the hand of thy servant David, and didst deliver up the\ncamp of the strangers into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul, and\nof his armour bearer.","Shut up this army in the hands of thy people Israel, and let them\nbe confounded in their host and their horsemen.","Strike them with fear, and cause the boldness of their strength to\nlanguish, and let them quake at their own destruction.","Cast them down with the sword of them that love thee:  and let all\nthat know thy name praise thee with hymns.","And they joined battle:  and there fell of the army of Lysias five\nthousand men.","And when Lysias saw that his men were put to flight, and how bold\nthe Jews were, and that they were ready either to live, or to die\nmanfully, he went to Antioch, and chose soldiers, that they might come\nagain into Judea with greater numbers.","Then Judas, and his brethren said:  Behold our enemies are\ndiscomfited:  let us go up now to cleanse the holy places, and to repair\nthem.","And all the army assembled together, and they went up into Mount\nSion.","And they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the altar profaned, and\nthe gates burnt, and shrubs growing up in the courts as in a forest, or\non the mountains, and the chambers joining to the temple thrown down.","And they rent their garments, and made great lamentation, and put\nashes on their heads:","And they fell down to the ground on their faces, and they sounded\nwith the trumpets of alarm, and they cried towards heaven.","Then Judas appointed men to fight against them that were in the\ncastle, till they had cleansed the holy places,","And he chose priests without blemish, whose will was set upon the\nlaw of God.","And they cleansed the holy places, and took away the stones that\nhad been defiled into an unclean place.","And he considered about the altar of holocausts that had been\nprofaned, what he should do with it.","And a good counsel came into their minds, to pull it down:  lest\nit should be a reproach to them, because the Gentiles had defiled it;\nso they threw it down.","And they laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple, in a\nconvenient place, till there should come a prophet, and give answer\nconcerning them.","Then they took whole stones, according to the law and built a new\naltar, according to the former:","And they built up the holy places, and the things that were\nwithin the temple:  and they sanctified the temple and the courts.","And they made new holy vessels, and brought in the candlestick,\nand the altar of incense, and the table, into the temple.","And they put incense upon the altar, and lighted up the lamps\nthat were upon the candlestick, and they gave light in the temple.","And they set the loaves upon the table, and hung up the veils,\nand finished all the works that they had begun to make.","And they arose before the morning on the five and twentieth day\nof the ninth month, (which is the month of Casleu) in the hundred and\nforty-eighth year.","And they offered sacrifice, according to the law, upon the new\naltar of holocausts which they had made.","According to the time, and according to the day wherein the\nheathens had defiled it, in the same was it dedicated anew with\ncanticles, and harps, and lutes, and cymbals.","And all the people fell upon their faces, and adored, and blessed\nup to heaven, him that had prospered them.","And they kept the dedication of the altar eight days, and they\noffered holocausts with joy, and sacrifices of salvation, and of\npraise.","And they adorned the front of the temple with crowns of gold, and\nescutcheons, and they renewed the gates, and the chambers, and hanged\ndoors upon them.","And there was exceeding great joy among the people, and the\nreproach of the Gentiles was turned away.","And Judas, and his brethren, and all the church of Israel\ndecreed, that the day of the dedication of the altar should be kept in\nits season from year to year for eight days, from the five and\ntwentieth day of the month of Casleu, with joy and gladness.","They built up also at that time Mount Sion, with high walls, and\nstrong towers round about, lest the Gentiles should at any time come,\nand tread it down, as they did before.","And he placed a garrison there, to keep it, and he fortified it,\nto secure Bethsura, that the people might have a defence against\nIdumea."]}
