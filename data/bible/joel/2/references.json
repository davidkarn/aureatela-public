Many build churches nowadays; their walls and pillars of glowing marble, their ceilings glittering with gold, their altars studded with jewels. Yet to the choice of Christ's ministers no heed is paid, And let no one allege against me the wealth of the temple in Judaea, its table, its lamps, its censers, its dishes, its cups, its spoons,[fn-19-P1949_483737:1363-nf] and the rest of its golden vessels. If these were approved by the Lord it was at a time when the priests had to offer victims and when the blood of sheep was the redemption of sins. They were figures typifying things still future and were \"written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.\"[fn-19-P1950_484091:1364-nf] But now our Lord by His poverty has consecrated the poverty of His house. Let us, therefore, think of His cross and count riches to be but dirt. Why do we admire what Christ calls \"the mammon of unrighteousness\"?[fn-19-P1951_484327:1365-nf] Why do we cherish and love what it is Peter's boast not to possess?[fn-19-P1952_484417:1366-nf] Or if we insist on keeping to the letter and find the mention of gold and wealth so pleasing, let us keep to everything else as well as the gold. Let the bishops of Christ be bound to marry wives, who must be virgins.[fn-19-P1953_484657:1367-nf] Let the best-intentioned priest be deprived of his office if he bear a scar and be disfigured.[fn-19-P1954_484777:1368-nf] Let bodily leprosy be counted worse than spots upon the soul. Let us be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth,[fn-19-P1955_484924:1369-nf] but let us slay no lamb and celebrate no mystic passover, for where there is no temple,[fn-19-P1956_485033:1370-nf] the law forbids these acts. Let us pitch tents in the seventh month[fn-19-P1957_485124:1371-nf] and noise abroad a solemn fast with the sound of a horn.[fn-19-P1958_485211:1372-nf] But if we compare all these things as spiritual with things which are spiritual;[fn-19-P1959_485314:1373-nf] and if we allow with Paul that \"the Law is spiritual\"[fn-19-P1960_485392:1374-nf] and call to mind David's words: \"open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law;\"[fn-19-P1961_485519:1375-nf] and if on these grounds we interpret it as our Lord interprets it-He has explained the Sabbath in this way:[fn-19-P1962_485650:1376-nf] then, rejecting the superstitions of the Jews, we must also reject the gold; or, approving the gold, we must approve the Jews as well. For we must either accept them with the gold or condemn them with it.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"641","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8. Genesis, we shall be told, needs no explanation; its topics are too simple-the birth of the world, the origin of the human race,[fn-20-P2064_512271:1446-nf] the division of the earth,[fn-20-P2065_512316:1447-nf] the confusion of tongues,[fn-20-P2066_512357:1448-nf] and the descent of the Hebrews into Egypt![fn-20-P2067_512416:1449-nf] Exodus, no doubt, is equally plain, containing as it does merely an account of the ten plagues,[fn-20-P2068_512530:1450-nf] the decalogue,[fn-20-P2069_512567:1451-nf] and sundry mysterious and divine precepts! The meaning of Leviticus is of course self-evident, although every sacrifice that it describes, nay more every word that it contains, the description of Aaron's vestments,[fn-20-P2070_512798:1452-nf] and all the regulations connected with the Levites are symbols of things heavenly! The book of Numbers too-are not its very figures,[fn-20-P2071_512949:1453-nf] and Balaam's prophecy,[fn-20-P2072_512990:1454-nf] and the forty-two camping places in the wilderness[fn-20-P2073_513068:1455-nf] so many mysteries? Deuteronomy also, that is the second law or the foreshadowing of the law of the gospel,-does it not, while exhibiting things known before, put old truths in a new light? So far the `five words' of the Pentateuch, with which the apostle boasts his wish to speak in the Church.[fn-20-P2074_513403:1456-nf] Then, as for Job,[fn-20-P2075_513446:1457-nf] that pattern of patience, what mysteries are there not contained in his discourses? Commencing in prose the book soon glides into verse and at the end once more reverts to prose. By the way in which it lays down propositions, assumes postulates, adduces proofs, and draws inferences, it illustrates all the laws of logic. Single words occurring in the book are full of meaning. To say nothing of other topics, it prophesies the resurrection of men's bodies at once with more clearness and with more caution than any one has yet shewn. \"I know,\" Job says, \"that my redeemer liveth, and that at the last day I shall rise again from the earth; and I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. This my hope is stored up in my own bosom.\"[fn-20-P2076_514427:1458-nf] I will pass on to Jesus the son of Nave[fn-20-P2077_514498:1459-nf] -a type of the Lord in name as well as in deed-who crossed over Jordan, subdued hostile kingdoms, divided the land among the conquering people and who, in every city, village, mountain, river, hill-torrent, and boundary which he dealt with, marked out the spiritual realms of the heavenly Jerusalem, that is, of the church.[fn-20-P2078_514923:1460-nf] In the book of Judges every one of the popular leaders is a type. Ruth the Moabitess fulfils the prophecy of Isaiah:-\"Send thou a lamb, O Lord, as ruler of the land from the rock of the wilderness to the mount of the daughter of Zion.\"[fn-20-P2079_515181:1461-nf] Under the figures of Eli's death and the slaying of Saul Samuel shews the abolition of the old law. Again in Zadok and in David he bears witness to the mysteries of the new priesthood and of the new royalty. The third and fourth books of Kings called in Hebrew Malachim give the history of the kingdom of Judah from Solomon to Jeconiah,[fn-20-P2080_515583:1462-nf] and of that of Israel from Jeroboam the son of Nebat to Hoshea who was carried away into Assyria. If you merely regard the narrative, the words are simple enough, but if you look beneath the surface at the hidden meaning of it, you find a description of the small numbers of the church and of the wars which the heretics wage against it. The twelve prophets whose writings are compressed within the narrow limits of a single volume,[fn-20-P2081_516060:1463-nf] have typical meanings far different from their literal ones. Hosea speaks many times of Ephraim, of Samaria, of Joseph, of Jezreel, of a wife of whoredoms and of children of whoredoms,[fn-20-P2082_516313:1464-nf] of an adulteress shut up within the chamber of her husband, sitting for a long time in widowhood and in the garb of mourning, awaiting the time when her husband will return to her.[fn-20-P2083_516514:1465-nf] Joel the son of Pethuel describes the land of the twelve tribes as spoiled and devastated by the palmerworm the canker-worm, the locust, and the blight,[fn-20-P2084_516695:1466-nf] and predicts that after the overthrow of the former people the Holy Spirit shall be poured out upon God's servants and handmaids;[fn-20-P2085_516845:1467-nf] the same spirit, that is, which was to be poured out in the upper chamber at Zion upon the one hundred and twenty believers.[fn-20-P2086_516992:1468-nf] These believers rising by gradual and regular gradations from one to fifteen form the steps to which there is a mystical allusion in the \"psalms of degrees.\"[fn-20-P2087_517183:1469-nf] Amos, although he is only \"an herdman\" from the country, \"a gatherer of sycomore fruit,\"[fn-20-P2088_517386:1470-nf] cannot be explained in a few words. For who can adequately speak of the three transgressions and the four of Damascus, of Gaza, of Tyre, of Idumaea, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, and in the seventh and eighth place of Judah and of Israel? He speaks to the fat kine that are in the mountain of Samaria,[fn-20-P2089_517716:1471-nf] and bears witness that the great house and the little house shall fall.[fn-20-P2090_517809:1472-nf] He sees now the maker of the grasshopper,[fn-20-P2091_517873:1473-nf] now the Lord, standing upon a wall[fn-20-P2092_517930:1474-nf] daubed[fn-20-P2093_517959:1475-nf] or made of adamant,[fn-20-P2094_518004:1476-nf] now a basket of apples[fn-20-P2095_518048:1477-nf] that brings doom to the transgressors, and now a famine upon the earth \"not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\"[fn-20-P2096_518229:1478-nf] Obadiah, whose name means the servant of God, thunders against Edom red with blood and against the creature born of earth.[fn-20-P2097_518376:1479-nf] He smites him with the spear of the spirit because of his continual rivalry with his brother Jacob. Jonah, fairest of doves, whose shipwreck shews in a figure the passion of the Lord, recalls the world to penitence, and while he preaches to Nineveh, announces salvation to all the heathen. Micah the Morasthite a joint heir with Christ[fn-20-P2098_518792:1480-nf] announces the spoiling of the daughter of the robber and lays siege against her, because she has smitten the jawbone of the judge of Israel.[fn-20-P2099_519018:1481-nf] Nahum, the consoler of the world, rebukes \"the bloody city\"[fn-21-P2100_519104:1482-nf] and when it is overthrown cries: -\"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.\"[fn-21-P2101_519247:1483-nf] Habakkuk, like a strong and unyielding wrestler,[fn-21-P2102_519318:1484-nf] stands upon his watch and sets his foot upon the tower[fn-21-P2103_519419:1485-nf] that he may contemplate Christ upon the cross and say \"His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.\"[fn-21-P2104_519677:1486-nf] Zephaniah, that is the bodyguard and knower of the secrets of the Lord,[fn-21-P2105_519784:1487-nf] hears \"a cry from the fishgate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.\"[fn-21-P2106_519938:1488-nf] He proclaims \"howling to the inhabitants of the mortar;[fn-21-P2107_520016:1489-nf] for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.\"[fn-21-P2108_520161:1490-nf] Haggai, that is he who is glad or joyful, who has sown in tears to reap in joy,[fn-21-P2109_520267:1491-nf] is occupied with the rebuilding of the temple. He represents the Lord(the Father, that is) as saying \"Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations and he who is desired[fn-21-P2110_520552:1492-nf] of all nations shall come'[fn-21-P2111_520616:1493-nf] Zechariah, he that is mindful of his Lord,[fn-21-P2112_520692:1494-nf] gives us many prophecies. He sees Jesus,[fn-21-P2113_520776:1495-nf] \"clothed with filthy garments,\"[fn-21-P2114_520847:1496-nf] a stone with seven eyes,[fn-21-P2115_520895:1497-nf] a candle-stick all of gold with lamps as many as the eyes, and two olivetrees on the right side of the bowl[fn-21-P2116_521026:1498-nf] and on the left. After he has described the horses, red, black, white, and grisled,[fn-21-P2117_521145:1499-nf] and the cutting off of the chariot from Ephraim and of the horse from Jerusalem[fn-21-P2118_521249:1500-nf] he goes on to prophesy and predict a king who shall be a poor man and who shall sit \"upon a colt the foal of an ass.\"[fn-21-P2119_521390:1501-nf] Malachi, the last of all the prophets, speaks openly of the rejection of Israel and the calling of the nations. \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles: and in every place incense[fn-21-P2120_521758:1502-nf] is offered unto my name, and a pure offering.\"[fn-21-P2121_521844:1503-nf] As for Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, who can fully understand or adequately explain them? The first of them seems to compose not a prophecy but a gospel. The second speaks of a rod of an almond tree[fn-21-P2122_522089:1504-nf] and of a seething pot with its face toward the north,[fn-21-P2123_522164:1505-nf] and of a leopard which has changed its spots.[fn-21-P2124_522231:1506-nf] He also goes four times through the alphabet in different metres.[fn-21-P2125_522321:1507-nf] The beginning and ending of Ezekiel, the third of the four, are involved in so great obscurity that like the commencement of Genesis they are not studied by the Hebrews until they are thirty years old. Daniel, the fourth and last of the four prophets, having knowledge of the times and being interested in the whole world, in clear language proclaims the stone cut out of the mountain without hands that overthrows all kingdoms.[fn-21-P2126_522852:1508-nf] David, who is our Simonides, Pindar, and Alcaeus, our Horace, our Catullus, and our Serenus all in one, sings of Christ to his lyre; and on a psaltery with ten strings calls him from the lower world to rise again. Solomon, a lover of peace[fn-21-P2127_523114:1509-nf] and of the Lord, corrects morals, teaches nature, unites Christ and the church, and sings a sweet marriage song[fn-21-P2128_523258:1510-nf] to celebrate that holy bridal. Esther, a type of the church, frees her people from danger and, after having slain Haman whose name means iniquity, hands down to posterity a memorable day and a great feast.[fn-21-P2129_523492:1511-nf] The book of things omitted[fn-21-P2130_523569:1512-nf] or epitome of the old dispensation[fn-21-P2131_523683:1513-nf] is of such importance and value that without it any one who should claim to himself a knowledge of the scriptures would make himself a laughing stock in his own eyes. Every name used in it, nay even the conjunction of the words, serves to throw light on narratives passed over in the books of Kings and upon questions suggested by the gospel. Ezra and Nehemiah, that is the Lord's helper and His consoler, are united in a single book. They restore the Temple and build up the walls of the city. In their pages we see the throng of the Israelites returning to their native land, we read of priests and Levites, of Israel proper and of proselytes; and we are even told the several families to which the task of building the walls and towers was assigned. These references convey one meaning upon the surface, but another below it.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1246","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2.

A certain rhetorician of Cappadocia named Asterius having abandoned his art, and professed himself a convert to Christianity, undertook the composition of some treatises, which are still extant, in which he commended the dogmas of Arius; asserting that Christ is the power of God, in the same sense as the locust and the palmer-worm are said by Moses to be the power of God,[fn-5-P523_215241:144-nf] with other similar utterances. Now Asterius was in constant association with the bishops, and especially with those of their number who did not discountenance the Arian doctrine: he also attended their Synods, in the hope of insinuating himself into the bishopric of some city: but he failed to obtain ordination, in consequence of having sacrificed during the persecution.[fn-5-P524_215635:145-nf] Going therefore throughout the cities of Syria, he read in public the books which he had composed. Marcellus being informed of this, and wishing to counteract his influence, in his over-anxiety to confute him, fell into the diametrically opposite error; for he dared to say, as the Samosatene[fn-5-P525_216301:146-nf] had done, that Christ was a mere man. When the bishops then convened at Jerusalem had intelligence of these things, they took no notice of Asterius, because he was not enrolled even in the catalogue of ordained priests; but they insisted that Marcellus, as a priest, should give an account of the book which he had written. Finding that he entertained Paul of Samosata's sentiments, they required him to retract his opinion; and he being thoroughly ashamed of himself, promised to burn his book. But the convention of bishops being hastily dissolved by the emperor's summoning them to Constantinople, the Eusebians on their arrival at that city, again took the case of Marcellus into consideration; and as Marcellus refused to fulfil his promise of burning his untimely book, those present deposed him, and sent Basil into Ancyra in his stead. Moreover Eusebius wrote a refutation of this work in three books, in which he exposed its erroneous doctrine. Marcellus however was afterwards reinstated[fn-5-P526_217782:147-nf] in his bishopric by the Synod at Sardica, on his assurance that his book had been misunderstood, and that on that account he was supposed to favor the Samosatene's views.

For, after His advent, we read, according to Daniel, that the city itself had to be exterminated; and we recognise that so it has befallen. For the Scripture says thus, that \"the city and the holy place are simultaneously exterminated together with the leader,\"[fn-24-P2418_792512:269-nf] -undoubtedly (that Leader) who was to proceed \"from Bethlehem,\" and from the tribe of \"Judah.\" Whence, again, it is manifest that \"the city must simultaneously be exterminated\" at the time when its \"Leader\" had to suffer in it, (as foretold) through the Scriptures of the prophets, who say: \"I have outstretched my hands the whole day unto a People contumacious and gainsaying Me, who walketh in a way not good, but after their own sins.\"[fn-24-P2419_792971:270-nf] And in the Psalms, David says: \"They exterminated my hands and feet: they counted all my bones; they themselves, moreover, contemplated and saw me, and in my thirst slaked me with vinegar.\"[fn-24-P2420_793197:271-nf] These things David did not suffer, so as to seem justly to have spoken of himself; but the Christ who was crucified. Moreover, the \"hands and feet,\" are not \"exterminated,\"[fn-24-P2421_793453:272-nf] except His who is suspended on a \"tree.\" Whence, again, David said that \"the Lord would reign from the tree: \"[fn-24-P2422_793600:273-nf] for elsewhere, too, the prophet predicts the fruit of this \"tree,\" saying \"The earth hath given her blessings,\"[fn-24-P2423_793736:274-nf] -of course that virgin-earth, not yet irrigated with rains, nor fertilized by showers, out of which man was of yore first formed, out of which now Christ through the flesh has been born of a virgin; \"and the tree,\"[fn-24-P2424_794027:275-nf] he says, \"hath brought his fruit,\"[fn-24-P2425_794090:276-nf] -not that \"tree\" in paradise which yielded death to the protoplasts, but the \"tree\" of the passion of Christ, whence life, hanging, was by you not believed![fn-24-P2426_794271:277-nf] For this \"tree\" in a mystery,[fn-24-P2427_794346:278-nf] it was of yore wherewith Moses sweetened the bitter water; whence the People, which was perishing of thirst in the desert, drank and revived;[fn-24-P2428_794507:279-nf] just as we do, who, drawn out from the calamities of the heathendom[fn-24-P2429_794601:280-nf] in which we were tarrying perishing with thirst (that is, deprived of the divine word), drinking, \"by the faith which is on Him,\"[fn-24-P2430_794747:281-nf] the baptismal water of the \"tree\" of the passion of Christ, have revived,-a faith from which Israel has fallen away, (as foretold) through Jeremiah, who says, \"Send, and ask exceedingly whether such things have been done, whether nations will change their gods (and these are not gods!). But My People hath changed their glory: whence no profit shall accrue to them: the heaven turned pale thereat\" (and when did it turn pale? undoubtedly when Christ suffered), \"and shuddered,\" he says, \"most exceedingly; \"[fn-24-P2431_795290:282-nf] and \"the sun grew dark at mid-day: \"[fn-24-P2432_795354:283-nf] (and when did it \"shudder exceedingly\" except at the passion of Christ, when the earth also trembled to her centre, and the veil of the temple was rent, and the tombs were burst asunder?[fn-24-P2433_795585:284-nf] \"because these two evils hath My People done; Me,\" He says, \"they have quite forsaken, the fount of water of life,[fn-24-P2434_795776:285-nf] and they have digged for themselves worn-out tanks, which will not be able to contain water.\" Undoubtedly, by not receiving Christ, the \"fount of water of life,\" they have begun to have \"worn-out tanks,\" that is, synagogues for the use of the \"dispersions of the Gentiles,\"[fn-24-P2435_796339:286-nf] in which the Holy Spirit no longer lingers, as for the time past He was wont to tarry in the temple before the advent of Christ, who is the true temple of God.

It was to give day the privileges of seniority that Scripture put the end of the first day before that of the first night, because night follows day: for, before the creation of light, the world was not in night, but in darkness. It is the opposite of day which was called night, and it did not receive its name until after day. Thus were created the evening and the morning.[fn-21-P2109_617638:37-nf] Scripture means the space of a day and a night, and afterwards no more says day and night, but calls them both under the name of the more important: a custom which you will find throughout Scripture. Everywhere the measure of time is counted by days, without mention of nights. \"The days of our years,\"[fn-21-P2110_618142:38-nf] says the Psalmist. \"Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been,\"[fn-21-P2111_618237:39-nf] said Jacob, and elsewhere \"all the days of my life.\"[fn-21-P2112_618310:40-nf] Thus under the form of history the law is laid down for what is to follow.And the evening and the morning were one day.[fn-21-P2113_618454:41-nf] Why does Scripture say \"one day the first day\"? Before speaking to us of the second, the third, and the fourth days, would it not have been more natural to call that one the first which began the series? If it therefore says \"one day,\" it is from a wish to determine the measure of day and night, and to combine the time that they contain. Now twenty-four hours fill up the space of one day-we mean of a day and of a night; and if, at the time of the solstices, they have not both an equal length, the time marked byScripture does not the less circumscribe their duration. It is as though it said: twenty-four hours measure the space of a day, or that, in reality a day is the time that the heavens starting from one point take to return there. Thus, every time that, in the revolution of the sun, evening and morning occupy the world, their periodical succession never exceeds the space of one day.But must we believe in a mysterious reason for this? God who made the nature of time measured it out and determined it by intervals of days; and, wishing to give it a week as a measure, he ordered the week to revolve from period to period upon itself, to count the movement of time, forming the week of one day revolving seven times upon itself: a proper circle begins and ends with itself. Such is also the character of eternity, to revolve upon itself and to end nowhere. If then the beginning of time is called \"one day\" rather than \"the first day,\" it is because Scripture wishes to establish its relationship with eternity. It was, in reality, fit and natural to call \"one\" the day whose character is to be one wholly separated and isolated from all the others. If Scripturespeaks to us of many ages, saying everywhere, \"age of age, and ages of ages,\" we do not see it enumerate them as first, second, and third. It follows that we are hereby shown not so much limits, ends and succession of ages, as distinctions between various states and modes of action. \"The day of the Lord,\" Scripture says, \"is great and very terrible,\"[fn-21-P2114_620516:42-nf] and elsewhere \"Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you? The day of the Lord is darkness and not light.\"[fn-21-P2115_620671:43-nf] A day of darkness for those who are worthy of darkness. No; this day without evening, without succession and without end is not unknown to Scripture, and it is the day that the Psalmist calls the eighth day, because it is outside this time of weeks.[fn-21-P2116_620938:44-nf] Thus whether you call it day, or whether you call it eternity, you express the same idea. Give this state the name of day; there are not several, but only one. If you call it eternity still it is unique and not manifold. Thus it is in order that you may carry your thoughts forward towards a future life, that Scripture marks by the word \"one\" the day which is the type of eternity, the first fruits of days, the contemporary of light, the holy Lord's day honoured by the Resurrection of our Lord.

And this is why Lazarus after his resurrection is[fn-67-P6787_2144263:176-nf] described as being at the feast with our Lord. We do not deny that fish and other kinds of flesh, if we choose, may be taken as food; but as we prefer virginity to marriage, so do we esteem fasting and spirituality above meats and full-bloodedness. And if Peter[fn-67-P6788_2144548:177-nf] before dinner went to the supper chamber at the sixth hour, a chance fit of hunger does not prejudice fasting. For, if this were so, because our Lord[fn-67-P6789_2144748:178-nf] at the sixth hour sat weary on the well of Samaria and wished to drink, all must of necessity, whether they so desire or not, drink at that time. Possibly it was the Sabbath, or the Lord's day, and he hungered at the sixth hour after two or three days' fasting; for I could never believe that the Apostle, if he had eaten a dinner only one day previous and had been blown out with a great meal, would have been hungry by noon next day. But if he did dine the day previous, and was hungry next day before luncheon, I do not think that a man who was so soon hungry ate until he was satisfied.

When thou seest the naked cover him, and hide not thyself from thine own flesh.\" He did not therefore reject fasting, but showed what He would have it to be: for that bodily hunger is not pleasing to God which is made null and void by strife, and plunder, and lust. If God does not desire fasting, how is it that in[fn-67-P6791_2146086:180-nf] Leviticus He commands the whole people in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, to fast until the evening, and threatens that he who does not afflict his soul shall die and be cut off from his people? How is it that the[fn-67-P6792_2146334:181-nf] graves of lust where the people fell in their devotion to flesh remain even to this day in the wilderness? Do we not read that the stupid people gorged themselves with quails until the wrath of God came upon them? Why was the man of God at whose prophecy the hand of King Jeroboam withered, and who ate contrary to the command of God,[fn-67-P6793_2146738:182-nf] immediately smitten? Strange that the lion which left the ass safe and sound should not spare the prophet just risen from his meal!He who, while he was fasting, had wrought miracles, no sooner ate a meal than he paid the penalty for the gratification. Joel also cries aloud:[fn-67-P6794_2147038:183-nf] \"Sanctify a fast, proclaim a time of healing,\" that it might appear that a fast is sanctified by other works, and that a holy fast avails for the cure of sin. Moreover, just as true virginity is not prejudiced by the counterfeit professions of the virgins of the devil, so neither is true fasting by the periodic fast and perpetual abstinence from certain kinds of food on the part of the worshippers of Isis and Cybele, particularly when a fast from bread is made up for by feasting on flesh. And just as the signs of Moses were imitated by the signs of the Egyptians which were in reality no signs at all, for the rod of Moses swallowed up the rods of the magicians: so when the devil tries to be the rival of God this does not prove that our religion is superstitious, but that we are negligent, since we refuse to do what even men of the world see clearly to be good.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_11_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"17.

For the words preceding also are tainted with the same profanity-\"receiving glory from the Father, not sharing glory with the Father, for the glory of the Almighty God is incommunicable.\" For my own part, even had his words referred to Moses who was glorified in the ministration of the Law,-not even then should I have tolerated such a statement, even if it be conceded that Moses, having no glory from within, appeared completely glorious to the Israelites by the favour bestowed on him from God. For the very glory that was bestowed on the lawgiver was the glory of none other but of God Himself, which glory the Lord in the Gospel bids all to seek, when He blames those who value human glory highly and seek not the glory that cometh from God only[fn-11-P1136_615427:142-nf] . For by the fact that He commanded them to seek the glory that cometh from the only God, He declared the possibility of their obtaining what they sought. How then is the glory of the Almighty incommunicable, if it is even our duty to ask for the glory that cometh from the only God, and if, according to our Lord's word, \"every one that asketh receiveth[fn-11-P1137_615808:143-nf] ?\" But one who says concerning the Brightness of the Father's glory, that He has the glory by having received it, says in effect that the Brightness of the glory is in Itself devoid of glory, and needs, in order to become Himself at last the Lord of some glory, to receive glory from another. How then are we to dispose of the utterances of the Truth,-one which tells us that He shall be seen in the glory of the Father[fn-11-P1138_616252:144-nf] , and another which says, \"All things that the Father hath are Mine[fn-11-P1139_616345:145-nf] \"? To whom ought the hearer to give ear? To him who says, \"He that is, as the Apostle says, the `heir of all things[fn-11-P1140_616485:146-nf] ' that are in the Father, is without part or lot in His Father's glory\"; or to Him Who declares that all things that the Father hath, He Himself hath also? Now among the \"all things,\" glory surely is included. Yet Eunomius says that the glory of the Almighty is incommunicable. This view Joel does not attest, nor yet the mighty Peter, who adopted, in his speech to the Jews, the language of the prophet. For both the prophet and the apostle say, in the person of God,-\"I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh[fn-11-P1141_617017:147-nf] .\" He then Who did not grudge the partaking in His own Spirit to all flesh,-how can it be that He does not impart His own glory to the only-begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, Who has all things that the Father has? Perhaps one should say that Eunomius is here speaking the truth, though not intending it. For the term \"impart\" is strictly used in the case of one who has not his glory from within, whose possession of it is an accession from without, and not part of his own nature: but where one and the same nature is observed in both Persons, He Who is as regards nature all that the Father is believed to be stands in no need of one to impart to Him each several attribute. This it will be well to explain more clearly and precisely. He Who has the Father dwelling in Him in His entirety-what need has He of the Father's glory, when none of the attributes contemplated in the Father is withdrawn from Him?","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_21_viii_on_fasting_in_opposition_to_the_psychics_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"ANF-04","text":"These will be warnings both to people and to bishops, even spiritual ones, in case they may ever have been guilty of incontinence of appetite.

But, more than that, the heathens recognise every form of tapeinofro/nhsij. When the heaven is rigid and the year arid, barefooted processions are enjoined by public proclamation; the magistrates lay aside their purple, reverse the fasces, utter prayer, offer a victim. There are, moreover, some colonies where, besides (these extraordinary solemnities, the inhabitants), by an annual rite, clad in sackcloth and besprent with ashes, present a suppliant importunity to their idols, (while) baths and shops are kept shut till the ninth hour. They have one single fire in public-on the altars; no water even in their platters. There is, I believe, a Ninevitan suspension of business! A Jewish fast, at all events, is universally celebrated; while, neglecting the temples, throughout all the shore, in every open place, they continue long to send prayer up to heaven. And, albeit by the dress and ornamentation of mourning they disgrace the duty, still they do affect a faith in abstinence, and sigh for the arrival of the long-lingering evening star to sanction (their feeding). But it is enough for me that you, by heaping blasphemies upon our xerophagies, put them on a level with the chastity of an Isis and a Cybele. I admit the comparison in the way of evidence. Hence (our xerophagy) will be proved divine, which the devil, the emulator of things divine, imitates. It is out of truth that falsehood is built; out of religion that superstition is compacted.Hence you are more irreligious, in proportion as a heathen is more conformable. He, in short, sacrifices his appetite to an idol-god; you to (the true) God will not. For to you your belly is god, and your lungs a temple, and your paunch a sacrificial altar, and your cook the priest, and your fragrant smell the Holy Spirit, and your condiments spiritual gifts, and your belching prophecy.","title":"VIII.

What is \"The abyss uttered its voice?\" Is it not that the depth of the human heart expressed what it perceived? The words, \"The depth of its phantasy,\" are an explanation of the previous verse, for the depth is the abyss; and \"Uttered its voice\" is to be understood before them, that is, as we have said, it expressed what it perceived. Now the phantasy is the vision, which it did not hold or conceal, but poured forth in confession. \"The sun was raised up, and the moon stood still in her course;\" that is, Christ ascended into heaven, and the Church was established under her King. \"Thy darts shall go in the light;\" that is, Thy words shall not be sent in secret, but openly.

For when many people are troubled, he saw the threatening tribulation of the Church, and at once acknowledged himself a member of it, and said, \"I shall rest in the day of tribulation,\" as being one of those Who are rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation.[fn-34-P3453_1873667:50-nf] \"That I may ascend,\" he says, \"among the people of my pilgrimage,\" departing quite from the wicked people of his carnal kinship, who are not pilgrims in this earth, and do not seek the country above.[fn-34-P3454_1873886:51-nf] \"Although the fig-tree,\" he says, \"shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olive shall lie, and the fields shall yield no meat; the sheep shall be cut off from the meat, and there shall be no oxen in the stalls.\" He sees that nation which was to slay Christ about to lose the abundance of spiritual supplies, which, in prophetic fashion, he has set forth by the figure of earthly plenty. And because that nation was to suffer such wrath of God, because, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, it wished to establish its own,[fn-34-P3455_1874471:52-nf] he immediately says, \"Yet will I rejoice in the Lord; I will joy in God my salvation. The Lord God is my strength, and He will set my feet in completion; He will place me above the heights, that I may conquer in His song,\" to wit, in that song of which something similar is said in the psalm, \"He set my feet upon a rock, and directed my goings, and put in my mouth a new song, a hymn to our God.\"[fn-34-P3456_1874885:53-nf] He therefore conquers in the song of the Lord, who takes pleasure in His praise, not in his own; that \"He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.\"[fn-34-P3457_1875053:54-nf] But some copies have, \"I will joy in God my Jesus,\" which seems to me better than the version of those who, wishing to put it in Latin, have not set down that very name which for us it is dearer and sweeter to name.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_108_letter_liv_to_serapion_concerning_the_death_of_arius_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"3.

For inanimate trees cannot be assembled in council to choose a king, inasmuch as they firmly fixed by deep roots to the earth. But altogether are these things narrated concerning souls which, before the incarnation of Christ, too deeply luxuriating in transgressions, approach to God as suppliants, and ask His mercy, and that they may be governed by His pity and compassion, which Scripture expresses under the figure of the olive, because oil is of great advantage to our bodies, and takes away our fatigues and ailments, and affords light. For all lamp-light increases when nourished by oil. So also the mercies of God entirely dissolve death, and assist the human race, and nourish the light of the heart.[fn-54-P5473_1663182:2-nf] And consider whether the laws, from the first created man until Christ in succession, were not set forth in these words by the Scripture by figments, in opposition to which the devil has deceived the human race. And it has likened the fig-tree to the command given to man in paradise, because, when he was deceived, he covered his nakedness with the leaves of a fig-tree;[fn-54-P5474_1663669:3-nf] and the vine to the precept given to Noah at the time of the deluge, because, when overpowered by wine, he was mocked.[fn-54-P5475_1663804:4-nf] The olive signifies the law given to Moses in the desert, because the prophetic grace, the holy oil, had failed from their inheritance when they broke the law. Lastly, the bramble not inaptly refers to the law which was given to the apostles for the salvation of the world; because by their instruction we have been taught virginity, of which alone the devil has not been able to make a deceptive image. For which cause, also, four Gospels have been given, because God has four times given the Gospel[fn-54-P5476_1664321:5-nf] to the human race, and has instructed them by four laws, the times of which are clearly known by the diversity of the fruits. For the fig-tree, on account of its sweetness and richness, represents the delights of man, which he had in paradise before the fall. Indeed, not rarely, as we shall afterwards show, the Holy Spirit[fn-54-P5477_1664660:6-nf] takes the fruit of the fig-tree as an emblem of goodness. But the vine, on account of the gladness produced by wine, and the joy of those who were saved from wrath and from the deluge, signifies the change produced from fear and anxiety into joy.[fn-54-P5478_1664925:7-nf] Moreover, the olive, on account of the oil which it produces, indicates the compassion of God, who again, after the deluge, bore patiently when men turned aside to ungodliness, so that He gave them the law and manifested Himself to some, and nourished by oil the light of virtue, now almost extinguished.","title":"Discourse X.-Domnina.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_118_discourse_x_domnina_","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"ANF-06","text":"For we find in the Sacred Writings that there are two kinds of fig-trees and vines, \"the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil; \"[fn-54-P5496_1670881:13-nf] \"wine that maketh glad the heart of man.\"[fn-54-P5497_1670942:14-nf] and wine which is the poison of dragons, and the incurable venom of asps.[fn-54-P5498_1671035:15-nf] But from the time when chastity began to rule over men, the fraud was detected and overcome, Christ, the chief of virgins, overturning it.

Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.

These things being thus demonstrated, it is superfluous to touch upon the other points, or to enter upon any discussion relating to them, since the body in which the Word was is not coessential with the Godhead, but was truly born of Mary, while the Word Himself was not, changed into bones and flesh, but came in the flesh. For what John said, `The Word was made flesh[fn-100-P10058_3600290:26-nf] ,' has this meaning, as we may see by a similar passage; for it is written in Paul:`Christ has become a curse for us[fn-100-P10059_3600424:27-nf] .' And just as He has not Himself become a curse, but is said to have done so because He took upon Him the curse on our behalf, so also He has become flesh not by being changed into flesh, but because He assumed on our behalf living flesh, and has become Man. For to say `the Word became flesh,' is equivalent to saying `the Word has become man;' according to what is said in Joel: `I will pour forth of My Spirit upon all flesh[fn-100-P10060_3600871:28-nf] ;' for the promise did not extend to the irrational animals, but is for men, on whose account the Lord is become Man. As then this is the sense of the above text, they all will reasonably condemn themselves who have thought that the flesh derived from Mary existed before her, and that the Word, prior to her, had a human soul, and existed in it always even before His coming. And they too will cease who have said that the Flesh was not accessible to death, but belonged to the immortal Nature. For if it did not die, how could Paul deliver to the Corinthians `that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures[fn-100-P10061_3601510:29-nf] ,' or how did He rise at all if He did not also die? Again, they will blush deeply who have even entertained the possibility of a Tetrad instead of a Triad resulting, if it were said that the Body was derived from Mary. For if (they argue) we say the Body is of one Essence with the Word, the Triad remains a Triad; for then the Word imports no foreign element into it; but if we admit that the Body derived from Mary is human, it follows, since the Body is foreign in Essence, and the Word is in it, that the addition of the Body causes a Tetrad instead of a Triad.","title":"Letter LIX.

He adds: \"Because of the angels.\"[fn-75-P7511_2155827:343-nf] What angels? In other words, whose angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,[fn-75-P7512_2155938:344-nf] there is great propriety in his meaning. It is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty. If, however, the angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is there for them? for not even Marcion's disciples, (to say nothing of his angels, ) have any desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as evil[fn-75-P7513_2156431:345-nf] among \"works of the flesh,\" and that he would have those persons accounted estimable[fn-75-P7514_2156542:346-nf] who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,[fn-75-P7515_2156654:347-nf] we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup[fn-75-P7516_2156753:348-nf] the verity of the Lord's body and blood in opposition to Marcion's phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of \"spiritual gifts,\"[fn-75-P7517_2157084:349-nf] I have to remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower[fn-75-P7518_2157455:350-nf] shall spring up from his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.\" After which he enumerates the special gifts of the same \"The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.[fn-75-P7519_2157733:351-nf] And with the fear of the Lord[fn-75-P7520_2157801:352-nf] shall the Spirit fill Him.\"[fn-75-P7521_2157867:353-nf] In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;[fn-75-P7522_2158291:354-nf] so that you cannot argue from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says, ) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,[fn-75-P7523_2158731:355-nf] rising from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst them. From Judah were taken away \"the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet; \"[fn-75-P7524_2159162:356-nf] that so it might prove true that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-75-P7525_2159266:357-nf] Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: \"He ascended up. on high,\" that is, into heaven; \"He led captivity captive,\" meaning death or slavery of man; \"He gave gifts to the sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7526_2159546:358-nf] that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata. He says specifically \"sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7527_2159690:359-nf] and not men promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children of men truly so called, choice men, apostles. \"For,\" says he, \"I have begotten you through the gospel; \"[fn-75-P7528_2159927:360-nf] and \"Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.\"[fn-75-P7529_2160009:361-nf] Now was absolutely fulfilled that promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.\"[fn-75-P7530_2160310:362-nf] Since, then, the Creator promised the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ has in these last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle says, \"When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son; \"[fn-75-P7531_2160624:363-nf] and again, \"This I say, brethren, that the time is short\"[fn-75-P7532_2160701:364-nf] ), it evidently follows in connection with this prediction of the last days, that this gift of the Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters. Now compare the Spirit's specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised by the prophet Isaiah. \"To one is given,\" says he, \"by the Spirit the word of wisdom; \"this we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be \"the spirit of wisdom.\" \"To another, the word of knowledge; \"this will be \"the (prophet's) spirit of understanding and counsel.\" \"To another, faith by the same Spirit; \"this will be \"the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.\" \"To another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles; \"this will be \"the spirit of might.\" \"To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues; \"this will be \"the spirit of knowledge.\"[fn-75-P7533_2161674:365-nf] See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is possible that they are opposed to our side, even if[fn-75-P7550_2164330:382-nf] the Creator promised them for His Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people. Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong severally[fn-75-P7557_2165747:389-nf] to my God. Here, then, is my frank avowal for any one who cares to require it.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If, owing to the fault of human error, the word God has become a common name (since in the world there are said and believed to be \"gods many\"[fn-76-P7665_2195216:488-nf] ), yet \"the blessed God,\" (who is \"the Father) of our Lord Jesus Christ,\"[fn-76-P7666_2195313:489-nf] will be understood to be no other God than the Creator, who both blessed all things (that He had made), as you find in Genesis,[fn-76-P7667_2195461:490-nf] and is Himself \"blessed by all things,\" as Daniel tells us.[fn-76-P7668_2195540:491-nf] Now, if the title of Father may be claimed for (Marcion's) sterile god, how much more for the Creator? To none other than Him is it suitable, who is also \"the Father of mercies,\"[fn-76-P7669_2195768:492-nf] and (in the prophets) has been described as \"full of compassion, and gracious, and plenteous in mercy.\"[fn-76-P7670_2195892:493-nf] In Jonah you find the signal act of His mercy, which He showed to the praying Ninevites.[fn-76-P7671_2196035:494-nf] How inflexible was He at the tears of Hezekiah![fn-76-P7672_2196104:495-nf] How ready to forgive Ahab, the husband of Jezebel, the blood of Naboth, when he deprecated His anger.[fn-76-P7673_2196231:496-nf] How prompt in pardoning David on his confession of his sin[fn-76-P7674_2196318:497-nf] -preferring, indeed, the sinner's repentance to his death, of course because of His gracious attribute of mercy.[fn-76-P7675_2196454:498-nf] Now, if Marcion's god has exhibited or proclaimed any such thing as this, I will allow him to be \"the Father of mercies.\" Since, however, he ascribes to him this title only from the time he has been revealed, as if he were the father of mercies from the time only when he began to liberate the human race, then we on our side, too,[fn-76-P7676_2196811:499-nf] adopt the same precise date of his alleged revelation; but it is that we may deny him! It is then not competent to him to ascribe any quality to his god, whom indeed he only promulged by the fact of such an ascription; for only if it were previously evident that his god had an existence, could he be permitted to ascribe an attribute to him. The ascribed attribute is only an accident; but accidents[fn-76-P7677_2197234:500-nf] are preceded by the statement of the thing itself of which they are predicated, especially when another claims the attribute which is ascribed to him who has not been previously shown to exist. Our denial of his existence will be all the more peremptory, because of the fact that the attribute which is alleged in proof of it belongs to that God who has been already revealed. Therefore \"the New Testament\" will appertain to none other than Him who promised it-if not \"its letter, yet its spirit; \"[fn-76-P7678_2197775:501-nf] and herein will lie its newness. Indeed, He who had engraved its letter in stones is the same as He who had said of its spirit, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.\"[fn-76-P7679_2197972:502-nf] Even if \"the letter killeth, yet the Spirit giveth life; \"[fn-76-P7680_2198051:503-nf] and both belong to Him who says: \"I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.\"[fn-76-P7681_2198156:504-nf] We have already made good the Creator's claim to this twofold character of judgment and goodness[fn-76-P7682_2198277:505-nf] -\"killing in the letter\" through the law, and \"quickening in the Spirit\" through the Gospel. Now these attributes, however different they be, cannot possibly make two gods; for they have already (in the prevenient dispensation of the Old Testament) been found to meet in One.[fn-76-P7683_2198601:506-nf] He alludes to Moses' veil, covered with which \"his face could not be stedfastly seen by the children of Israel.\"[fn-76-P7684_2198755:507-nf] Since he did this to maintain the superiority of the glory of the New Testament, which is permanent in its glory, over that of the Old, \"which was to be done away,\"[fn-76-P7685_2198946:508-nf] this fact gives support to my belief which exalts the Gospel above the law and you must look well to it that it does not even more than this. For only there is superiority possible where was previously the thing over which superiority can be affirmed. But then he says, \"But their minds were blinded\"[fn-76-P7686_2199272:509-nf] -of the world; certainly not the Creator's mind, but the minds of the people which are in the world.[fn-76-P7687_2199416:510-nf] Of Israel he says, Even unto this day the same veil is upon their heart; \"[fn-76-P7688_2199659:511-nf] showing that the veil which was on the face of Moses was a figure of the veil which is on the heart of the nation still; because even now Moses is not seen by them in heart, just as he was not then seen by them in eye. But what concern has Paul with the veil which still obscures Moses from their view, if the Christ of the Creator, whom Moses predicted, is not yet come? How are the hearts of the Jews represented as still covered and veiled, if the predictions of Moses relating to Christ, in whom it was their duty to believe through him, are as yet unfulfilled? What had the apostle of a strange Christ to complain of, if the Jews failed in understanding the mysterious announcements of their own God, unless the veil which was upon their hearts had reference to that blindness which concealed from their eyes the Christ of Moses? Then, again, the words which follow, But when it shall turn to the Lord, the evil shall be taken away,\"[fn-76-P7689_2200621:512-nf] properly refer to the Jew, over whose gaze Moses' veil is spread, to the effect that, when he is turned to the faith of Christ, he will understand how Moses spoke of Christ. But how shall the veil of the Creator be taken away by the Christ of another god, whose mysteries the Creator could not possibly have veiled-unknown mysteries, as they were of an unknown god? So he says that \"we now with open face\" (meaning the candour of the heart, which in the Jews had been covered with a veil), \"beholding Christ, are changed into the same image, from that glory\" (wherewith Moses was transfigured as by the glory of the Lord) \"to another glory.\"[fn-76-P7690_2201286:513-nf] By thus setting forth the glory which illumined the person of Moses from his interview with God, and the veil which concealed the same from the infirmity of the people, and by superinducing thereupon the revelation and the glory of the Spirit in the person of Christ-\"even as,\" to use his words, \"by the Spirit of the Lord\"[fn-76-P7691_2201633:514-nf] -he testifies that the whole Mosaic system[fn-76-P7692_2201897:515-nf] was a figure of Christ, of whom the Jews indeed were ignorant, but who is known to us Christians. We are quite aware that some passages are open to ambiguity, from the way in which they are read, or else from their punctuation, when there is room for these two causes of ambiguity. The latter method has been adopted by Marcion, by reading the passage which follows, \"in whom the God of this world,\"[fn-76-P7693_2202325:516-nf] as if it described the Creator as the God of this world, in order that he may, by these words, imply that there is another God for the other world. We, however, say that the passage ought to be punctuated with a comma after God, to this effect: \"In whom God hath blinded the eyes of the unbelievers of this world.\"[fn-76-P7694_2202661:517-nf] \"In whom\" means the Jewish unbelievers, from some of whom the gospel is still hidden under Moses' veil. Now it is these whom God had threatened for \"loving Him indeed with the lip, whilst their heart was far from Him,\"[fn-76-P7695_2203650:518-nf] in these angry words: \"Ye shall hear with your ears, and not understand; and see with your eyes, but not perceive; \"[fn-76-P7696_2203789:519-nf] and, \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand; \"[fn-76-P7697_2203881:520-nf] and again, \"I will take away the wisdom of their wise men, and bring to nought[fn-76-P7698_2203987:521-nf] the understanding of their prudent ones.\" But these words, of course, He did not pronounce against them for concealing the gospel of the unknown God. At any rate, if there is a God of this world,[fn-76-P7699_2204217:522-nf] He blinds the heart of the unbelievers of this world, because they have not of their own accord recognised His Christ, who ought to be understood from His Scriptures.[fn-77-P7700_2204457:523-nf] Content with my advantage, I can willingly refrain from noticing to any greater length[fn-77-P7701_2204617:524-nf] this point of ambiguous punctuation, so as not to give my adversary any advantage,[fn-77-P7702_2204753:525-nf] indeed, I might have wholly omitted the discussion. A simpler answer I shall find ready to hand in interpreting \"the god of this world\" of the devil, who once said, as the prophet describes him: \"I will be like the Most High; I will exalt my throne in the clouds.\"[fn-77-P7703_2205190:526-nf] The whole superstition, indeed, of this world has got into his hands,[fn-77-P7704_2205281:527-nf] so that he blinds effectually the hearts of unbelievers, and of none more than the apostate Marcion's. Now he did not observe how much this clause of the sentence made against him: \"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to (give) the light of the knowledge (of His glory) in the face of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7705_2205660:528-nf] Now who was it that said; \"Let there be light? \"[fn-77-P7706_2205730:529-nf] And who was it that said to Christ concerning giving light to the world: \"I have set Thee as a light to the Gentiles\"[fn-77-P7707_2205866:530-nf] -to them, that is, \"who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death? \"[fn-77-P7708_2205989:531-nf] (None else, surely, than He), to whom the Spirit in the Psalm answers, in His foresight of the future, saying, \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, hath been displayed upon us.\"[fn-77-P7709_2206205:532-nf] Now the countenance (or person[fn-77-P7710_2206262:533-nf] ) of the Lord here is Christ. Wherefore the apostle said above: Christ, who is the image of God.\"[fn-77-P7711_2206409:534-nf] Since Christ, then, is the person of the Creator, who said, \"Let there be light,\" it follows that Christ and the apostles, and the gospel, and the veil, and Moses-nay, the whole of the dispensations-belong to the God who is the Creator of this world, according to the testimony of the clause (above adverted to), and certainly not to him who never said, \"Let there be light.\" I here pass over discussion about another epistle, which we hold to have been written to the Ephesians, but the heretics to the Laodiceans. In it he tells[fn-77-P7712_2206961:535-nf] them to remember, that at the time when they were Gentiles they were without Christ, aliens from (the commonwealth of) Israel, without intercourse, without the covenants and any hope of promise, nay, without God, even in his own world,[fn-77-P7713_2207209:536-nf] as the Creator thereof. Since therefore he said, that the Gentiles were without God, whilst their god was the devil, not the Creator, it is clear that he must be understood to be the lord of this world, whom the Gentiles received as their god-not the Creator, of whom they were in ignorance. But how does it happen, that \"the treasure which we have in these earthen vessels of ours\"[fn-77-P7714_2207612:537-nf] should not be regarded as belonging to the God who owns the vessels? Now since God's glory is, that so great a treasure is contained in earthen vessels, and since these earthen vessels are of the Creator's make, it follows that the glory is the Creator's; nay, since these vessels of His smack so much of the excellency of the power of God, that power itself must be His also! Indeed, all these things have been consigned to the said \"earthen vessels\" for the very purpose that His excellence might be manifested forth. Henceforth, then, the rival god will have no claim to the glory, and consequently none to the power. Rather, dishonour and weakness will accrue to him, because the earthen vessels with which he had nothing to do have received all the excellency! Well, then, if it be in these very earthen vessels that he tells us we have to endure so great sufferings,[fn-77-P7715_2208506:538-nf] in which we bear about with us the very dying of God,[fn-77-P7716_2208584:539-nf] (Marcion's) god is really ungrateful and unjust, if he does not mean to restore this same I substance of ours at the resurrection, wherein so much has been endured in loyalty to him, in which Christ's very death is borne about, wherein too the excellency of his power is treasured.[fn-77-P7717_2209030:540-nf] For he gives prominence to the statement, \"That the life also of Christ may be manifested in our body,\"[fn-77-P7718_2209156:541-nf] as a contrast to the preceding, that His death is borne about in our body. Now of what life of Christ does he here speak? Of that which we are now living? Then how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the things which are seen and are temporal, but to those which are not seen and are eternal[fn-77-P7719_2209494:542-nf] -in other words, not to the present, but to the future? But if it be of the future life of Christ that he speaks, intimating that it is to be made manifest in our body,[fn-77-P7720_2209688:543-nf] then he has clearly predicted the resurrection of the flesh.[fn-77-P7721_2209771:544-nf] He says, too, that \"our outward man perishes,\"[fn-77-P7722_2209840:545-nf] not meaning by an eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in reference to which he previously said, \"For which cause we will not faint.\"[fn-77-P7723_2210021:546-nf] Now, when he adds of \"the inward man\" also, that it \"is renewed day by day,\" he demonstrates both issues here-the wasting away of the body by the wear and tear[fn-77-P7724_2210203:547-nf] of its trials, and the renewal of the soul[fn-77-P7725_2210264:548-nf] by its contemplation of the promises.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-03","text":"We have it on the true tradition[fn-79-P7952_2264515:757-nf] of the Church, that this epistle was sent to the Ephesians, not to the Laodiceans. Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new rifle (of Laodicean),[fn-79-P7953_2264695:758-nf] as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,[fn-79-P7954_2264997:759-nf] he declared Him to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted. Now, to what god will most suitably belong all those things which relate to \"that good pleasure, which God hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might recapitulate\" (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word[fn-79-P7955_2265389:760-nf] ) \"all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,\"[fn-79-P7956_2265517:761-nf] but to Him whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following words announce, when the apostle says: \"That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ? \"[fn-79-P7957_2267025:762-nf] Now who could have first trusted-i.e. previously trusted[fn-79-P7958_2267101:763-nf] -in God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say: ) \"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His Holy Spirit of promise.\"[fn-79-P7959_2267644:764-nf] Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,\"[fn-79-P7960_2267778:765-nf] that is, on all nations. Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold. Again, \"the Father of glory\"[fn-79-P7961_2267956:766-nf] is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated as \"the King of Glory\" in the Psalm: \"Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory.\"[fn-79-P7962_2268146:767-nf] From Him also is besought \"the spirit of wisdom,\"[fn-79-P7963_2268217:768-nf] at whose disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.[fn-79-P7964_2268330:769-nf] He likewise will grant \"the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,\"[fn-79-P7965_2268426:770-nf] who has also enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive: \"And who is blind, but my servants? ... yea, the servants of God have become blind.\"[fn-79-P7966_2268640:771-nf] In His gift, too, are \"the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,\"[fn-79-P7967_2268754:772-nf] who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: \"Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.\"[fn-79-P7968_2268904:773-nf] It was He who \"wrought in Christ His mighty power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting all things under His feet\"[fn-79-P7969_2269081:774-nf] -even the same who said: \"Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.\"[fn-79-P7970_2269199:775-nf] For in another passage the Spirit says to the Father concerning the Son: \"Thou hast put all things under His feet.\"[fn-79-P7971_2269333:776-nf] Now, if from all these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced[fn-79-P7972_2269440:777-nf] another god and another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,[fn-79-P7973_2269545:778-nf] we find Him, when he speaks of such as \"were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in the children of disobedience.\"[fn-79-P7974_2269792:779-nf] But Marcion must not here interpret the world as meaning the God of the world.[fn-79-P7975_2269893:780-nf] For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air; for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator[fn-79-P7976_2270363:781-nf] of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that[fn-79-P7977_2270587:782-nf] these designations are unsuited to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable-and the apostle knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up \"children of disobedience\" against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that \"air\" of His; even as the prophet makes him say: \"I will set my throne above the stars; ... I will go up above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.\"[fn-79-P7978_2271057:783-nf] This must mean the devil, whom in another passage (since such will they there have the apostle's meaning to be) we shall recognize in the appellation the god of this world.[fn-79-P7979_2271297:784-nf] For he has filled the whole world with the lying pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,[fn-79-P7980_2271481:785-nf] if he had not existed, we might then possibly have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism; and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), \"in which also we all had our conversation in times past,\"[fn-79-P7981_2271798:786-nf] he must not be understood to indicate that the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator-when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: \"We also were the children of wrath,\" but \"by nature.\"[fn-79-P7982_2272182:787-nf] Let the heretic, however, not contend that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of wrath.[fn-79-P7983_2272335:788-nf] For when (the apostle) says,\" We were by nature the children of wrath,\" inasmuch as the Jews were not the Creator's children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he (must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding this at lasts\" even as others,\"[fn-79-P7984_2272664:789-nf] who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature of all mankind, the devil [however leading that nature astray,[fn-79-P7985_2272897:790-nf] which he has already infected with the implanted germ of sin. \"We,\" says he, \"are His workmanship, created in Christ.\"[fn-79-P7986_2273033:791-nf] It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One. Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He \"made\" him; as touching the work of grace, He \"created\" him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words: \"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand-that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise,[fn-79-P7987_2273717:792-nf] having no hope, and without God in the world.\"[fn-79-P7988_2273817:793-nf] Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely, without Him to whom the commonwealth[fn-79-P7989_2273953:794-nf] of Israel belonged, and the covenants and the promise. \"But now in Christ,\" says he, \"ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh by His blood.\"[fn-79-P7990_2274153:795-nf] From whom were they far off before? From the privileges) whereof he speaks above, even tom the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel, which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise, yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in words like these: \"They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.\"[fn-79-P7991_2275057:796-nf] For the Creator's righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often shown already. Therefore he says: \"He is our peace, who hath made both one\"[fn-79-P7992_2275308:797-nf] -that is, the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that \"the middle wall has been broken down\" of their \"enmity,\" (are made one) \"in His flesh.\"[fn-79-P7993_2275512:798-nf] But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.[fn-79-P7994_2275711:799-nf] And thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the adroitness of a Marrucinian,[fn-79-P7995_2275894:800-nf] for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete[fn-79-P7996_2276098:801-nf] by His own precepts, even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her; \"superfluous also is, \"Thou shalt do no murder,\" when He says, \"Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,\") it is impossible to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.[fn-79-P7997_2276496:802-nf] \"For to create[fn-79-P7998_2276531:803-nf] in Himself of twain,\" for He who had made is also the same who creates (just as we have found it stated above: \"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus\"),[fn-79-P7999_2276788:804-nf] \"one new man, making peace\" (really new, and really man-no phantom-but new, and newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), \"that He might reconcile both unto God\"[fn-80-P8000_2276974:805-nf] (even the God whom both races had offended-both Jew and Gentile), \"in one body,\" says he, \"having in it slain the enmity by the cross.\"[fn-80-P8001_2277133:806-nf] Thus we find from this passage also, that there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. \"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,\" we both obtained \"access to the Father,\" being \"now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God\" (even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), \"built upon the foundation of the apostles\"[fn-80-P8002_2277652:807-nf] -(the apostle added), \"and the prophets; \"these words, however, the heretic erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also. He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the ancient prophets,[fn-80-P8003_2277951:808-nf] since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with (the words of) the prophets. For whence did he learn to call Christ \"the chief corner-stone,\"[fn-80-P8004_2278282:809-nf] but from the figure given him in the Psalm: \"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head (stone) of the corner? \"[fn-80-P8005_2278429:810-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"157","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Joel: \"Blow with the trumpet in Sion; sanctify a fast, and call a healing; assemble the people, sanctify the Church, gather the elders, collect the little ones that suck the breast; let the Bridegroom go forth of His chamber, and the bride out of her closet.\"[fn-83-P8301_2742502:241-nf] Also in Jeremiah: \"And I will take away from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of the joyous, and the voice of the glad; the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.\"[fn-83-P8302_2742737:242-nf] Also in the eighteenth Psalm: \"And he is as a bridegroom going forth from his chamber; he exulted as a giant to run his course. From the height of heaven is his going forth, and his circuit even to the end of it; and there is nothing which is hid from his heat.\"[fn-83-P8303_2743020:243-nf] Also in the Apocalypse: \"Come, I will show thee the new bride, the Lamb's wife. And he took me in the Spirit to a great mountain, and he showed me the holy city Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God.\"[fn-83-P8304_2743274:244-nf] Also in the Gospel according to John: \"Ye are my witnesses, that I said to them who were sent from Jerusalem to me, that I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before Him. For he who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom is he who standeth and heareth him with joy, and rejoiceth because of the voice of the bridegroom.\"[fn-83-P8305_2743647:245-nf] The mystery of this matter was shown in Jesus the son of Nave, when he was bidden to put his shoes from off him, doubt less because he himself was not the bridegroom. For it was in the law, that whoever should refuse marriage should put off his shoe, but that he should be shod who was to be the bridegroom: \"And it happened, when Jesus was in Jericho, he looked around with his eyes, and saw a man standing before his face, and holding a javelin[fn-83-P8306_2744119:246-nf] in his hand, and said, Art thou for us or for our enemies? And he said, I am the leader of the host of the Lord; now draw near. And Jesus fell on his rice to the earth, and said to him, Lord, what dost Thou command unto Thy servant. And the leader of the Lord's host said, Loose thy shoe from thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.\"[fn-83-P8307_2744491:247-nf] Also, in Exodus, Moses is bidden to put off his shoe, because he, too, was not the bridegroom: \"And there appeared unto him the angel of the Lord in a flame of fire out of a bush; and he saw that the bush burned with fire, but the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will pass over and see this great sight, why the bush is not consumed. But when He saw that he drew near to see, the Lord God called him from the bush, saying, Moses, Moses. And he said, What is it? And He said, Draw not nigh hither, unless thou hast loosed thy shoe from off thy feet; for the place on which thou standest is holy ground. And He said unto him, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\"[fn-83-P8308_2745241:248-nf] This was also made plain in the Gospel according to John: \"And John answered them, I indeed baptize with water, but there standeth One in the midst of you whom ye know not: He it is of whom I said, The man that cometh after me is made before me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.\"[fn-83-P8309_2745563:249-nf] Also according to Luke: \"Let your loins be girt, and your lamps burning, and ye like to men that wait for their master when he shall come from the wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him. Blessed are those servants whom their Lord, when He cometh, shall find watching.\"[fn-83-P8310_2745882:250-nf] Also in the Apocalypse: \"The Lord God omnipotent reigneth: let us be glad and rejoice, and let us give to Him the honour of glory; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready.\"[fn-83-P8311_2746114:251-nf] ","title":"Treatise XII.

Let us look also at what follows. What says the most divine evangelist? When the Lord had entered into the temple, the blind and the lame came to Him; and He healed them. And when the chief priests and Pharisees saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,[fn-62-P6206_1909102:51-nf] they brooked not this honour that was paid Him, and therefore they came to Him, and thus spake, Hearest Thou not what these say? As if they said, Art Thou not grieved at hearing from these innocents things which befit God, and God alone? Has not God of old made it manifest by the prophet, \"My glory will I not give unto another; \"[fn-62-P6207_1909457:52-nf] and how dost Thou, being a man, make Thyself God?[fn-62-P6208_1909526:53-nf] But what to this answers the long-suffering One, He who is abundant in mercy,[fn-62-P6209_1909621:54-nf] and slow to wrath?[fn-62-P6210_1909658:55-nf] He bears with these frenzied ones; with an apology He keeps their wrath in check; in His turn He calls the Scriptures to their remembrance; He brings forward testimony to what is done, and shrinks not from inquiry. Wherefore He says, Have ye never heard Me saying by the prophet, Then shall ye know that I am He that doth speak?[fn-62-P6211_1910004:56-nf] nor again, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou perfected praise because of Thine enemies, that Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger? Which without doubt are ye, who give heed unto the law, and read the prophets, while yet ye despise Me who, both by the law and the prophets, have been beforehand proclaimed. Ye think, indeed, under a pretence of piety, to avenge the glory of God, not understanding that he that despiseth Me despiseth My Father also.[fn-62-P6212_1910497:57-nf] I came forth from God, and am come into the world,[fn-62-P6213_1910566:58-nf] and My glory is the glory of My Father also.

And this method of apprehension is undoubtedly suggested to the minds of all by the power of the Holy Spirit.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_38_oration_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"6. Terrible is an unfruitful season, and the loss of the crops. It could not be otherwise, when men are already rejoicing in their hopes, and counting on their all but harvested stores. Terrible again is an unseasonable harvest, when the farmers labour with heavy hearts, sitting as it were beside the grave of their crops, which the gentle rain nourished, but the wild storm has rooted up, whereof the mower filleth not his hand, neither he that bindeth up the sheaves his bosom,[fn-37-P3759_1092387:33-nf] nor have they obtained the blessing which passers-by bestow upon the farmers. Wretched indeed is the sight of the ground devastated, cleared, and shorn of its ornaments, over which the blessed Joel wails in his most tragic picture of the desolation of the land, and the scourge of famine;[fn-37-P3760_1092695:34-nf] while another[fn-37-P3761_1092726:35-nf] prophet wails, as he contrasts with its former beauty its final disorder, and thus discourses on the anger of the Lord when He smites the land: before him is the garden of Eden, behind Him a desolate wilderness.[fn-37-P3762_1093058:36-nf] Terrible indeed these things are, and more than terrible, when we are grieved only at what is present, and are not yet distressed by the feeling of a severer blow: since, as in sickness, the suffering which pains us from time to time is more distressing than that which is not present. But more terrible still are those which the treasures[fn-37-P3763_1093415:37-nf] of God's wrath contain, of which God forbid that you should make trial; nor will you, if you fly for refuge to the mercies of God, and win over by your tears Him Who will have mercy,[fn-37-P3764_1093632:38-nf] and avert by your conversion what remains of His wrath. As yet, this is gentleness and loving-kindness and gentle reproof, and the first elements of a scourge to train our tender years: as yet, the smoke[fn-37-P3765_1093853:39-nf] of His anger, the prelude of His torments; not yet has fallen the flaming fire,[fn-37-P3766_1093952:40-nf] the climax of His being moved; not yet the kindled coals,[fn-37-P3767_1094027:41-nf] the final scourge, part of which He threatened, when He lifted up the other over us, part He held back by force, when He brought the other upon us; using the threat and the blow alike for our instruction, and making a way for His indignation, in the excess of His goodness; beginning with what is slight, so that the more severe may not be needed; but ready to instruct us by what is greater, if He be forced so to do.","title":"Oration XVI.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_38_oration_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"13.

If, then, by being \"washed,\" as says the Prophet[fn-40-P4074_2706395:120-nf] , in that mystic bath we become \"clean\" in our wills and \"put away the evil\" of our souls, we thus become better men, and are changed to a better state. But if, when the bath has been applied to the body, the soul has not cleansed itself from the stains of its passions and affections, but the life after initiation keeps on a level with the uninitiate life, then, though it may be a bold thing to say, yet I will say it and will not shrink; in these cases the water is but water, for the gift of the Holy Ghost in no ways appears in him who is thus baptismally born; whenever, that is, not only the deformity of anger[fn-40-P4075_2707032:121-nf] , or the passion of greed, or the unbridled and unseemly thought, with pride, envy, and arrogance, disfigures the Divine image, but the gains, too, of injustice abide with him, and the woman he has procured by adultery still even after that ministers to his pleasures. If these and the like vices, after, as before, surround the life of the baptized, I cannot see in what respects he has been changed; for I observe him the same man as he was before. The man whom he has unjustly treated, the man whom he has falsely accused, the man whom he has forcibly deprived of his property, these, as far as they are concerned, see no change in him though he has been washed in the laver of baptism. They do not hear the cry of Zacchaeus from him as well: \"If I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore fourfold[fn-40-P4076_2708002:122-nf] .\" What they said of him before his baptism, the same they now more fully declare; they call him by the same names, a covetous person, one who is greedy of what belongs to others, one who lives in luxury at the cost of men's calamities. Let such an one, therefore, who remains in the same moral condition as before, and then babbles to himself of the beneficial change he has received from baptism, listen to what Paul says: \"If a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself[fn-40-P4077_2708532:123-nf] .\" For what you have not become, that you are not. \"As many as received Him,\" thus speaks the Gospel of those who have been born again, \"to them gave He power to become the sons of God[fn-40-P4078_2708736:124-nf] .\" Now the child born of any one is entirely of a kindred nature with his parent. If, then, you have received God, if you have become a child of God, make manifest in your disposition the God that is in you, manifest in yourself Him that begot you. By the same marks whereby we recognize God, must this relationship to God of the son so born be exhibited. \"He openeth His hand and filleth every living thing with His good pleasure.\" \"He passeth over transgressions.\" \"He repenteth Him of the evil.\" \"The Lord is good to all, and bringeth not on us His anger every day.\" \"God is a righteous Lord, and there isno injustice in Him[fn-40-P4079_2709386:125-nf] ;\" and all other sayings of the like kind which are scattered for our instruction throughout the Scripture;-if you live amidst such things as these, you are a child of God indeed; but if you continue with the characteristic marks of vice in you, it is in vain that you babble to yourself of your birth from above.

For that change in our life which takes place through regeneration will not be change, if we continue in the state in which we were. I do not see how it is possible to deem one who is still in the same condition, and in whom there has been no change in the distinguishing features of his nature, to be any other than he was, it being palpable to every one that it is for a renovation and change of our nature that the saving birth is received. And yet human nature does not of itself admit of any change in baptism; neither the reason, nor the understanding, nor the scientific faculty, nor any other peculiar characteristic of man is a subject for change. Indeed the change would be for the worse if any one of these properties of our nature were exchanged away[fn-40-P4073_2705905:119-nf] for something else.

For after Him no prophet has arisen among you. Now, that [you may know that] your prophets, each receiving some one or two powers from God, did and spoke the things which we have learned from the Scriptures, attend to the following remarks of mine. Solomon possessed the spirit of wisdom, Daniel that of understanding and counsel, Moses that of might and piety, Elijah that of fear, and Isaiah that of knowledge; and so with the others: each possessed one power, or one joined alternately with another; also Jeremiah, and the twelve [prophets], and David, and, in short, the rest who existed amongst you.

I have already said, and do again say, that it had been prophesied that this would be done by Him after His ascension to heaven. It is accordingly said,[fn-48-P4831_1052338:348-nf] `He ascended on high, He led captivity captive, He gave gifts unto the sons of men.'

Again I will remind thee, my beloved, also of that which is written.

Moreover the blessed apostle also said:-God\ndivided of the of Christ and sent it into the Prophets.[fn-42-P4274_1418561:98-nf] And Christ was in nothing injured, for it was\nnot by measure that His Father gave unto Him the Spirit.[fn-42-P4275_1418711:99-nf] By this reflection thou canst comprehend that\nChrist dwells in faithful men; yet Christ suffers no loss though He is divided among many. For the\nProphets received of the Spirit of Christ, each one of them as he was able to bear. And of the Spirit\nof Christ again there is poured forth to-day upon all flesh,[fn-42-P4276_1419039:100-nf] and the sons and the daughters prophesy, the old\nmen and the youths, the men-servants and the hand-maids. Something of Christ is in us, yet Christ is\nin heaven at the right hand of His Father. And Christ received the Spirit not by measure, but His\nFather loved Him and delivered all into His hands, and gave Him authority over all His treasure.

These things I have written according to what I have attained to. But if anyone shall\nread these dicourses, and find words that do not agree with his thought, he ought not to scorn them;\nbecause whatsoever is written in these chapters was not written according to the thought of one man,\nnor for the persuasion of one reader; but according to the thought of all the Church, and for the\npersuasion of all faith. If he shall read and hear with persuasion, it is well; and if not, it is\nmeet for me to say that I wrote for those open to persuasion and not for mockers. And if again any\nreader should find words that are spoken by us in one fashion, and by another sage in another\nfashion, let him not be disturbed at this; for every man speaks to his hearers according to what he\ncan attain to. So I, who have written these things, even if some of the words do not agree with what\nother speakers have said, yet say this; that those sages have spoken well, yet it seemed good to me\nto speak thus. And if any man shall speak and demonstrate to me about any matter, I will receive\ninstruction from him without contention. Everyone who reads the sacred scriptures, both former and\nlatter, in both covenants, and reads with persuasion, will learn and teach. But if he strives about\nanything that he does not understand, his mind does not receive teaching. But if he finds words that\nare too difficult for him, and he does not understand their force, let him say thus, \"Whatsoever is\nwritten is written well, but I have not attained to the understanding of it.\" And if he shall ask\nabout the matters that are too hard for him of wise and discerning men who inquire into doctrine,\nthen, when ten wise men shall speak to him in ten different ways about one matter, let him accept\nthat which pleases him; and if any please not him, let him not scorn the sages; for the word of God\nis like a pearl, that has a beautiful appearance on whatever side you turn it. And remember, O\ndisciple, what David said, From all my teachers have I learned.[fn-46-P4683_1582010:45-nf] And the Apostle said:-Thou readest every\nScripture that is in the Spirit of God. And prove everything; hold fast that which is good; and flee\nfrom every evil thing.[fn-46-P4684_1582194:46-nf] For if the days\nof a man should be many as all the days of the world from Adam to the end of the ages, and he should\nsit and meditate upon the Holy Scriptures, he would not comprehend all the force of the depth of the\nwords. And man cannot rise up to the wisdom of God; as I have written in the tenth discourse. But,\nhowever, the words of all speakers who do not take from the great treasure, are accursed and to be\ndespised. For the image of the king (on his coin) is received wher- ever it goes; but (the coin) in\nwhich there is base metal, is rejected and is not received. And if any one should say, \"These\ndiscourses were spoken by such an one;\" let him carefully learn that to be careful to inquire about\nthe speaker is not commanded him. I also according to my insignificance have written these things, a\nman sprung from Adam, and fashioned by the hands of God, a disciple of the Holy Scriptures. For our\nLord said:-Every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and for him that knocketh\nit shall be opened.[fn-46-P4685_1583264:47-nf] And the prophet\nsaid:-I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh in the last days, and they shall\nprophesy.[fn-46-P4686_1583389:48-nf] Therefore whoever shall read\nanything that I have written above, let him read with persuasion, and pray for the author as a\nbrother of the Body; that through the petition of all the Church of God; his sins may be forgiven.\nAnd let whoever reads understand what is written:-Let him that hears the word, communicate to him\nthat causes him to hear, in all good things.[fn-46-P4687_1583773:49-nf] And again it is written, The sower and the\nreaper shall rejoice together.[fn-46-P4688_1583864:50-nf] And\nEvery man according to his labours shall receive his reward.<fl t=s3.v13.a3.w1.b0.f569>\nAnd There is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed to every man. parparpar","title":"Letter of an Inquirer.","author":"Aphrahat"},{"chapter":2,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_50_exhortation_to_the_heathen","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"358","folder":"ANF-02","text":"And again by Isaiah, \"Who shall measure heaven with a span, and the whole earth with his hand? \"[fn-31-P3122_907768:78-nf] Behold God's greatness, and be filled with amazement.

For the former deserved to be accused, because they had contemned the law; and they of the Gentiles who believe deserve to be aided by the defence of the Spirit, because they earnestly desire to attain to the Gospel law. Assuredly in the Spirit there are different kinds of offices, because in the times there is a different order of occasions; and yet, on this account, He who discharges these offices is not different, nor is He another in so acting, but He is one and the same, distributing His offices according to the times, and the occasions and impulses of things. Moreover, the Apostle Paul says, \"Having the same Spirit; as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-104-P10424_3282722:246-nf] He is therefore one and the same Spirit who was in the prophets and apostles, except that in the former He was occasional, in the latter always. But in the former not as being always in them, in the latter as abiding always in them; and in the former distributed with reserve, in the latter all poured out; in the former given sparingly, in the latter liberally bestowed; not yet manifested before the Lord's resurrection, but conferred after the resurrection. For, said He, \"I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Advocate, that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10425_3283345:247-nf] And, \"When He, the Advocate, shall come, whom I shall send unto you from my Father, the Spirit of truth who proceedeth from my Father.\"[fn-104-P10426_3283506:248-nf] And, \"If I go not away, that Advocate shall not come to you; but if I go away, I will send Him to you.\"[fn-104-P10427_3283631:249-nf] And, \"When the Spirit of truth shall come, He will direct you into all the truth.\"[fn-104-P10428_3283735:250-nf] And because the Lord was about to depart to the heavens, He gave the Paraclete out of necessity to the disciples; so as not to leave them in any degree orphans,[fn-104-P10429_3283918:251-nf] which was little desirable, and forsake them without an advocate and some kind of protector. For this is He who strengthened their hearts and minds, who marked out the Gospel sacraments, who was in them the enlightener of divine things; and they being strengthened, feared, for the sake of the Lord's name, neither dungeons nor chains, nay, even trod under foot the very powers of the world and its tortures, since they were henceforth armed and strengthened by the same Spirit, having in themselves the gifts which this same Spirit distributes, and appropriates to the Church, the spouse of Christ, as her ornaments. This is He who places prophets in the Church, instructs teachers, directs tongues, gives powers and healings, does wonderful works, often discrimination of spirits, affords powers of government, suggests counsels, and orders and arranges whatever other gifts there are of charismata; and thus make the Lord's Church everywhere, and in all, perfected and completed. This is He who, after the manner of a dove, when our Lord was baptized, came and abode upon Him, dwelling in Christ full and entire, and not maimed in any measure or portion; but with His whole overflow copiously distributed and sent forth, so that from Him others might receive some enjoyment of His graces: the source of the entire Holy Spirit remaining in Christ, so that from Him might be drawn streams of gifts and works, while the Holy Spirit dwelt affluently in Christ. For truly Isaiah, prophesying this, said: \"And the Spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and piety; and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-104-P10430_3285641:252-nf] This self-same thing also he said in the person of the Lord Himself, in another place, ' \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because He has anointed me, He has sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor.\"[fn-104-P10431_3285866:253-nf] Similarly David: \"Wherefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\"[fn-104-P10432_3285998:254-nf] Of Him the Apostle Paul says: \"For he who hath not the Spirit of Christ is none of His.\"[fn-104-P10433_3286107:255-nf] \"And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"[fn-104-P10434_3286186:256-nf] He it is who effects with water the second birth as a certain seed of divine generation, and a consecration of a heavenly nativity, the pledge of a promised inheritance, and as it were a kind of handwriting of eternal salvation; who can make us God's temple, and fit us for His house; who solicits the divine hearing for us with groanings that cannot be uttered; filling the offices of advocacy, and manifesting the duties of our defence,-an inhabitant given for our bodies and an effector of their holiness. Who, working in us for eternity, can also produce our bodies at the resurrection of immortality, accustoming them to be associated in Himself with heavenly power, and to be allied with the divine eternity of the Holy Spirit.

For the former deserved to be accused, because they had contemned the law; and they of the Gentiles who believe deserve to be aided by the defence of the Spirit, because they earnestly desire to attain to the Gospel law. Assuredly in the Spirit there are different kinds of offices, because in the times there is a different order of occasions; and yet, on this account, He who discharges these offices is not different, nor is He another in so acting, but He is one and the same, distributing His offices according to the times, and the occasions and impulses of things. Moreover, the Apostle Paul says, \"Having the same Spirit; as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-104-P10424_3282722:246-nf] He is therefore one and the same Spirit who was in the prophets and apostles, except that in the former He was occasional, in the latter always.

For bodies which are like each other may be separated and become at distances from each other, as are human sons relatively to their parents (as it is written concerning Adam and Seth, who was begotten of him that he was like him after his own pattern[fn-33-P3390_1341177:158-nf] ); but since the generation of the Son from the Father is not according to the nature of men, and not only like, but also inseparable from the essence of the Father, and He and the Father are one, as He has said Himself, and the Word is ever in the Father and the Father in the Word, as the radiance stands towards the light (for this the phrase itself indicates), therefore the Council, as understanding this, suitably wrote `one in essence,' that they might both defeat the perverseness of the heretics, and shew that the Word was other than originated things. For, after thus writing, they at once added, `But they who say that the Son of God is from nothing, or created, or alterable, or a work, or from other essence, these the Holy Catholic Church anathematizes[fn-33-P3391_1341963:159-nf] .' And by saying this, they shewed clearly that `of the essence,' and `one in essence,' are destructive of those catchwords of irreligion, such as `created,' and `work,' and `originated,' and `alterable,' and `He was not before His generation.' And he who holds these, contradicts the Council; but he who does not hold with Arius, must needs hold and intend the decisions of the Council, suitably regarding them to signify the relation of the radiance to the light, and from thence gaining the illustration of the truth.","title":"De Decretis or Defence of the Nicene Definition","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_14_homily_vi_the_creation_of_luminous_bodies_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"Those who devote themselves to the observation of these bodies find signs in the different phases of the moon, as if the air, by which the earth is enveloped, were obliged to vary to correspond with its change of form.

For when divine judgment is reasoning with men it must speak with the language and feelings of men. For when a doctor for the sake of health with good reason either cuts or cauterizes those who are suffering from the inflammation of ulcers, it is considered an evil by those who have to bear it. Nor are the spur and the whip pleasant to a restive horse. Moreover all chastisement seems at the moment to be a bitter thing to those who are chastised, as the Apostle says: \"Now all chastisement for the present indeed seemeth not to bring with it joy but sorrow; but afterwards it will yield to them that are exercised by it most peaceable fruits of righteousness,\" and \"whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth: for what son is there whom the father doth not correct?\"[fn-42-P4290_1581725:20-nf] And so evils are sometimes wont to stand for afflictions, as where we read: \"And God repented of the evil which He had said that He would do to them and He did it not.\"[fn-42-P4291_1581915:21-nf] And again: \"For Thou, Lord, are gracious and merciful, patient and very merciful and ready to repent of the evil,\"[fn-42-P4292_1582057:22-nf] i.e., of the sufferings and losses which Thou art forced to bring upon us as the reward of our sins. And another prophet, knowing that these are profitable to some men, and certainly not through any jealousy of their safety, but with an eye to their good, prays thus: \"Add evils to them, O Lord, add evils to the haughty ones of the earth;\"[fn-42-P4293_1582423:23-nf] and the Lord Himself says \"Lo, I will bring evils upon them,\"[fn-42-P4294_1582511:24-nf] i.e., sorrows, and losses, with which they shall for the present be chastened for their soul's health, and so shall be at length driven to return and hasten back to Me whom in their prosperity they scorned. And so that these are originally evil we cannot possibly assert: for to many they conduce to their good and offer the occasions of eternal bliss, and therefore (to return to the question raised) all those things, which are thought to be brought upon us as evils by our enemies or by any other people, should not be counted as evils, but as things indifferent. For in the end they will not be what he thinks, who brought them upon us in his rage and fury, but what he makes them who endures them. And so when death has been brought upon a saint, we ought not to think that an evil has happened to him but a thing indifferent; which is an evil to a wicked man, while to the good it is rest and freedom from evils. \"For death is rest to a man whose way is hidden.\"[fn-42-P4295_1583498:25-nf] And so a good man does not suffer any loss from it, because he suffers nothing strange, but by the crime of an enemy he only receives (and not without the reward of eternal life) that which would have happened to him in the course of nature, and pays the debt of man's death, which must be paid by an inevitable law, with the interest of a most fruitful passion, and the recompense of a great reward.","title":"VI.

For now that is clearly shown \"which was not made known to other ages, which is now revealed to the sons of men.\"[fn-76-P7627_2299534:163-nf] For there was always a natural manifestation of the one Almighty God, among all right-thinking men; and the most, who had not quite divested themselves of shame with respect to the truth, apprehended the eternal beneficence in divine providence. In fine, then, Xenocrates the Chalcedonian was not quite without hope that the notion of the Divinity existed even in the irrational creatures. And Democritus, though against his will, will make this avowal by the consequences of his dogmas; for he represents the same images as issuing, from the divine essence, on men and on the irrational animals.[fn-76-P7628_2300151:164-nf] Far from destitute of a divine idea is man, who, it is written in Genesis, partook of inspiration, being endowed with a purer essence than the other animate creatures. Hence the Pythagoreans say that mind comes to man by divine providence, as Plato and Aristotle avow; but we assert that the Holy Spirit inspires him who has believed. The Platonists hold that mind is an effluence of divine dispensation in the soul, and they place the soul in the body. For it is expressly said by Joel, one of the twelve prophets, \"And it shall come to pass after these things, I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.\"[fn-76-P7629_2300834:165-nf] But it is not as a portion of God that the Spirit is in each of us. But how this dispensation takes place, and what the Holy Spirit is, shall be shown by us in the books on prophecy, and in those on the soul.

And what is the character of the arms of this centurion, and for what use in battle they are, hear the blessed Apostle declaring: \"The arms,\" he says \"of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God.\" He tells us their character; viz., that they are not carnal or weak, but spiritual and mighty to God. Then he next suggests in what struggles they are to be used: \"Unto the pulling down of fortifications, purging the thoughts, and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ, and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be first fulfilled.\"[fn-44-P4426_1628570:12-nf] And since though useful, it yet belongs to another time to run through these one by one, I only want you to see the different sorts of these arms and their characteristics, as we also ought always to walk with them girt upon us if we mean to fight the Lord's battles and to serveamong the centurions of the gospel. \"Take,\" he says \"the shield of faith, wherewith ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.\"[fn-44-P4427_1629016:13-nf] Faith then is that which intercepts the flaming darts of lust, and destroys them by the fear of future judgment, and belief in the heavenly kingdom. \"And the breastplate,\" he says, \"of charity.\"[fn-44-P4428_1629229:14-nf] This indeed is that which going round the vital parts of the breast and protecting what is exposed to the deadly wounds of swelling thoughts, keeps off the blows opposed to it, and does not allow the darts of the devil to penetrate to our inner man. For it \"endureth all things, suffereth all things, beareth all things.\"[fn-44-P4429_1629571:15-nf] \"And for an helmet the hope of salvation.\"[fn-44-P4430_1629635:16-nf] The helmet is what protects the head. As then Christ is our head, we ought always in all temptations and persecutions to protect it with the hope of future good things to come, and especially to keep faith in Him whole and undefiled. For it is possible for one who has lost other parts of the body, weak as he may be, still to survive: but even a short time of living is extended to no one without a head. \"And the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.\"[fn-44-P4431_1630117:17-nf] For it is \"sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:\"[fn-44-P4432_1630326:18-nf] as it divides and cuts off whatever carnal and earthly things it may find in us. And whosoever is protected by these arms will ever be defended from the weapons and ravages of his foes, and will not be led away bound in the chains of his spoilers, a captive and a prisoner, to the hostile land of vain thoughts, nor hear the words of the prophet: \"Why art thou grown old in a strange country?\"[fn-44-P4433_1630738:19-nf] But he will stand like a triumphant conqueror in the land of thoughts which he has chosen. Would you understand too the strength and courage of this centurion, by which he bears these arms of which we spoke before as not carnal but mighty to God? Hear of the selection by which the King himself marks and approves brave men when he summons them to the spiritual combat. \"Let,\" says He, \"the weak say that I am strong;\" and: \"Let him who is the sufferer become a warrior.\"[fn-44-P4434_1631231:20-nf] You see then that none but sufferers and weak people can fight the Lord's battles, weak indeed with that weakness, rounded on which that centurion of ours in the gospel said with confidence: \"For when I am weak, then am I strong,\" and again, \"for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-44-P4435_1631546:21-nf] Of which weakness one of the prophets says: \"And he that is weak among them shall be as the house of David.[fn-44-P4436_1631678:22-nf] For the patient sufferer shall fight these wars, with that patience of which it is said \"patience is necessary for you that doing the will of God you may receive the reward.\"[fn-44-P4437_1631872:23-nf] ","title":"VII.

And as to the actual definition of Nicaea, that the Son is coessential with the Father, on account of which they ostensibly oppose the synod, and buzz around everywhere like gnats about the phrase, either they stumble at it from ignorance, like those who stumble at the stone of stumbling that was laid in Sion[fn-78-P7859_3147226:20-nf] ; or else they know, but for that very reason are constantly opposing and murmuring, because it is an accurate declaration and full in the face of their heresy. For it is not the phrases that vex them, but the condemnation of themselves which the definition contains. And of this, once again, they are themselves the cause, even if they wish to conceal the fact of which they are perfectly aware,-But we must now mention it, in order that hence also the accuracy of the great synod may be shewn. For[fn-78-P7860_3147744:21-nf] the assembled bishops wished to put away the impious phrases devised by the Arians, namely `made of nothing,' and that the Son was `a thing made,' and a `creature,' and that `there was a time when He was not,' and that `He is of mutable nature.' And they wished to set down in writing the acknowledged language of Scripture, namely that the Word is of God by nature Only-begotten, Power, Wisdom of the Father, Very God, as John says, and as Paul wrote, brightness of the Father's glory and express image of His person[fn-78-P7861_3148329:22-nf] . But Eusebius and his fellows, drawn on by their own error, kept conferring together as follows: `Let us assent. For we also are of God: for \"there is one God of whom are all things[fn-78-P7862_3148528:23-nf] ,\" and \"old things are passed away, behold all things are made new, but all things are of God[fn-78-P7863_3148643:24-nf] .\"' And they considered what is written in the Shepherd[fn-78-P7864_3148732:25-nf] , `Before all things believe that God is one, who created and set all things in order, and made them to exist out of nothing.' But the Bishops, beholding their craftiness, and the cunning of their impiety, expressed more plainly the sense of the words `of God,' by writing that the Son is of the Essence of God, so that whereas the Creatures, since they do not exist of themselves without a cause, but have a beginning of their existence, are said to be `of God,' the Son alone might be deemed proper to the Essence of the Father. For this is peculiar to one who is Only-begotten and true Word in relation to a Father, and this was the reason why the words `of the essence' were adopted. Again[fn-78-P7865_3149446:26-nf] , upon the bishops asking the dissembling minority if they agreed that the Son was not a Creature, but the Power and only Wisdom of the Father, and the Eternal Image, in all respects exact, of the Father, and true God, Eusebius and his fellows were observed exchanging nods with one another, as much as to say `this applies to us men also, for we too are called \"the image and glory of God[fn-78-P7866_3149869:27-nf] ,\" and of us it is said, \"For we which live are alway[fn-78-P7867_3149942:28-nf] ,\" and there are many Powers, and \"all the power[fn-78-P7868_3150046:29-nf] of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt,\" while the caterpillar and the locust are called His \"great power[fn-78-P7869_3150182:30-nf] .\" And \"the Lord of powers[fn-78-P7870_3150227:31-nf] is with us, the God of Jacob is our help.\" For we hold that we are proper[fn-78-P7871_3150329:32-nf] to God, and not merely so, but insomuch that He has even called us brethren. Nor does it vex us, even if they call the Son Very God. For when made He exists in verity.'","title":"To the Bishops of Africa","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":2,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_72_letter_i_for_329_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"4. For since, as I before said, there are divers proclamations, listen, as in a figure, to the prophet blowing the trumpet; and further, having turned to the truth, be ready for the announcement of the trumpet, for he saith, `Blow ye the trumpet in Sion: sanctify a fast[fn-88-P8817_3240320:22-nf] .' This is a warning trumpet, and commands with great earnestness, that when we fast, we should hallow the fast. For not all those who call upon God, hallow God, since there are some who defile Him; yet not Him-that is impossible-but their own mind concerning Him; for He is holy, and has pleasure in the saints[fn-88-P8818_3240650:23-nf] . And therefore the blessed Paul accuses those who dishonour God; `Transgressors of the law dishonour God[fn-88-P8819_3240773:24-nf] .' So then, to make a separation from those who pollute the fast, he saith here, `sanctify a fast.' For many, crowding to the fast, pollute themselves in the thoughts of their hearts, sometimes by doing evil against their brethren, sometimes by daring to defraud. And, to mention nothing else, there are many who exalt themselves above their neighbours, thereby causing great mischief. For the boast of fasting did no good to the Pharisee, although he fasted twice in the week[fn-88-P8820_3241268:25-nf] , only because he exalted himself against the publican. In the same manner the Word blamed the children of Israel on account of such a fast as this, exhorting them by Isaiah the Prophet, and saying, `This is not the fast and the day that I have chosen, that a man should humble his soul; not even if thou shouldest bow down thy neck like a hook, and shouldest strew sackcloth and ashes under thee; neither thus shall ye call the fast acceptable[fn-88-P8821_3241735:26-nf] .' That we may be able to shew what kind of persons we should be when we fast, and of what character the fast should be, listen again to God commanding Moses, and saying, as it is written in Leviticus[fn-88-P8822_3241955:27-nf] , `And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, In the tenth day of this seventh month, there shall be a day of atonement; a convocation, and a holy day shall it be to you; and ye shall humble your souls, and offer whole burnt-offerings unto the Lord.' And afterwards, that the law might be defined on this point, He proceeds to say; `Every soul that shall not humble itself, shall be cut off from the people[fn-88-P8823_3242385:28-nf] .'","title":"Letter I.

But I wonder that some are so obstinate as to think that repentance is not to be granted to the lapsed, or to suppose that pardon is to be denied to the penitent, when it is written, \"Remember whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works,\"[fn-56-P5626_1726275:38-nf] which certainly is said to him who evidently has fallen, and whom the Lord exhorts to rise up again by his works, because it is written, \"Alms do deliver from death,\"[fn-56-P5627_1726460:39-nf] and not, assuredly, from that death which once the blood of Christ extinguished, and from which the saving grace of baptism and of our Redeemer has delivered us, but from that which subsequently creeps in through sins. Moreover, in another place time is granted for repentance; and the Lord threatens him that does not repent: \"I have,\" saith He, \"many things against thee, because thou sufferest thy wife Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols; and I gave her a space to repent, and she will not repent of her fornication. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds; \"[fn-56-P5628_1727241:40-nf] whom certainly the Lord would not exhort to repentance, if it were not that He promises mercy to them that repent. And in the Gospel He says, \"I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance.\"[fn-56-P5629_1727561:41-nf] For since it is written, \"God did not make death, neither hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living,\"[fn-56-P5630_1727688:42-nf] assuredly He who wills that none should perish, desires that sinners should repent, and by repentance should return again to life. Thus also He cries by Joel the prophet, and says, \"And now, thus saith the Lord your God, Turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your heart, and not your garments, and return unto the Lord your God; for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth Him of the evil appointed.\"[fn-56-P5631_1728214:43-nf] In the Psalms, also, we read as well the rebuke as the clemency of God, threatening at the same time as He spares, punishing that He may correct; and when He has corrected, preserving. \"I will visit,\" He says, \"their transgressions with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. Nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from them.\"[fn-56-P5632_1728584:44-nf] ","title":"Epistle LI.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_217_sermon_lxxxviii_on_the_fast_of_the_seventh_month_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Of what avail, dearly-beloved, are religious fasts in winning the mercy of God, and in renewing the fortunes of human frailty, we know from the statements of the holy Prophets, who proclaim that justice of God, Whose vengeance the people of Israel had again and again incurred through their iniquities, cannot be appeased save by fasting.
