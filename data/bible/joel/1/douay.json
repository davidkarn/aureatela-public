{"verses":["The word of the Lord, that came to Joel, the son of Phatuel.","Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the\nland:  did this ever happen in your days, or in the days of your\nfathers?","Tell ye of this to your children, and let your children tell their\nchildren, and their children to another generation.","That which the palmerworm hath left, the locust hath eaten:  and\nthat which the locust hath left, the bruchus hath eaten:  and that which\nthe bruchus hath left, the mildew hath destroyed.","Awake, ye that are drunk, and weep, and mourn all ye that take\ndelight; in drinking sweet wine:  for it is cut off from your mouth.","For a nation come up upon my land, strong, and without number:  his\nteeth are like the teeth of a lion:  and his cheek teeth as of a lion's\nwhelp.","He hath laid my vineyard waste, and hath pilled off the bark of my\nfig tree:  he hath stripped it bare, and cast it away; the branches\nthereof are made white.","Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her\nyouth.","Sacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of the Lord:  the\npriests, the Lord's ministers, have mourned:","The country is destroyed, the ground hath mourned:  for the corn\nis wasted, the wine is confounded, the oil hath languished.","The husbandmen are ashamed, the vinedressers have howled for the\nwheat, and for the barley, because the harvest of the field is\nperished.","The vineyard is confounded, and the fig tree hath languished:  the\npomegranate tree, and the palm tree, and the apple tree, and all the\ntrees of the field are withered:  because joy is withdrawn from the\nchildren of men.","Gird yourselves, and lament, O ye priests, howl, ye ministers of\nthe altars:  go in, lie in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God:  because\nsacrifice and libation is cut off from the house of your God.","Sanctify ye a fast, call an assembly, gather together the\nancients, all the inhabitants of the land into the house of your God:\nand cry ye to the Lord:","Ah, ah, ah, for the day:  because the day of the Lord is at hand,\nand it shall come like destruction from the mighty.","Is not your food cut off before your eyes, joy and gladness from\nthe house of our God?","The beasts have rotted in their dung, the barns are destroyed,\nthe storehouses are broken down:  because the corn is confounded.","Why did the beasts groan, why did the herds of cattle low?\nbecause there is no pasture for them:  yea, and the flocks of sheep are\nperished.","To thee, O Lord, will I cry:  because fire hath devoured the\nbeautiful places of the wilderness:  and the flame hath burnt all the\ntrees of the country.","Yea, and the beasts of the field have looked up to thee, as a\ngarden bed that thirsteth after rain, for the springs of waters are\ndried up, and fire hath devoured the beautiful places of the\nwilderness."]}
