Genesis, we shall be told, needs no explanation; its topics are too simple-the birth of the world, the origin of the human race,[fn-20-P2064_512271:1446-nf] the division of the earth,[fn-20-P2065_512316:1447-nf] the confusion of tongues,[fn-20-P2066_512357:1448-nf] and the descent of the Hebrews into Egypt![fn-20-P2067_512416:1449-nf] Exodus, no doubt, is equally plain, containing as it does merely an account of the ten plagues,[fn-20-P2068_512530:1450-nf] the decalogue,[fn-20-P2069_512567:1451-nf] and sundry mysterious and divine precepts! The meaning of Leviticus is of course self-evident, although every sacrifice that it describes, nay more every word that it contains, the description of Aaron's vestments,[fn-20-P2070_512798:1452-nf] and all the regulations connected with the Levites are symbols of things heavenly! The book of Numbers too-are not its very figures,[fn-20-P2071_512949:1453-nf] and Balaam's prophecy,[fn-20-P2072_512990:1454-nf] and the forty-two camping places in the wilderness[fn-20-P2073_513068:1455-nf] so many mysteries? Deuteronomy also, that is the second law or the foreshadowing of the law of the gospel,-does it not, while exhibiting things known before, put old truths in a new light? So far the `five words' of the Pentateuch, with which the apostle boasts his wish to speak in the Church.[fn-20-P2074_513403:1456-nf] Then, as for Job,[fn-20-P2075_513446:1457-nf] that pattern of patience, what mysteries are there not contained in his discourses? Commencing in prose the book soon glides into verse and at the end once more reverts to prose. By the way in which it lays down propositions, assumes postulates, adduces proofs, and draws inferences, it illustrates all the laws of logic. Single words occurring in the book are full of meaning. To say nothing of other topics, it prophesies the resurrection of men's bodies at once with more clearness and with more caution than any one has yet shewn. \"I know,\" Job says, \"that my redeemer liveth, and that at the last day I shall rise again from the earth; and I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh shall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. This my hope is stored up in my own bosom.\"[fn-20-P2076_514427:1458-nf] I will pass on to Jesus the son of Nave[fn-20-P2077_514498:1459-nf] -a type of the Lord in name as well as in deed-who crossed over Jordan, subdued hostile kingdoms, divided the land among the conquering people and who, in every city, village, mountain, river, hill-torrent, and boundary which he dealt with, marked out the spiritual realms of the heavenly Jerusalem, that is, of the church.[fn-20-P2078_514923:1460-nf] In the book of Judges every one of the popular leaders is a type. Ruth the Moabitess fulfils the prophecy of Isaiah:-\"Send thou a lamb, O Lord, as ruler of the land from the rock of the wilderness to the mount of the daughter of Zion.\"[fn-20-P2079_515181:1461-nf] Under the figures of Eli's death and the slaying of Saul Samuel shews the abolition of the old law. Again in Zadok and in David he bears witness to the mysteries of the new priesthood and of the new royalty. The third and fourth books of Kings called in Hebrew Malachim give the history of the kingdom of Judah from Solomon to Jeconiah,[fn-20-P2080_515583:1462-nf] and of that of Israel from Jeroboam the son of Nebat to Hoshea who was carried away into Assyria. If you merely regard the narrative, the words are simple enough, but if you look beneath the surface at the hidden meaning of it, you find a description of the small numbers of the church and of the wars which the heretics wage against it. The twelve prophets whose writings are compressed within the narrow limits of a single volume,[fn-20-P2081_516060:1463-nf] have typical meanings far different from their literal ones. Hosea speaks many times of Ephraim, of Samaria, of Joseph, of Jezreel, of a wife of whoredoms and of children of whoredoms,[fn-20-P2082_516313:1464-nf] of an adulteress shut up within the chamber of her husband, sitting for a long time in widowhood and in the garb of mourning, awaiting the time when her husband will return to her.[fn-20-P2083_516514:1465-nf] Joel the son of Pethuel describes the land of the twelve tribes as spoiled and devastated by the palmerworm the canker-worm, the locust, and the blight,[fn-20-P2084_516695:1466-nf] and predicts that after the overthrow of the former people the Holy Spirit shall be poured out upon God's servants and handmaids;[fn-20-P2085_516845:1467-nf] the same spirit, that is, which was to be poured out in the upper chamber at Zion upon the one hundred and twenty believers.[fn-20-P2086_516992:1468-nf] These believers rising by gradual and regular gradations from one to fifteen form the steps to which there is a mystical allusion in the \"psalms of degrees.\"[fn-20-P2087_517183:1469-nf] Amos, although he is only \"an herdman\" from the country, \"a gatherer of sycomore fruit,\"[fn-20-P2088_517386:1470-nf] cannot be explained in a few words. For who can adequately speak of the three transgressions and the four of Damascus, of Gaza, of Tyre, of Idumaea, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, and in the seventh and eighth place of Judah and of Israel? He speaks to the fat kine that are in the mountain of Samaria,[fn-20-P2089_517716:1471-nf] and bears witness that the great house and the little house shall fall.[fn-20-P2090_517809:1472-nf] He sees now the maker of the grasshopper,[fn-20-P2091_517873:1473-nf] now the Lord, standing upon a wall[fn-20-P2092_517930:1474-nf] daubed[fn-20-P2093_517959:1475-nf] or made of adamant,[fn-20-P2094_518004:1476-nf] now a basket of apples[fn-20-P2095_518048:1477-nf] that brings doom to the transgressors, and now a famine upon the earth \"not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\"[fn-20-P2096_518229:1478-nf] Obadiah, whose name means the servant of God, thunders against Edom red with blood and against the creature born of earth.[fn-20-P2097_518376:1479-nf] He smites him with the spear of the spirit because of his continual rivalry with his brother Jacob. Jonah, fairest of doves, whose shipwreck shews in a figure the passion of the Lord, recalls the world to penitence, and while he preaches to Nineveh, announces salvation to all the heathen. Micah the Morasthite a joint heir with Christ[fn-20-P2098_518792:1480-nf] announces the spoiling of the daughter of the robber and lays siege against her, because she has smitten the jawbone of the judge of Israel.[fn-20-P2099_519018:1481-nf] Nahum, the consoler of the world, rebukes \"the bloody city\"[fn-21-P2100_519104:1482-nf] and when it is overthrown cries: -\"Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.\"[fn-21-P2101_519247:1483-nf] Habakkuk, like a strong and unyielding wrestler,[fn-21-P2102_519318:1484-nf] stands upon his watch and sets his foot upon the tower[fn-21-P2103_519419:1485-nf] that he may contemplate Christ upon the cross and say \"His glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.\"[fn-21-P2104_519677:1486-nf] Zephaniah, that is the bodyguard and knower of the secrets of the Lord,[fn-21-P2105_519784:1487-nf] hears \"a cry from the fishgate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.\"[fn-21-P2106_519938:1488-nf] He proclaims \"howling to the inhabitants of the mortar;[fn-21-P2107_520016:1489-nf] for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.\"[fn-21-P2108_520161:1490-nf] Haggai, that is he who is glad or joyful, who has sown in tears to reap in joy,[fn-21-P2109_520267:1491-nf] is occupied with the rebuilding of the temple. He represents the Lord(the Father, that is) as saying \"Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; and I will shake all nations and he who is desired[fn-21-P2110_520552:1492-nf] of all nations shall come'[fn-21-P2111_520616:1493-nf] Zechariah, he that is mindful of his Lord,[fn-21-P2112_520692:1494-nf] gives us many prophecies. He sees Jesus,[fn-21-P2113_520776:1495-nf] \"clothed with filthy garments,\"[fn-21-P2114_520847:1496-nf] a stone with seven eyes,[fn-21-P2115_520895:1497-nf] a candle-stick all of gold with lamps as many as the eyes, and two olivetrees on the right side of the bowl[fn-21-P2116_521026:1498-nf] and on the left. After he has described the horses, red, black, white, and grisled,[fn-21-P2117_521145:1499-nf] and the cutting off of the chariot from Ephraim and of the horse from Jerusalem[fn-21-P2118_521249:1500-nf] he goes on to prophesy and predict a king who shall be a poor man and who shall sit \"upon a colt the foal of an ass.\"[fn-21-P2119_521390:1501-nf] Malachi, the last of all the prophets, speaks openly of the rejection of Israel and the calling of the nations. \"I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles: and in every place incense[fn-21-P2120_521758:1502-nf] is offered unto my name, and a pure offering.\"[fn-21-P2121_521844:1503-nf] As for Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, who can fully understand or adequately explain them? The first of them seems to compose not a prophecy but a gospel. The second speaks of a rod of an almond tree[fn-21-P2122_522089:1504-nf] and of a seething pot with its face toward the north,[fn-21-P2123_522164:1505-nf] and of a leopard which has changed its spots.[fn-21-P2124_522231:1506-nf] He also goes four times through the alphabet in different metres.[fn-21-P2125_522321:1507-nf] The beginning and ending of Ezekiel, the third of the four, are involved in so great obscurity that like the commencement of Genesis they are not studied by the Hebrews until they are thirty years old. Daniel, the fourth and last of the four prophets, having knowledge of the times and being interested in the whole world, in clear language proclaims the stone cut out of the mountain without hands that overthrows all kingdoms.[fn-21-P2126_522852:1508-nf] David, who is our Simonides, Pindar, and Alcaeus, our Horace, our Catullus, and our Serenus all in one, sings of Christ to his lyre; and on a psaltery with ten strings calls him from the lower world to rise again. Solomon, a lover of peace[fn-21-P2127_523114:1509-nf] and of the Lord, corrects morals, teaches nature, unites Christ and the church, and sings a sweet marriage song[fn-21-P2128_523258:1510-nf] to celebrate that holy bridal. Esther, a type of the church, frees her people from danger and, after having slain Haman whose name means iniquity, hands down to posterity a memorable day and a great feast.[fn-21-P2129_523492:1511-nf] The book of things omitted[fn-21-P2130_523569:1512-nf] or epitome of the old dispensation[fn-21-P2131_523683:1513-nf] is of such importance and value that without it any one who should claim to himself a knowledge of the scriptures would make himself a laughing stock in his own eyes. Every name used in it, nay even the conjunction of the words, serves to throw light on narratives passed over in the books of Kings and upon questions suggested by the gospel. Ezra and Nehemiah, that is the Lord's helper and His consoler, are united in a single book. They restore the Temple and build up the walls of the city. In their pages we see the throng of the Israelites returning to their native land, we read of priests and Levites, of Israel proper and of proselytes; and we are even told the several families to which the task of building the walls and towers was assigned. These references convey one meaning upon the surface, but another below it.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_11_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"17. My opponent has dared to maintain that our Lord was called by the Pharisees a wine-bibber and a glutton: and from the fact of His going to marriage feasts and from His not despising the banquets of sinners, I am to infer His wishes respecting ourselves. That Lord, so you suppose, is a glutton who fasted forty days to hallow Christian fasting;[fn-67-P6779_2142794:168-nf] who calls them blessed that hunger and thirst;[fn-67-P6780_2142863:169-nf] who says that He has food, not that which the disciples surmised, but such as would not perish for ever;[fn-67-P6781_2142991:170-nf] who forbids us to think of the morrow; who, though He is said to have hungered and thirsted, and to have gone frequently to various meals, except in celebrating the mystery whereby He represented His passion, or[fn-67-P6782_2143264:171-nf] in proving the reality of His body is nowhere described as ministering to His appetite;[fn-67-P6783_2143394:172-nf] who tells of purple-clad Dives in hell for his feasting, and says that poor Lazarus for his abstinence was in Abraham's bosom; who, when we fast,[fn-67-P6784_2143566:173-nf] bids us anoint our head and wash our face, that we fast not to gain glory from men, but praise from the Lord; who did indeed[fn-67-P6785_2143731:174-nf] after His resurrection eat part of a broiled fish and of a honey-comb, not to allay hunger and to gratify His palate, but to show the reality of a His own body. For whenever He raised anyone from the dead He[fn-67-P6786_2143957:175-nf] ordered that food should be given him to eat, lest the resurrection should be thought a delusion. And this is why Lazarus after his resurrection is[fn-67-P6787_2144263:176-nf] described as being at the feast with our Lord. We do not deny that fish and other kinds of flesh, if we choose, may be taken as food; but as we prefer virginity to marriage, so do we esteem fasting and spirituality above meats and full-bloodedness. And if Peter[fn-67-P6788_2144548:177-nf] before dinner went to the supper chamber at the sixth hour, a chance fit of hunger does not prejudice fasting. For, if this were so, because our Lord[fn-67-P6789_2144748:178-nf] at the sixth hour sat weary on the well of Samaria and wished to drink, all must of necessity, whether they so desire or not, drink at that time. Possibly it was the Sabbath, or the Lord's day, and he hungered at the sixth hour after two or three days' fasting; for I could never believe that the Apostle, if he had eaten a dinner only one day previous and had been blown out with a great meal, would have been hungry by noon next day. But if he did dine the day previous, and was hungry next day before luncheon, I do not think that a man who was so soon hungry ate until he was satisfied. Again, God by the mouth of Isaiah says what fast He did not choose:[fn-67-P6790_2145430:179-nf] \"In the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and afflict the lowly: ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness. it is not such a fast that I have chosen, saith the Lord.\" What kind He has chosen He thus teaches: \"Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor into thy house. When thou seest the naked cover him, and hide not thyself from thine own flesh.\" He did not therefore reject fasting, but showed what He would have it to be: for that bodily hunger is not pleasing to God which is made null and void by strife, and plunder, and lust. If God does not desire fasting, how is it that in[fn-67-P6791_2146086:180-nf] Leviticus He commands the whole people in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, to fast until the evening, and threatens that he who does not afflict his soul shall die and be cut off from his people? How is it that the[fn-67-P6792_2146334:181-nf] graves of lust where the people fell in their devotion to flesh remain even to this day in the wilderness? Do we not read that the stupid people gorged themselves with quails until the wrath of God came upon them? Why was the man of God at whose prophecy the hand of King Jeroboam withered, and who ate contrary to the command of God,[fn-67-P6793_2146738:182-nf] immediately smitten? Strange that the lion which left the ass safe and sound should not spare the prophet just risen from his meal!He who, while he was fasting, had wrought miracles, no sooner ate a meal than he paid the penalty for the gratification. Joel also cries aloud:[fn-67-P6794_2147038:183-nf] \"Sanctify a fast, proclaim a time of healing,\" that it might appear that a fast is sanctified by other works, and that a holy fast avails for the cure of sin. Moreover, just as true virginity is not prejudiced by the counterfeit professions of the virgins of the devil, so neither is true fasting by the periodic fast and perpetual abstinence from certain kinds of food on the part of the worshippers of Isis and Cybele, particularly when a fast from bread is made up for by feasting on flesh. And just as the signs of Moses were imitated by the signs of the Egyptians which were in reality no signs at all, for the rod of Moses swallowed up the rods of the magicians: so when the devil tries to be the rival of God this does not prove that our religion is superstitious, but that we are negligent, since we refuse to do what even men of the world see clearly to be good.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_11_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"17.

After collecting the forces already enumerated he set out against the Church, as though he were pressing forward to the subjugation of a foreign foe. Then, as is well known, the most shocking deeds were done, and at the bare thought of telling the story, its recollection fills me with anguish. I have shed floods of tears, and I should have long remained thus bitterly affected had I not assuaged my grief by divine meditation. The crowds intruded into the church called Theonas[fn-20-P2085_656717:69-nf] and there instead of holy words were uttered the praises of idols; there where the Holy Scriptures had been read might be heard unseemly clapping of hands with unmanly and indecent utterances; there outrages were offered to the Virgins of Christ which the tongue refuses to utter, for \"it is a shame even to speak of them.\"[fn-20-P2086_657069:70-nf] On only hearing of these wrongs one of the well disposed stopped his ears and prayed that he might rather become deaf than have to listen to their foul language. Would that they had been content to sin in word alone, and had not surpassed the wickedness of word by deed, for insult, however bad it be, can be borne by them in whom dwells Christ's wisdom and His holy lessons. But these same villains, vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,[fn-20-P2087_657529:71-nf] screwed up their noses and poured out, if I may so say, as from a well-head, foul noises through their nostrils, and rent the raiment from Christ's holy virgins, whose conversation gave an exact likeness of saints; they dragged them in triumph, naked as when they were born, through all the town; they made indecent sport of them at their pleasure; their deeds were barbarous and cruel. Did any one in pity interfere and urge to mercy he was dismissed with wounds. Ah! woe is me. Many a virgin underwent brutal violation; many a maid beaten on the head, with clubs lay dumb, and even their bodies were not allowed to be given up for burial, and their grief-stricken parents cannot find their corpses to this day. But why recount woes which seem small when compared with greater? Why linger over these and not hurry on to events more urgent?

Therefore we, the worshippers of the Trinity, the perfect suppliants of the perfect Deity, became a reproach to Thy Beloved, neither daring to bring down to our own level any of the things above us, nor in such wise to rise up against the godless tongues which fought against God, as to make His Majesty a fellow servant with ourselves; but, as is plain, we were delivered up on account of our other sins, and because our conduct had been unworthy of Thy commandments, and we had walked after our own evil mind.

He devoured me, he tore me in pieces, a slight darkness enveloped me,[fn-54-P5471_1826264:22-nf] if I may even in my lamentation keep to the language of Scripture. If the Lord had not helped me,[fn-54-P5472_1826385:23-nf] and righteously delivered him to the hands of the lawless, by casting him off (such are the judgments of God) to the Persians, by whom his blood was righteously shed for his unholy sheddings of blood, since in this case alone justice could not afford even to be longsuffering, my soul had shortly dwelt in the grave.[fn-54-P5473_1826721:24-nf] The second[fn-54-P5474_1826750:25-nf] no more kindly, if he were not even more grievous still, for while he bore the name of Christ, he was a false Christ, and at once a burden and a reproach to the Christians, for, while to obey him was ungodly, to suffer at his hands was inglorious, since they did not even seem to be wronged, nor to gain by their sufferings the glorious title of martyr, inasmuch as the truth was in this case perverted, for while they suffered as Christians, they were supposed to be punished as heretics.

And there is between these two a sort of reciprocal and inseparable union. For just as the crown of the building of all virtues is the perfection of prayer, so unless everything has been united and compacted by this as its crown, it cannot possibly continue strong and stable. For lasting and continual calmness in prayer, of which we are speaking, cannot be secured or consummated without them, so neither can those virtues which lay its foundations be fully gained without persistence in it. And so we shall not be able either to treat properly of the effect of prayer, or in a rapid discourse to penetrate to its main end, which is acquired by labouring at all virtues, unless first all those things which for its sake must be either rejected or secured, are singly enumerated and discussed, and, as the Parable in the gospel teaches,[fn-47-P4796_1740201:3-nf] whatever concerns the building of that spiritual and most lofty tower, is reckoned up and carefully considered beforehand. But yet these things when prepared will be of no use nor allow the lofty height of perfection to be properly placed upon them unless a clearance of all faults be first undertaken, and the decayed and dead rubbish of the passions be dug up, and the strong foundations of simplicity and humility be laid on the solid and (so to speak) living soil of our breast, or rather on that rock of the gospel,[fn-47-P4797_1740736:4-nf] and by being built in this way this tower of spiritual virtues will rise, and be able to stand unmoved, and be raised to the utmost heights of heaven in full assurance of its, stability. For if it rests on such foundations, then though heavy storms of passions break over it, though mighty torrents of persecutions beat against it like a battering ram, though a furious tempest of spiritual foes dash against it and attack it, yet not only will no ruin overtake it, but the onslaught will not injure it even in the slightest degree.","title":"IX.
