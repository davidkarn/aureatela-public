But what can we suppose to have been the reason why it was not found, though sought with the greatest earnestness and labour by so many intellects, and during so many ages, unless it be that philosophers sought for it out of their own limits? And since they traversed and explored all parts, but nowhere found any wisdom, and it must of necessity be somewhere, it is evident that it ought especially to be sought there where the title of folly[fn-11-P1128_505968:6-nf] appears; under the covering of which God hides the treasury of wisdom and truth, lest the secret of His divine work should be exposed to view.[fn-11-P1129_506135:7-nf] Whence I am accustomed to wonder that, when Pythagoras, and after him Plato, inflamed with the love of searching out the truth, had penetrated as far as to the Egyptians, and Magi, and Persians, that they might become acquainted with their religious rites and institutions (for they suspected that wisdom was concerned with religion), they did not approach the Jews only, in whose possession alone it then was, and to whom they might have gone more easily. But I think that they were turned away from them by divine providence, that they might not know the truth, because it was not yet permitted for the religion of the true God and righteousness to become known to men of other nations.[fn-11-P1130_506930:8-nf] For God had determined, as the last time drew near,[fn-11-P1131_507178:9-nf] to send from heaven a great leader,[fn-11-P1132_507299:10-nf] who should reveal to foreign nations that which was taken away from a perfidious[fn-11-P1133_507470:11-nf] and ungrateful people.

In what manner, then, did He beget Him? First of all, divine operations cannot be known or declared[fn-12-P1201_532015:46-nf] by any one; but nevertheless the sacred writings teach us, in which it is laid down[fn-12-P1202_532159:47-nf] that this Son of God is the speech, or even the reason[fn-12-P1203_532231:48-nf] of God, and also that the other angels are spirits[fn-12-P1204_532344:49-nf] of God. For speech is breath sent forth with a voice signifying something. But, however, since breath and speech are sent forth from different parts, inasmuch as breath proceeds from the nostrils, speech from the mouth, the difference between the Son of God and the other angels is great. For they proceeded from God as silent spirits, because they were not created to teach[fn-12-P1205_533135:50-nf] the knowledge of God, but for His service. But though He is Himself also a spirit, yet He proceeded from the mouth of God with voice and sound, as the Word, on this account indeed, because He was about to make use of His voice to the people; that is, because He was about to be a teacher of the knowledge of God, and of the heavenly mystery[fn-12-P1206_533495:51-nf] to be revealed to man: which word also God Himself first spoke, that through Him He might speak to us, and that He might reveal to us the voice and will of God.","title":"Book IV.

For when the things which we say seem to them probable, they consider that we fail in this one point alone, that we confess that there is another God, and that He is mortal. We have already spoken of His mortality: now let us teach concerning His unity. When we speak of God the Father and God the Son, we do not speak of them as different, nor do we separate each: because the Father cannot exist without the Son, nor can the Son be separated from the Father, since the name of Father[fn-16-P1678_679831:392-nf] cannot be given without the Son, nor can the Son be begotten without the Father. Since, therefore, the Father makes the Son, and the Son the Father, they both have one mind, one spirit, one substance; but the former[fn-16-P1679_680114:393-nf] is as it were an overflowing fountain, the latter[fn-16-P1680_680195:394-nf] as a stream flowing forth from it: the former as the sun, the latter as it were a ray[fn-16-P1681_680308:395-nf] extended from the sun. And since He is both faithful to the Most High Father, and beloved by Him, He is not separated from Him; just as the stream is not separated from the fountain, nor the ray from the sun: for the water of the fountain is in the stream, and the light of the sun is in the ray: just as the voice cannot be separated from the mouth, nor the strength or hand from the body. When, therefore, He is also spoken of by the prophets as the hand, and strength, and word of God, there is plainly no separation; for the tongue, which is the minister of speech, and the hand, in which the strength is situated, are inseparable portions of the body.","title":"Book IV.

It is, then, for this reason nowhere written, that the Father is greater than the Holy Spirit, or that the Holy Spirit is less than God the Father, because the creature in which the Holy Spirit was to appear was not taken in the same way as the Son of man was taken, as the form in which the person of the Word of God Himself should be set forth not that He might possess the word of God, as other holy and wise men have possessed it, but \"above His fellows;\"[fn-4-P495_178258:37-nf] not certainly that He possessed the word more than they, so as to be of more surpassing wisdom than the rest were, but that He was the very Word Himself. For the word in the flesh is one thing, and the Word made flesh is another; i.e. the word in man is one thing, the Word that is man is another. For flesh is put for man, where it is said, \"The Word was made flesh;\"[fn-4-P496_178643:38-nf] and again, \"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\"[fn-4-P497_178719:39-nf] For it does not mean flesh without soul and without mind; but \"all flesh,\" is the same as if it were said, every man. The creature, then, in which the Holy Spirit should appear, was not so taken, as that flesh and human form were taken, of the Virgin Mary. For the Spirit did not beatify the dove, or the wind, or the fire, and join them for ever to Himself and to His person in unity and \"fashion.\"[fn-4-P498_179137:40-nf] Nor, again, is the nature of the Holy Spirit mutable and changeable; so that these things were not made of the creature, but He himself was turned and changed first into one and then into another, as water is changed into ice. But these things appeared at the seasons at which they ought to have appeared, the creature serving the Creator, and being changed and converted at the command of Him who remains immutably in Himself, in order to signify and manifest Him in such way as it was fit He should be signified and manifested to mortal men. Accordingly, although that dove is called the Spirit;[fn-4-P499_180250:41-nf] and in speaking of that fire, \"There appeared unto them,\" he says, \"cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance;[fn-5-P500_180480:42-nf] in order to show that the Spirit was manifested by that fire, as by the dove; yet we cannot call the Holy Spirit both God and a dove, or both God and fire, in the same way as we call the Son both God and man; nor as we call the Son the Lamb of God; which not only John the Baptist says, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\"[fn-5-P501_180813:43-nf] but also John the Evangelist sees the Lamb slain in the Apocalypse.[fn-5-P502_180899:44-nf] For that prophetic vision was not shown to bodily eyes through bodily forms, but in the spirit through spiritual images of bodily things. But whosoever saw that dove and that fire, saw them with their eyes. Although it may perhaps be disputed concerning the fire, whether it was seen by the eyes or in the spirit, on account of the form of the sentence. For the text does not say, They saw cloven tongues like fire, but, \"There appeared to them.\" But we are not wont to say with the same meaning, It appeared to me; as we say, I saw. And in those spiritual visions of corporeal images the usual expressions are, both, It appeared to me; and, I saw: but in those things which are shown to the eyes through express corporeal forms, the common expression is not, It appeared to me; but, I saw. There may, therefore, be a question raised respecting that fire, how it was seen; whether within in the spirit as it were outwardly, or really outwardly before the eyes of the flesh. But of that dove, which is said to have descended in a bodily form, no one ever doubted that it was seen by the eyes. Nor, again, as we call the Son a Rock (for it is written, \"And that Rock was Christ\"[fn-5-P503_182093:45-nf] ), can we so call the Spirits dove or fire. For that rock was a thing already created, and after the mode of its action was called by the name of Christ, whom it signified; like the stone placed under Jacob's head, and also anointed, which he took in order to signify the Lord;[fn-5-P504_182390:46-nf] or as Isaac was Christ, when he carried the wood for the sacrifice of himself.[fn-5-P505_182492:47-nf] A particular significative action was added to those already existing things; they did not, as that dove and fire, suddenly come into being in order simply so to signify. The dove and the fire, indeed, seem to me more like that flame which appeared to Moses in the bush,[fn-5-P506_182782:48-nf] or that pillar which the people followed in the wilderness,[fn-5-P507_182860:49-nf] or the thunders and lightnings which came when the Law was given in the mount.[fn-5-P508_182962:50-nf] For the corporeal form of these things came into being for the very purpose, that it might signify something, and then pass away.[fn-5-P509_183110:51-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_09_book_iii_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"22. It is manifest, accordingly, that all those appearances to the fathers, when God was presented to them according to His own dispensation, suitable to the times, were wrought through the creature. And if we cannot discern in what manner He wrought them by ministry of angels, yet we say that they were wrought by angels; but not from our own power of discernment, lest we should seem to any one to be wise beyond our measure, whereas we are wise so as to think soberly, as God hath dealt to us the measure of faith;[fn-7-P768_294015:64-nf] and we believe, and therefore speak.[fn-7-P769_294070:65-nf] For the authority is extant of the divine Scriptures, from which our reason ought not to turn aside; nor by leaving the solid support of the divine utterance, to fall headlong over the precipice of its own surmisings, in matters wherein neither the perceptions of the body rule, nor the clear reason of the truth shines forth. Now, certainly, it is written most clearly in the Epistle to the Hebrews, when the dispensation of the New Testament was to be distinguished from the dispensation of the Old, according to the fitness of ages and of times, that not only those visible things, but also the word itself, was wrought by angels. For it is said thus: \"But to which of the angels said He at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?\"[fn-7-P770_294962:66-nf] Whence it appears that all those things were not only wrought by angels, but wrought also on our account, that is, on account of the people of God, to whom is promised the inheritance of eternal life. As it is written also to the Corinthians, \"Now all these things happened unto them in a figure: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world arecome.\"[fn-7-P771_295363:67-nf] And then, demonstrating by plain consequence that as at that time the word was spoken by the angels, so now by tim Son; \"Therefore,\" he says, \"we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?\" And then, as though you asked, What salvation?-in order to show that he is now speaking of the New Testament, that is, of the word which was spoken not by angels, but by the Lord, he says, \"Which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to His own will.\"[fn-7-P772_296258:68-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_03_introduction","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"No subject illustrates this inconsistency better than that of sin, of which Hilary gives two accounts, the one Eastern and traditional, the other an anticipation of Augustinianism. These are never compared and weighed the one against the other. In the passages where each appears, it is adduced confidently, without any reservation or hint that he is aware of another explanation of the facts of experience. The more usual account is that which is required by Hilary's doctrine of the separate creation of every human soul, which is good, because it is God's immediate work, and has a natural tendency to, and fitness for, perfection. Because God, after Whose image man is made, is free, therefore man also is free; he has absolute liberty, and is under no compulsion to good or to evil[fn-5-P532_378979:348-nf] . The sin which God foresees, as in the case of Esau, He does not forordain[fn-5-P533_379094:349-nf] . Punishment never follows except upon sin actually committed; the elect are they who show themselves worthy of election[fn-5-P534_379234:350-nf] , But the human body has defiled the soul; in fact, Hilary sometimes speaks as though sin were not an act of will but an irresistible pressure exerted by the body on the soul. If we had no body, he says once, we should have no sin; it is a 'body of death' and cannot be pure. This is the spiritual meaning of the ancient law against touching a corpse[fn-5-P535_379623:351-nf] . When the Psalmist laments that his soul cleaveth to the ground, his sorrow is that it is inseparably attached to a body of earth[fn-5-P536_379787:352-nf] ; when Job and Jeremiah cursed the day of their birth, their anger was directed against the necessity of living surrounded by the weaknesses and vices of the flesh, not against the creation of their souls after the image of God[fn-5-P537_380038:353-nf] . Such language, if it stood alone, would convict its author of Manicheanism, but Hilary elsewhere asserts that the desire of the soul goes half-way to meet the invitation of sin[fn-5-P538_380243:354-nf] ., and this latter in his normal teaching. Man has a natural proclivity to evil, an inherited weakness[fn-5-P539_380373:355-nf] which has, as a matter of experience, betrayed all men into actual sin, with the exception of Christ[fn-5-P540_380560:356-nf] . Elsewhere, however, Hilary recognises the possibility, under existing conditions, of a sinless life. For David could make the prayer, 'Take from me the way of iniquity ;' of iniquity itself he was guiltless, and only needed to pray against the tendency inherent in his bodily nature[fn-5-P541_380895:357-nf] . But such a case is altogether exceptional; ordinary men must confide in the thought that God is indulgent, for He knows our infirmity. He is propitiated by the wish to be righteous, and in His judgment the merits of good men outweigh their sins[fn-5-P542_381184:358-nf] . Hence a prevalent tone of hopefulness about the future state of the baptized; even Sodom and Gomorrah, their punishment in history having satisfied the righteousness of God, shall ultimately be saved[fn-5-P543_381406:359-nf] . Yet God has a perfect, immutable goodness of which human goodness, though real, falls infinitely short, because He is steadfast and we are driven by varying impulses[fn-5-P544_381623:360-nf] . This Divine goodness is the standard and the hope set before us. It can only be attained by grace[fn-5-P545_381747:361-nf] , and grace is freely offered. But just as the soul, being free advances to meet sin, so it must advance to meet grace. Man must take the first step; he must wish and pray for grace, and then perseverance in faith will be granted him[fn-5-P546_382036:362-nf] , together with such a measure of the Spirit as he shall desire and deserve[fn-5-P547_382230:363-nf] . He will, indeed, be able to do more than he need, as David did when he spared and afterwards lamented Saul, his worst enemy, and St. Paul, who voluntarily abstained from the lawful privilege of marriage[fn-5-P548_382456:364-nf] . Such is Hilary's first account, 'a naive, undeveloped mode of thought concerning the origin of sin and the state of man[fn-5-P549_382615:365-nf] .' Its inconsistencies are as obvious as their cause, the unguarded homiletical expansion of isolated passages. There is no attempt to reconcile man's freedom to be good with the fact of universal sin. The theory, so far as it is consistent, is derived from Alexandria, from Clement and Origen. It may seem not merely inadequate as theology, but philosophical rather than Christian; and its aim is, indeed, that of strengthening man's sense of moral responsibility and of heightening his courage to withstand temptation. But we must remember that Hilary everywhere assumes the union between the Christian and Christ. While this union exists there is always the power of bringing conduct into conformity with His will. Conduct, then, is, comparatively speaking, a matter of detail. Sins of action and emotion do not necessarily sever the union; a whole system of casuistry might be built upon Hilary's foundation. But false thoughts of God violate the very principle of union between Him and man. However abstract they may seem and remote from practical life, they are an insuperable barrier. For intellectual harmony, as well as moral, is necessary; and error of belief, like a key moving in a lock with whose wards it does not correspond, forbids all access to the nature and the grace of God. Agood example of his relative estimate of intellectual and moral offences occurs in the Homily on Psalm I. **ss 6-8, where it is noteworthy that he does not trace back the former to moral causes[fn-5-P550_384130:366-nf] .","title":"Introduction","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_05_prolegomena","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"112","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Arian Literature.

But if any one may also apply the expression to the Father himself, yet would it now be even more fifty said of the Word; because he was not changed by having become man, but as the Apostle says,[fn-2-P226_59680:25-nf] `Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and forever' But what could persuade them to say that he was made on our account, when Paul has expressly declared[fn-2-P227_59857:26-nf] that `all things are for him, and by him'? One need not wonder indeed at their blasphemous assertion that the Son does not perfectly know the Father; for having once determined to fight against Christ, they reject even the words of the Lord himself, when he says,[fn-2-P228_60139:27-nf] `As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father' If therefore the Father but partially knows the Son, it is manifest that the Son also knows the Father but in part. But if it would be improper to affirm this, and it be admitted that the Father perfectly knows the Son, it is evident that as the Father knows his own Word, so also does the Word know his own Father, whose Word he is. And we, by stating these things, and unfolding the divine Scriptures, have often confuted them: but again as chameleons they were changed, striving to apply to themselves that which is written, `When the ungodly has reached the depths of iniquity, he becomes contemptuous.'[fn-2-P229_60817:28-nf] Many heresies have arisen before these, which exceeding all bounds in daring, have lapsed into complete infatuation: but these persons, by attempting in all their discourses to subvert the Divinity of The Word, as hating made a nearer approach to Antichrist, have comparatively lessened the odium of former ones. Wherefore they have been publicly repudiated by the Church, and anathematized. We are indeed grieved on account of the perdition of these persons, and especially so because, after having been previously instructed in the doctrines of the Church, they have now apostatized from them. Nevertheless we are not greatly surprised at this, for Hymenaeus and Philetus[fn-2-P230_61534:29-nf] fell in like manner; and before them Judas, who had been a follower of the Saviour, but afterwards deserted him became his betrayer. Nor were we without forewarning respecting these very persons: for the Lord himself said: `Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ: and shall many deceive many';[fn-2-P231_61911:30-nf] and `the time is at hand; Go ye not therefore after them.'[fn-2-P232_61990:31-nf] And Paul, having learned these things from the Saviour, wrote, `That in the latter times some should apostatize from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits, and doctrines of devils,'[fn-2-P233_62196:32-nf] who pervert the truth. Seeing then that our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has himself enjoined this, and has also by the apostle given us intimation respecting such men, we having ourselves heard their impiety have in consequence anathematized them, as we before said, and declared them to be alienated from the Catholic Church and faith. Moreover we have intimated this to your piety, beloved and most honored fellow-ministers, in order the ye might neither receive any of them, if they should presume to come to you, nor be induced to put confidence in Eusebius, or any other who may write to you about them. For it is incumbent on us who are Christians, to turn away from all those who speak or entertain a thought against Christ, as from those who are resisting God, and are destroyers of the souls of men: neither does it become us even `to saute such men,'[fn-2-P234_63088:33-nf] as the blessed John has prohibited, `lest we should at any time be made partakers of their sins.'

For the grace flowing from Him when He dwells in those that are worthy, and carries out His own operations, is well described as existing in those that are able to receive Him. On the other hand His essential existence before the ages, and His ceaseless abiding with Son and Father, cannot be contemplated without requiring titles expressive of eternal conjunction. For absolute and real co-existence is predicated in the case of things which are mutually inseparable. We say, for instance, that beat exists in the hot iron, but in the case of the actual fire it co-exists; and, similarly, that health exists in the body, but that life co-exists with the soul. It follows that wherever the fellowship is intimate, congenital,[fn-18-P1842_476145:553-nf] and inseparable, the word with is more expressive, suggesting, as it does, the idea of inseparable fellowship. Where on the other hand the grace flowing from the Spirit naturally comes and goes, it is properly and truly said to exist in, even if on account of the firmness of the recipients' disposition to good the grace abides with them continually. Thus whenever we have in mind the Spirit's proper rank, we contemplate Him as being with the Father and the Son, but when we think of the grace that flows from Him operating on those who participate in it, we say that the Spirit is in us. And the doxology which we offer \"in the Spirit\" is not an acknowledgment of His rank; it is rather a confession of our own weakness, while we shew that we are not sufficient to glorify Him of ourselves, but our sufficiency[fn-18-P1843_479376:554-nf] is in the Holy Spirit.

The bishops assembled on this occasion out of various cities, took into consideration many subjects of the utmost importance. They asserted the divinity of the Holy Spirit[fn-10-P1050_466332:19-nf] and comprehended him in the consubstantial Trinity: they also declared that the Word in being made man, assumed not only flesh, but also a soul, in accordance with the views of the early ecclesiastics. For they did not introduce any new doctrine of their own devising into the church, but contented themselves with recording their sanction of those points which ecclesiastical tradition has insisted on from the beginning, and wise Christians have demonstratively taught. Such sentiments the ancient fathers have uniformly maintained in all their controversial writings. Irenaeus, Clemens, Apollinaris of Hierapolis, and Serapion who presided over the church at Antioch, assure us in their several works, that it was the generally received opinion that Christ in his incarnation was endowed with a soul. Moreover, the Synod convened on account of Beryllus[fn-10-P1051_467451:20-nf] bishop of Philadelphia in Arabia, recognized the same doctrine in their letter to that prelate. Origen also every where in his extant works accepts that the Incarnate God took on himself a human soul. But he more particularly explains this mystery in the ninth volume of his Comments upon Genesis, where he shows that Adam and Eve were types of Christ and the church. That holy man Pamphilus, and Eusebius who was surnamed after him, are trustworthy witnesses on this subject: both these witnesses in their joint life of Origen, and admirable defense of him in answer to such as were prejudiced against him, prove that he was not the first who made this declaration, but that in doing so he was the mere expositor of the mystical tradition of the church. Those who assisted at the Alexandrian Council examined also with great minuteness the question concerning `Essence' or `Substance,' and `Existence,' `Subsistence,' or `Personality.' For Hosius, bishop of Cordova in Spain, who has been before referred to as having been sent by the Emperor Constantine to allay the excitement which Arius had caused, originated the controversy about these terms in his earnestness to overthrow the dogma of Sabellius the Libyan. In the council of Nicaea, however, which was held soon after, this dispute was not agitated; but in consequence of the contention about it which subsequently arose, the matter was freely discussed at Alexandria.[fn-10-P1052_469164:21-nf] It was there determined that such expressions as ousia and hypostasis ought not to be used in reference to God: for they argued that the word ousia is nowhere employed in the sacred Scriptures; and that the apostle has misapplied the term hypostasis[fn-10-P1053_469859:22-nf] owing to an inevitable necessity arising from the nature of the doctrine. They nevertheless decided that in refutation of the Sabellian error these terms were admissible, in default of more appropriate language, lest it should be supposed that one thing was indicated by a threefold designation; whereas we ought rather to believe that each of those named in the Trinity is God in his own proper person. Such were the decisions of this Synod. If we may express our own judgment concerning substance and personality, it appears to us that the Greek philosophers have given us various definitions of ousia, but have not taken the slightest notice of hypostasis. Irenaenus[fn-10-P1054_470545:23-nf] the grammarian indeed, in his Alphabetical [Lexicon entitled] Atticistes, even declares it to be a barbarous term; for it is not to be found in any of the ancients, except occasionally in a sense quite different from that which is attached to it in the present day. Thus Sophocles, in his tragedy entitled Phoenix, uses it to signify `treachery': in Menander it implies `sauces'; as if one should call the `sediment' at the bottom of a hogshead of wine hypostasis. But although the ancient philosophical writers scarcely noticed this word, the more modern ones have frequently used it instead of ousia. This term, as we before observed, has been variously defined: but can that which is capable of being circumscribed by a definition be applicable to God who is incomprehensible? Evagrius in his Monachicus,[fn-10-P1055_471379:24-nf] cautions us against rash and inconsiderate language in reference to God; forbidding all attempt to define the divinity, inasmuch as it is wholly simple in its nature: `for,' says he, `definition belongs only to things which are compound.' The same author further adds, `Every proposition has either a \"genus\" which is predicted, or a \"species,\" or a \"differentia,\" or a \"proprium,\" or an \"accidens,\" or that which is compounded of these: but none of these can be supposed to exist in the sacred Trinity.

For the phrase `He was not' must either have reference to time, or to some interval in the ages. If then it be true that all things were made by Him, it is evident that every age, time, all intervals of time, and that `when' in which `was not' has its place, were made by Him. And is it not absurd to say that there was a time when He who created all time, and ages, and seasons, with which the `was not' is confused, was not? For it would be the height of ignorance, and contrary indeed to all reason, to affirm that the cause of any created thing can be posterior to that caused by it. The interval during which they say the Son was still unbegotten of the Father was, according to their opinion, prior to the wisdom of God, by whom all things were created. They thus contradict the Scripture which declares Him to be `the firstborn of every creature[fn-10-P1010_193821:42-nf] .' In consonance with this doctrine, Paul with his usual mighty voice cries concerning Him; `whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds[fn-10-P1011_194005:43-nf] . `For by Him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him and for Him: and He is before all things'[fn-10-P1012_194562:44-nf] .'

For just as it has been shown that the nature of His existence cannot be expressed by language, and infinitely surpasses in excellence all things to which He has given being, so His Sonship, naturally partaking in His paternal Divinity, is unspeakably different from the sonship of those who, by His appointment, have been adopted as sons.

The majority it is true of those who are not very sensibly minded propose to be content with escaping hell; but I say that a far more severe punishment than hell is exclusion from the glory of the other world, and I think that one who has failed to reach it ought not to sorrow so much over the miseries of hell, as over his rejection from heaven, for this alone is more dreadful than all other things in respect of punishment. But frequently now when we see a king, attended by a large bodyguard, enter the palace, we count those happy who are near him, and have a share in his speech and mind, and partake of all the rest of his glory; and even if we have countless blessings, we have no perception of any of them, and deem ourselves miserable when we look at the glory of those who are round about him, although we know that such splendour is slippery and insecure, both on account of wars, and plots, and envy, and because apart from these things it is not in itself worthy of any consideration. But where the king of all is concerned, he who holds not a portion of the earth but the whole circuit of it, or rather who comprehends it all in the hollow of his hand, and measures the Heavens with a span, who upholdeth all things by the word of His power,[fn-6-P653_380206:36-nf] by whom all the nations are counted as nought, and as a drop of spittle;-in the case of such a king I say shall we no reckon it the most extreme punishment to miss being enrolled in that company which is round about him, but be content if we merely escape hell? and what could be more pitiable than this condition of soul? For this king does not come to judge the earth, drawn by a pair of white mules, nor tiding in a golden chariot, nor arrayed in a purple robe and diadem. How then does He come? Hear the prophets crying aloud and saying as much as it is possible to tell to men: for one saith \"God shall come openly, even our God and shall not keep silence: a fire shall be kindled before Him, and a mighty tempest shall be round about Him: He shall call the Heaven from above and the earth that He may judge His people.\"[fn-6-P654_381126:37-nf] But Esias depicts the actual punishment impending over us speaking thus: \"Behold the day of the Lord cometh, inexorable, with wrath and anger; to lay the whole world desolate, and to destroy sinners out of it. For the stars of Heaven, and Orion, and the whole system of the heaven shall not give their light, and the sun shall be darkened in its going down,[fn-6-P655_381501:38-nf] and the moon shall not give her light; and I will ordain evils against the whole world, and visit their sins upon the ungodly, and I will destroy the insolence of the lawless, and humble the insolence of the proud, and they who are left shall be more precious than unsmelted gold, and a man shall be more precious than the sapphire stone. For the heaven shall be disturbed[fn-6-P656_381920:39-nf] and the earth shall be shaken from its foundations by reason of the fury of the wrath of the Lord of Sabaoth, in the day when His wrath shall come upon us.\"[fn-6-P657_382133:40-nf] And again \"windows\" he saith \"hall be opened from the Heaven, and the foundations of the earth shall be shaken the earth shall be mightily confounded, the earth shall be bent low, it shall be perplexed with great perplexity, the earth shall stagger grievously like the drunkard and the reveller; the earth shall shake as a hut, it shall fall and not be able to rise up again: for iniquity has waxed mighty therein. And God shall set His hand upon the host of the Heaven in the height in that day, and upon the kingdoms of the earth, and He shall gather together the congregation thereof into a prison, and shall shut them up in a stronghold.\"[fn-6-P658_382800:41-nf] And Malachi speaking concordantly with these said \"Behold the Lord almighty cometh, and who shall abide the day of His coming or who shall stand when He appeareth for He cometh like a refiner's fire, and like fullers soap: and He shall sit refining and purifying as it were silver, and as it were gold.\"[fn-6-P659_383165:42-nf] And again, \"Behold,\" he saith, \"the day of the Lord cometh, burning like an oven, and it shall consume them, and all the aliens, and all who work iniquity shall be stubble, and the day which is coming shall set fire to them saith the Lord almighty; and there shall be left neither root nor branch.\"[fn-6-P660_383487:43-nf] And the man greatly beloved saith \"I beheld until thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days was seated, and his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head was pure as wool: His throne was a flame of fire, and the wheels thereof burning fire: a stream of fire wound its way in front of Him.

His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed. As for me Daniel, my spirit shuddered within me, and the visions of my head troubled me.\"[fn-6-P662_384587:45-nf] Then all the gates of the heavenly vaults are opened, or rather the heaven itself is taken away out of the midst \"for the heaven,\" we read \"shall be rolled up like a scroll,\"[fn-6-P663_384832:46-nf] wrapped up in the middle like the skin and covering of some tent so as to be transformed into some better shape. Then all things are full of amazement and horror and trembling: then even the angels themselves are holden by much fear, and not angels only but also archangels and thrones, and dominions, and principalities and authorities. \"For the powers\" we read \"of the heavens shall be shaken,\" because their fellow-servants are required to give an account of their life in this world.[fn-6-P664_385342:47-nf] For if when a single city is bring judged before rulers in this world, all men shudder, even those who are outside the danger, when the whole world is arraigned before such a judge as this who needs no witnesses, or proofs, but independently of all these things brings forward deeds and words and thoughts, and exhibits them all as in some picture both to those who have committed the sins and to those who are ignorant of them, how is it not natural that every power should be confounded and shake? For if there were no river of fire winding by, nor any terrible angels standing by the side of the throne, but men were merely summoned some to be praised and admired, others to be dismissed with ignominy that they might not see the glory of God, (\"For let the ungodly\" we read \"be taken away that he may not see the glory of the Lord\"[fn-6-P665_386200:48-nf] ) and if this were the only punishment would not the loss of such blessings sting the souls of those who were deprived of them more bitterly than all hell itself? For how great an evil this is cannot possibly be represented now in words; but then we shall know it clearly in the actual reality. But now I pray add the punishment also to the scene, and imagine men not only covered with shame, and veiling their heads, and bending them low, but also being dragged along the road to the fire, and haled away to the instruments of torture and delivered over to the cruel powers, and suffering these things just at the time when all they who have practised what is good, and wrought deeds worthy of eternal life, are being crowned, and proclaimed conquerors, and presented before the royal throne.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_106_epistles_on_the_arian_heresy","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"ANF-06","text":"12. Concerning whom we thus believe, even as the Apostolic Church believes. In one Father unbegotten, who has from no one the cause of His being, who is unchangeable and immutable, who is always the same, and admits of no increase or diminution; who gave to us the Law, the prophets, and the Gospels; who is Lord of the patriarchs and apostles, and all the saints. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God; not begotten of things which are not, but of Him who is the Father; not in a corporeal manner, by excision or division as Sabellius and Valentinus thought, but in a certain inexplicable and unspeakable manner, according to the words of the prophet cited above: \"Who shall declare His generation? \"[fn-47-P4704_1409728:34-nf] Since that His subsistence no nature which is begotten can investigate, even as the Father can be investigated by none; because that the nature of rational beings cannot receive the knowledge of His divine generation by the Father. But men who are moved by the Spirit of truth, have no need to learn these things from me, for in our ears are sounding the words before uttered by Christ on this very thing,\" No man knoweth the Father, save the Son; and no man knoweth who the Son is, save the Father.\"[fn-47-P4705_1410248:35-nf] That He is equally with the Father unchangeable and immutable, wanting in nothing, and the perfect Son, and like to the Father, we have learnt; in this alone is He inferior to the Father, that He is not unbegotten. For He is the very exact image of the Father, and in nothing differing from Him. For it is clear that He is the image fully containing all things by which the greatest similitude is declared, as the Lord Himself hath taught us, when He says, \"My Father is greater than I.\"[fn-47-P4706_1410755:36-nf] And according to this we believe that the Son is of the Father, always existing. \"For He is the brightness of His glory, the express image of His Father's person.\"[fn-47-P4707_1410938:37-nf] But let no one take that word always so as to raise suspicion that He is unbegotten, as they imagine who have their senses blinded. For neither are the words, \"He was,\" or \"always,\" or \"before all worlds,\" equivalent to unbegotten. But neither can the human mind employ any other word to signify unbegotten. And thus I think that you understand it, and I trust to your right purpose in all things, since these words do not at all signify unbegotten. For these words seem to denote simply a lengthening out of time, but the Godhead, and as it were the antiquity of the only-begotten, they cannot worthily signify; but they have been employed by holy men, whilst each, according to his capacity, seeks to express this mystery, asking indulgence from the hearers, and pleading a reasonable excuse, in saying, Thus far have we attained. But if there be any who are expecting from mortal lips some word which exceeds human capacity, saying that those things have been done away which are known in part, it is manifest that the words,\" He was,\" and \"always,\" and \"before all ages,\" come far short of what they hoped. And whatever word shall be employed is not equivalent to unbegotten. Therefore to the unbegotten Father, indeed, we ought to preserve His proper dignity, in confessing that no one is the cause of His being; but to the Son must be allotted His fitting honour, in assigning to Him, as we have said, a generation from the Father without beginning, and allotting adoration to Him, so as only piously and properly to use the words,\" He was,\" and \"always,\" and \"before all worlds,\" with respect to Him; by no means rejecting His Godhead, but ascribing to Him a similitude which exactly answers in every respect to the Image and Exemplar of the Father. But we must say that to the Father alone belongs the property of being unbegotten, for the Saviour Himself said, My Father is greater than I.\"[fn-47-P4708_1412855:38-nf] And besides the pious opinion concerning the Father and the Son, we confess to one Holy Spirit, as the divine Scriptures teach us; who hath inaugurated both the holy men of the Old Testament, and the divine teachers of that which is called the New. And besides, also, one only Catholic and Apostolic Church, which can never be destroyed, though all the world should seek to make war with it; but it is victorious over every most impious revolt of the heretics who rise up against it. For her Goodman hath confirmed our minds by saying, \"Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\"[fn-47-P4709_1413457:39-nf] After this we know of the resurrection of the dead, the first-fruits of which was our Lord Jesus Christ, who in very deed, and not in appearance merely, carried a body, of Mary Mother of God, who in the end of the world came to the human race to put away sin, was crucified and died, and yet did He not thus perceive any detriment to His divinity, being raised from the dead, taken up into heaven, seated at the right hand of majesty.","title":"Epistles on the Arian Heresy","author":"Alexander"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_106_epistles_on_the_arian_heresy","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"ANF-06","text":"3.

Among arts, some have in view production, some practice, others theory.[fn-20-P2022_565939:27-nf] The object of the last is the exercise of thought, that of the second, the motion of the body. Should it cease, all stops; nothing more is to be seen. Thus dancing and music have nothing behind; they have no object but themselves. In creative arts on the contrary the work lasts after the operation. Such is architecture-such are the arts which work in wood and brass and weaving, all those indeed which, even when the artisan has disappeared, serve to show an industrious intelligence and to cause the architect, the worker in brass or the weaver, to be admired on account of his work. Thus, then, to show that the world is a work of art displayed for the beholding of all people; to make them know Him who created it, Moses does not use another word. \"In the beginning,\" he says \"God created.\" He does not say \"God worked,\" \"God formed,\" but\" God created.\" Among those who have imagined that the world co-existed with God from all eternity, many have denied that it was created by God, but say that it exists spontaneously, as the shadow of this power. God, they say, is the cause of it, but an involuntary cause, as the body is the cause of the shadow and the flame is the cause of the brightness.[fn-20-P2023_567226:28-nf] It is to correct this error that the prophet states, with so much precision, \"In the beginning God created.\" He did not make the thing itself the cause of its existence.[fn-20-P2024_567693:29-nf] Being good, He made it an useful work.

There are inquirers into nature[fn-20-P2044_576308:44-nf] who with a great display of words give reasons for the immobility of the earth. Placed, they say, in the middle of the universe and not being able to incline more to one side than the other because its centre is everywhere the same distance from the surface, it necessarily rests upon itself; since a weight which is everywhere equal cannot lean to either side. It is not, they go on, without reason or by chance that the earth occupies the centre of the universe. It is its natural and necessary position. As the celestial body occupies the higher extremity of space all heavy bodies, they argue, that we may suppose to have fallen from these high regions, will be carried from all directions to the centre, and the point towards which the parts are tending will evidently be the one to which the whole mass will be thrust together. If stones, wood, all terrestrial bodies, fall from above downwards, this must be the proper and natural place of the whole earth. If, on the contrary, a light body is separated from the centre, it is evident that it will ascend towards the higher regions. Thus heavy bodies move from the top to the bottom, and following this reasoning, the bottom is none other than the centre of the world. Do not then be surprised that the world never falls: it occupies the centre of the universe, its natural place. By necessity it is obliged to remain in its place, unless a movement contrary to nature should displace it.[fn-20-P2045_577893:45-nf] If there is anything in this system which might appear probable to you, keep your admiration for the source of such perfect order, for the wisdom of God.

The wall which they set up against the weapons of the devil, and the antidote wherewith they repelled his deadly poisons, was their confession that the Father and the Son are of one substance, one godhead, one virtue, one power, one likeness[fn-16-P1638_442961:115-nf] , and that the Holy Ghost is of the same essence[fn-16-P1639_443259:116-nf] and substance. Whoever did not thus think was judged separate from our communion. Their deliberation was worthy of all respect, and their definition sound. But certain men have intended by other later discussions to corrupt and befoul it. Yet, at the very outset, error was so far set right by the bishops on whom the attempt was made at Ariminum to compel them to manipulate or innovate on the faith, that they confessed themselves seduced by opposite arguments, or owned that they had not perceived any contradiction to the opinion of the Fathers livered at Nicaea. No prejudice could arise from the number of bishops gathered at Ariminum, since it is well known that neither the bishop of the Romans, whose opinion ought before all others to have been waited for, nor Vincentius, whose stainless episcopate had lasted so many years, nor the rest, gave in their adhesion to such doctrines.

Again the phrase, \"not having lot in his power,\" we should rather pass by as un-meaning than confute as ungodly. For what sense is attached to the term \"having lot\" is not easy to discover from the common use of the word. Those cast lots, as the Scripture tells us, for the Lord's vesture, who were unwilling to rend His garment, but disposed to make it over to that one of their number in whose favour the lot should decide[fn-10-P1026_552554:57-nf] . They then who thus cast lots among themselves for the \"coat\" may be said, perhaps, to \"have had lot\" in it.

For He Who is in the Father is manifestly in the Father with all His own might, and He Who has the Father in Himself includes all the power and might of the Father. For He has in Himself all the Father, and not merely a part of Him: and He Who has Him entirely assuredly has His power as well. With what meaning, then, Eunomius asserts that the Father has \"none who has lot in His power,\" those perhaps can tell who are disciples of his folly one who knows how to appreciate language confesses that he cannot understand phrases divorced from meaning. The Father, he says, \"has none Who has lot in His power.\" Why, who is there that says that the Father and Son contend together for power and cast lots to decide the matter?

But all that is the Father's is the Son's also; so that, on this understanding[fn-10-P1037_556199:67-nf] , we admit this phrase too. But if, leaving the Father, he speaks of another Almighty, he is speaking the language of the Jews or following the speculations of Plato,-for they say that that philosopher also affirms that there exists on high a maker and creator of certain subordinate gods. As then in the case of the Jewish and Platonic opinions he who does not believe in God the Father is not a Christian, even though in his creed he asserts an Almighty God, so Eunomius also falsely pretends to the name of Christian, being in inclination a Jew, or asserting the doctrines of the Greeks while putting on the guise of the title borne by Christians. And with regard to the next points he asserts the same account will apply. He says He is \"God of Gods.\" We make the declaration our own by adding the name of the Father, knowing that the Father is God of Gods. But all that belongs to the Father certainly belongs also to the Son. \"And Lord of Lords.\" The same account will apply to this. \"And Most High over all the earth.\" Yes, for whichever of the Three Persons you are thinking of, He is Most High over all the earth, inasmuch as the oversight of earthly things from on high is exercised alike by the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. So, too, with what follows the words above, \"Most High in the heavens, Most High in the highest, Heavenly, true in being what He is, and so continuing, true in words, true in works.\" Why, all these things the Christian eye discerns alike in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. If Eunomius does assign them to one only of the Persons acknowledged in the creed, let him dare to call Him \"not true in words\" Who has said, \"I am the Truth[fn-10-P1038_557962:68-nf] ,\" or to call the Spirit of truth \"not true in words,\" or let him refuse to give the title of \"true in works\" to Him Who doeth righteousness and judgment, or to the Spirit Who worketh all in all as He will. For if he does not acknowledge that these attributes belong to the Persons delivered to us in the creed, he is absolutely cancelling the creed of Christians. For how shall any one think Him a worthy object of faith Who is false in words and untrue in works.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Perhaps, however, it is waste of time to linger long over such follies. Let us pass to the next point of his statement. He adds to what he had already said, \"Not standing in need, in the act of creation, of matter or parts or natural instruments: for He stands in need of nothing.\" This proposition, though Eunomius states it with a certain looseness of phrase, we yet do not reject as inconsistent with godly doctrine. For learning as we do that \"He spake the word and they were made: He commanded and they were created[fn-10-P1053_571210:76-nf] ,\"we know that the Word is the Creator of matter, by that very act also producing with the matter the qualitiesof matter, so that for Him the impulse of Hisalmighty will was everything and instead of everything, matter, instrument, place, time, essence, quality, everything that is conceived in creation. For at one and the same time did He will that that which ought to be should be, and His power, that produced all things that are, kept pace with His will, turning His will into act. For thus the mighty Moses in the record of creation instructs us about the Divine power, ascribing the production of each of the objects that were manifested in the creation to the words that bade them be. For \"God said,\" he tells us, \"Let there be light, and there was light[fn-10-P1054_572021:77-nf] :\" and so about the rest, without any mention either of matter or of any instrumental agency. Accordingly the language of Eunomius on this point is not to be rejected. For God, when creating all things that have their origin by creation, neither stood in need of any matter on which to operate, nor of instruments to aid Him in His construction: for the power and wisdom of God has no need of any external assistance. But Christ is \"the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-10-P1055_572509:78-nf] ,\" by Whom all things were made and without Whom is no existent thing, as John testifies[fn-10-P1056_572617:79-nf] . If, then, all things were made by Him, both visible and invisible, and if His will alone suffices to effect the subsistence of existing things (for His will is power), Eunomius utters our doctrine though with a loose mode of expression[fn-10-P1057_572878:80-nf] . For what instrument and what matter could He Who upholds all thinsg by the word of His power[fn-10-P1058_573089:81-nf] need in upholding the constitution of existing things by His almighty word? But if he maintains that what we have believed to be true of the Only-begotten in the case of the creation, is true also in the case of the Son -in the sense that the Father created Him in like manner as the creation was made by the Son,-then we retract our former statement, because such a supposition is a denial of the Godhead of the Only-begotten. For we have learnt from the mighty utterance of Paul that it is the distinguishing feature of idolatry to worship and serve the creature more than the Creator[fn-10-P1059_573733:82-nf] , as well as from David, when He says \"There shall no new God be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any alien God[fn-10-P1060_573869:83-nf] .\" We use this line and rule to arrive at the discernment of the object of worship, so as to be convinced that that alone is God which is neither \"new\" nor \"alien.\" Since then we have been taught to believe that the Only-begotten God is God, we acknowledge, by our belief that He is God, that He is neither \"new\" or \"alien.\" If, then, He is God, He is not \"new,\" and if He is not new, He is assuredly eternal. Accordingly, neither is the Eternal \"new,\" nor is He Who is of the Father and in the bosom of the Father and Who has the Father in Himself \"alien\" from true Deity. Thus he who severs the Son from the nature of the Father either absolutely disallows the worship of the Son, that he may not worship an alien God, or bows down before an idol, making a creature and not God the object of his worship, and giving to his idol the name of Christ.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"The mighty Paul, knowing that the Only-begotten God, Who has the pre-eminence in all things[fn-10-P1067_578878:86-nf] , is the author and cause of all good, bears witness to Him that not only was the creation of all existent things wrought by Him, but that when the original creation of man had decayed and vanished away[fn-10-P1068_579102:87-nf] , to use his own language, and another new creation was wrought in Christ, in this too no other than He took the lead, but He is Himself the first-born of all that new creation of men which is effected by the Gospel.

In those passages therefore where he makes mention of the \"first-born\" in connexion with other words, he suggests that we should understand the phrase in the way which I have indicated: but where, without any such addition, he says, \"When again He bringeth the first-born into the world[fn-10-P1086_584364:104-nf] ,\" the addition of \"again\" asserts that manifestation of the Lord of all which shall take place at the last day.

For the inspired teaching adopts, in order to set forth the unspeakable power of God, all the forms of generation that human intelligence recognizes, yet without including the corporeal senses attaching to the words. For when it speaks of the creative power, it gives to such an energy the name of generation, because its expression must stoop to our low capacity; it does not, however, convey thereby all that we include in creative generation, as time, place, the furnishing of matter, the fitness of instruments, the design in the things that come into being, but it leaves these, and asserts of God in lofty and magnificentlanguage the creation of all existent things, when it says, \"He spake the word and theywere made[fn-10-P1096_589953:110-nf] , He commanded and they were created.\" Again when it interprets to us the unspeakable and transcendent existence of the Only-begotten from the Father, as the poverty of human intellect is incapable of receiving doctrines which surpass all power of speech and thought, there too it borrows our language and terms Him \"Son,\"-a name which our usage assigns to those who are born of matter and nature. But just as Scripture, when speaking of generation by creation, does not in the case of God imply that such generation took place by means of any material, affirming that the power of God's will served for material substance, place, time and all such circumstances, even so here too, when using the term Son, it rejects both all else that human nature remarks in generation here below,-I mean affections and dispositions and the co-operation of time, and the necessity of place,-and, above all, matter, without all which natural generation here below does not take place. But when all such material, temporal and local[fn-10-P1097_591034:111-nf] existence is excluded from the sense of the term \"Son,\" community of nature alone is left, and for this reason by the title \"Son\" is declared, concerning the Only-begotten, the close affinity and genuineness of relationship which mark His manifestation from the Father. And since such a kind of generation was not sufficient to implant in us an adequate notion of the ineffable mode of subsistence of the Only-begotten, Scripture avails itself also of the third kind of generation to indicate the doctrine of the Son's Divinity,-that kind, namely, which is the result of material efflux, and speaks of Him as the \"brightness of glory[fn-10-P1098_591757:112-nf] ,\" the \"savour of ointment[fn-10-P1099_591802:113-nf] ,\" the \"breath of God[fn-11-P1100_591882:114-nf] ;\" illustrations which in the scientific phraseology we have adopted we ordinarily designate as material efflux.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"What is this vain juggling with words?

For, to take an example, Ishmael was not before the generation that brought him into being, and before his birth there was of course an interval of time. But with Him Who is \"the brightness of glory[fn-11-P1109_600326:120-nf] ,\" \"before\" and \"after\" have no place: for before the brightness, of course neither was there any glory, for concurrently with the existence of the glory there assuredly beams forth its brightness; and it is impossible in the nature of things that one should be severed from the other, nor is it possible to see the glory by itself before its brightness. For he who says thus will make out the glory in itself to be darkling and dim, if the brightness from it does not shine out at the same time. But this is the unfair method of the heresy, to endeavour, by the notions and terms employed concerning the Only-begotten God, to displace Him from His oneness with the Father. It is to this end they say, \"Before the generation that brought Him into being He was not Son:\" but the \"sons of rams[fn-11-P1110_601140:121-nf] ,\" of whom the prophet speaks,-are not they too called sons after coming into being? That quality, then, which reason notices in the \"sons of rams,\" that they are not \"sons of rams\" before the generation which brings them into being,-this our reverend divine now ascribes to the Maker of the worlds and of all creation, Who has the Eternal Father in Himself, and is contemplated in the eternity of the Father, as He Himself says, \"I am in the Father, and the Father in Me[fn-11-P1111_601647:122-nf] .\" Those, however, who are not able to detect the sophistry that lurks in his statement, and are not trained to any sort of logical perception, follow these inconsequent statements and receive what comes next as a logical consequence of what preceded. For he says, \"coming into being before all creation,\" and as though this were not enough to prove his impiety, he has a piece of profanity in reserve in the phrase that follows, when he terms the Son \"not uncreate.\" In what sense then does he call Him Who is not uncreate \"very Son\"? For if it is meet to call Him Who is not uncreate \"very Son,\" then of course the heaven is \"very Son;\" for it too is \"not uncreate.\" So the sun too is \"very Son,\" and all that the creation contains, both small and great, are of course entitled to the appellation of \"very Son.\" And in what sense does He call Him Who has come into being \"Only-begotten\"? For all things that come into being are unquestionably in brotherhood with each other, so far, I mean, as their coming into being is concerned. And from whom did He come into being? For assuredly all things that have ever come into being did so from the Son. For thus did John testify, saying, \"All things were made by Him[fn-11-P1112_602884:123-nf] .\" If then the Son also came into being, according to Eunomius' creed, He is certainly ranked in the class of things which have come into being. If then all things that came into being were made by Him, and the Word is one of the things that came into being, who is so dull as not to draw from these premises the absurd conclusion that our new creed-monger makes out the Lord of creation to have been His own work, in saying in so many words that the Lord and Maker of all creation is \"not uncreate\"? Let him tell us whence he has this boldness assertion. From what inspired utterance? What evangelist, what apostle ever uttered such words as these? What prophet, what lawgiver, what patriarch, what other person of all who were divinely moved by the Holy Ghost, whose voices are preserved in writing, ever originated such a statement as this? In the tradition of the faith delivered by the Truth we are taught to believe in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. If it were right to believe that the Son was created, how was it that the Truth in delivering to us this mystery bade us believe in the Son, and not in the creature? and how is it that the inspired Apostle, himself adoring Christ, lays it down that they who worship the creature besides the Creator are guilty of idolatry[fn-11-P1113_604183:124-nf] ? For, were the Son created, either he would not have wor-shipped Him, or he would have refrained from classing those who worship the creature along with idolaters, lest he himself should appear to be an idolater, in offering adoration to the created. But he knew that He Whom he adored was God over all[fn-11-P1114_604628:125-nf] , for so he terms theSon in his Epistle to the Romans. Why then do those who divorce the Son from the essence of the Father, and call Him creature, bestow on Him i mockery the fictitious title of Deity, idly conferring on one alien from true Divinity the name of \"God,\" as they might confer it on Bel or Dagon or the Dragon?

This view Joel does not attest, nor yet the mighty Peter, who adopted, in his speech to the Jews, the language of the prophet. For both the prophet and the apostle say, in the person of God,-\"I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh[fn-11-P1141_617017:147-nf] .\" He then Who did not grudge the partaking in His own Spirit to all flesh,-how can it be that He does not impart His own glory to the only-begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, Who has all things that the Father has? Perhaps one should say that Eunomius is here speaking the truth, though not intending it. For the term \"impart\" is strictly used in the case of one who has not his glory from within, whose possession of it is an accession from without, and not part of his own nature: but where one and the same nature is observed in both Persons, He Who is as regards nature all that the Father is believed to be stands in no need of one to impart to Him each several attribute. This it will be well to explain more clearly and precisely. He Who has the Father dwelling in Him in His entirety-what need has He of the Father's glory, when none of the attributes contemplated in the Father is withdrawn from Him?","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"The disjointed incoherencies which follow next, I think it well to pass over, not because they give no handle at all to censure, but because their language is such as might be used by the devout, if detached from its malignant context. If he does here and there use some expressions favourable to devotion it is just held out as a bait to simple souls, to the end that the hook of impiety may be swallowed along with it. For after employing such language as a member of the Church might use, he subjoins, \"Obedient with regard to the creation and production of all things that are, obedient with regard to every ministration, not having by His obedience attained Sonship or Godhead, but, as a consequence of being Son and being generated as the Only-begotten God, showing Himself obedient in words, obedient in acts.\" Yet who of those who are conversant with the oracles of God does not know With regard to what point of time it was said of Him by the mighty Paul, (and that once for all), that He \"became obedient[fn-11-P1158_627368:159-nf] \"? For it was when He came in the form of a servant to accomplish the mystery of redemption by the cross, Who had emptied Himself, Who humbled Himself by assuming the likeness and fashion of a man, being found as man in man's lowly nature-then, I say, it was that He became obedient, even He Who \"took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses[fn-11-P1159_627729:160-nf] ,\" healing the disobedience of men by His own obedience, that by His stripes He might heal our wound, and by His own death do away with the common death of all men,-then it was that for our sakes He was made obedient, even as He became \"sin[fn-11-P1160_628000:161-nf] \" and \"a curse[fn-11-P1161_628036:162-nf] \" by reason of the dispensation on our behalf, not being so by nature, but becoming so in His love for man. But by what sacred utterance was He ever taught His list of so many obediences? Nay, on the contrary every inspired Scripture attests His independent and sovereign power, saying, \"He spake the word and they were made: He commanded and they were created[fn-11-P1162_628418:163-nf] \":-for it is plain that the Psalmist says this concerning Him Who upholds \"all things by the word of His power[fn-11-P1163_628552:164-nf] ,\" Whose authority, by the sole impulse of His will, framed every existence and nature, and all things in the creation apprehended by reason or by sight. Whence, then, was Eunomius moved to ascribe in such manifold wise to the King of the universe the attribute of obedience, speaking of Him as \"obedient with regard to all the work of creation, obedient with regard to every ministration, obedient in words and in acts\"? Yet it is plain to every one, that he alone is obedient to another in acts and words, who has not yet perfectly achieved in himself the condition of accurate working or unexceptionable speech, but keeping his eye ever on his teacher and guide, is trained by his suggestions to exact propriety in deed and word. But to think that Wisdom needs a master and teacher to guide aright. Its attempts at imitation, is the dream of Eunomius' fancy, and of his alone. And concerning the Father he says, that He is faithful in words and faithful in works, while of the Son he does not assert faithfulness in word and deed, but only obedience and not faithfulness, so that his profanity extends impartially through all his statements. But it is perhaps right to pass in silence over the inconsiderate folly of the assertion interposed between those last mentioned, lest some unreflecting persons should laugh at its absurdity when they ought rather to weep over the perdition of their souls, than laugh at the folly of their words. For this wise and wary theologian says that He did not attain to being a Son as the result of His obedience! Mark his penetration! with what cogent force does he lay it down for us that He was not first obedient and afterwards a Son, and that we ought not to think that His obedience was prior to His generation! Now if he had not added this defining clause, who without it would have been sufficiently silly and idiotic to fancy that His generation was bestowed on Him by His Father, as a reward of the obedience of Him Who before His generation had showed due subjection and obedience? But that no one may too readily extract matter for laughter from these remarks, let each consider that even the folly of the words has in it something worthy of tears. For what he intends to establish by these observations is something of this kind, that His obedience is part of His nature, so that not even if He willed it would it be possible for Him not to be obedient.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Now the drift of Eunomius' excessive concern about the Ungenerate has been often ex plained before; and it shall here be briefly discovered yet again. For as the term Father points to no difference of nature from the Son, his impiety, if he had brought his statement to a close here, would have had no support, seeing that the natural sense of the names Father and Son excludes the idea of their being alien in essence. But as it is, by employing the terms \"generate\" and \"ungenerate,\" since the contradictory opposition between them admits of no mean, just like that between \"mortal\" and \"immortal,\" \"rational\" and \"irrational,\" and all those terms which are opposed to each other by the mutually exclusive nature of their meaning,-by the use of these terms, I repeat, he gives free course to his profanity, so as to contemplate as existing in the \"generate\" with reference to the \"ungenerate\" the same difference which there is between \"mortal\" and \"immortal\": and even as the nature of the mortal is one, and that of the immortal another, and as the special attributes of the rational and of the irrational are essentially incompatible, just so he wants to make out that the nature of the ungenerate is one, and that of the generate another, in order to show that as the irrational nature has been created in subjection to the rational, so the generate is by a necessity of its being in a state of subordination to the ungenerate. For which reason he attaches to the ungenerate the name of \"Almighty,\" and this he does not apply to express providential operation, as the argument led the way for him in suggesting, but transfers the application of the word to arbitrary sovereignty, so as to make the Son to be a part of the subject and subordinate universe, a fellow-slave with all the rest to Him Who with arbitrary and absolute sovereignty controls all alike. And that it is with an eye to this result that he employs these argumentative distinctions, will be clearly established from the passage before us. For after those sapient and carefully-considered expressions, that He is not like either as Father to Father, or as Son to Son,-and yet there is no necessity that father should invariably be like father or son like son: for suppose there is one father among the Ethiopians, and another among the Scythians, and each of these has a son, the Ethiopian's son black, but the Scythian white-skinned and with hair of a golden tinge, yet none the more because each is a father does the Scythian turn black on the Ethiopian's account, nor does the Ethiopian's body change to white on account of the Scythian,-after saying this, however, according to his own fancy, Eunomius subjoins that \"He is like as Son to Father[fn-11-P1182_645287:176-nf] .\" But although such a phrase indicates kinship in nature, as the inspired Scripture attests in the case of Seth and Adam, our doctor, with but small respect for his intelligent readers, introduces his idle exposition of the title \"Son,\" defining Him to be the image and seal of the energy[fn-11-P1183_645670:177-nf] of the Almighty. \"For the Son,\" he says, \"is the image and seal of the energy of the Almighty.\" Let him who hath ears to hear first, I pray, consider this particular point-What is \"the seal of the energy\"? Every energy is contemplated as exertion in the party who exhibits it, and on the completion of his exertion, it has no independent existence. Thus, far example, the energy of the runner is the motion of his feet, and when the motion has stopped there is no longer any energy. So too about every pursuit the same may be said;-when the exertion of him who is busied about anything ceases, the energy ceases also, and has no independent existence, either when a person is actively engaged in the exertion he undertakes, or when he ceases from that exertion. What then does he tell us that the energy is in itself, which is neither essence, nor image, nor person? So he speaks of the Son as the similitude of the impersonal, and that which is like the non-existent surely has itself no existence at all. This is what his juggling with idle opinions comes to,-belief in nonentity! for that which is like nonentity surely itself is not. O Paul and John and all you others of the band of Apostles and Evangelists, who are they that arm their venomous tongues against your words? who are they that raise their frog-like croakings against your heavenly thunder? What then saith the son of thunder? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-11-P1184_647260:178-nf] .\" And what saith he that came after him, that other who had been within the heavenly temple, who in Paradise had been initiated into mysteries unspeakable? \"Being,\" he says, \"the Brightness of His glory, and the express Image of His person[fn-11-P1185_647522:179-nf] .\" What, after these have thus spoken, are the words of our ventriloquist[fn-11-P1186_647614:180-nf] ? \"The seal,\" quoth he, \"of the energy of the Almighty.\" He makes Him third after the Father, with that non-existent energy mediating between them, or rather moulded at pleasure by non-existence. God the Word, Who was in the beginning, is \"the seal of the energy\":-the Only-begotten God, Who is contemplated in the eternity of the Beginning of existent things, Who is in the bosom of the Father[fn-11-P1187_648087:181-nf] , Who sustains all things, by the word of His power[fn-11-P1188_648161:182-nf] , the creator of the ages, from Whom and through Whom and in Whom are all things[fn-11-P1189_648264:183-nf] , Who sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and hath meted out heaven with the span, Who measureth the water in the hollow of his hand[fn-11-P1190_648423:184-nf] , Who holdeth in His hand all things that are, Who dwelleth on high and looketh upon the things that are lowly[fn-11-P1191_648561:185-nf] , or rather did look upon them to make all the world to be His footstool[fn-11-P1192_648662:186-nf] , imprinted by the footmark of the Word-the form of God[fn-11-P1193_648744:187-nf] is \"the seal\" of an \"energy.\" Is God then an energy, not a Person? Surely Paul when expounding this very truth says He is \"the express image,\" not of His energy, but \"of His Person.\" Is the Brightness of His glory a seal of the energy of God? Alas for his impious ignorance! What is there intermediate between God and His own form? and Whom does the Person employ as mediator with His own express image? and what can be conceived as coming between the glory and its brightness? But while there are such weighty and numerous testimonies wherein the greatness of the Lord of the creation is proclaimed by those who were entrusted with the proclamation of the Gospel, what sort of language does this forerunner of the final apostasy hold concerning Him? What says he? \"As image,\" he says, \"and seal of all the energy and power of the Almighty.\" How does he take upon himself to emend the words of the mighty Paul? Paul says that the Son is \"the Power of God[fn-11-P1194_649722:188-nf] \"; Eunomius calls Him \"the seal of a power,\" not the Power. And then, repeating his expression, what is it that he adds to his previous statement? He calls Him \"seal of the Father's works and words and counsels.\" To what works of the Father is He like? He will say, of course, the world, and all things that are therein. But the Gospel has testified that all these things are the works of the Only-begotten. To what works of theFather, then, was He likened? of what works was He made the seal? what Scripture ever entitled Him \"seal of the Father's works\"? But if any one should grant Eunomius the right to fashion his words at his own will, as he desires, even though Scripture does not agree with him, let him tell us what works of the Father there are of which he says that the Son was made the seal, apart from those that have been wrought by the Son. All things visible and invisible are the work of the Son: in the visible are included the whole world and all that is therein; in the invisible, the supramundane creation. What works of the Father, then, are remaining to be contemplated by themselves, over and above things visible and invisible, whereof he says that the Son was made the \"seal\"? Will he perhaps, when driven into a corner, return once more to the fetid vomit of heresy, and say that the Son is a work of the Father? How then does the Son come to be he seal of these works when He Himself, as Eunomius says, is the work of the Father? Or does he say that the same Person is at once a work and the likeness of a work? Let this be granted: let us suppose him to speak of the other works of which he says the Father was the creator, if indeed he intends us to understand likeness by the term \"seal.\" But what other \"words\" of the Father does Eunomius know, besides that Word Who was ever in the Father, Whom he calls a \"seal\"-Him Who is and is called the Word in the absolute, true, and primary sense? And to what counsels can he possibly refer, apart from the Wisdom of God, to which the Wisdom of God is made like, in becoming a \"seal\" of those counsels? Look at the want of discrimination and circumspection, at the confused muddle of his statement, how he brings the mystery into ridicule, without understanding either what he says or what he is arguing about. For He Who has the Father in His entirety in Himself, and is Himself in His entirety in the Father, as Word and Wisdom and Power and Truth, as His express image and brightness, Himself is all things in the Father, and does not come to be the image and seal and likeness of certain other things discerned in the Father prior to Himself.

For those in whom the Holy One dwells, He makes holy, even as the Good One makes men good. And the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are holy and good, as has been shown. \"Acting as a guide to those who approach the mystery.\" This may well be said of Apollos who watered what Paul planted. For the Apostle plants by his guidance[fn-12-P1272_692308:250-nf] , and Apollos, when he baptizes, waters by Sacramental regeneration, bringing to the mystery those who were instructed by Paul. Thus he places on a level with Apollos that Spirit Who perfects men through baptism. \"Distributing every gift.\" With this we too agree; for everything that is good is a portion of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. \"Co-operating with the faithful for the understanding and contemplation of things appointed.\" As he does not add by whom they are appointed, he leaves his meaning doubtful, whether it is correct or the reverse. But we will by a slight addition advance his statement so as to make it consistent with godliness. For since, whether it be the word of wisdom, or the word of knowledge, or faith, or help, or government, or aught else that is enumerated in the lists of saving gifts, \"all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will[fn-12-P1273_693352:251-nf] ,\" we therefore do not reject the statement of Eunomius when he says that the Spirit \"co-operates with the faithful for understanding and contemplation of things appointed\" by Him, because by Him all good teachings are appointed for us. \"Sounding an accompaniment to those who pray.\" It would be foolish seriously to examine the meaning of this expression, of which the ludicrous and meaningless character is at once manifest to all. For who is so demented and beside himself as to wait for us to tell him that the Holy Spirit is not a bell nor an empty cask sounding an accompaniment and made to ring by the voice of him who prays as it were by a blow? \"Leading us to that which is expedient for us.\" This the Father and the Son likewise do: for \"He leadeth Joseph like a sheep[fn-12-P1274_694154:252-nf] ,\" and, \"led His people like sheep[fn-12-P1275_694209:253-nf] ,\" and, \"the good Spirit leadeth us in a land of righteousness[fn-12-P1276_694295:254-nf] .\" \"Strengthening us to godliness.\" To strengthen man to godliness David says is the work of God; \"For Thou art my strength and my refuge[fn-12-P1277_694460:255-nf] ,\" says the Psalmist, and \"the Lord is the strength of His people[fn-12-P1278_694550:256-nf] ,\" and, \"He shall give strength and power unto His people[fn-12-P1279_694630:257-nf] .\" If then the expressions of Eunomius are meant in accordance with the mind of the Psalmist, they are a testimony to the Divinity of the Holy Ghost: but if they are opposed to the word of prophecy, then by this very fact a charge of blasphemy lies against Eunomius, because he sets up his own opinions in opposition to the holy prophets. Next he says, \"Lightening souls with the light of knowledge.\" This grace also the doctrine of godliness ascribes alike to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. For He is called a light by David[fn-12-P1280_695195:258-nf] , and from thence the light of knowledge shines in them who are enlightened. In like manner also the cleansing of our thoughts of which the statement speaks is proper to the power of the Lord. For it was \"the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of His person,\" Who \"purged our sins[fn-12-P1281_695518:259-nf] .\" Again, to banish devils, which Eunomius says is a property of the Spirit, this also the only-begotten God, Who said to the devil, \"I charge thee[fn-12-P1282_695684:260-nf] ,\" ascribes to the power of the Spirit, when He says, \"If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils[fn-12-P1283_695808:261-nf] ,\" so that the expulsion of devils is not destructive of the glory of the Spirit, but rather a demonstration of His divine and transcendent power. \"Healing the sick,\" he says, \"curing the infirm, comforting the afflicted, raising up those who stumble, recovering the distressed.\" These are the words of those who think reverently of the Holy Ghost, for no one would ascribe the operation of any one of these effects to any one except to God. If then heresy affirms that those things which it belongs to none save God alone to effect, are wrought by the power of the Spirit, we have in support of the truths for which we are contending the witness even of our adversaries. How does the Psalmist seek his healing from God, saying, \"Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, for my hones are vexed[fn-12-P1284_696647:262-nf] !\" It is to God that Isaiah says, \"The dew that is from Thee is healing unto them[fn-12-P1285_696747:263-nf] .\" Again, prophetic language attests that the conversion of those in error is the work of God. For \"they went astray in the wilderness in a thirsty land,\" says the Psalmist, and he adds, \"So He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to the city where they dwelt[fn-12-P1286_697050:264-nf] :\" and, \"when the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion[fn-12-P1287_697131:265-nf] .\" In like manner also the comfort of the afflicted is ascribed to God, Paul thus speaking, \"Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1288_697344:266-nf] .\" Again, the Psalmist says, speaking in the person of God \"Thou calledst upon Me in trouble and I delivered thee[fn-12-P1289_697491:267-nf] .\" And the setting upright of those who stumble is innumerable times ascribed by Scripture to the power of the Lord: \"Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall, but the Lord was my help[fn-12-P1290_697703:268-nf] ,\" and \"Though he fall, he shall not be cast away, for the Lord upholdeth him with His hand[fn-12-P1291_697818:269-nf] ,\" and \"The Lord helpeth them that are fallen[fn-12-P1292_697887:270-nf] .\" And to the loving-kindness of God confessedly belongs the recovery of the distressed, if Eunomius means the same thing of which we learn in prophecy, as the Scripture says, \"Thou laidest trouble upon our loins; Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, and Thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place[fn-12-P1293_698246:271-nf] .\"","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_13_lecture_viii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"8.

For by what we have quoted, one who considers the inference to be drawn will understand that the father of falsehood, the maker of death, the inventor of wickedness, being created in a nature intellectual and incorporeal, was not by that nature hindered from becoming what he is by way of change. For the mutability of essence, moved either way at will, involves a capacity of nature that follows the impulse of determination, so as to become that to which its determination leads it. Accordingly they will define the Lord as being capable even of contrary dispositions, drawing Him down as it were to a rank equal with the angels, by the conception of creation[fn-14-P1458_817013:14-nf] . But let them listen to the great voice of Paul. Why is it that he says that He alone has been called Son? Because He is not of the nature of angels, but of that which is more excellent. \"For unto which of the angels said He at any time, `Thou art My Son, This day have I begotten Thee'? and when again He bringeth the first-begotten into the world He saith, `And let all the angels of God worship Him.' And of the angels He saith, `Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire': but of the Son He saith, `Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom[fn-14-P1459_818269:15-nf] ,'\" and all else that the prophecy recites together with these words in declaring His Godhead.

If, then, the Godhead of the Only-begotten is as far above the angelic nature as a master is superior to his slaves, how do they make common either with the sensible creation Him Who is Lord of the creation, or with the nature of the angels Him Who is worshipped by them[fn-14-P1461_819217:17-nf] , by detailing, concerning the manner of His existence, statements which will properly apply to the individual things we contemplate in creation, even as we already showed the account given by heresy, touching the Lord, to be closely and appropriately applicable to the making of the earth?","title":"Book IV","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_15_book_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Four times the name of \"first-born\" or \"first-begotten\" is used by the Apostle in all his writings: but he has made mention of the name in different senses and not in the same manner.

Is it in the sense that the Father is according to nature, while the Son \"varies\" from that nature? Or does he express by this word the perversion of virtue, separating the evil from the more excellent by the name of \"variation,\" so as to regard the one essence in a good, the other? a contrary aspect? Or does he assert that one Divine essence also is variant from another, in the manner of the opposition of the elements? or as war stands to peace, and life to death, does he also perceive in the essences the conflict which so exists among all such things, so that they cannot unite one with another, because the mixture of contraries exerts upon the things mingled a consuming force, as the wisdom of the Proverbs saith of such a doctrine, that water and fire never say \"It is enough[fn-15-P1543_885432:65-nf] ,\" expressing enigmatically the nature of contraries of equal force and equal balance, and their mutual destruction? Or is it in none of these ways that he sees \"variance\" in the essences? Let him tell us, then, what he conceives besides these. He could not say, I take it, even if he were to repeat his wonted phrase[fn-15-P1544_885781:66-nf] , \"The Son is variant from Him Who begat Him\"; for thereby the absurdity of his statements is yet more clearly shown. For what mutual relation is so closely and concordantly engrafted and fitted together as that meaning of relation to the Father expressed by the word \"Son\"? And a proof of this is that even if both of these names be not spoken, that which is omitted is connoted by the one that is uttered, so closely is the one implied in the other, and concordant with it: and both of them are so discerned in the one that one cannot be conceived without the other. Now that which is \"at variance\" is surely so conceived and so called, in opposition to that which is \"in harmony,\" as the plumb-line is in harmony with the straight line, while that which is crooked, when set beside that which is straight, does not harmonize with it. Musicians also are wont to call the agreement of notes \"harmony,\" and that which is out of tune and discordant \"inharmonious.\" To speak of things as at \"variance,\" then, is the same as to speak of them as \"out of harmony.\" If, therefore, the nature of the Only-begotten God is at \"variance,\" to use the heretical phrase, with the essence of the Father, it is surely not in harmony with it: and in harmoniousness cannot exist where there is no possibility of harmony[fn-15-P1545_887738:67-nf] . For the case is as when, the figure in the wax and in the graying of the signet being one, the wax that has been stamped by the signet, when it is fitted again. to the latter, makes the impression on itself accord with that which surrounds it, filling up the hollows and accommodating the projections of the engraving with its own patterns: but if some strange and different pattern is fitted to the engraving of the signet, it makes its own form rough and confused, by rubbing off its figure on an engraved surface that does not correspond with it. But He Who is \"in the form of God[fn-15-P1546_888463:68-nf] \" has been formed by no impression different from the Father, seeing that He is \"the express image\" of the Father's Person[fn-15-P1547_888604:69-nf] , while the \"form of God\" is surely the same thing as His essence. For as, \"being made in the form of a servant[fn-15-P1548_888732:70-nf] ,\" He was formed in the essence of a servant, not taking upon Him the form merely, apart from the essence, but the essence is involved in the sense of \"form,\" so, surely, he who says that He is \"in the form of God\" signified essence by \"form.\" If, therefore, He is \"in the form of God,\" and being in the Father is sealed with the Father's glory, (as the word of the Gospel declares, which saith, \"Him hath God the Father sealed[fn-15-P1549_889178:71-nf] ,\"-whence also \"He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-15-P1550_889256:72-nf] ,\") then \"the image of goodness\" and \"the brightness of glory,\" and all other similar titles, testify that the essence of the Son is not out of harmony with the Father. Thus by the text cited is shown the insubstantial character of the adversaries' blasphemy. For if things at \"variance\" are not in harmony, and He Who is sealed by the Father, and displays the Father in Himself, both being in the Father, and having the Father in Himself[fn-15-P1551_889716:73-nf] , shows in all points His close relation and harmony, then the absurdity of the opposing views is hereby overwhelmingly shown. For as that which is at \"variance\" was shown to be out of harmony, so conversely that which is harmonious is surely confessed beyond dispute not to be at \"variance.\" For as that which is at \"variance\" is not harmonious, so the harmonious is not at \"variance.\" Moreover, he who says that the nature of the Only-begotten is at \"variance\" with the good essence of the Father, clearly has in view variation in the good itself. But as for what that is which is at variance with the good-\"O ye simple,\" as the Proverb saith, \"understand his craftiness[fn-15-P1552_890415:74-nf] !\"","title":"Book IV","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_14_book_vii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"15. Again, any one who is in doubt concerning this matter may gain from the Jews an accurate knowledge of Christ's nature; or rather learn that He was truly born from the Gospel, where it is written, Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill Him because He not only broke the Sabbath, but said also that God was His own Father, making Himself equal with God[fn-15-P1549_989539:19-nf] . This passage is unlike most others in not giving us the words spoken by the Jews, but the Apostle's explanation of their motive in wishing to kill the Lord. We see that no plea of misapprehension can excuse the wickedness of these blasphemers; for we have the Apostle's evidence that the true nature of Christ was fully revealed to them. They could speak of His birth:-He said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God. Was not His clearly a birth of nature from nature, when He published the equality of His nature by speaking of God, by name, as His own Father? Now it is manifest that equality consists in the absence of difference between those who are equal. Is it not also manifest that the result of birth must be a nature in which there is an absence of difference between Son and Father? And this is the only possible origin of true equality; birth can only bring into existence a nature equal to its origin. But again, we can no more hold that there is equality where there is confusion, than we can where there is difference. Thus equality, as of the image[fn-15-P1550_990643:20-nf] , is incompatible with isolation and with diversity; for equality cannot dwell with difference, nor yet in solitude.","title":"Book VII","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_14_book_ii_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"177","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"138.

For this reason we declare the maintenance of their doctrine as to the non-existence at some time of Him Who truly is, to be a denial and rejection of His true Godhead; and this on the ground that, on the one hand, He Who showed Himself to Moses by the light speaks of Himself as being, when He says, \"I am He that is[fn-18-P1819_1059094:4-nf] ,\" while on the other, Isaiah (being made, so to say, the instrument of Him Who spoke in him) says in the person of Him that is, \"I am the first, and hereafter am I[fn-18-P1820_1059276:5-nf] ,\" so that hereby, whichever way we consider it, we conceive eternity in God. And so, too, the word that was spoken to Manoah shows the fact that the Divinity is not comprehensible by the significance of His name, because, when Manoah asks to know His name, that, when the promise has come actually to pass, he may by name glorify his benefactor, He says to him, \"Why askest thou this? It also is wonderful[fn-18-P1821_1059752:6-nf] \"; so that by this we learn that there is one name significant of the Divine Nature-the wonder, namely, that arises unspeakably in our hearts concerning It. So, too, great David, in his discourses with himself, proclaims the same truth, in the sense that all the creation was brought into being by God, while He alone exists always in the same manner, and abides for ever, where he says, \"But Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail[fn-18-P1822_1060224:7-nf] .\" When we hear these sayings, and others like them, from men inspired by God, let us leave all that is not from eternity to the worship of idolaters, as a new thing alien from the true Godhead. For that which now is, and formerly was not, is clearly new and not eternal, and to have regard to any new object of worship is called by Moses the service of demons, when he says, \"They sacrificed to devils and not to God, to gods whom their fathers knew not; new gods were they that came newly up[fn-18-P1823_1060734:8-nf] .\" If then everything that is new in worship is a service of demons, and is alien from the true Godhead, and if what is now, but was not always, is new and not eternal, we who have regard to that which is, necessarily reckon those who contemplate non-existence as attaching to Him Who is, and who say that \"He once was not,\" among the worshippers of idols. For we may also see that the great John, when declaring in his own preaching the Only-begotten God, guards his own statement in every way, so that the conception of non-existence shall find no access to Him Who is. For he says[fn-18-P1824_1061377:9-nf] that He \"was in the beginning,\" and \"was with God,\" and \"was God,\" and was light, and life, and truth, and all good things at all times, and never at any time failed to be anything that is excellent, Who is the fulness of all good, and is in the bosom of the Father. If then Moses lays down as a law for us some such mark of true Godhead as this, that we know nothing else of God but this one thing, that He is (for to this point the words, \"I am He that is[fn-18-P1825_1061854:10-nf] \"); while Isaiah in his preaching declares aloud the absolute infinity of Him Who is, defining the existence of God as having no regard to beginning or to end (for He Who says \"I am the first, and hereafter am I,\" places no limit to His eternity in either direction, so that neither, if we look to the beginning, do we find any point marked since which He is, and beyond which He was not, nor, if 'we turn our thought to the future, can we cut short by any boundary the eternal progress of Him Who is),-and if the prophet David forbids us to worship any new and strange God[fn-18-P1826_1062447:11-nf] (both of which are involved in the heretical doctrine; \"newness\" is clearly indicated in that which is not eternal, and \"strangeness\" is alienation from the Nature of the very God),-if, I say, these things are so, we declare all the sophistical fabrication about the non-existence at some time of Him Who truly is, to be nothing else than a departure from Christianity, and a turning to idolatry. For when the Evangelist, in his discourse concerning the Nature of God, separates at all points non-existence from Him Who is, and, by his constant repetition of the word \"was,\" carefully destroys the suspicion of non-existence, and calls Him the Only-begotten God, the Word of God, the Son of God, equal with God, and all such names, we have this judgment fixed and settled in us, that if the Only-begotten Son is God, we must believe that He Who is believed to be God is eternal. And indeed He is verily God, and assuredly is eternal, and is never at any time found to be non-existent. For God, as we have often said, if He now is, also assuredly always was, and if He once was not, neither does He now exist at all. But since even the enemies of the truth confess that the Son is and continually abides the Only-begotten God, we say this, that, being in the Father, He is not in Him in one respect only, but He is in Him altogether, in respect of all that the Father is conceived to be. As, then, being in the incorruptibility of the Father, He is incorruptible, good in His goodness, powerful in His might, and, as being in each of these attributes of special excellence which are conceived of the Father, He is that particular thing, so, also, being in His eternity, He is assuredly eternal. Now the eternity of the Father is marked by His never having taken His being from nonexistence, and never terminating His being in non-existence. He, therefore, Who hath all things that are the Father's[fn-18-P1827_1064368:12-nf] , and is contemplated in all the glory of the Father, even as, being in the endlessness of the Father, He has no end, so, being in the unoriginateness of the Father, has, as the Apostle says, \"no beginning of days[fn-18-P1828_1064604:13-nf] ,\" but at once is \"of the Father,\" and is regarded in the eternity of the Father:and in this respect, more especially, is seen the complete absence of divergence in the Likeness, as compared with Him Whose Likeness He is. And herein is His saying found true which tells us, \"He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-18-P1829_1064939:14-nf] .\" Moreover, it is in this way that those words of the Apostle, that the Son is \"the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His Person[fn-18-P1830_1065106:15-nf] ,\" are best understood to have an excellent and close application. For the Apostle conveys to those hearers who are unable, by the contemplation of purely intellectual objects, to elevate their thought to the height of the knowledge of God, a sort of notion of the truth, by means of things apparent to sense. For as the body of the sun is expressly imaged by the whole disc that surrounds it, and he who looks on the sun argues, by means of what he sees, the existence of the whole solid substratum, so, he says, the majesty of the Father is expressly imaged in the greatness of the power of the Son, that the one may be believed to be as great as the other is known to be: and again, as the radiance of light sheds its brilliancy from the whole of the sun's disc (for in the disc one part is not radiant, and the rest dim), so all that glory which the Father is, sheds its brilliancy from its whole extent by means of the brightness that comes from it, that is, by the true Light; and as the ray is of the sun (for there would be no ray if the sun were not), yet the sun is never conceived as existing by itself without the ray of brightness that is shed from it, so the Apostle delivering to us the continuity and eternity of that existence which the Only-begotten has of the Father, calls the Son \"the brightness of His glory.\"","title":"Book VIII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_19_book_viii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Now these modes of generation being well known to men, the loving dispensation of the Holy Spirit, in delivering to us the Divine mysteries, conveys its instruction on those matters which transcend language by means of what is within our capacity, as it does also constantly elsewhere, when it portrays the Divinity in bodily terms, making mention, in speaking concerning God, of His eye, His eyelids, His ear, His fingers, His hand, His right hand, His arm, His feet, His shoes[fn-18-P1850_1080766:24-nf] , and the like,-none of which things is apprehended to belong in its primary sense to the Divine Nature,-but turning its teaching to what we can easily perceive, it describes by, terms well worn in human use, facts that are beyond every name, while by each of the terms employed concerning God we are led analogically to some more exalted conception. In this way, then, it employs the numerous forms of generation to present to us, from the inspired teaching, the unspeakable existence of the Only-begotten, taking just so much from each as may be reverently admitted into our conceptions concerning God. For as its mention of \"fingers,\" \"hand,\" and \"arm,\" in speaking of God, does not by the phrase portray the structure of the limb out of bones and sinews and flesh and ligaments, but signifies by such an expression His effective and operative power, and as it indicates by each of the other words of this kind those conceptions concerning God which correspond to them, not admitting the corporeal senses of the words, so also it speaks indeed of the forms of these modes of coming into being as applied to the Divine Nature, yet does not speak in that sense which our customary knowledge enables us to understand. For when it speaks of the formative power, it calls that particular energy by the name of \"generation,\" because the word expressive of Divine power must needs descend to our lowliness, yet it does not indicate all that is associated with formative generation among ourselves,-neither place nor time nor preparation of material, nor the co-operation of instruments, nor the purpose in the things produced, but it leaves these out of sight, and greatly and loftily claims for God the generation of the things that are, where it says, \"He spake and they were begotten, He commanded and they were created[fn-18-P1851_1082649:25-nf] .\" Again, when it expounds that unspeakable and transcendent existence which the Only-begotten has from the Father, because human poverty is incapable of the truths that are too high for speech or thought, it uses our language here also, and calls Him by the name of \"Son,\"-a name which our ordinary use applies to those who are produced by matter and nature. But just as the word, which tells us in reference to God of the \"generation\" of the creation, did not add the statement that it was generated by the aid of any material, declaring that its material substance, its place, its time, and all the like, had their existence in the power of His will, so here too, in speaking of the \"Son,\" it leaves out of sight both all other things which human nature sees in earthly generation (passions, I mean, and dispositions, and the co-operation of time and the need of place, and especially matter), without all which earthly generation as a result of nature does not occur. Now every such conception of matter and interval being excluded from the sense of the word \"Son,\" nature alone remains, and hereby in the word \"Son\" is declared concerning the Only-begotten the close and true character of His manifestation from the Father. And since this particular species of generation did not suffice to produce in us an adequate idea of the unspeakable existence of the Only-begotten, it employs also another species of generation, that which is the result of efflux, to express the Divine Nature of the Son, and calls Him \"the brightness of glory[fn-18-P1852_1084218:26-nf] ,\" the \"savour of ointment[fn-18-P1853_1084261:27-nf] ,\" the \"breath of God[fn-18-P1854_1084308:28-nf] ,\" which our accustomed use, in the scientific discussion we have already made, calls material efflux. But just as in the previous cases neither the making of creation nor the significance of the word \"Son\" admitted time, or matter, or place, or passion, so here also the phrase, purifying the sense of \"brightness\" and the other terms from every material conception, and employing only that element in this particular species of generation which is suitable to the Divinity, points by the force of this mode of expression to the truth that He is conceived as being both from Him and with Him. For neither does the word \"breath\" present to us dispersion into the air from the underlying matter, nor \"savour\" the transference that takes place from the quality of the ointment to the air, nor \"brightness\" the efflux by means of rays from the body of the sun; but this only, as we have said, is manifested by this particular mode of generation, that He is conceived to be of Him and also with Him, no intermediate interval existing between the Father and that Son Who is of Him. And since, in its abundant loving-kindness, the grace of the Holy Spirit has ordered that our conceptions concerning the Only-begotten Son should arise in us from many sources, it has added also the remaining species of things contemplated in generation,-that, I mean, which is the result of mind and word. But the lofty John uses especial foresight that the hearer may not by any means by inattention or feebleness of thought fall into the common understanding of \"Word,\" so that the Son should be supposed to be the voice of the Father. For this reason he prepares us at his first proclamation to regard the Word as in essence, and not in any essence foreign to or dissevered from that essence whence It has Its being, but in that first and blessed Nature. For this is what he teaches us when he says the Word \"was in the beginning[fn-18-P1855_1086239:29-nf] ,\" and \"was with God[fn-18-P1856_1086283:30-nf] ,\" being Himself also both God and all else that the \"Beginning\" is. For thus it is that he makes his discourse on the Godhead, touching the eternity of the Only-begotten. Seeing then that these modes of generation (those, I mean, which are the result of cause) are ordinarily known among us, and are employed by Holy Scripture for our instruction on the subjects before us, in such a way as it might be expected that each of them would be applied to the presentation of Divine conceptions, let the reader of our argument \"judge righteous judgement[fn-18-P1857_1086855:31-nf] ,\" whether any of the assertions that heresy makes have any force against the truth.","title":"Book VIII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_19_book_viii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"I will now once more subjoin the actual language of my opponent, word for word. It runs thus:-\"While there are,\" he says, \"two statements which we have made, the one, that the essence of the Only-begotten was not before its own generation, the other, that, being generated, it was before all things-\" What kind of generation does our dogmatist propose to us? Is it one of which we may fittingly think and speak in regard to God? And who is so godless as to pre-suppose non-existence in God? But it is clear that he has in view this material generation of ours, and is making the lower nature the teacher of his conceptions concerning the Only-begotten God, and since an ox or an ass or a camel is not before its own generation, he thinks it proper to say even of the Only-begotten God that which the course of the lower nature presents to our view in the case of the animals, without thinking, corporeal theologian that he is, of this fact, that the predicate \"Only-begotten\", applied to God, signifies by the very word itself that which is not in common with all begetting, and is peculiar to Him. How could the term \"Only-begotten\" be used of this \"generation,\" if it had community and identity of meaning with other generation? That there is something unique and exceptional to be understood in His case, which is not to be remarked in other generation, is distinctly and suitably expressed by the appellation of \"Only-begotten\"; as, were any element of the lower generation conceived in it, He Who in respect of any of the attributes of His generation was placed on a level with other things that are begotten would no longer be \"Only-begotten.\" For if the same things are to be said of Him which are said of the other things that come into being by generation, the definition will transform the sense of \"Only-begotten\" to signify a kind of relationship involving brotherhood. If then the sense of \"Only-begotten\" points to absence of mixture and community with the rest. of generated things, we shall not admit that anything which we behold in the lower generation is also to be conceived in the case of that existence which the Son has from the Father. But non-existence before generation is proper to all things that exist by generation: therefore this is foreign to the special character of the Only-begotten, to which the name \"Only-begotten\" bears witness that there attaches nothing belonging to the mode of that form of common generation which Eunomius misapprehends. Let this materialist and friend of the senses be persuaded therefore to correct the error of his conception by the other forms of generation. What will you say when you hear of the \"brightness of glory\" or of the \"savour of ointment[fn-18-P1861_1090276:32-nf] ?\" That the \"brightness\" was not before its own generation? But if you answer thus, you will surely admit that neither did the \"glory\" exist, nor the \"ointment\": for it is not possible that the \"glory\" should be conceived as having existed by itself, dark and lustreless, or the \"ointment\" without producing its sweet breath: so that if the \"brightness\" \"was not,\" the \"glory\" also surely \"was not,\" and the \"savour\" being non-existent, there is also proved the non-existence of the \"ointment.\" But if these examples taken from Scripture excite any man's fear, on the ground that they do not accurately present to us the majesty of the Only-begotten, because neither is essentially the same with its substratum-neither the exhalation with the ointment, nor the beam with the sun-let the true Word correct his fear, Who was in the Beginning and is all that the Beginning is, and existent before all; since John so declares in his preaching, \"And the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-18-P1862_1091316:33-nf] .\" If then the Father is God and the Son is God, what doubt still remains with regard to the perfect Divinity of the Only-begotten, when by the sense of the word \"Son\" is acknowledged the close relationship of Nature, by \"brightness\" the conjunction and inseparability, and by the appellation of \"God,\" applied alike to the Father and the Son, their absolute equality, while the \"express image,\" contemplated in reference to the whole Person[fn-18-P1863_1091774:34-nf] of the Father, marks the absence of any defect in the Son's proper greatness, and the \"form of God\" indicates His complete identity by showing in itself all those marks by which the Godhead is betokened.","title":"Book VIII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_19_book_viii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Let us now set forth Eunomius' statement once more. \"He was not,\" he says, \"before His own generation.\" Who is it of Whom he says \"He was not\"?

For he who speaks, of the ray of the lamp indicates also that the lamp shines, and he who says that the ray \"is not,\" signifies also the extinction of that which gives light: so that when the Son is said not to be thereby is also maintained as a necessary consequence the non-existence of the Father.

Since then they maintain that the Son (that is, the \"brightness of the glory,\") \"was not\" before He was begotten, and since logical consequence involves also, together with the non-existence of the brightness, the abolition of the glory, and the Father is the glory whence came the brightness of the Only-begotten Light, let these men who are wise over-much consider that they are manifestly supporters of the Epicurean doctrines, preaching atheism under the guise of Christianity.

For if the soul of the Son and the Son Himself are one in the same sense in which the Father and the Son are one, then the Father and the Soul will be one and the soul of the Son shall one day say `He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father;'[fn-42-P4247_1093394:195-nf] but this is not so; God forbid. For the Son and the Father are one because there is no distinction between their qualities, but the soul and the Son are distinguished alike in nature and substance, in that the soul which is naturally of one substance with us was made by Him. For if the soul and the Son are one in the same manner in which the Father anti the Son are one, as Origen would have it, then the soul equally with the Son will be `the brightness of God's glory and express image of His person.'[fn-42-P4248_1093920:196-nf] But this is impossible; impossible that the Son and the soul should be one as He and the Father are one.

Now, to meet this objection, we must explain the nature[fn-44-P4422_1428760:123-nf] of the soul. We must at the outset hold fast the meaning of the Greek scripture, which has afflatus, not spirit.[fn-44-P4423_1428890:124-nf] Some interpreters of the Greek, without reflecting on the difference of the words, and careless about their exact meaning, put spirit for afflatus; they thus afford to heretics an opportunity of tarnishing[fn-44-P4424_1429349:125-nf] the Spirit of God, that is to say, God Himself, with default. And now comes the question. Afflatus, observe then, is less than spirit, although it comes from spirit; it is the spirit's gentle breeze,[fn-44-P4425_1429568:126-nf] but it is not the spirit. Now a breeze is rarer than the wind; and although it proceeds from wind, yet a breeze is not the wind. One may call a breeze the image of the spirit. In the same manner, man is the image of God, that is, of spirit; for God is spirit. Afflatus is therefore the image of the spirit. Now the image is not in any case equal to the very thing.[fn-44-P4426_1429949:127-nf] It is one thing to be like the reality, and another thing to be the reality itself. So, although the afflatus is the image of the spirit, it is yet not possible to compare the image of God in such a way, that, because the reality-that is, the spirit, or in other words, the Divine Being-is faultless, therefore the afflatus also, that is to say, the image, ought not by any possibility to have done wrong. In this respect will the image be less than the reality, and the afflatus inferior to the spirit, in that, while it possesses beyond doubt the true lineaments of divinity, such as an immortal soul, freedom and its own mastery over itself, foreknowledge in a great degree,[fn-44-P4427_1430644:128-nf] reasonableness, capacity of understanding and knowledge, it is even in these respects an image still, and never amounts to the actual power of Deity, nor to absolute exemption from fault,-a property which is only conceded to God, that is, to the reality, and which is simply incompatible with an image. An image, although it may express all the lineaments of the reality, is yet wanting in its intrinsic power; it is destitute of motion. In like manner, the soul, the image of the spirit, is unable to express the simple power thereof, that is to say, its happy exemption from sinning.[fn-44-P4428_1431248:129-nf] Were it otherwise,[fn-44-P4429_1431302:130-nf] it would not be soul, but spirit; not man, who received a soul, but God. Besides, to take another view of the matter,[fn-44-P4430_1431436:131-nf] not everything which pertains to God will be regarded as God, so that you would not maintain that His afflatus was God, that is, exempt from fault, because it is the breath of God. And in an act of your own, such as blowing into a flute, you would not thereby make the flute human, although it was your own human breath which you breathed into it, precisely as God breathed of His own Spirit, In fact,[fn-44-P4431_1431861:132-nf] the Scripture, by expressly saying[fn-44-P4432_1431912:133-nf] that God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, and that man became thereby a living soul, not a life-giving spirit, has distinguished that soul from the condition of the Creator. The work must necessarily be distinct from the workman, and it is inferior to him. The pitcher will not be the potter, although made by the potter; nor in like manner, will the afflatus, because made by the spirit, be on that account the spirit. The soul has often been called by the same name as the breath. You should also take care that no descent be made from the breath to a still lower quality. So you have granted (you say) the infirmity of the soul, which you denied before! Undoubtedly, when you demand for it an equality with God, that is, a freedom from fault, I contend that it is infirm. But when the comparison is challenged with an angel, I am compelled to maintain that the head over all things is the stronger of the two, to whom the angels are ministers,[fn-44-P4433_1432895:134-nf] who is destined to be the judge of angels,[fn-44-P4434_1432957:135-nf] if he shall stand fast in the law of God-an obedience which he refused at first. Now this disobedience[fn-44-P4435_1433081:136-nf] it was possible for the afflatus of God to commit: it was possible, but it was not proper. The possibility lay in its slenderness of nature, as being the breath and not the spirit; the impropriety, however, arose from its power of will, as being free, and not a slave. It was furthermore assisted by the warning against committing sin under the threat of incurring death, which was meant to be a support for its slender nature, and a direction for its liberty of choice. So that the soul can no longer appear to have sinned, because it has an affinity with God, that is to say, through the afflatus, but rather through that which was an addition to its nature, that is, through its free-will, which was indeed given to it by God in accordance with His purpose and reason, but recklessly employed[fn-44-P4436_1433944:137-nf] by man according as he chose. This, then, being the case, the entire course[fn-44-P4437_1434037:138-nf] of God's action is purged from all imputation to evil. For the liberty of the will will not retort its own wrong on Him by whom it was bestowed, but on him by whom it was improperly used. What is the evil, then, which you want to impute to the Creator? If it is man's sin, it will not be God's fault, because it is man's doing; nor is that Being to be regarded as the author of the sin, who turns out to be its forbidder, nay, its condemner. If death is the evil, death will not give the reproach of being its own author to Him who threatened it, but to him who despised it. For by his contempt he introduced it, which assuredly[fn-44-P4438_1434685:139-nf] would not have appeared had man not despised it.","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_21_lecture_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"22.

The reader may judge for himself the meaning of his words: they run as follows,-\"Who, by being called `Angel,' clearly showed by Whom He published His words, and Who is the Existent, while by being addressed also as God, He showed His superiority over all things. For He Who is the God of all things that were made by Him, is the Angel of the God over all.\" Indignation rushes into my heart and interrupts my discourse, and under this emotion arguments are lost in a turmoil of anger roused by words like these. And perhaps I may be pardoned for feeling such emotion. For whose resentment would not be stirred within him at such profanity, when he remembers how the Apostle proclaims that every angelic nature is subject to the Lord, and in witness of his doctrine invokes the sublime utterances of the prophets:-\"When He bringeth the first-begotten into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him,\" and, \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever,\" and, \"Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail[fn-20-P2039_1232013:20-nf] \"? When the Apostle has gone through all this argument to demonstrate the unapproachable majesty of the Only-begotten God, what must I feel when I hear from the adversary of Christ that the Lord of Angels is Himself only an Angel,-and when he does not let such a statement fall by chance, but puts forth his strength to maintain this monstrous invention, so that it may be established that his Lord has no superiority over John and Moses? For the word says concerning them, \"This is he of whom it is written, `Behold I send my angel before thy face[fn-20-P2040_1232658:21-nf] .'\" John therefore is an angel. But the enemy of the Lord, even though he grants his Lord the name of God, yet makes Him out to be on a level with the deity of Moses, since he too was a servant of the God over all, and was constituted a god to the Egyptians[fn-20-P2041_1233084:22-nf] . And yet this phrase, \"over all,\" as has been previously observed, is common to the Son with the Father, the Apostle having expressly ascribed such a title to Him, when he says, \"Of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Who is God over all[fn-20-P2042_1233354:23-nf] .\" But this man degrades the Lord of angels to the rank of an angel, as though he had not heard that the angels are \"ministering spirits,\" and \"a flame of fire[fn-20-P2043_1233531:24-nf] .\" For by the use of these distinctive terms does the Apostle make the difference between the several subjects clear and unmistakable, defining the subordinate nature to be \"spirits\" and \"fire,\" and distinguishing the supreme power by the name of Godhead. And yet, though there are so many that proclaim the glory of the Only-begotten God, against them all Eunomius lifts up his single voice, calling the Christ \"an angel of the God over all,\" defining Him, by thus contrasting Him with the \"God over all,\" to be one of the \"all things,\" and, by giving Him the same name as the angels, trying to establish that He no wise differs from them in nature: for he has often previously said that all those things which share the same name cannot be different in nature. Does the argument, then, still lack its censors, as it concerns a man who proclaims in so many words that the \"Angel\" does not publish His own word, but that of the Existent? For it is by this means that he tries to show that the Word Who was in the beginning, the Word Who was God, is not Himself the Word, but is the Word of some other Word, being its minister and \"angel.\" And who knows not that the only opposite to the \"Existent\" is the nonexistent? so that he who contrasts the Son with the Existent, is clearly playing the Jew, robbing the Christian doctrine of the Person of the Only-begotten. For in saying that He is excluded from the title of the \"Existent,\" he is assuredly trying to establish also that He is outside the pale of existence: for surely if he grants Him existence, he will not quarrel about the sound of the word.","title":"Book XI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_22_book_xi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"For it is not as if he had but let fall something of the kind just once under some headlong and inconsiderate impulse, and in what followed had striven to retrieve his error: no, he dallies lingeringly with the malignity, striving in his later statements to surpass what had gone before.

And perhaps I may be pardoned for feeling such emotion. For whose resentment would not be stirred within him at such profanity, when he remembers how the Apostle proclaims that every angelic nature is subject to the Lord, and in witness of his doctrine invokes the sublime utterances of the prophets:-\"When He bringeth the first-begotten into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him,\" and, \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever,\" and, \"Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail[fn-20-P2039_1232013:20-nf] \"? When the Apostle has gone through all this argument to demonstrate the unapproachable majesty of the Only-begotten God, what must I feel when I hear from the adversary of Christ that the Lord of Angels is Himself only an Angel,-and when he does not let such a statement fall by chance, but puts forth his strength to maintain this monstrous invention, so that it may be established that his Lord has no superiority over John and Moses? For the word says concerning them, \"This is he of whom it is written, `Behold I send my angel before thy face[fn-20-P2040_1232658:21-nf] .'\" John therefore is an angel. But the enemy of the Lord, even though he grants his Lord the name of God, yet makes Him out to be on a level with the deity of Moses, since he too was a servant of the God over all, and was constituted a god to the Egyptians[fn-20-P2041_1233084:22-nf] . And yet this phrase, \"over all,\" as has been previously observed, is common to the Son with the Father, the Apostle having expressly ascribed such a title to Him, when he says, \"Of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Who is God over all[fn-20-P2042_1233354:23-nf] .\" But this man degrades the Lord of angels to the rank of an angel, as though he had not heard that the angels are \"ministering spirits,\" and \"a flame of fire[fn-20-P2043_1233531:24-nf] .\" For by the use of these distinctive terms does the Apostle make the difference between the several subjects clear and unmistakable, defining the subordinate nature to be \"spirits\" and \"fire,\" and distinguishing the supreme power by the name of Godhead. And yet, though there are so many that proclaim the glory of the Only-begotten God, against them all Eunomius lifts up his single voice, calling the Christ \"an angel of the God over all,\" defining Him, by thus contrasting Him with the \"God over all,\" to be one of the \"all things,\" and, by giving Him the same name as the angels, trying to establish that He no wise differs from them in nature: for he has often previously said that all those things which share the same name cannot be different in nature. Does the argument, then, still lack its censors, as it concerns a man who proclaims in so many words that the \"Angel\" does not publish His own word, but that of the Existent? For it is by this means that he tries to show that the Word Who was in the beginning, the Word Who was God, is not Himself the Word, but is the Word of some other Word, being its minister and \"angel.\" And who knows not that the only opposite to the \"Existent\" is the nonexistent? so that he who contrasts the Son with the Existent, is clearly playing the Jew, robbing the Christian doctrine of the Person of the Only-begotten.

For Arius and Eunomius, asserting the only begotten Son of God to be a creature, and made out of the non-existent, and a servant, have ventured to apply to His godhead what is said in lowly and human sense; establishing by such means the difference of substance and the unlikeness. Besides this, to be brief, he argues that the very impassible and immutable Godhead of the Christ suffered, and was crucified, dead, and buried. This goes beyond even the madness of Arius and Eunomius, for this pitch of impiety has not been reached even by them that dare to call the maker and creator of the universe a creature. Furthermore he blasphemes against the Holy Ghost, denying that It proceeds from the Father, in accordance with the word of the Lord, but maintaining that It has Its origin of the Son. Here we have the fruit of the Apollinarian seed; here we come near the evil husbandry of Macedonius. Such are the offspring of the Egyptian, viler children of a vile father. This growth, which men, entrusted with the healing of souls, ought to make abortive while yet in the womb, or destroy as soon as it is born, as dangerous and deadly to mankind, is cherished by these excellent persons, and promoted with great energy, alike to their own ruin and to that of all who will listen to them.We, on the contrary, earnestly desire to keep our heritage untouched; and the faith which we have received, and in which we have been ourselves baptized, and baptize others, we strive to preserve uninjured and undefiled. We confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and body, was begotten of the Father before the ages, as touching the Godhead; and in the last days for us men and our salvation (was born) of the Virgin Mary; that the same Lord is of one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, and of one substance with us as touching the manhood. For there was an union of two natures. Wherefore we acknowledge one Christ, one Son, one Lord; but we do not destroy the union; we believe it to have been made without confusion, in obedience to the word of the Lord to the Jews, \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-65-P6501_1678851:549-nf] If on the contrary there had been mixture and confusion, and one nature was made out of both, He ought to have said \"Destroy me and in three days I shall be raised.\" But now, to show that there is a distinction between God according to His nature, and the temple, and that both are one Christ, His words are \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,\" clearly teaching that it was not God who was undergoing destruction, but the temple. The nature of this latter was susceptible of destructions while the power of the former raised what was being destroyed. Furthermore it is in obedience to the divine Scriptures that we acknowledge the Christ to be God and man. That our Lord Jesus Christ is God is asserted by the blessed evangelist John \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was. God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made that was made.\"[fn-65-P6502_1679824:550-nf] And again, \"That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\"[fn-65-P6503_1679932:551-nf] And the Lord Himself distinctly teaches us, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\"[fn-65-P6504_1680039:552-nf] And \"I and my Father are one\"[fn-65-P6505_1680089:553-nf] and \"I am in the Father and the Father in me,\"[fn-65-P6506_1680155:554-nf] and the blessed Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews says \"Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power\"[fn-65-P6507_1680368:555-nf] and in the epistle to the Philippians \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant.\"[fn-65-P6508_1680634:556-nf] And in the Epistle to the Romans, \"Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever. Amen.\"[fn-65-P6509_1680830:557-nf] And in the epistle to Titus \"Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.\"[fn-65-P6510_1680985:558-nf] And Isaiah exclaims \"Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called, Angel of great counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, powerful, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the Age to come.\"[fn-65-P6511_1681278:559-nf] And again \"In chains they shall come over and they shall fall unto thee. They shall make supplication unto thee shying, surely God is in thee anti there is none else, there is no God.

This, to be sure,[fn-61-P6139_1837638:838-nf] was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him\"[fn-61-P6140_1837814:839-nf] -Him, that is, not Moses or Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of Moses and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must have forbidden all[fn-61-P6141_1838040:840-nf] others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he prohibited those whom he did display? Now, even if their presence was necessary, they surely should not be represented as conversing together, which is a sign of familiarity; nor as associated in glory with him, for this indicates respect and graciousness; but they should be shown in some slough[fn-61-P6142_1838493:841-nf] as a sure token of their ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was sent to disperse, far removed from the glory of Him who was about to sever their words and writings from His gospel. This, then, is the way[fn-61-P6143_1838751:842-nf] how he demonstrates them to be aliens,[fn-61-P6144_1838802:843-nf] even by keeping them in his own company! This is how he shows they ought to be relinquished: he associates them with himself instead! This is how he destroys them: he irradiates them with his glory! How would their own Christ act? I suppose He would have imitated the frowardness (of heresy),[fn-61-P6145_1839128:844-nf] and revealed them just as Marcion's Christ was bound to do, or at least as having with Him any others rather than His own prophets! But what could so well befit the Creator's Christ, as to manifest Him in the company of His own foreannouncers?[fn-61-P6146_1839403:845-nf] -to let Him be seen with those to whom He had appeared in revelations?-to let Him be speaking with those who had spoken of Him?-to share His glory with those by whom He used to be called the Lord of glory; even with those chief servants of His, one of whom was once the moulder[fn-61-P6147_1839703:846-nf] of His people, the other afterwards the reformer[fn-61-P6148_1839810:847-nf] thereof; one the initiator of the Old Testament, the other the consummator[fn-61-P6149_1839930:848-nf] of the New? Well therefore does Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble connection with Him, suggest an expedient: \"It is good for us to be here\" (good: that evidently means to be where Moses and Elias are); \"and let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. But he knew not what he said.\"[fn-61-P6150_1840483:849-nf] How knew not? Was his ignorance the result of simple error? Or was it on the principle which we maintain[fn-61-P6151_1840608:850-nf] in the cause of the new prophecy,[fn-61-P6152_1840959:851-nf] that to grace ecstasy or rapture[fn-61-P6153_1841018:852-nf] is incident. For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, especially when he beholds the glory of God, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily loses his sensation,[fn-61-P6154_1841199:853-nf] because he is overshadowed with the power of God,-a point concerning which there is a question between us and the carnally-minded.[fn-61-P6155_1841352:854-nf] Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture[fn-61-P6156_1842177:855-nf] of Peter. For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the law forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the Spirit? And therefore, because it was in the Spirit that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not know what he had said. But if, on the other hand,[fn-61-P6157_1842594:856-nf] he was thus ignorant, because he erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, \"Whom they thought Him to be,\" meant the Creator's Christ, when he answered, \"Thou art the Christ; \"because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival god, he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in error here because of his previous erroneous opinion,[fn-61-P6158_1843038:857-nf] then you may be sure that up to that very day no new divinity had been revealed by Christ, and that Peter had so far made no mistake, because hitherto Christ had revealed nothing of the kind; and that Christ accordingly was not to be regarded as belonging to any other than the Creator, whose entire dispensation[fn-61-P6159_1843388:858-nf] he, in fact, here described. He selects from His disciples three witnesses of the impending vision and voice. And this is just the way of the Creator. \"In the mouth of three witnesses,\" says He, \"shall every word be established.\"[fn-61-P6160_1843707:859-nf] He withdraws to a mountain. In the nature of the place I see much meaning. For the Creator had originally formed His ancient people on a mountain both with visible glory and His voice. It was only tight that the New Testament should be attested[fn-61-P6161_1843999:860-nf] on such an elevated spot[fn-61-P6162_1844043:861-nf] as that whereon the Old Testament had been composed;[fn-61-P6163_1844119:862-nf] under a like covering of cloud also, which nobody will doubt, was condensed out of the Creator's air. Unless, indeed, he[fn-61-P6164_1844267:863-nf] had brought down his own clouds thither, because he had himself forced his way through the Creator's heaven;[fn-61-P6165_1844398:864-nf] or else it was only a precarious cloud,[fn-61-P6166_1844500:865-nf] as it were, of the Creator which he used. On the present (as also on the former)[fn-61-P6167_1844705:866-nf] occasion, therefore, the cloud was not silent; but there was the accustomed voice from heaven, and the Father's testimony to the Son; precisely as in the first Psalm He had said, \"Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.\"[fn-61-P6168_1844948:867-nf] By the mouth of Isaiah also He had asked concerning Him, \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6169_1845101:868-nf] When therefore He here presents Him with the words, \"This is my (beloved) Son,\" this clause is of course understood, \"whom I have promised.\" For if He once promised, and then afterwards says, \"This is He,\" it is suitable conduct for one who accomplishes His purpose[fn-61-P6170_1845415:869-nf] that He should utter His voice in proof of the promise which He had formerly made; but unsuitable in one who is amenable to the retort, Can you, indeed, have a right to say, \"This is my son,\" concerning whom you have given us no previous information,[fn-61-P6171_1845694:870-nf] any more than you have favoured us with a revelation about your own prior existence? \"Hear ye Him,\" therefore, whom from the beginning (the Creator) had declared entitled to be heard in the name of a prophet, since it was as a prophet that He had to be regarded by the people. \"A prophet,\" says Moses, \"shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your sons\" (that is, of course, after a carnal descent[fn-61-P6172_1846178:871-nf] ); \"unto Him shall ye hearken, as unto me.\"[fn-61-P6173_1846264:872-nf] \"Every one who will not hearken unto Him, his soul[fn-61-P6174_1846339:873-nf] shall be cut off from amongst his people.\"[fn-61-P6175_1846402:874-nf] , So also Isaiah: \"Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear the voice of His Son.\"[fn-61-P6176_1846522:875-nf] This voice the Father was going Himself to recommend. For, says he,[fn-61-P6177_1846609:876-nf] He establishes the words of His Son, when He says, \"This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him.\" Therefore, even if there be made a transfer of the obedient \"heating\" from Moses and Elias to[fn-61-P6178_1847561:877-nf] Christ, it is still not from[fn-61-P6179_1847684:878-nf] another God, or to another Christ; but from\" the Creator to His Christ, in consequence of the departure of the old covenant and the supervening of the new. \"Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but He Himself,\" says Isaiah, \"shall save them; \"[fn-61-P6180_1847960:879-nf] for it is He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law and the prophets. The Father gave to the Son new disciples,[fn-61-P6181_1848177:880-nf] after that Moses and Elias had been exhibited along with Him in the honour of His glory, and had then been dismissed as having fully discharged their duty and office, for the express purpose of affirming for Marcion's information the fact that Moses and Elias had a share in even the glory of Christ. But we have the entire structure[fn-61-P6182_1848541:881-nf] of this same vision in Habakkuk also, where the Spirit in the person of some[fn-61-P6183_1848634:882-nf] of the apostles says, \"O Lord, I have heard Thy speech, and was afraid.\" What speech was this, other than the words of the voice from heaven, This is my beloved Son, hear ye, Him? \"I considered thy works, and was astonished.\" When could this have better happened than when Peter, on seeing His glory, knew not what he was saying? \"In the midst of the two Thou shalt be known\"-even Moses and Elias.[fn-61-P6184_1849050:883-nf] These likewise did Zechariah see under the figure of the two olive trees and olive branches.[fn-61-P6185_1849261:884-nf] For these are they of whom he says, \"They are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.\" And again Habakkuk says, \"His glory covered the heavens\" (that is, with that cloud), \"and His splendour shall be like the light-even the light, wherewith His very raiment glistened.\" And if we would make mention of[fn-61-P6186_1849613:885-nf] the promise to Moses, we shall find it accomplished here. For when Moses desired to see the Lord, saying, \"If therefore I have found grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself to me, that I may see Thee distinctly,\"[fn-61-P6187_1849874:886-nf] the sight which he desired to have was of that condition which he was to assume as man, and which as a prophet he knew was to occur. Respecting the face of God, however, he had already heard, \"No man shall see me, and live.\" \"This thing,\" said He, \"which thou hast spoken, will I do unto thee.\" Then Moses said, \"Show me Thy glory.\" And the Lord, with like reference to the future, replied, \"I will pass before thee in my glory,\" etc. Then at the last He says, \"And then thou shall see my back.\"[fn-61-P6188_1850423:887-nf] Not loins, or calves of the legs, did he want to behold, but the glory which was to be revealed in the latter days.[fn-61-P6189_1850569:888-nf] He had promised that He would make Himself thus face to face visible to him, when He said to Aaron, \"If there shall be a prophet among you, I will make myself known to him by vision, and by vision will I speak with him; but not so is my manner to Moses; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently\" (that is to say, in the form of man which He was to assume), \"and not in dark speeches.\"[fn-61-P6190_1851193:889-nf] Now, although Marcion has denied[fn-61-P6191_1851248:890-nf] that he is here represented as speaking with the Lord, but only as standing, yet, inasmuch as he stood \"mouth to mouth,\" he must also have stood \"face to face\" with him, to use his words,[fn-61-P6192_1851451:891-nf] not far from him, in His very glory-not to say,[fn-61-P6193_1851553:892-nf] in His presence. And with this glory he went away enlightened from Christ, just as he used to do from the Creator; as then to dazzle the eyes of the children of Israel, so now to smite those of the blinded Marcion, who has failed to see how this argument also makes against him.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"93","folder":"ANF-03","text":"You ought to be very much ashamed of yourself on this account too, for permitting him to appear on the retired mountain in the company of Moses and Elias,[fn-61-P6138_1837568:837-nf] whom he had come to destroy. This, to be sure,[fn-61-P6139_1837638:838-nf] was what he wished to be understood as the meaning of that voice from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him\"[fn-61-P6140_1837814:839-nf] -Him, that is, not Moses or Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of Moses and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must have forbidden all[fn-61-P6141_1838040:840-nf] others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the others whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he prohibited those whom he did display? Now, even if their presence was necessary, they surely should not be represented as conversing together, which is a sign of familiarity; nor as associated in glory with him, for this indicates respect and graciousness; but they should be shown in some slough[fn-61-P6142_1838493:841-nf] as a sure token of their ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was sent to disperse, far removed from the glory of Him who was about to sever their words and writings from His gospel. This, then, is the way[fn-61-P6143_1838751:842-nf] how he demonstrates them to be aliens,[fn-61-P6144_1838802:843-nf] even by keeping them in his own company! This is how he shows they ought to be relinquished: he associates them with himself instead! This is how he destroys them: he irradiates them with his glory! How would their own Christ act? I suppose He would have imitated the frowardness (of heresy),[fn-61-P6145_1839128:844-nf] and revealed them just as Marcion's Christ was bound to do, or at least as having with Him any others rather than His own prophets! But what could so well befit the Creator's Christ, as to manifest Him in the company of His own foreannouncers?[fn-61-P6146_1839403:845-nf] -to let Him be seen with those to whom He had appeared in revelations?-to let Him be speaking with those who had spoken of Him?-to share His glory with those by whom He used to be called the Lord of glory; even with those chief servants of His, one of whom was once the moulder[fn-61-P6147_1839703:846-nf] of His people, the other afterwards the reformer[fn-61-P6148_1839810:847-nf] thereof; one the initiator of the Old Testament, the other the consummator[fn-61-P6149_1839930:848-nf] of the New? Well therefore does Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble connection with Him, suggest an expedient: \"It is good for us to be here\" (good: that evidently means to be where Moses and Elias are); \"and let us make three tabernacles, one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. But he knew not what he said.\"[fn-61-P6150_1840483:849-nf] How knew not? Was his ignorance the result of simple error? Or was it on the principle which we maintain[fn-61-P6151_1840608:850-nf] in the cause of the new prophecy,[fn-61-P6152_1840959:851-nf] that to grace ecstasy or rapture[fn-61-P6153_1841018:852-nf] is incident. For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, especially when he beholds the glory of God, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily loses his sensation,[fn-61-P6154_1841199:853-nf] because he is overshadowed with the power of God,-a point concerning which there is a question between us and the carnally-minded.[fn-61-P6155_1841352:854-nf] Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture[fn-61-P6156_1842177:855-nf] of Peter. For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the law forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the Spirit? And therefore, because it was in the Spirit that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not know what he had said. But if, on the other hand,[fn-61-P6157_1842594:856-nf] he was thus ignorant, because he erroneously supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked by Christ, \"Whom they thought Him to be,\" meant the Creator's Christ, when he answered, \"Thou art the Christ; \"because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival god, he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in error here because of his previous erroneous opinion,[fn-61-P6158_1843038:857-nf] then you may be sure that up to that very day no new divinity had been revealed by Christ, and that Peter had so far made no mistake, because hitherto Christ had revealed nothing of the kind; and that Christ accordingly was not to be regarded as belonging to any other than the Creator, whose entire dispensation[fn-61-P6159_1843388:858-nf] he, in fact, here described.

Suffice it first to say this. There is no faculty in human nature adequate to the full comprehension of the divine essence. It may be that it is easy to show this in the case of human capacity alone, and to say that the incorporeal creation is incapable of taking in and comprehending that nature which is infinite will not be far short of the truth, as we may see by familiar examples; for as there are many and various things that have fleshly life, winged things, and things of the earth, some that mount above the clouds by virtue of their wings, others that dwell in hollows or burrow in the ground, on comparing which it would appear that there was no small difference between the inhabitants of air and of land; while, if the comparison be extended to the stars and the fixed circumference, it will be seen that what soars aloft on wings is not less widely removed from heaven than from the animals that are on the earth; so, too, the strength of angels compared with our own seems preeminently great, because, undisturbed by sensation, it pursues its lofty themes with pure naked intelligence. Yet, if we weigh even their comprehension with the majesty of Him Who really is, it may be that if any one should venture to say that even their power of understanding is not far superior to our own weakness, his conjecture would fall within the limits of probability, for wide and insurmountable is the interval that divides and fences off untreated from created nature. The latter is limited, the former not. The latter is confined within its own boundaries according to the pleasure of its Maker. The former is bounded only by infinity. The latter stretches itself out within certain degrees of extension, limited by time and space: the former transcends all notion of degree, baffling curiosity from every point of view. In this life we can apprehend the beginning and the end of all things that exist, but the beatitude that is above the creature admits neither end nor beginning, but is above all that is connoted by either, being ever the same, self-dependent, not travelling on by degrees from one point to another in its life; for there is no participation of other life in its life, such that we might infer end and beginning; but, be it what it may, it is life energizing in itself, not becoming greater or less by addition or diminution. For increase has no place in the infinite, and that which is by its nature passionless excludes all notion of decrease. And as, when looking up to heaven, and in a measure apprehending by the visual organs the beauty that is in the height, we doubt not the existence of what we see, but if asked what it is, we are unable to define its nature, but we simply admire as we contemplate the overarching vault, the reverse planetary motion[fn-21-P2183_1356289:13-nf] , the so-called Zodiac graven obliquely on the pole, whereby astronomers observe the motion of bodies revolving in an opposite direction, the differences of luminaries according to their magnitude, and the specialities of their rays, their risings and settings that take place according to the circling year ever at the same seasons undeviatingly, the conjunctions of planets, the courses of those that pass below, the eclipses of those that are above, the obumbrations of the earth, the reappearance of eclipsed bodies, the moon's multiform changes, the motion of the sun midway within the poles, and how, filled with his own light, and crowned with his encircling beams, and embracing all things in his sovereign light, he himself also at times suffers eclipse (the disc of the moon, as they say, passing before him), and how, by the will of Him Who has so ordained, ever running his own particular course, he accomplishes his appointed orbit and progress, opening out the four seasons of the year in succession; we, as I say, when we contemplate these phenomena by the aid of sight, are in no doubt of their existence, though we are as far from comprehending their essential nature as if sight had not given us any glimpse whatever of what we have seen; and even so, with regard to the Creator of the world, we know that He exists, but of His essential nature we cannot deny that we are ignorant. But, boasting as they do that they know these things, let them first tell us about the things of inferior nature; what they think of the body of the heavens, of the machinery which conveys the stars in their eternal courses, or of the sphere in which they move; for, however far speculation may proceed, when it comes to the uncertain and incomprehensible it must stop. For though any one say that another body, like in fashion (to that body of the heavens), fitting to its circular shape, checks its velocity, so that, ever turning in its course, it revolves conformably to that other upon itself, being retained by the force that embraces it from flying off at a tangent, yet how can he assert that these bodies will remain unspent by their constant friction with each other? And how, again, is motion produced in the case of two coeval bodies mutually conformed, when the one remains motionless (for the inner body, one would have thought, being held as in a vice by the motionlessness of that which embraces it, will be quite unable to act); and what is it that maintains the embracing body in its fixedness, so that it remains unshaken and unaffected by the motion of that which fits into it? And if in restless curiosity of thought we should conceive of some position for it that should keep it stationary, we must go on in logical consistency to search for the base of that base, and of the next, and of the next, and so on, and so the inquiry, proceeding from like to like, will go on to infinity, and end in helpless perplexity, still, even when some body has been put for the farthest foundation of the system of the universe, reaching after what is beyond, so that there is no stopping in our inquiry after the limit of the embracing circles. But not so, say others: but (according to the vain theory of those who have speculated on these matters) there is an empty space spread over the back of the heavens, working in which vacuum the motion of the universe revolves upon itself, meeting with no resistance from any solid body capable of retarding it by opposition and of checking its course of revolution. What, then, is that vacuum, which they say is neither a body nor an idea? How far does it extend, and what succeeds it, and what relation exists between the firm, resisting body, and that void and unsubstantial one? What is there to unite things so contrary by nature? and how can the harmony of the universe consist out of elements so incongruous; and what can any one say of Heaven itself? That it is a mixture of the elements which it contains, or one of them, or something else beside them? What, again, of the stars themselves? whence comes their radiance? what is it and how is it composed? and what is the reason of their difference in beauty and magnitude? and the seven inner orbs revolving in an opposite direction to the motion of the universe, what are they, and by what influence are they propelled? Then, too, what is that immaterial and ethereal empyrean, and the intermediate air which forms a wall of partition between that element in nature which gives heat and consumes, and that which is moist and combustible? And how does earth below form the foundation of the whole, and what is it that keeps it firmly in its place? what is it that controls its downward tendency? If any one should interrogate us on these and such-like points, will any of us be found so presumptuous as to promise an explanation of them? No! the only reply that can be given by men of sense is this:-that He Who made all things in wisdom can alone furnish an account of His creation. For ourselves, \"through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God,\" as saith the Apostle[fn-21-P2184_1362037:14-nf] .","title":"Answer to Eunomius' Second Book","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_25_answer_to_eunomius_second_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"19","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"And on other accounts also it may be called safe to let alone the Divine essence, as unspeakable, and beyond the scope of human reasoning. For the desire of investigating what is obscure and tracing out hidden things by the operation of human reasoning gives an entrance to false no less than to true notions, inasmuch as he who aspires to know the unknown will not always arrive at truth, but may also conceive of falsehood itself as truth. But the disciple of the Gospels and of Prophecy believes that He Who is, is; both from what he has learnt from the sacred writers, and from the harmony of things which do appear, and from the works of Providence. But what He is and how-leaving this as a useless and unprofitable speculation, such a disciple will open no door to falsehood against truth. For in speculative enquiry fallacies readily find place. But where speculation is entirely at rest, the necessity of error is precluded. And that this is a true account of the case, may be seen if we consider how it is that heresies in the churches have wandered off into many and various opinions in regard to God, men deceiving themselves as they are swayed by one mental impulse or another; and how these very men with whom our treatise is concerned have slipped into such a pit of profanity. Would it not have been safer for all, following the counsel of wisdom, to abstain from searching into such deep matters, and in peace and quietness to keep inviolate the pure deposit of the faith? But since, in fact, human nothingness has commenced intruding recklessly into matters that are above comprehension, and supporting by dogmatic teaching the figments of their vain imagination, there has sprung up in consequence a whole host of enemies to the truth, and among them these very men who are the subject of this treatise; dogmatizers of deceit who seek to limit the Divine Being, and all but openly idolize their own imagination, in that they deify the idea expressed by this \"ungeneracy\" of theirs, as not being only in a certain relation discernible in the Divine nature, but as being itself God, or the essence of God. Yet perchance they would have done better to look to the sacred company of the Prophets and Patriarchs, to whom \"at sundry times, and in divers manners[fn-22-P2201_1373579:25-nf] ,\" the Word of truth spake, and, next in order, those who were eye-witnesses and ministers of the word, that they might give honour due to the claims on their belief of the things attested by the Holy Spirit Himself, and abide within the limits of their teaching and knowledge, and not venture on themes which are not comprehended in the canon of the sacred writers. For those writers, by revealing God, so long unknown to human life by reason of the prevalence of idolatry, and making Him known to men, both from the wonders which manifest themselves in His works, and from the names which express the manifold variety of His power, lead men, as by the hand, to the understanding of the Divine nature, making known to them the bare grandeur of the thought of God; while the question of His essence, as one which it is impossible to grasp, and which bears no fruit to the curious enquirer, they dismiss without any attempt at its solution. For whereas they have set forth respecting all other things, that they were created, the heaven, the earth, the sea, times, ages, and the creatures that are therein, but what each is in itself, and how and whence, on these points they are silent; so, too, concerning God Himself, they exhort men to \"believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him[fn-22-P2202_1374914:26-nf] ,\" but in regard to His nature, as being above every name, they neither name it nor concern themselves about it. For if we have learned any names expressive of the knowledge of God, all these are related and have analogy to such names as denote human characteristics. For as they who would indicate some person unknown by marks of recognition speak of him as of good parentage and descent, if such happen to be the case, or as distinguished for his riches or his worth, or as in the prime of life, or of such or such stature, and in so speaking they do not set forth the nature of the person indicated, but give certain notes of recognition (for neither advantages of birth, nor of wealth, nor of reputation, nor of age, constitute the man; they are considered, simply as being observable in the man), thus too the expressions of Holy Scripture devised for the glory of God set forth one or another of the things which are declared concerning Him, each inculcating some special teaching. For by these expressions we are taught either His power, or that He admits not of deterioration, or that He is without cause and without limit, or that He is supreme above all things, or, in short, something, be it what it may, respecting Him. But His very essence, as not to be conceived by the human intellect or expressed in words, this it has left untouched as a thing not to be made the subject of curious enquiry, ruling that it be revered in silence, in that it forbids the investigation of things too deep for us, while it enjoins the duty of being slow to utter any word before God. And therefore, whosoever searches the whole of Revelation will find therein no doctrine of the Divine nature, nor indeed of anything else that has a substantial existence, so that we pass our lives in ignorance of much, being ignorant first of all of ourselves, as men, and then of all things besides. For who is there who has arrived at a comprehension of his own soul? Who is acquainted with its very essence, whether it is material or immaterial, whether it is purely incorporeal, or whether it exhibits anything of a corporeal character; how it comes into being, how it is composed, whence it enters into the body, how it departs from it, or what means it possesses to unite it to the nature of the body; how, being intangible and without form, it is kept within its own sphere, what difference exists among its powers, how one and the same soul, in its eager curiosity to know the things which are unseen, soars above the highest heavens, and again, dragged down by the weight of the body, falls back on material passions, anger and fear, pain and pleasure, pity and cruelty, hope and memory, cowardice and audacity, friendship and hatred, and all the contraries that are produced in the faculties of the soul? Observing which things, who has not fancied that he has a sort of populace of souls crowded together in himself, each of the aforesaid passions differing widely from the rest, and, where it prevails, holding lordship over them all, so that even the rational faculty falls under and is subject to the predominating power of such forces, and contributes its own co-operation to such impulses, as to a despotic lord? What word, then, of the inspired Scripture has taught us the manifold and multiform character of what we understand in speaking of the soul? Is it a unity composed of them all, and, if so, what is it that blends and harmonizes things mutually opposed, so that many things become one, while each element, taken by itself, is shut up in the soul as in some ample vessel? And how is it that we have not the perception of them all as being involved in it, being at one and the same time confident and afraid, at once hating and loving and feeling in ourselves the working as well of all other emotions confused and intermingled; but, on the contrary, take knowledge only of their alternate control, when one of them prevails, the rest remaining quiescent? What in short is this composition and arrangement, and this capacious void within us, such that to each is assigned its own post, as though hindered by middle walls of partition from holding intercourse with its neighbour? And then again what account has explained whether passion is the fundamental essence of the soul, or fear, or any of the other elements which I have mentioned; and what emotions are unsubstantial? For if these have an independent subsistence, then, as I have said, there is comprehended in ourselves not one soul, but a collection of souls, each of them occupying its distinct position as a particular and individual soul. But if we must suppose these to be a kind of emotion without subsistence, how can that which has no essential existence exercise lordship over us, having reduced us as it were to slave under whichsoever of these things may have happened to prevail? And if the soul is something that thought only can grasp, how can that which is manifold and composite be contemplated as such, when such an object ought to be contemplated by itself, independently of these bodily qualities? Then, as to the soul's power of growth, of desire, of nutrition, of change, and the fact that all the bodily powers are nourished, while feeling does not extend through all, but, as in things without life, some of our members are destitute of feeling, the bones for example, the cartilages, the nails, the hair, all of which take nourishment, but do not feel,-tell me who is there that understands this only half-complete operation of the soul as to these? And why do I speak of the soul? Even the inquiry as to that thing in the flesh itself which assumes all the corporeal qualities has not been pursued to any definite result. For if any one has made a mental analysis of that which is seen into its component parts, and, having stripped the object of its qualities, has attempted to consider it by itself, I fail to see what will have been left for investigation. For when you take from a body its colour, its shape, its degree of resistance, its weight, its quantity, its position, its forces active or passive, its relation to other objects, what remains, that can still be called a body, we can neither see of ourselves, nor are we taught it by Scripture. But how can he who is ignorant of himself take knowledge of anything that is above himself? And if a man is familiarized with such ignorance of himself, is he not plainly taught by the very fact not to be astonished at any of the mysteries that are without? Wherefore also, of the elements of the world, we know only so much by our senses as to enable us to receive what they severally supply for our living. But we possess no knowledge of their substance, nor do we count it loss to be ignorant of it. For what does it profit me to inquire curiously into the nature of fire, how it is struck out, how it is kindled, how, when it has caught hold of the fuel supplied to it, it does not let it go till it has devoured and consumed its prey; how the spark is latent in the flint, how steel, cold as it is to the touch, generates fire, how sticks rubbed together kindle flame how water shining in the sun causes a flash; and then again the cause of its upward tendency, its power of incessant motion?-Putting aside all which curious questions and investigations, we give heed only to the subservience of this fire to life, seeing that he who avails himself of its service fares no worse than he who busies himself with inquiries into its nature.","title":"Answer to Eunomius' Second Book","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"2.

Hegesippus who lived near the apostolic age, in the fifth book of his Commentaries, writing of James. says \"After the apostles, James the brother of the Lord surnamed the Just was made head of the Church at Jerusalem. Many indeed are called James. This one was holy from his mother's womb. He drank neither wine nor strong drink, ate no flesh, never shaved or anointed himself with ointment or bathed. He alone halt the privilege of entering the Holy of Holies, since indeed he did not use woolen vestments but linen and went alone into the temple and prayed in behalf of the people, insomuch that his knees were reputed to have acquired the hardness of camels' knees.\" He says also many other things, too numerous to mention. Josephus also in the 20th book of his Antiquities, and Clement in the 7th of his Outlines mention that on the death of Fetus who reigned over Judea, Albinus was sent by Nero as his successor. Before he had reached his province, Ananias the high priest, the youthful son of Ananus of the priestly class taking advantage of the state of anarchy, assembled a council and publicly tried to force James to deny that Christ is the son of God. When he refused Ananius ordered him to be stoned. Cast down from a pinnacle of the temple, his legs broken, but still half alive, raising his hands to heaven he said, \"Lord forgive them for they know not what they do.\" Then struck on the head by the club of a fuller such a club as fullers are accustomed to wring out garments[fn-70-P7082_1821611:27-nf] with-he died. This same Josephus records the tradition that this James was of so great sanctity and reputation among the people that the downfall of Jerusalem was believed to be on account of his death. He it is of whom the apostle Paul writes to the Galatians that \"No one else of the apostles did I see except James the brother of the Lord,\" and shortly after the event the Acts of the apostles bear witness to the matter. The Gospel also which is called the Gospel according to the Hebrews,[fn-70-P7083_1822156:28-nf] and which I have recently translated into Greek and Latin and which also Origen[fn-70-P7084_1822347:29-nf] often makes use of, after the account of the resurrection of the Saviour says, \"but the Lord, after he had given his grave clothes to the servant of the priest, appeared to James(for James had. sworn that he would not eat bread from that hour in which he drank the cup of the Lord until he should see him rising again from among those that sleep)\" and again, a little later, it says \"`Bring a table and bread,' said the Lord.\" And immediately it is added, \"He brought bread and blessed and brake and gave to James the Just and said to him, `my brother eat thy bread, for the son of man is risen from among those that sleep.'\" And so he ruled the church of Jerusalem thirty years, that is until the seventh year of Nero, and was buried near the temple from which he had been cast down. His tombstone with its inscription was well known until the siege of Titus and the end of Hadrian's reign. Some of our writers think he was buried in Mount Olivet, but they are mistaken.","title":"Jerome-Lives of Illustrious Men.","author":"Jerome and Gennadius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_27_jerome_lives_of_illustrious_men_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"288","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Jude[fn-70-P7095_1824590:34-nf] the brother of James, left a short epistle which is reckoned among the seven catholic epistles, and because in it[fn-70-P7096_1824724:35-nf] he quotes from the apocryphal book of Enoch it is rejected by many.

We must then say that the Son is the true Son of the true Father, that we may both worship Him, and avoid condemnation as worshipping a strange God. But to those who quote from the Proverbs the passage, \"the Lord created me[fn-26-P2617_1788562:7-nf] ,\" and think that they hereby produce a strong argument that the Creator and Maker of all things was created, we must answer that the Only-begotten God was made for us many things. For He was the Word, and was made flesh; and He was God, and was made man; and He was without body, and was made a body; and besides, He was made \"sin,\" and \"a curse,\" and \"a stone,\" and \"an axe,\" and \"bread,\" and \"a lamb,\" and \"a way,\" and \"a door,\" and \"a rock,\" and many such things; not being by nature any of these, but being made these things for our sakes, by way of dispensation. As, therefore, being the Word, He was for our sakes made flesh, and as, being God, He was made man, so also, being the Creator, He was made for our sakes a creature; for the flesh is created. As, then, He said by the prophet, \"Thus saith the Lord, He that formed me from the womb to be His servant[fn-26-P2618_1789448:8-nf] ;\" so He said also by Solomon, \"The Lord created me as the beginning of His ways, for His works[fn-26-P2619_1789559:9-nf] .\" For all creation, as the Apostle says, is in servitude[fn-26-P2620_1789637:10-nf] . Therefore both He Who was formed in the Virgin's womb, according to the word of the prophet, is the servant, and not the Lord (that is to say, the man according to the flesh, in whom God was manifested), and also, in the other passage, He Who was created as the beginning of His ways is not God, but the man in whom God was manifested to us for the renewing again of the ruined way of man's salvation. So that, since we recognize two things in Christ, one Divine, the other human (the Divine by nature, but the human in the Incarnation), we accordingly claim for the Godhead that which is eternal, and that which is created we ascribe to His human nature. For as, according to the prophet, He was formed in the womb as a servant, so also, according to Solomon, He was manifested in the flesh by means of this servile creation. But when they say, \"if He was, He was not begotten, and if He was begotten He was not,\" let them learn that it is not fitting to ascribe to His Divine nature the attributes which belong to His fleshly origin[fn-26-P2621_1790745:11-nf] . For bodies which do not exist, are generated, and God makes those things to be which are not, but does not Himself come into being from that which is not. And for this reason also Paul calls Him \"the brightness of glory[fn-26-P2622_1791088:12-nf] ,\" that we may learn that as the light from the lamp is of the nature of that which sheds the brightness, and is united with it (for as soon as the lamp appears the light that comes from it shines out simultaneously), so in this place the Apostle would have us consider both that the Son is of the Father, and that the Father is never without the Son; for it is impossible that glory should be without radiance, as it is impossible that the lamp should be without brightness. But it is clear that as His being brightness is a testimony to His being in relation with the glory (for if the glory did not exist, the brightness shed from it would not exist), so, to say that the brightness \"once was not[fn-26-P2623_1791804:13-nf] \" is a declaration that the glory also was not, when the brightness was not; for it is impossible that the glory should be without the brightness. As therefore it is not possible to say in the case of the brightness, \"If it was, it did not come into being, and if it came into being it was not,\" so it is in vain to say this of the Son, seeing that the Son is the brightness. Let those also who speak of \"less\" and \"greater,\" in the case of the Father and the Son, learn from Paul not to measure things immeasurable. For the Apostle says that the Son is the express image of the Person of the Father[fn-26-P2624_1792464:14-nf] . It is clear then that however great the Person of the Father is, so great also is the express image of that Person; for it is not possible that the express image should be less than the Person contemplated in it. And this the great John also teaches when he says, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God[fn-26-P2625_1792804:15-nf] .\" For in saying that he was \"in the beginning\" and not \"after the beginning,\" he showed that the beginning was never without the Word; and in declaring that \"the Word was with God,\" he signified the absence of defect in the Son in relation to the Father; for the Word is contemplated as a whole together with the whole being of God. For if the Word were deficient in His own greatness so as not to be capable of relation with the whole being of God, we are compelled to suppose that that part of Godwhich extends beyond the Word is without the Word. But in fact the whole magnitude of the Word is contemplated together with the whole magnitude of God: and consequently in statements concerning the Divine nature, it is not admissible to speak of \"greater\" and \"less.\"","title":"On the Faith","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_29_on_the_faith","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"God commands us by His prophet not to esteem any new God to be God, and not to worship any strange God[fn-26-P2611_1786554:1-nf] .

We, however, have received no aid from human instruction; nay, whatever graces of character are esteemed of good report by those who have understanding, are entirely the gift of God. And I am able to oppose no feeble buckler against the deadly weapons of Satan's armory; I mean the knowledge I possess of those things which are pleasing to him: and of these I will select such as are appropriate to my present design, while I proceed to sing the praises of the Father of all. But do thou, O Christ, Saviour of mankind, be present to aid me in my hallowed task! Direct the words which celebrate thy virtues,[fn-82-P8204_3369033:51-nf] and instruct me worthily to sound thy praises. And now, let no one expect to listen to the graces of elegant language: for well I know that the nerveless eloquence of those who speak to charm the ear, and whose aim is rather applause than sound argument, is distasteful to hearers of sound judgment. It is asserted, then, by some profane and senseless persons, that Christ, whom we worship, was justly condemned to death, and that he who is the author of life to all, was himself deprived of life. That such an assertion should be made by those who have once dared to enter the paths of impiety, who have cast aside all fear, and all thought of concealing their own depravity, is not surprising. But it is beyond the bounds of folly itself that they should be able, as it seems, really to persuade themselves that the incorruptible God yielded to the violence of men, and not rather to that love alone which he bore to the human race: that they should fail to perceive that divine magnanimity and forbearance is changed by no insult, is moved from its intrinsic steadfastness by no revilings; but is ever the same, breaking down and repelling, by the spirit of wisdom and greatness of soul, the savage fierceness of those who assail it. The gracious kindness of God had determined to abolish iniquity, and to exalt order and justice. Accordingly, he gathered a company of the wisest among men,[fn-82-P8205_3370471:52-nf] and ordained that most noble and useful doctrine, which is calculated to lead the good and blessed of mankind to an imitation of his own providential care. And what higher blessing can we speak of than this, that God should prescribe the way of righteousness, and make those who are counted worthy of his instruction like himself; that goodness might be communicated to all classes of mankind, and eternal felicity be the result? This is the glorious victory: this the true power: this the mighty work, worthy of its author, the restoration of all people to soundness of mind: and the glory of this triumph we joyfully ascribe to thee, thou Saviour of all! But thou, vile and wretched blasphemy, whose glory is in lies and rumors and calumny; thy power is to deceive and prevail with the inexperience of youth, and with men who still retain the folly of youth. These thou seducest from the service of the true God, and settest up false idols as the objects of their worship and their prayers; and thus the reward of their folly awaits thy deluded victims: for they calumniate Christ, the author of every blessing, who is God, and the Son of God. Is not the worship of the best and wisest of the nations of this world worthily directed to that God, who, while possessing boundless power, remains immovably true to his own purpose, and retains undiminished his characteristic kindness and love to man? Away, then, ye impious, for still ye may while vengeance on your transgressions is yet withheld; begone to your sacrifices, your feasts, your scenes of revelry and drunkenness, wherein, under the semblance of religion, your hearts are devoted to profligate enjoyment, and pretending to perform sacrifices, yourselves are the willing slaves of your own pleasures. No knowledge have ye of any good, nor even of the first commandment of the mighty God, who both declares his will to man, and gives commission to his Son to direct the course of human life, that they who have passed a career of virtue and self-control may obtain, according to the judgment of that Son, a second, yea, a blessed and happy existence.[fn-82-P8206_3373376:53-nf] I have now declared the decree of God respecting the life which he prescribes to man, neither ignorantly, as many have done, nor resting on the ground of opinion or conjecture. But it may be that some will ask, Whence this title of Son? Whence this generation of which we speak, if God be indeed only One, and incapable of union with another? We are, however, to consider generation as of two kinds; one in the way of natural birth, which is known to all; the other, that which is the effect of an eternal cause, the mode of which is seen by the prescience of God, and by those among men whom he loves. For he who is wise will recognize the cause which regulates the harmony of creation. Since, then, nothing exists without a cause, of necessity the cause of existing substances preceded their existence. But since the world and all things that it contains exist, and are preserved,[fn-82-P8207_3374419:54-nf] their preserver must have had a prior existence; so that Christ is the cause of preservation, and the preservation of things is an effect:[fn-82-P8208_3374939:55-nf] even as the Father is the cause of the Son, and the Son the effect of that cause. Enough, then, has been said to prove his priority of existence. But how do we explain his descent to this earth, and to men? His motive in this,[fn-82-P8209_3375839:56-nf] as the prophets had foretold, originated in his watchful care for the interests of all: for it needs must be that the Creator should care for his own works. But when the time came for him to assume a terrestrial body, and to sojourn on this earth, the need requiring, he devised for himself a new mode[fn-82-P8210_3376345:57-nf] of birth. Conception was there, yet apart from marriage: childbirth, yet pure virginity: and a maiden became the mother of God! An eternal nature received a beginning of temporal existence: a sensible form of a spiritual essence, a material manifestation of incorporeal brightness,[fn-82-P8211_3376855:58-nf] appeared. Alike wondrous were the circumstances which attended this great event. A radiant dove, like that which flew from the ark of Noah,[fn-82-P8212_3377081:59-nf] alighted on the Virgin's bosom: and accordant with this impalpable union, purer than chastity, more guileless than innocence itself, were the results which followed. From infancy possessing the wisdom of God, received with reverential awe by the Jordan, in whose waters he was baptized, gifted with that royal unction, the spirit of universal intelligence; with knowledge and power to perform miracles, and to heal diseases beyond the reach of human art; he yielded a swift and unhindered assent to the prayers of men, to whose welfare, indeed, his whole life was devoted without reserve. His doctrines instilled, not prudence only,[fn-82-P8213_3378708:60-nf] but real wisdom: his hearers were instructed, not in the mere social virtues,[fn-82-P8214_3379381:61-nf] but in the ways which conduct to the spiritual world; and devoted themselves to the contemplation of immutable and eternal things, and the knowledge of the Supreme Father. The benefits which he bestowed were no common blessings: for blindness, the gift of sight; for helpless weakness, the vigor of health; in the place of death, restoration to life again. I dwell not on that abundant provision in the wilderness, whereby a scanty measure of food became a complete and enduring supply[fn-82-P8215_3379968:62-nf] for the wants of a mighty multitude?[fn-82-P8216_3380200:63-nf] Thus do we render thanks to thee, our God and Saviour, according to our feeble power; unto thee, O Christ, supreme Providence of the mighty Father, who both savest us from evil, and impartest to us thy most blessed doctrine: for I say these things, not to praise, but to give thanks. For what mortal is he who shall worthily declare thy praise, of whom we learn that thou didst from nothing call creation into being, and illumine it with thy light; that thou didst regulate the confusion of the elements by the laws of harmony and order? But chiefly we mark thy loving-kindness,[fn-82-P8217_3380883:64-nf] in that thou hast caused those whose hearts inclined to thee to desire earnestly a divine and blessed life, and hast provided that, like merchants of true blessings, they might impart to many others the wisdom and good fortune they had received; themselves, meanwhile, reaping the everlasting fruit of virtue. Freed from the trammels of vice, and imbued with the love of their fellow-men, they keep mercy ever before their eyes, and hoping for the promises of faith;[fn-82-P8218_3381585:65-nf] devoted to modesty, and all those virtues which the past career of human life had thrown aside [but which were now restored by him whose providence is over all].[fn-82-P8219_3381782:66-nf] No other power could be found to devise a remedy for such evils, and for that spirit of injustice which had heretofore asserted its dominion over the race of men. Providence, however, could reach the circumstances even here, and with ease restored whatever had been disordered by violence and the licentiousness of human passion. And this restoring power he exercised without concealment. For he knew that, though there were some whose thoughts were able to recognize and understand his power, others there were whose brutish and senseless nature led them to rely exclusively on the testimony of their own senses. In open day, therefore, that no one, whether good or evil, might find room for doubt, he manifested his blessed and wondrous healing power; restoring the dead to life again, and renewing with a word the powers of those who had been bereft of bodily sense.[fn-82-P8220_3382826:67-nf] Can we, in short, suppose, that to render the sea firm as the solid ground, to still the raging of the storm, and finally to ascend to heaven, after turning the unbelief of men to steadfast faith by the performance of these wondrous acts, demanded less than almighty power, was less than the work of God? Nor was the time of his passion unaccompanied by like wonders: when the sun was darkened, and the shades of night obscured the light of day. Then terror everywhere laid hold upon the people, and the thought that the end of all things was already come, and that chaos, such as had been ere the order of creation began, would once more prevail. Then, too, the cause was sought of so terrible an evil, and in what respect the trespasses of men had provoked the wrath of Heaven; until God himself, who surveyed with calm dignity the arrogance of the ungodly, renewed the face of heaven, and adorned it with the host of stars. Thus the beclouded face of Nature was again restored to her pristine beauty.","title":"The Oration of the Emperor Constantine","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_29_lecture_xxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"6.

But[fn-10-P1093_1037138:11-nf] as they thought * * He feared lest Peter, in consequence of the slaying of James, should withdraw; and wishing to have him in safe keeping, he put him in prison: \"and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers\" (v. 4): the stricter the custody, the more wondrous the display. \"Peter therefore was kept in prison.\" (v. 5.) But this was all the better for Peter, who was thereby made more approved, and evinced his own manly courage. And it says, \"there was earnest prayer making.\" It was the prayer of (filial) affection: it was for a father they asked, a father mild. \"There was,\" it says, \"earnest prayer.\" Hear how they were affected to their teachers. No factions, no perturbation:[fn-10-P1094_1038002:12-nf] but they betook them to prayer, to that alliance which is indeed invincible, to this they betook them for refuge. They did not say, \"What? I, poor insignificant creature that I am, to pray for him!\" for, as they acted of love, they did not give these things a thought. And observe, it was during the feast, that (their enemies) brought these trials upon them, that their worth might be the more approved. \"And when Herod,\" etc. (v. 6.) See Peter sleeping, and not in distress or fear! That same night, after which he was to be brought forth, he slept, having cast all upon God. \"Between two soldiers, bound with two chains.\" (comp. 1 Pet. v. 7.) Mark, how strict the ward! \"And says, Arise.\" (v. 7.) The guards were asleep with him, and therefore perceived nothing of what was happening. \"And a light shined.\" What was the light for? In order that Peter might see as well as hear, and not imagine it to be all fancy. And the command, \"Arise quickly,[fn-10-P1095_1039495:13-nf] \" that he may not be remiss. He also smote him; so deeply did he sleep. (a) \"Rise,\" says he, \"quickly:\" this is not to hurry him (qorubountoj) but to persuade him not to delay. (c) \"And\" immediately \"his chains fell off from his hands.\" (b) How? answer me: where are the heretics?-let them answer. \"And the Angel said unto him,\" etc. (v. 8) by this also convincing him that it is no fancy: to this end he bids him gird himself and put on his shoes, that he may shake off his sleep, and know that it is real. (a) (e) \"And he wist not that it was true that was done by the Angel, but thought he saw a vision\" (v. 9): (e) well he might, by reason of the excessive greatness (uperbolhn) of the things taking place. Do you mark what a thing it is for a miracle to be excessive (ekplhttei shmeiou)? how it amazes (ekplhttei) the beholder? how it will not let the thing be believed?[fn-10-P1096_1041330:14-nf] For if Peter \"thought he saw a vision,\" though he had girded himself and put on his shoes, what would have been the case with another? \"And,\" it says, \"when they had passed the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate, which opened unto them of its own accord\" (v. 10): and yet the things that had happened within (the prison) were more marvellous: but this was now more after the manner of man. \"And having gone out, they went along one street and immediately (all `until') the Angel departed from him.\" (v. 11.) When there was no hindrance, then the Angel departed. For Peter would not have gone along (prohlqen), there being so many hindrances. \"And when he came to himself:\" for in very truth, it was indeed an amazement (ekplhcij). \"Now,\" saith he, \"I know\"-now, not then, when I was in the prison,-\"that the Lord hath sent His Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. And when he had considered\" (v. 12), it says: viz. where he was, or, that he must not without more ado depart but requite his Benefactor: \"he came to the house of Mary the mother of John.\" Who is this John? Probably[fn-10-P1097_1042582:15-nf] he that was always with them: for this is why he adds his distinctive name (to parashmon), \"whose surname was Mark.\" But observe, \"praying\" in the night, how much they got by it: what a good thing affliction is; how wakeful it made them! Do you see how great the gain resulting from the death of Stephen? do you see how great the benefit accruing from this imprisonment? For it is not by taking vengeance upon those who wronged them that God shows the greatness of the Gospel: but in the wrong-doers themselves,[fn-10-P1098_1043369:16-nf] without any harm happening to those, he shows what a mighty thing the afflictions in themselves are, that we may not seek in any wise deliverance from them, nor the avenging of our wrongs. And mark how the very servant-girls were henceforth upon an equality with them. \"For joy,\" it says, \"she opened not.\" (v. 13, 14.) This too is well done, that they likewise may not be amazed by seeing him at once, and that they may be incredulous, and their minds may be exercised. \"But ran in,\" etc. just as we are wont to do, she was eager to be herself the bringer of the good tidings, for good news it was indeed. \"And they said unto her, Thou art mad: but she constantly affirmed that it was even so: then said they, It is his Angel.\" (v. 15.) This is a truth, that each man has an Angel.[fn-10-P1099_1044431:17-nf] And what would the Angel?[fn-11-P1100_1045326:18-nf] It was from the time (of night) that they surmised this. But when he \"continued knocking, and when they had opened, and saw him, they were astonished. But he beckoning to them with his hand\" (v. 16, 17), made them keep quiet, to hear all that had happened to him. He was now an object of more affectionate desire to the disciples, not only in consequence of his being saved, but by his sudden coming in upon them and straightway departing. Now, both his friends learn all clearly; and the aliens also learn, if they had a mind, but they had not. The same thing happened in the case of Christ. \"Tell these things,\" he says, \"to James, and to the brethren.\" How free from all vainglory! Nor did he say, Make known these things to people everywhere, but, \"to the brethren. And he withdrew to another place:\" for he did not tempt God, nor fling himself into temptation: since, when they were commanded to do this, then they did it. \"Go,\" it was said, \"speak in the temple to the people.\" (ch. v. 20.) But this the Angel said not (here); on the contrary, by silently removing him and bringing him out by night, he gave him free permission to withdraw-and this too is done, that we may learn that many things are providentially brought about after the manner of men-so that he should not again fall into peril.-For that they may not say, \"It was his Angel,\"[fn-11-P1101_1046838:19-nf] after he was gone, they say this first, and then they see himself overthrowing their notion of the matter. Had it been the Angel, he would have knocked at the door, would not have retired to another place.

Now the gates of Zion may be conceived as opposed to the gates of death, so that there is one gate of death, dissoluteness, but a gate of Zion, self-control; and so a gate of death, unrighteousness, but a gate of Zion, righteousness, which the prophet shows forth saying, \"This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter into it.\"[fn-79-P7939_1688414:93-nf] And again there is cowardice, a gate of death, but manly courage, a gate of Zion; and want of prudence, a gate of death, but its opposite, prudence, a gate of Zion. But to all the gates of the \"knowledge which is falsely so called\"[fn-79-P7940_1688668:94-nf] one gate is opposed, the gate of knowledge which is free from falsehood.

Let, then, the principalities and powers with which our wrestling is, be called gates of Hades, but the \"ministering spirits\"[fn-79-P7943_1689195:97-nf] gates of righteousness.

According to John, \"God is light.\" The only-begotten Son, therefore, is the glory of this light, proceeding inseparably from (God) Himself, as brightness does from light, and illuminating the whole of creation. For, agreeably to what we have already explained as to the manner in which He is the Way, and conducts to the Father; and in which He is the Word, interpreting the secrets of wisdom, and the mysteries of knowledge, making them known to the rational creation; and is also the Truth, and the Life, and the Resurrection,-in the same way ought we to understand also the meaning of His being the brightness: for it is by its splendour that we understand and feel what light itself is. And this splendour, presenting itself gently and softly to the frail and weak eyes of mortals, and gradually training, as it were, and accustoming them to bear the brightness of the light, when it has put away from them every hindrance and obstruction to vision, according to the Lord's own precept,\" Cast forth the beam out of thine eye,\"[fn-63-P6308_1137741:43-nf] renders them capable of enduring the splendour of the light, being made in this respect also a sort of mediator between men and the light.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_45_book_i_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"ANF-04","text":"8. But since He is called by the apostle not only the brightness of His glory, but also the express figure of His person or subsistence,[fn-63-P6310_1138034:44-nf] it does not seem idle to inquire how there can be said to be another figure of that person besides the person of God Himself, whatever be the meaning of person and subsistence. Consider, then, whether the Son of God, seeing He is His Word and Wisdom, and alone knows the Father, and reveals Him to whom He will (i.e., to those who are capable of receiving His word and wisdom), may not, in regard of this very point of making God to be understood and acknowledged, be called the figure of His person and subsistence; that is, when that Wisdom, which desires to make known to others the means by which God is acknowledged and understood by them, describes Himself first of all, it may by so doing be called the express figure of the person of God. In order, however, to arrive at a fuller understanding of the manner in which the Saviour is the figure of the person or subsistence of God, let us take an instance, which, although it does not describe the subject of which we are treating either fully or appropriately, may nevertheless be seen to be employed for this purpose only, to show that the Son of God, who was in the form of God, divesting Himself (of His glory), makes it His object, by this very divesting of Himself, to demonstrate to us the fulness of His deity. For instance, suppose that there were a statue of so enormous a size as to fill the whole world, and which on that account could be seen by no one; and that another statue were formed altogether resembling it in the shape of the limbs, and in the features of the countenance, and in form and material, but without the same immensity of size, so that those who were unable to behold the one of enormous proportions, should, on seeing the latter, acknowledge that they had seen the former, because it preserved all the features of its limbs and countenance, and even the very form and material, so closely, as to be altogether undistinguishable from it; by some such similitude, the Son of God, divesting Himself of His equality with the Father, and showing to us the way to the knowledge of Him, is made the express image of His person: so that we, who were unable to look upon the glory of that marvellous light when placed in the greatness of His Godhead, may, by His being made to us brightness, obtain the means of beholding the divine light by looking upon the brightness. This comparison, of course, of statues, as belonging to material things, is employed for no other purpose than to show that the Son of God, though placed in the very insignificant form of a human body, in consequence of the resemblance of His works and power to the Father, showed that there was in Him an immense and invisible greatness, inasmuch as He said to His disciples, \"He who sees Me, sees the Father also; \"and, \"I and the Father are one.\" And to these belong also the similar expression, \"The Father is in Me, and I in the Father.\"","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_45_book_i_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"ANF-04","text":"1.

For we find in holy Scripture numerous names of certain orders and offices, not only of holy beings, but also of those of an opposite description, which we shall bring before us, in the first place; and the meaning of which we shall endeavour, in the second place, to the best of our ability, to ascertain. There are certain holy angels of God whom Paul terms \"ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.\"[fn-63-P6379_1180908:90-nf] In the writings also of St. Paul himself we find him designating them, from some unknown source, as thrones, and dominions, and principalities, and powers; and after this enumeration, as if knowing that there were still other rational offices[fn-63-P6380_1181168:91-nf] and orders besides those which he had named, he says of the Saviour: \"Who is above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.\"[fn-63-P6381_1181409:92-nf] From which he shows that there were certain beings besides those which he had mentioned, which may be named indeed in this world, but were not now enumerated by him, and perhaps were not known by any other individual; and that there were others which may not be named in this world, but will be named in the world to come.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_46_a_plea_for_the_christians","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"ANF-02","text":"That we are not atheists, therefore, seeing that we acknowledge one God, uncreated, eternal, invisible, impassible, incomprehensible, illimitable, who is apprehended by the understanding only and the reason, who is encompassed by light, and beauty, and spirit, and power ineffable, by whom the universe has been created through His Logos, and set in order, and is kept in being-I have sufficiently demonstrated. [I say \"His Logos\"], for we acknowledge also a Son of God. Nor let any one think it ridiculous that God should have a Son. For though the poets, in their fictions, represent the gods as no better than men, our mode of thinking is not the same as theirs, concerning either God the Father or the Son. But the Son of God is the Logos of the Father, in idea and in operation; for after the pattern of Him and by Him[fn-22-P2212_611432:30-nf] were all things made, the Father and the Son being one. And, the Son being in the Father and the Father in the Son, in oneness and power of spirit, the understanding and reason (nou=j kai\\ lo/goj) of the Father is the Son of God. But if, in your surpassing intelligence,[fn-22-P2213_611760:31-nf] it occurs to you to inquire what is meant by the Son, I will state briefly that He is the first product of the Father, not as having been brought into existence (for from the beginning, God, who is the eternal mind [nou=j], had the Logos in Himself, being from eternity instinct with Logos [logiko/j]; but in as much as He came forth to be the idea and energizing power of all material things, which lay like a nature without attributes, and an inactive earth, the grosser particles being mixed up with the lighter. The prophetic Spirit also agrees with our statements. \"The Lord,\" it says, \"made me, the beginning of His ways to His works.\"[fn-22-P2214_612423:32-nf] The Holy Spirit Himself also, which operates in the prophets, we assert to be an effluence of God, flowing from Him, and returning back again like a beam of the sun. Who, then, would not be astonished to hear men who speak of God the Father, and of God the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,[fn-22-P2215_612730:33-nf] and who declare both their power in union and their distinction in order, called atheists? Nor is our teaching in what relates to the divine nature confined to these points; but we recognise also a multitude of angels and ministers,[fn-22-P2216_613030:34-nf] whom God the Maker and Framer of the world distributed and appointed to their several posts by His Logos, to occupy themselves about the elements, and the heavens, and the world, and the things in it, and the goodly ordering of them all.","title":"A Plea For the Christians","author":"Writings of Athenagoras"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"61","folder":"ANF-04","text":"3. But perhaps this question is asked, If it be the understanding which prays and sings with the spirit, and if it be the same which receives both perfection and salvation, how is it that Peter says, \"Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls? \"[fn-66-P6654_1346986:132-nf] If the soul neither prays nor sings with the spirit, how shall it hope for salvation? or when it attains to blessedness, shall it be no longer called a soul?[fn-66-P6655_1347164:133-nf] Let us see if perhaps an answer may be given in this way, that as the Saviour came to save what was lost, that which formerly was said to be lost is not lost when it is saved; so also, perhaps, this which is saved is called a soul, and when it has been placed in a state of salvation will receive a name from the Word that denotes its more perfect condition. But it appears to some that this also may be added, that as the thing which was lost undoubtedly existed before it was lost, at which time it was something else than destroyed, so also will be the case when it is no longer in a ruined condition. In like manner also, the soul which is said to have perished will appear to have been something at one time, when as yet it had not perished, and on that account would be termed soul, and being again freed from destruction, it may become a second time what it was before it perished, and be called a soul. But from the very signification of the name soul which the Greek word conveys, it has appeared to a few curious inquirers that a meaning of no small importance may be suggested.

The prophet Jeremiah also hears from Him, who gave him his answers, \"Behold, I have given My words into thy mouth a fire.\"[fn-66-P6660_1349832:138-nf] As God, then, is a fire, and the angels a flame of fire, and all the saints are fervent in spirit, so, on the contrary, those who have fallen away from the love of God are undoubtedly said to have cooled in their affection for Him, and to have become cold. For the Lord also says, that, \"because iniquity has abounded, the love of many will grow cold.\"[fn-66-P6661_1350277:139-nf] Nay, all things, whatever they are, which in holy Scripture are compared with the hostile power, the devil is said to be perpetually finding cold; and what is found to be colder than he? In the sea also the dragon is said to reign. For the prophet[fn-66-P6662_1350548:140-nf] intimates that the serpent and dragon, which certainly is referred to one of the wicked spirits, is also in the sea. And elsewhere the prophet says, \"I will draw out my holy sword upon the dragon the flying serpent, upon the dragon the crooked serpent, and will slay him.\"[fn-66-P6663_1350853:141-nf] And again he says: \"Even though they hide from my eyes, and descend into the depths of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and it shall bite them.\"[fn-66-P6664_1351030:142-nf] In the book of Job also, he is said to be the king of all things in the waters.[fn-66-P6665_1351129:143-nf] The prophet[fn-66-P6666_1351168:144-nf] threatens that evils will be kindled by the north wind upon all who inhabit the earth.

If, then, those things which are holy are named fire, and light, and fervent, while those which are of an opposite nature are said to be cold; and if the love of many is said to wax cold; we have to inquire whether perhaps the name soul, which in Greek is termed yukh/, be so termed from growing cold[fn-66-P6668_1351802:146-nf] out of a betterand more divine condition, and be thence derived, because it seems to have cooled from thatnatural and divine warmth, and therefore has been placed in its present position, and called by its present name. Finally, see if you caneasily find a place in holy Scripture where thesoul is properly mentioned in terms of praise: it frequently occurs, on the contrary, accompanied with expressions of censure, as in the passage, \"An evil soul ruins him who possesses it; \"[fn-66-P6669_1352309:147-nf] and, \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\"[fn-66-P6670_1352376:148-nf] For after it has been said, \"All souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine,\"[fn-66-P6671_1352521:149-nf] it seemed to follow that He would say, \"The soul that doeth righteousness, it shall be saved,\" and \"The soul which sinneth, it shall die.\" But now we see that He has associated with the soul what is censurable, and has been silent as to that which was deserving of praise. We have therefore to see if, perchance, as we have said is declared by the name itself, it was called yukh/, i.e., anima, because it has waxed cold from the fervour of just things,[fn-66-P6672_1353002:150-nf] and from participation in the divine fire, and yet has not lost the power of restoring itself to that condition of fervour in which it was at the beginning.

Thus, therefore, Christ also-that is, the image of God, and the Son of God-is looked upon by men, inasmuch as He could be seen. And thus the weakness and imperfection of the human destiny is nourished, led up, and educated by Him; so that, being accustomed to look upon the Son, it may one day be able to see God the Father Himself also as He is, that it may not be stricken by His sudden and intolerable brightness, and be hindered from being able to see God the Father, whom it has always desired.[fn-102-P10282_3215614:137-nf] Wherefore it is the Son who is seen; but the Son of God is the Word of God: and the Word of God was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and this is Christ. What in the world is the reason that we should hesitate to call Him God, who in so many ways is acknowledged to be proved God? And if, moreover, the angel meets with Hagar, Sarah's maid, driven from her home as well as turned away, near the fountain of water in the way to Shur; asks and learns the reason of her flight, and after that offers her advice that she should humble herself; and, moreover, gives her the hope of the name of mother, and pledges and promises that from her womb there should be a numerous seed, and that she should have Ishmael to be born from her; and with other things unfolds the place of his habitation, and describes his mode oflife; yet Scripture sets forth this angel as both Lord and God-for He would not have promised the blessing of seed unless the angel had also been God. Let them ask what the heretics can make of this present passage. Was that the Father that was seen by Hagar or not? For He is declared to be God. But far be it from us to call God the Father an angel, lest He should be subordinate to another whose angel He would be. But they will say that it was an angel. How then shall He be God if He was an angel? Since this name is nowhere conceded to angels, except that on either side the truth compels us into this opinion, that we ought to understand it to have been God the Son, who, because He is of God, is rightly called God, because He is the Son of God. But, because He is subjected[fn-102-P10283_3217306:138-nf] to the Father, and the Announcer of the Father's will, He is declared to be the Angel of Great Counsel.[fn-102-P10284_3217548:139-nf] Therefore, although this passage neither is suited to the person of the Father, lest He should be called an angel, nor to the person of an angel, lest he should be called God; yet it is suited to the person of Christ that He should be both God because He is the Son of God, and should be an angel because He is the Announcer of the Father's mind. And the heretics ought to understand that they are setting themselves against the Scriptures, in that, while they say that they believe Christ to have been also an angel, they are unwilling to declare Him to have been also God, when they read in the Old Testament that He often came to visit the human race. To this, moreover, Moses added the instance of God seen of Abraham at the oak of Mature, when he was sitting at the opening of his tent at noon-day. And nevertheless, although he had beheld three men, note that he called one of them Lord; and when he had washed their feet, he offers them bread baked on the ashes, with butter and abundance of milk itself, and urges them that, being detained as guests, they should eat. And after I this he hears also that he should be a father, and learns that Sarah his wife should bring forth a son by him; and acknowledges concerning the destruction of the people of Sodom, what they deserve to suffer; and learns that God had come down on account of the cry of Sodom. in which place, if they will have it that the Father was seen at that time to have been received with hospitality in company with two angels, the heretics have believed the Father to be visible. But if an angel, although of the three angels one is called Lord, why, although it is not usual, is an angel called God? Unless because, in order that His proper invisibility may be restored to the Father, and the proper inferiority[fn-102-P10285_3219497:140-nf] be remitted to the angel, it was only God the Son, who also is God, who was seen by Abraham, and was believed to have been received with hospitality. For He anticipated sacramentally what He was hereafter to become. He was made a guest of Abraham, being about to be among the sons of Abraham. And his children's feet, by way of proving what He was, He washed; returning in the children the claim of hospitality which formerly the Father had put out to interest to Him. Whence also, that there might be no doubt but that it was He who was the guest of Abraham on the destruction of the people of Sodom, it is declared: \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrha fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven.\"[fn-102-P10286_3220353:141-nf] For thus also said the prophet in the person of God: \"I have overthrown you, as the Lord overturned Sodom and Gomorrha.\"[fn-102-P10287_3220496:142-nf] Therefore the Lord overturned Sodom, that is, God overturned Sodom; but in the overturning of Sodom, the Lord rained fire from the Lord. And this Lord was the God seen by Abraham; and this God was the guest of Abraham, certainly seen because He was also touched. But although the Father, being invisible, was assuredly not at that time seen, He who was accustomed to be touched and seen was seen and received to hospitality. But this the Son of God, \"The Lord rained from the Lord upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire.\" And this is the Word of God. And the Word of God was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and this is Christ. It was not the Father, then, who was a guest with Abraham, but Christ. Nor was it the Father who was seen then, but the Son; and Christ was seen. Rightly, therefore, Christ is both Lord and God, who was not otherwise seen by Abraham, except that as God the Word He was begotten of God the Father before Abraham himself. Moreover, says the Scripture, the same Angel and God visits and consoles the same Hagar when driven with her son from the dwelling of Abraham. For when in the desert she had exposed the infant, because the water had fallen short from the pitcher; and when the lad had cried out, and she had lifted up her weeping and lamentation, \"God heard,\" says the Scripture, \"the voice of the lad from the place where he was.\"[fn-102-P10288_3221883:143-nf] Having told that it was God who heard the voice of the infant, it adds: \"And the angel of the Lord called Hagar herself out of heaven,\" saying that that was an angel[fn-102-P10289_3222076:144-nf] whom it had called God, and pronouncing Him to be Lord whom it had set forth as an angel; which Angel and God moreover promises to Hagar herself greater consolations, in saying, \"Fear not; for I have heard the voice of the lad from the place where he was. Arise, take up the lad, and hold him; for I will make of him a great nation.\"[fn-102-P10290_3222446:145-nf] Why does this angel, if angel only, claim to himself this right of saying, I will make of him a great nation, since assuredly this kind of power belongs to God, and cannot belong to an angel? Whence also He is confirmed to be God, since He is able to do this; because, by way of proving this very point, it is immediately added by the Scripture: \"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of running water; and she went and filled the bottle from the well, and gave to the lad: and God was with the lad.\"[fn-102-P10291_3222975:146-nf] If, then, this God was with the Lord, who opened the eyes of Hagar that she might see the well of running water, and might draw the water on account of the urgent need of the lad's thirst, and this God who calls her from heaven is called an angel when, in previously hearing the voice of the lad crying, He was rather God; is not understood to be other than angel, in like manner as He was God also. And since this cannot be applicable or fitting to the Father, who is God only, but may be applicable to Christ, who is declared to be not only God, but angel also,[fn-102-P10292_3223561:147-nf] it manifestly appears that it was not the Father who thus spoke to Hagar, but rather Christ, since He is God; and to Him also is applied the name of angel, since He became the \"angel of great counsel.\"[fn-102-P10293_3223792:148-nf] And He is the angel, in that He declares the bosom of the Father, as John sets forth. For if John himself says, that He Himself who sets forth the bosom of the Father, as the Word, became flesh in order to declare the bosom of the Father, assuredly Christ is not only man, but angel also; and not only angel, but He is shown by the Scriptures to be God also. And this is believed to be the case by us; so that, if we will not consent to apprehend that it was Christ who then spoke to Hagar, we must either make an angel God, or we must reckon God the Father Almighty among the angels.[fn-102-P10294_3224402:149-nf] ","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_44_oration_xxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XVII.

Justly, therefore, do we convict them of having departed far and wide from the truth.

The case being thus, let who will among them consider the matter, so that one may abash them by the following question; Is it right to say that what is God's offspring and proper to Him is out of nothing? or is it reasonable in the very idea, that what is from God has accrued to Him, that a man should dare to say that the Son is not always? For in this again the generation of the Son exceeds and transcends the thoughts of man, that we become fathers of our own children in time, since we ourselves first were not and then came into being; but God, in that He ever is, is ever Father of the Son[fn-32-P3293_1300094:76-nf] . And the origination of mankind is brought home to us from things that are parallel; but, since `no one knoweth the Son but the Father, and no one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him[fn-32-P3294_1300943:77-nf] ,' therefore the sacred writers to whom the Son has revealed Him, have given us a certain image from things visible, saying, `Who is the brightness of His glory, and the Expression of His Person[fn-32-P3295_1301157:78-nf] ;' and again, `For with Thee is the well of life, and in Thy light shall we see lights[fn-32-P3296_1301260:79-nf] ;' and when the Word chides lsrael, He says, `Thou hast forsaken the Fountain of wisdom[fn-32-P3297_1301367:80-nf] ;' and this Fountain it is which says, `They have forsaken Me the Fountain of living waters[fn-32-P3298_1301478:81-nf] .' And mean indeed and very dim is the illustration[fn-32-P3299_1301935:82-nf] compared with what we desiderate; but yet it is possible from it to understand something above man's nature, instead of thinking the Son's generation to be on a level with ours. For who can even imagine that the radiance of light ever was not, so that he should dare to say that the Son was not always, or that the Son was not before His generation? or who is capable of separating the radiance from the sun, or to conceive of the fountain as ever void of life, that he should madly say, `The Son is from nothing,' who says, `I am the life[fn-33-P3300_1302494:83-nf] ,' or `alien to the Father's essence,' who, says, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the: Father[fn-33-P3301_1302607:84-nf] ?' for the sacred writers wishing us thus to understand, have given these illustrations; and it is unseemly and most irreligious, when Scripture contains such images, to form ideas concerning our Lord from others which are neither in Scripture, nor have any religious bearing.","title":"De Decretis or Defence of the Nicene Definition","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_34_de_decretis_or_defence_of_the_nicene_definition","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"17.

Solomon also received the same from God, and said, `The Lord by wisdom founded the earth[fn-33-P3347_1320751:122-nf] ,' and John, knowing that the Word was the Hand and the Wisdom, thus preached, `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made[fn-33-P3348_1321040:123-nf] .'

Here then all points but one are satisfactorily and exactly defined, some for the correction of what had been corrupted, some as a precaution against errors expected to arise. The doctrine of the Spirit, however, is merely mentioned, as needing no elaboration, because at the time of the Council no question was mooted, and the opinion on this subject in the hearts of the faithful was exposed to no attack. Little by little, however, the growing poison-germs of impiety, first sown by Arius, the champion of the heresy, and then by those who succeeded to his inheritance of mischief, were nurtured to the plague of the Church, and the regular development of the impiety issued in blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. Under these circumstances we are under the necessity of putting before the men who have no pity for themselves, and shut their eyes to the inevitable threat directed by our Lord against blasphemers of the Holy Ghost, their bounden duty. They must anathematize all who call the Holy Ghost a creature, and all who so think; all who do not confess that He is holy by nature, as the Father is holy by nature, and the Son is holy by nature, and refuse Him His place in the blessed divine nature. Our not separating Him from Father and Son is a proof of our right mind, for we are bound to be baptized in the terms we have received and to profess belief in the terms in which we are baptized, and as we have professed belief in, so to give glory to Father, on, and Holy Ghost; and to hold aloof from the communion of all who call Him creature, as from open blasphemers. One point must be regarded as settled; and the remark is necessary because of our slanderers; we do not speak of the Holy Ghost as unbegotten, for we recognise one Unbegotten and one Origin of all things,[fn-40-P4086_1307440:8-nf] the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: nor do we speak of the Holy Ghost as begotten, for by the tradition of the faith we have been taught one Only-begotten: the Spirit of truth we have been taught to proceed from the Father, and we confess Him to be of God without creation.We are also bound to anathematize all who speak of the Holy Ghost as ministerial,[fn-40-P4087_1307825:9-nf] inasmuch as by this term they degrade Him to the rank of a creature.

And He approached him as one of the multitude, and humbled Himself among the captives though He was the Redeemer, and ranged Himself with those under judgment though He was the Judge, and joined Himself with the lost sheep though He was the Good Shepherd who on account of the straying sheep came down from heaven, and yet did not forsake His heavens, and Was mingled with the tares though He was that heavenly grain that springs unsown. And when the Baptist John then saw Him, recognising Him whom before in his mother's womb he had recognised and worshipped, and discerning clearly that this was He on whose account, in a manner surpassing the natural time, the had leaped in the womb of his mother. in violation of the limits of nature, he drew his right hand within his double cloak, and bowing his head like a servant full of love to his master, addressed Him in these words: I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?[fn-12-P1267_336953:6-nf] What is this Thou doest, my Lord? Why dost Thou reverse the order of things? Why seekest Thou along with the servants, at the hand of Thy servant, the things that are proper to servants? Why dost Thou desire to receive what Thou requirest not? Why dost Thou burden me, Thy servitor, with Thy mighty condescension? I have need to be baptized of Thee, but Thou hast no need to be baptized of me. The less is blessed by the greater, and the greater is not blessed and sanctified by the less. The light is kindled by the sun, and the sun is not made to shine by the rush-lamp. The clay is wrought by the potter, and the potter is not moulded by the clay.

Or, because Thou hast condescended so far to me as to have approached my body, and dost bear me wholly in Thyself in order to effect the salvation of the whole man, am I, on account of that body of Thine which is seen, to overlook that divinity of Thine which is only apprehended? Or, because on behalf of my salvation Thou hast taken to Thyself the offering of my first-fruits, am I to ignore the fact that Thou \"coverest Thyself with light as with a garment? \"[fn-12-P1269_338676:8-nf] Or, because Thou wearest the flesh that is related to me, and dost show Thyself to men as they are able to see Thee, am I to forget the brightness of Thy glorious divinity? Or, because I see my own form in Thee, am I to reason against Thy divine substance, which is invisible and incomprehensible? I know Thee, O Lord; I know Thee clearly. I know Thee, since I have been taught by Thee; for no one can recognise Thee, unless He enjoys Thine illumination. I know Thee, O Lord, clearly; for I saw Thee spiritually before I beheld this light. When Thou wert altogether in the incorporeal bosom of the heavenly Father, Thou wert also altogether in the womb of Thy handmaid and mother; and I though held in the womb of Elisabeth by nature as in a prison, and bound with the indissoluble bonds of the children unborn, leaped and celebrated Thy birth with anticipative rejoicings. Shall I then, who gave intimation of Thy sojourn on earth before Thy birth, fail to apprehend Thy coming after Thy birth? Shall I, who in the womb was a teacher of Thy coming, be now a child in understanding in view of perfect knowledge? But I cannot but worship Thee, who art adored by the whole creation; I cannot but proclaim Thee, of whom heaven gave the indication by the star, and for whom earth offered a kind reception by the wise men, while the choirs of angels also praised Thee in joy over Thy condescension to us, and the shepherds who kept watch by night hymned Thee as the Chief Shepherd of the rational sheep.

I was born, and thereby removed the barrenness of the mother that bore me; and while still a babe I became the healer of my father's speechlessness, having received of Thee from my childhood the gift of the miraculous. But Thou, being born of the Virgin Mary, as Thou didst will, and as Thou alone dost know, didst not do away with her virginity; but Thou didst keep it, and didst simply gift her with the name of mother: and neither did her virginity preclude Thy birth, nor did Thy birth injure her virginity. But these two things, so utterly opposite-bearing and virginity-harmonized with one intent; for such a thing abides, possible with Thee, the Framer of nature.

What a variety, I have said, in the actions and lives of flying creatures. Some of these unreasoning creatures even have a government, if the feature of government is to make the activity of all the individuals centrein one common end. This may be observed in bees. They have a common dwelling place; they fly in the air together, they work at thesame work together; and what is still more extraordinary is that they give themselves to these labours under the guidance of a king and superintendent, and that they do not allow themselves to fly to the meadows without seeing if the king is flying at their head. As to this king, it is not election that gives him this authority; ignorance on the part of the people often puts the worst man in power; it is not fate; the blind decisions of fate often give authority to the most unworthy. It is not heredity that places him on the throne; it is only too common to see the children of kings, corrupted by luxury and flattery, living in ignorance of all virtue. It is nature which makes the king of the bees, for nature gives him superior size, beauty, and sweetness of character. He has a sting like the others, but he does not use it to revenge himself.[fn-24-P2432_800729:19-nf] It is a principle of natural and unwritten law, that those who are raised to high office, ought to be lenient in punishing. Even bees who do not follow the example of their king, repent without delay of their imprudence, since they lose their lives with their sting. Listen, Christians, you to whom it is forbidden to \"recompense evil for evil\" and commanded \"to overcome evil with good.\"[fn-24-P2433_801433:20-nf] Take the bee for your model, which constructs its cells without injuring any one and without interfering with the goods of others. It gathers openly wax from the flowers with its mouth, drawing in the honey scattered over them like dew, and injects it into the hollow of its cells. Thus at first honey is liquid; time thickens it and gives it its sweetness.[fn-24-P2434_801814:21-nf] The book of Proverbs has given the bee the most honourable and the best praise by calling her wise and industrious.[fn-24-P2435_802523:22-nf] How much activity she exerts in gathering this precious nourishment, by which both kings and men of low degree are brought to health! How great is the art and cunning she displays in the construction of the store houses which are destined to receive the honey! After having spread the wax like a thin membrane, she distributes it in contiguous compartments which, weak though they are, by their number and by their mass, sustain the whole edifice. Each cell in fact holds to the one next to it, and is separated by a thin partition; we thus see two or three galleries of cells built one upon the other. The bee takes care not to make one vast cavity, for fear it might break trader the weight of the liquid, and allow it to escape.

For first of all, as to their first question, which is such as this, how dull and vague it is! they do not explain who it is they ask about, so as to allow of an answer, but they say abstractedly, `He who is,' `him who is not.' Who then `is,' and what `are not,' O Arians? or who `is,' and who `is not?' what are said `to be,' what `not to be?' for He that is, can make things which are not, and which are, and which were before. For instance, carpenter, and goldsmith, and potter, each, according to his own art, works upon materials previously existing, making what vessels he pleases; and the God of all Himself, having taken the dust of the earth existing and already brought to be, fashions man; that very earth, however, whereas it was not once, He has at one time made by His own Word. If then this is the meaning of their question, the creature on the one hand plainly was not before its origination, and men, on the other, work the existing material; and thus their reasoning is inconsequent, since both `what is' becomes, and `what is not' becomes, as these instances shew. But if they speak concerning God and His Word, let them complete their question and then ask, Was the God, `who is,' ever without Reason? and, whereas He is Light, was He ray-less? or was He always Father of the Word? Or again in this manner. Has the Father `who is' made the Word `who is not,' or has He ever with Him His Word, as the proper offspring of His substance? This will shew them that they do but presume and venture on sophisms about God and Him who is from Him. Who indeed can bear to hear them say that God was ever without Reason? this is what they fall into a second time, though endeavouring in vain to escape it and to hide it with their sophisms. Nay, one would fain not hear them disputing at all, that God was not always Father, but became so afterwards (which is necessary for their fantasy, that His Word once was not), considering the number of the proofs already adduced against them; while John besides says, `The Word was[fn-54-P5464_2150873:155-nf] ,' and Paul again writes, `Who being the brightness of His glory[fn-54-P5465_2150956:156-nf] ,' and, `Who is over all, God blessed for ever.

Therefore the Image of the unalterable God must be unchangeable; for `Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever[fn-55-P5525_2188458:195-nf] .' And David in the Psalm says of Him, `Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thine hands. They shall perish, but Thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment. And as a vesture shall Thou fold them up, and they shall be changed, but Thou art the same. and Thy years shall not fail[fn-55-P5526_2188838:196-nf] .' And the Lord Himself says of Himself through the Prophet, `See now that I, even I am He,' and `I change not[fn-55-P5527_2188972:197-nf] .' It may be said indeed that what is here signified relates to the Father; yet it suits the Son also to say this, specially because, when made man, He manifests His own identity and unalterableness to such as suppose that by reason of the flesh He is changed and become other than He was. More trustworthy are the saints, or rather the Lord, than the perversity of the irreligious. For Scripture, as in the above-cited passage of the Psalter, signifying under the name of heaven and earth, that the nature of all things originate and created is alterable and changeable, yet excepting the Son from these, shews us thereby that He is no wise a thing originate; nay teaches that He changes everything else, and is Himself not changed, in saying, `Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail[fn-55-P5528_2189803:198-nf] .' And with reason; for things originate, being from nothing[fn-55-P5529_2189883:199-nf] , and not being before their origination, because, in truth, they come to be after not being, have a nature which is changeable; but the Son, being from the Father, and proper to His essence, is unchangeable and unalterable as the Father Himself. For it were sin to say that from that essence which is unalterable was begotten an alterable word and a changeable wisdom. For how is He longer the Word, if He be alterable? or can that be Wisdom which is changeable? unless perhaps, as accident in essence[fn-55-P5530_2190404:200-nf] , so they would have it, viz. as in any particular essence, a certain grace and habit of virtue exists accidentally, which is called Word and Son and Wisdom, and admits of being taken from it and added to it. For they have often expressed this sentiment, but it is not the faith of Christians; as not declaring that He is truly Word and Son of God, or that the wisdom intended is true Wisdom. For what alters and changes, and has no stay in one and the same condition, how can that be true? whereas the Lord says, `I am the Truth[fn-55-P5531_2190963:201-nf] .' If then the Lord Himself speaks thus concerning Himself, and declares His unalterableness, and the Saints have learned and testify this, nay and our notions of God acknowledge it as religious, whence did these men of irreligion draw this novelty?

Hitherto we have met their irrational conceits with the true conceptions[fn-55-P5559_2201135:222-nf] implied in the Word `Son,' as the Lord Himself has given us. But it will be well next to cite the divine oracles, that the unalterableness of the Son and His unchangeable nature, which is the Father's, as well as their perverseness, may be still more fully proved. The Apostle then, writing to the Philippians, says, `Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who, being in the form of God, thought it not a prize to be equal with God; but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men. And, being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself. becoming obedient to death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also highly exalted Him, and gave Him a Name which is above every name; that in the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father[fn-55-P5560_2202222:223-nf] .' Can anything be plainer and more express than this? He was not from a lower state pro-rooted: but rather, existing as God, He took the form of a servant, and in taking it, was not promoted but humbled Himself. Where then is there here any reward of virtue, or what advancement and promotion in humiliation? For if, being God, He became man, and descending from on high He is still said to be exalted, where is He exalted, being God? this withal being plain, that, since God is highest of all, His Word must necessarily he highest also. Where then could He be exalted higher, who is in the Father and like the Father in all things[fn-55-P5561_2202877:224-nf] ? Therefore He is beyond the need of any addition; nor is such as the Arians think Him. For though the Word has descended in order to be exalted, and so it is written, yet what need was there that He should humble Himself, as if to seek that which He had already? And what grace did He receive who is the Giver of grace[fn-55-P5562_2203243:225-nf] ? or how did He receive that Name for worship, who is always worshipped by His Name? Nay, certainly before He became man, the sacred writers invoke Him, `Save me, O God, for Thy Name's sake[fn-55-P5563_2203456:226-nf] ;'and again, `Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will remember the Name of the Lord our God[fn-55-P5564_2203593:227-nf] .'

For He says not, `Wherefore He anointed Thee in order to Thy being God or Kites or Son or Word;' for so He was before and is for ever, as has been shewn; but rather, `Since Thou art God and King,therefore Thou wast anointed, since none bat Thou couldest unite man to the Holy Ghost, Thou the Image of the Father, in which[fn-56-P5631_2238455:282-nf] we were made in the beginning; for Thine is even the Spirit.'

However, they must be answered, with the chance of their profiting by it, that comparison confessedly does belong to subjects one in kind, not to those which differ. No one, for instance, would compare God with man, or again man with brutes, nor wood with stone, because their natures are unlike; but God is beyond comparison, and man is compared to man, and wood to wood, and stone to stone. Now in such cases we should not speak of `better,' but of `rather' and `more;' thus Joseph was comely rather than his brethren, and Rachel than Leah; star[fn-57-P5707_2264546:347-nf] is not better than star, but is the rather excellent in glory; whereas in bringing together things which differ in kind, then `better' is used to mark the difference, as has been said in the case of wisdom and jewels. Had then the Apostle said, `by so much has the Son precedence of the Angels,' or `by so much greater,' you would have had a plea, as if the Son were compared with the Angels; but, as it is, in saying that He is `better,' and differs as far as Son from servants, the Apostle shews that He is other than the Angels in nature. (6.) Moreover by saying that He it is who has `laid the foundation of all things[fn-57-P5708_2265192:348-nf] ,' he shews that He is other than all things originate. But if He be other and different in essence from their nature, what comparison of His essence can[fn-57-P5709_2265365:349-nf] there be, or what likeness to them? though, even if they have any such thoughts, Paul shall refute them, who speaks to the very point, `For unto which of the Angels said He at any time, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee? And of the Angels He saith, Who maketh His Angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire[fn-57-P5710_2265719:350-nf] .'58. Observe here, the word `made' belongs to things originate, and he calls them things made; but to the Son he speaks not of making, nor of becoming, hut of eternity and kingship, and a Framer's office, exclaiming, `Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever;' and, `Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thine hands; they shall perish, but Thou remainest.' From which words even they, were they but willing, might perceive that the Framer is other than things framed, the former God, the latter things originate, made out of nothing. For what has been said, `They shall perish,' is said, not as if the creation were destined for destruction, but to express the nature of things originate by the issue to which they tend[fn-57-P5711_2266521:351-nf] . For things which admit of perishing, though through the grace[fn-57-P5712_2266606:352-nf] of their Maker they perish not, yet have come out of nothing, and themselves witness that they once were not. And on this account, since their nature is such, it is said of the Son, `Thou remainest,' to shew His eternity; for not having the capacity of perishing, as things originate have, but having eternal duration, it is foreign to Him to have it said, `He was not before His generation,' but proper to Him to be always, and to endure together with the Father. And though the Apostle had not thus written in his Epistle to the Hebrews, still his other Epistles, and the whole of Scripture, would certainly forbid their entertaining such notions concerning the Word. But since he has here expressly written it, and, as has been above shewn, the Son is Offspring of the Father's essence, and He is Framer, and other things are framed by Him, and He is the Radiance and Word and Image and Wisdom of the Father, and things originate stand and serve in their place below the Triad, therefore the Son is different in kind and different in essence from things originate, and on the contrary is proper to the Father's essence and one in nature with it[fn-57-P5713_2267782:353-nf] .

And Hence it is that the Son too says not, `My Father is better than I[fn-57-P5714_2268053:354-nf] ,' lest we should conceive Him to be foreign to His Nature, but `greater,' not indeed in greatness, nor in time, but because of His generation from the Father Himself[fn-57-P5715_2268241:355-nf] , nay, in saying `greater' He again shows that He is proper to His essence.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"61.

For in that the Son reigns in His Father's kingdom, is seated upon the same throne as the Father, and is contemplated in the Father's Godhead, therefore is the Word God, and whose beholds the Son, beholds the Father; and thus there is one God. Sitting then on the right, yet He does not place His Father on the left[fn-57-P5739_2275967:375-nf] ; but whatever is right[fn-57-P5740_2276125:376-nf] and precious in the Father, that also the Son has, and says, `All things that the Father hath are Mine[fn-57-P5741_2276242:377-nf] .'

Thus they misunderstand the passage in the Proverbs, `The Lord hath created me a beginning of His ways for His works[fn-58-P5803_2311771:2-nf] ,' and the words of the Apostle, `Who was faithful to Him that made Him[fn-58-P5804_2311889:3-nf] ,' and straightway argue, that the Son of God is a work and a creature. But although they might have learned from what is said above, had they not utterly lost their power of apprehension, that the Son is not from nothing nor in the number of things originate at all, the Truth witnessing[fn-58-P5805_2312194:4-nf] it (for, being God, He cannot be a work, and it is impious to call Him a creature, and it is of creatures and works that we say, `out of nothing,' and `it was not before its generation'), yet since, as if dreading to desert their own fiction, they are accustomed to allege the aforesaid passages of divine Scripture, which have a good meaning, but are by them practised on, let us proceed afresh to take up the question of the sense of these, to remind the faithful, and to shew from each of these passages that they have no knowledge at all of Christianity. Were it otherwise, they would not have shut themselves up in the unbelief[fn-58-P5806_2312853:5-nf] of the present Jews[fn-58-P5807_2312893:6-nf] , but would have inquired and learned[fn-58-P5808_2313227:7-nf] that, whereas `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,' in consequence, it was when at the good pleasure of the Father the Word became man, that it was said of Him, as by John, `The Word became flesh[fn-58-P5809_2313562:8-nf] ;' so by Peter, `He hath made Him Lord and Christ[fn-58-P5810_2313627:9-nf] ';-as by means of Solomon in the Person of the Lord Himself, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways for His works[fn-58-P5811_2313764:10-nf] ;' so by Paul, `Become so much better than the Angels[fn-58-P5812_2313839:11-nf] ;' and again, `He emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant[fn-58-P5813_2313930:12-nf] ;' and again, `Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Jesus, who was faithful to Him that made Him[fn-58-P5814_2314125:13-nf] .' For all these texts have the same force and meaning, a religious one, declarative of the divinity of the Word, even those of them which speak humanly concerning Him, as having become the Son of man. But, though this distinction is sufficient for their refutation, still, since from a misconception of the Apostle's words (to mention them first), they consider the Word of God to be one of the works, because of its being written, `Who was faithful to Him that made Him,' I have thought it needful to silence this further argument of theirs, taking in hand[fn-58-P5815_2314728:14-nf] , as before, their statement.

Moreover if, as the heretics hold, the Son were creature or work, but not as one of the creatures, because of His excelling them inglory, it were natural that Scripture should describe and display Him by a comparison in His favour with the other works; for instance, that it should say that He is greater than Archangels, and more honourable than the Thrones, and both brighter than sun and moon, and greater than the heavens. But he is not in fact thus referred to; but the Father shews Him to be His own proper and only Son, saying, `Thou art My Son,' and `This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased[fn-59-P5971_2384004:139-nf] ' Accordingly the Angels ministered unto Him, as being one beyond themselves; and they worship Him, not as being greater in glory, but as being some one beyond all the creatures, and beyond themselves, and alone the Father's proper Son according to essence[fn-59-P5972_2384294:140-nf] .

But this is not the case[fn-59-P5973_2384458:141-nf] ; for creature does not worship creature, but servant Lord, and creature God. Thus Peter the Apostle hinders Cornelius who would worship him, saying, `I myself also am a man[fn-59-P5974_2384659:142-nf] .'

And when Thomas said to Him, `My Lord and my God[fn-59-P5980_2386078:148-nf] ,' He allows his words, or rather accepts him instead of hindering him. For He is, as the other Prophets declare, and David says in the Psalm, `the Lord of hosts, the Lord of Sabaoth,' which is interpreted, `the Lord of Armies,' and God True and Almighty, though the Arians burst[fn-59-P5981_2386393:149-nf] at the tidings.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"32.

And I think that the irreligious men themselves will be shamed from such a thought; for if the case stands not as we have said, but they will rule it that He is `First-born of the whole creation' as in essence-a creature among creatures, let them reflect that they will be conceiving Him as brother and fellow of the things without reason and life. For of the whole creation these also are parts; and the `First-born' must be first indeed in point of time but only thus, and in kind and similitude[fn-63-P6323_2520031:434-nf] must be the same with all. How then can they say this without exceeding all measures of irreligion? or who will endure them, if this is their language? or who can but hate them even imagining such things? For it is evident to all, that neither for Himself, as being a creature, nor as having any connection according to essence with the whole creation, has He been called `First-born' of it: but because the Word, when at the beginning He framed the creatures, condescended to things originate, that it might be possible for them to come to be. For they could not have endured His nature, which was untempered splendour, even that of the Father, unless condescending by the Father's love for man He had supported them and taken hold of them and brought them into existence[fn-63-P6324_2520816:435-nf] ; and next, because, by this condescension of the Word, the creation too is made a son[fn-63-P6325_2521373:436-nf] through Him, that He might be in all respects `First-born' of it, as has been said, both in creating, and also in being brought for the sake of all into this very world.

Nor, on seeing an Angel would a man say that he had seen the Father; for Angels, as it is written, are `ministering spirits sent forth to minister[fn-66-P6626_2629971:112-nf] ,' and are heralds of gifts given by Him through the Word to those who receive them. And the Angel on his appearance, himself confesses that he has been sent by his Lord; as Gabriel confessed in the case of Zacharias, and also in the case of Mary, bearer of God[fn-66-P6627_2630252:113-nf] . And he who beholds a vision of Angels, knows that he has seen the Angel and not God. For Zacharias saw an Angel; and Isaiah saw the Lord. Manoah, the father of Samson, saw an Angel; but Moses beheld God. Gideon saw an Angel, but to Abraham appeared God. And neither he who saw God, beheld an Angel, nor he who saw an Angel, considered that he saw God; for greatly, or rather wholly, do things by nature originate differ from God the Creator. But if at any time, when the Angel was seen, he who saw it heard God's voice, as took place at the bush; for `the Angel of the Lord was seen in a flame of fire out of the bush, and the Lord called Moses out of the bush, saying, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob[fn-66-P6628_2632388:114-nf] ,' yet was not the Angel the God of Abraham, but in the Angel God spoke. And what was seen was an Angel; but God spoke in him[fn-66-P6629_2632541:115-nf] . For as He spoke to Moses in the pillar of a cloud in the tabernacle, so also God appears and speaks in Angels. So again to the son of Nun He spake by an Angel. But what God speaks, it is very plain He speaks through the Word, and not through another. And the Word, as being not separate from the Father, nor unlike and foreign to the Father's Essence, what He works, those are the Father's works, and His framing of all things is one with His; and what the Son gives, that is the Father's gift. And he who hath seen the Son, knows that, in seeing Him, he has seen, not Angel, nor one merely greater than Angels, nor in short any creature, but the Father Himself. And he who hears the Word, knows that he hears the Father; as he who is irradiated by the radiance, knows that he is enlightened by the sun.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"36. For lest a man, perceiving that the Son has all that the Father hath, from the exact likeness and identity of that He hath, should wander into the irreligion of Sabellius, considering Him to be the Father, therefore He has said `Was given unto Me,' and `I received,' and `Were delivered to Me[fn-68-P6820_2703665:276-nf] ,' only to shew that He is not the Father, but the Father's Word, and the Eternal Son, who because of His likeness to the Father, has eternally what He has from Him, and because He is the Son, has from the Father what He has eternally. Moreover that `Was given' and `Were delivered,' and the like, do not impair[fn-68-P6821_2704013:277-nf] the Godhead of the Son, but rather shew Him to be truly[fn-68-P6822_2704100:278-nf] Son, we may learn from the passages themselves. For if all things are delivered unto Him, first, He is other than that all which He has received; next, being Heir of all things, He alone is the Son and proper according to the Essence of the Father. For if He were one of all, then He were not `heir of all[fn-68-P6823_2704431:279-nf] ,' but every one had received according as the Father willed and gave. But now, as receiving all things, He is other than them all, and alone proper to the Father. Moreover that `Was given' and `Were delivered' do not shew that once He had them not, we may conclude from a similar passage, and in like manner concerning them all; for the Saviour Himself says, `As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself[fn-68-P6824_2704903:280-nf] .' Now from the words `Hath given,' He signifies that He is not the Father; but in saying `so,' He shews the Son's natural likeness and propriety towards the Father. If then once the Father had not, plainly the Son once had not; for as the Father, `so' also the Son has. But if this is irreligious to say, and religious on the contrary to say that the Father had ever, is it not unseemly in themwhen the Son says that, `as' the Father has, `so' also the Son has, to say that He has not `so[fn-68-P6825_2705413:281-nf] ,' but otherwise? Rather then is the Word faithful, and all things which He says that He has received, He has always, yet has from the Father; and the Father indeed not from any, but the Son from the Father. For as in the instance of the radiance, if the radiance itself should say, `All places the light hath given me to enlighten, and I do not enlighten from myself, but as the light wills,' yet, in saying this, it does not imply that it once had not, but it means, `I am proper to the light, and all things of the light are mine;' so, and much more, must we understand in the instance of the Son. For the Father, having given all things to the Son, in the Son still[fn-68-P6826_2706108:282-nf] hath all things; and the Son having, still the Father hath them; for the Son's Godhead is the Father's Godhead, and thus the Father in the Son exercises His Providence[fn-68-P6827_2708323:283-nf] over all things.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"88","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"59.

Moreover, if they say that the Son is by will, they should say also that He came to be by understanding; for I consider understanding and will to be the same. For what a man counsels, about that also he has understanding; and what he has in understanding, that also he counsels. Certainly the Saviour Himself has made them correspond, as being cognate, when He says, `Counsel is mine and security; mine is understanding, and mine strength[fn-70-P7048_2802245:464-nf] .' For as strength and security are the same (for they mean one attribute), so we may say that Understanding and Counsel are the same, which is the Lord. But these irreligious men are unwilling that the Son should be Word and Living Counsel; but they fable that there is with God[fn-70-P7049_2802548:465-nf] , as if a habit[fn-70-P7050_2802733:466-nf] , coming and going[fn-70-P7051_2802801:467-nf] , after the manner of men, understanding, counsel, wisdom; and they leave nothing undone, and they put forward the `Thought' and `Will' of Valentinus, so that they may but separate the Son from the Father, and may call Him a creature instead of the proper Word of the Father. To them then must be said what was said to Simon Magus; `the irreligion of Valentinus perish with you[fn-70-P7052_2803386:468-nf] ;' and let every one rather trust to Solomon, who says, that the Word is Wisdom and Understanding. For he says, `The Lord by Wisdom founded the earth, by Understanding He established the heavens.' And as here by Understanding, so in the Psalms, `By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made.' And as by the Word the heavens, so `He hath done whatsoever pleased Him.' And as the Apostle writes to Thessalonians, `the will of God is in Christ Jesus[fn-70-P7053_2803856:469-nf] .' The Son of God then, He is the `Word' and the `Wisdom;' He the `Understanding' and the Living `Counsel;' and in Him is the `Good Pleasure of the Father;' He is `Truth' and `Light' and `Power' of the Father. But if the Will of God is Wisdom and Understanding, and the Son is Wisdom, he who says that the Son is `by will,' says virtually that Wisdom has come into being in wisdom, and the Son is made in a son, and the Word created through the Word[fn-70-P7054_2804385:470-nf] ; which is incompatible with God and is opposed to His Scriptures. For the Apostle proclaims the Son to be the own Radiance and Expression, not of the Father's will[fn-70-P7055_2804590:471-nf] , but of His Essence[fn-70-P7056_2804636:472-nf] Itself, saying, `Who being the Radiance of His glory and the Expression of His Subsistence[fn-70-P7057_2805361:473-nf] .'

And again, if a man were to examine and compare the great synod itself, and those held by these people, he would discover the piety of the one and the folly of the others. They who assembled at Nicaea did so not after being deposed: and secondly, they confessed that the Son was of the Essence of the Father. But the others, after being deposed again and again, and once more at Ariminum itself, ventured to write that it ought not to be said that the Son had Essence or Subsistence. This enables us to see, brethren, that they of Nicaea breathe the spirit of Scripture, in that God says in Exodus[fn-78-P7848_3145099:12-nf] , `I am that I am,' and through Jeremiah, `Who is in His substance[fn-78-P7849_3145184:13-nf] and hath seen His word;' and just below, `if they had stood in My subsistence[fn-78-P7850_3145300:14-nf] and heard My words:' now subsistence is essence, and means nothing else but very being, which Jeremiah calls existence, in the words, `and they heard not the voice of existence[fn-78-P7851_3145500:15-nf] .'

But the others, who think they know the Scriptures and call themselves wise, and do not choose to speak of subsistence in God (for thus they wrote at Ariminum and at other synods of theirs), were surely with justice deposed, saying as they did, like the fool did in his heart[fn-78-P7853_3146041:17-nf] , `God is not.' And again the fathers taught at Nicaea that the Son and Word is not a creature, nor made, having read `all things were made through Him[fn-78-P7854_3146210:18-nf] ,' and `in Him were all things created, and consist[fn-78-P7855_3146278:19-nf] ;' while these men, Arians rather than Christians, in their other synods have ventured to call Him a creature, and one of the things that are made, things of which He Himself is the Artificer and Maker.

I think that you cannot fail to understand this too, that the word \"father\" is but a single term indeed, and yet one admitting of being understood in various ways. For one is called father, as being the parent of those children whom he has begotten in a natural way; another is called father, as being the guardian of children whom he has but brought up; and some, again, are called fathers in respect of the privileged standing accruing through time or age. Hence our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is said to have a variety of fathers: for David was called His father, and Joseph was reckoned to be His father, while neither of these two was His father in respect of the actuality of nature. For David is called His father as touching the prerogative of time and age,[fn-35-P3594_998366:322-nf] and Joseph is designated His father as concerning the law of upbringing; but God Himself is His only Father by nature, who was pleased to make all things manifest in short space[fn-35-P3595_998583:323-nf] to us by His word. And our Lord Jesus Christ, making no tarrying,[fn-35-P3596_998667:324-nf] in the space of one year[fn-35-P3597_998724:325-nf] restored multitudes of the sick to health, and gave back the dead to the light of life; and He did indeed embrace all things in the power of His own word.[fn-35-P3598_999144:326-nf] And wherein, forsooth, did He make any tarrying, so that we should have to believe Him to have waited so long, even to these days, before He actually sent the Paraclete?[fn-35-P3599_999353:327-nf] Nay, rather, as has been already said above, He gave proof of His presence with us forthwith, and did most abundantly impart Himself to Paul, whose testimony we also believe when he says, \"Unto me only is this grace given.\"[fn-36-P3600_999677:328-nf] For this is he who formerly was a persecutor of the Church of God, but who afterwards appeared openly before all men as a faithful minister of the Paraclete; by whose instrumentality His singular clemency was made known to all men, in such wise that even to us who some time were without hope the largess of His gifts has come. For which of us could have hoped that Paul, the persecutor and enemy of the Church, would prove its defender and guardian? Yea, and not that alone, but that he would become also its ruler, the founder and architect of the churches? Wherefore after him, and after those who were with Himself-that is, the disciples-we are not to look for the advent of any other (such), according to the Scriptures; for our Lord Jesus Christ says of this Paraclete, \"He shall receive of mine.\"[fn-36-P3601_1000524:329-nf] Him therefore He selected as an acceptable vessel; and He sent this Paul to us in the Spirit. Into him the Spirit was poured;[fn-36-P3602_1000671:330-nf] and as that Spirit could not abide upon all men, but only on Him who was born of Mary the mother of God, so that Spirit, the Paraclete, could not come into any other, but could only come upon the apostles and the sainted Paul. \"For he is a chosen vessel,\" He says, \"unto me, to bear my name before kings and the Gentiles.\"[fn-36-P3603_1001283:331-nf] The apostle himself, too, states the same thing in his first epistle, where he says: \"According to the grace that is given to me of God, that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering[fn-36-P3604_1001546:332-nf] the Gospel of God.\"[fn-36-P3605_1001624:333-nf] \"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-36-P3606_1001745:334-nf] And again: \"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me by word and deed.\"[fn-36-P3607_1001883:335-nf] \"I am the last of all the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle. But by the grace of God I am what I am.\"[fn-36-P3608_1002022:336-nf] And it, is his wish to have to deal with[fn-36-P3609_1002240:337-nf] those who sought the proof of that Christ who spake in him, for this reason, that the Paraclete was in him: and as having obtained His gift of grace, and as being enriched with magnificent, honour,[fn-36-P3610_1002458:338-nf] he says: \"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-36-P3611_1002714:339-nf] Again, that it was the Paraclete Himself who was in Paul, is indicated by our Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel, when He says: \"If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray my Father, and He shall give you another Comforter.\"[fn-36-P3612_1002971:340-nf] In these words He points to the Paraclete Himself, for He speaks of \"another\" Comforter. And hence we have given credit to Paul, and have hearkened to him when he says, \"Or[fn-36-P3613_1003169:341-nf] seek ye a proof of Christ i speaking in me? \"[fn-36-P3614_1003227:342-nf] and when he expresses himself in similar terms, of which we have already spoken above. Thus, too, he seals his testament for us as for his faithful heirs, and like a father he addresses us in these words in his Epistle to the Corintians: \"I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures; and that He was seen of Cephas, then of the eleven apostles:[fn-36-P3615_1003765:343-nf] after that He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that He was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all He was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. For I am the last of the apostles.\"[fn-36-P3616_1004100:344-nf] \"Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.\"[fn-36-P3617_1004213:345-nf] And again, in delivering over to his heirs that inheritance which he gained first himself, he says: \"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ,[fn-36-P3618_1004538:346-nf] whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another Spirit, which we have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.

There iS a time to keep silence and a time to speak,[fn-53-P5302_1658217:3-nf] is the saying of the Preacher. Time enough has been given to silence, and now the time has come to open my mouth for the publication of the truth concerning matters that are, up to now, unknown. The illustrious Job bore his calamities for a long time in silence, and ever showed his courage by holding out under the most intolerable sufferings, but when he had struggled long enough in silence, and had persisted in covering his anguish in the bottom of his heart, at last he opened his mouth and uttered his well-known words.[fn-53-P5303_1658763:4-nf] In my own case this is now the third year of my silence, and my boast has become like that of the Psalmist \"I was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs.\"[fn-53-P5304_1658961:5-nf] Thus I shut up in the bottom of my heart the pangs which I suffered on account of the calumnies directed against me, for calumny humbles a man, and calumny makes a poor man giddy.[fn-53-P5305_1659161:6-nf] If, therefore, the mischief of calumny is so great as to cast down even the perfect man from his height, for this is what Scripture indicates by the word man, and by the poor man is meant he who lacks the great doctrines, as is the view also of the prophet when he says, \"These are poor, therefore they shall not hear; ... I will get me unto the great men,\"[fn-53-P5306_1659648:7-nf] he means by poor those who are lacking in understanding; and here, too, he plainly means those who are not yet furnished in the inner man, and have not even come to the full measure of their age; it is.these who are said by the proverb to be made giddy and tossed about. Nevertheless I thought that I ought to bear my troubles in silence, waiting for some indication to come out of them. I did not even think that what was said against me proceeded from ill will; I thought it was the result of ignorance of the truth. But now I see that hostility increases with time, and that my slanderers are not sorry for what they said at the beginning, and do not take any trouble to make amends for the past, but go on and on and rally themselves together to attain their original object. This was to make my life miserable and to devise means for sullying my reputation among the brethren. I, therefore, no longer see safety in silence. I have bethought me of the words of Isaiah: \"I have long time holden my peace, shall I always be still and refrain myself? I have been patient like a travailing woman.\"[fn-53-P5307_1660766:8-nf] God grant that I may both receive the reward of silence, and gain some strength to confute my opponents, and that thus, by confuting them, I may dry up the bitter torrent of falsehood that has gushed out against me. So might I say, \"My soul bus passed over the torrent;\"[fn-53-P5308_1661061:9-nf] and, \"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side when men rose up against us, ... then they had swallowed us up quick, the water had drowned us.\"[fn-53-P5309_1661235:10-nf] ","title":"Letter CCXXIII.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_251_letter_ccxxxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2. Let them dismiss, therefore, these questions of dialectics and examine the truth, not with mischievous exactness but with reverence. The judgment of our mind is given us for the understanding of the truth. Now our God is the very truth.[fn-54-P5449_1716703:4-nf] So the primary function of our mind is to know one God, but to know Him so far as the infinitely great can be known by the very small. When our eyes are first brought to the perception of visible objects, all visible objects are not at once brought into sight. The hemisphere of heaven is not beheld with one glance, but we are surrounded by a certain appearance, though in reality many things, not to say all things, in it are unperceived;-the nature of the stars, their greatness, their distances, their movements, their conjunctions, their intervals, their other conditions, the actual essence of the firmament, the distance of depth from the concave circumference to the convex surface. Nevertheless, no one would allege the heaven to be invisible because of what is unknown; it would be said to be visible on account of our limited perception of it. It is just the same in the case of God. If the mind has been injured by devils it will be guilty of idolatry, or will be perverted to some other form of impiety. But if it has yielded to the aid of the Spirit, it will have understanding of the truth, and will know God. But it will know Him, as the Apostle says, in part; and in the life to come more perfectly. For \"when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\"[fn-54-P5450_1718031:5-nf] The judgment of the mind is, therefore, good and given us for a good end-the perception of God; but it operates only so far as it can.

Now the proper way to direct our investigation seems to me to be as follows. We say that every good thing, which by God's providence befalls us, is an operation, of the Grace which worketh in us all things, as the apostle says, \"But all these worketh that one and the self same Spirit dividing to every man severally as he will.\"[fn-31-P3112_1012024:7-nf] If we ask, if the supply of good things which thus comes to the saints has its origin in the Holy Ghost alone, we are on the other hand guided by Scripture to the belief that of the supply of the good things which are wrought in us through the Holy Ghost, the Originator and Cause is the Only-begotten God;[fn-31-P3113_1012350:8-nf] for we are taught by Holy Scripture that \"All things were made by Him,\"[fn-31-P3114_1012794:9-nf] and \"by Him consist.\"[fn-31-P3115_1012831:10-nf] When we are exalted to this conception, again, led by God-inspired guidance, we are taught that by that power all things are brought from non-being into being, but yet not by that power to the exclusion of origination.[fn-31-P3116_1013067:11-nf] On the other hand there is a certain power subsisting without generation and without origination,[fn-31-P3117_1013181:12-nf] which is the cause of the cause of all things. For the Son, by whom are all things, and with whom the Holy Ghost is inseparably conceived of, is of the Father.[fn-31-P3118_1013385:13-nf] For it is not possible for any one to conceive of the Son if he be not previously enlightened by the Spirit. Since, then, the Holy Ghost, from Whom all the supply of good things for creation has its source, is attached to the Son, and with Him is inseparably apprehended, and has Its[fn-31-P3119_1013865:14-nf] being attached to the Father, as cause, from Whom also It proceeds; It has this note of Its peculiar hypostatic nature, that It is known after the Son[fn-31-P3120_1014044:15-nf] and together with the Son, and that It has Its subsistence of the Father. The Son, Who declares the Spirit proceeding from the Father through Himself and with Himself, shining forth alone and by only-begetting from the unbegotten light, so far as the peculiar notes are concerned, has nothing in common either with the Father or with the Holy Ghost. He alone is known by the stated signs. But God, Who is over all, alone haS, as one special mark of His own hypostasis, His being Father, and His deriving His hypostasis[fn-31-P3121_1015000:16-nf] from no cause; and through this mark He is peculiarly known. Wherefore in the communion of the substance we maintain that there is no mutual approach or intercommunion of those notes of indication perceived in the Trinity, whereby is set forth the proper peculiarity of the Persons delivered in the faith, each of these being distinctively apprehended by His own notes. Hence, in accordance with the stated signs of indication, discovery is made of the separation of the hypostases; while so far as relates to the infinite, the incomprehensible, the uncreate, the uncircumscribed, and similar attributes, there is no variableness in the life-giving nature; in that, I mean, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but in Them is seen a certain communion indissoluble and continuous. And by the same considerations, whereby a reflective student could perceive the greatness of any one of the (Persons) believed in in the Holy Trinity, he will proceed without variation. Beholding the glory in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, his mind all the while recognises no void interval wherein it may travel between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for there is nothing inserted between Them; nor beyond the divine nature is there anything so subsisting as to be able to divide that nature from itself by the interposition of any foreign matter. Neither is there any vacuum of interval, void of subsistence, which can make a break in the mutual harmony of the divine essence, and solve the continuity by the interjection of emptiness. He who perceives the Father, and perceives Him by Himself, has at the same time mental perception of the Son; and he who receives the Son does not divide Him from the Spirit, but, in consecution so far as order is concerned, in conjunction so far as nature is concerned, expresses the faith commingled in himself in the three together. He who makes mention of the Spirit alone, embraces also in this confession Him of whom He is the Spirit. And since the Spirit is Christ's and of God,[fn-31-P3122_1017013:17-nf] as says Paul, then just as he who lays hold on one end of the chain pulls the other to him, so he who \"draws the Spirit,\"[fn-31-P3123_1017169:18-nf] as says the prophet, by His means draws to him at the same time both the Son and the Father. And if any one verily receives the Son, he will hold Him on both sides, the Son drawing towards him on the one His own Father, and on the other His own Spirit. For He who eternally exists in the Father can never be cut off from the Father, nor can He who worketh all things by the Spirit ever be disjoined from His own Spirit. Likewise moreover he who receives the Father virtually receives at the same time both the Son and the Spirit; for it is in no wise possible to entertain the idea of severance or division, in such a way as that the Son should be thought of apart from the Father, or the Spirit be disjoined from the Son. But the communion and the distinction apprehended in Them are, in a certain sense, ineffable and inconceivable, the continuity of nature being never rent asunder by the distinction of the hypostases, nor the notes of proper distinction confounded in the community of essence. Marvel not then at my speaking of the name thing as being both conjoined and parted, and thinking as it were darkly in a riddle, of a certain[fn-31-P3124_1018478:19-nf] new and strange conjoined separation and separated conjunction. Indeed, even in objects perceptible to the senses, any one who approaches the subject in a candid and uncontentious spirit, may find similar conditions of things.","title":"Letter XXXVIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_56_letter_xxxviii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"6. It may however be thought that the account here given of the hypostasis does not tally with the sense of the Apostle's words, where he says concerning the Lord that He is \"the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person,\"[fn-31-P3128_1023620:21-nf] for if we have taught hypostasis to be the conflux of the several properties; and if it is confessed that, as in the case of the Father something is contemplated as proper and peculiar, whereby He alone is known, so in the same way is it believed about the Only-begotten; how then does Scripture in this place ascribe the name of the hypostasis to the Father alone, and describes the Son as form of the hypostasis, and designated not by His own proper notes, but by those of the Father? For if the hypostasis is the sign of several existence, and the property of the Father is confined to the unbegotten being, and the Son is fashioned according to His Father's properties, then the term unbegotten can no longer be predicated exclusively of the Father, the existence of the Only-begotten being denoted by the distinctive note of the Father.","title":"Letter XXXVIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_84_letter_lxvi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"No one.

You are well aware that if no check is put to the swift deterioration which we are witnessing, there will soon be nothing to prevent the complete transformation of the Churches. And if the decay of the Churches seems so pitiful to me, what must-so I have often in my lonely musings reflected-be the feelings of one who has known, by experience, the old tranquillity of the Churches of the Lord, and their one mind about the faith? But as your excellency feels most deeply this distress, it seems to me only becoming that your wisdom should be more strongly moved to interest itself in the Church's behalf. I for my part have long been aware, so far as my moderate intelligence has been able to judge of current events, that the one way of safety for the Churches of the East lies in their having the sympathy of the bishops of the West. For if only those bishops liked to show the same energy on behalf of the Christians sojourning in our part of the world[fn-35-P3519_1146151:2-nf] which they have shewn in the case of one or two of the men convicted of breaches of orthodoxy in the West, our common interests would probably reap no small benefit, our sovereigns I treating the authority of the people with respect, and the laity in all quarters unhesitatingly following them.[fn-35-P3520_1146708:3-nf] Bat, to carry out these objects, who has more capacity than yourself, with your intelligence and prudence? Who is keener to see the needful course to be taken? Who has more practical experience in working a profitable policy? Who feels more deeply the troubles of the brethren? What through all the West is more honoured than your venerable gray hairs?[fn-35-P3521_1147199:4-nf] O most honoured father, leave behind you some memorial worthy of your life and character. By this one act crown your innumerable efforts on behalf of true religion. Despatch from the holy Church placed under your care men of ability in sound doctrine to the bishops in the West. Recount to them the troubles whereby we are beset. Suggest some mode of relief. Be a Samuel to the Churches. Share the grief of the beleaguered people. Offer prayers for peace. Ask favour from the Lord, that He will send some memorial of peace to the Churches. I know how weak letters are to move men in matters of such importance; but you yourself no more need exhortation from others than the noblest athletes need the children's cheers. It is not as though I were instructing one in ignorance; I am only giving a new impulse to one whose energies are already roused. For the rest of the affairs of the East perhaps you may need the aid of more, and we must wait for the Westerns. But plainly the discipline of the Church of Antioch depends upon your reverence's being able to control some, to reduce others to silence, and to restore strength to the Church by concord.[fn-35-P3522_1148556:5-nf] No one knows better than you do, that, like all wise physicians, you ought to begin your treatment in the most vital parts, and what part is more vital to the Churches throughout the world than Antioch? Only let Antioch be restored to harmony, and nothing will stand in the way of her supplying, as a healthy head, soundness to all the body. Truly the diseases of that city, which has not only been cut asunder by heretics, but is torn in pieces by men who say that they are of one mind with one another, stand in need of your wisdom and evangelic sympathy. To unite the sundered parts again, and bring about the harmony of one body, belongs to Him alone Who by His ineffable power grants even to the dry bones to come back again to sinews and flesh. But the Lord always works His mighty works by means of them that are worthy of Him. Once again, in this case too, we trust that the ministry of matters so important may beseem your excellency, with the result that yon will lay the tempest of the people, do away with the party superiorities, and subject all to one another in love, and give back to the Church her ancient strength.","title":"Letter LXVI","author":"St. Basil"}]
