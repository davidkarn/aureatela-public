Many of our writers, it is true, unwisely, take this course; however, a few sentences of scripture will dispose alike of the heretics and the philosophers. What says the chosen vessel? \"God had concluded all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all;[fn-52-P5292_1461107:3780-nf] and in another place, \"all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.\"[fn-52-P5293_1461205:3781-nf] The preacher also who is the mouthpiece of the Divine Wisdom freely protests and says: \"there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not:\"[fn-52-P5294_1461386:3782-nf] and again, \"if thy people sin against thee, for there is no man that sinneth not:\"[fn-52-P5295_1461495:3783-nf] and \"who can say, I have made my heart clean?\"[fn-52-P5296_1461566:3784-nf] and \"none is clean from stain, not even if his life on earth has been but for one day. David insists on the same thing when he says: \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me;\"[fn-52-P5297_1461794:3785-nf] and in another psalm, \"in thy sight shall no man living be justified.\"[fn-52-P5298_1461885:3786-nf] This last passage they try to explain away from motives of reverence, arguing that the meaning is that no man is perfect in comparison with God. Yet the scripture does not say: \"in comparison with thee shall no man living be justified\" but \"in thy sight shall no man living be justified.\" And when it says \"in thy sight\" it means that those who seem holy to men to God in his fuller knowledge are by no means holy. For \"man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\"[fn-52-P5299_1462404:3787-nf] But if in the sight of God who sees all things and to whom the secrets of the heart lie open[fn-53-P5300_1462519:3788-nf] no man is just; then these heretics instead of adding to man's dignity, clearly take away from God's power. I might bring together many other passages of scripture of the same import; but were I to do so, I should exceed the limits I will not say of a letter but of a volume.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_09_book_iv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"Chrysostom: At this I shook my head and smiled a little, admiring the simple-mindedness of the man, and thus addressed him: I could wish indeed that matters were as thou sayest, most excellent of men, but not in order that I might be able to accept that office from which I lately fled.

In its very exordium one thus reads: \"God, who at sundry times, and in divers manners, spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds; who, being the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.\"[fn-5-P593_413821:169-nf] And by and by the writer says: \"For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?\"[fn-5-P594_414054:170-nf] And again in another passage: \"Forasmuch then,\" says he, \"as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.\"[fn-5-P595_414409:171-nf] Again, shortly after, he says: \"Wherefore in all things it behoved Him to be made like unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.\"[fn-5-P596_414673:172-nf] And in another place he writes: \"Let us hold fast our profession. For we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\"[fn-5-P597_414914:173-nf] Again he says: \"He hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them. For such a High Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; who needeth not daily (as those high priests) to offer up sacrifice, first for His own sins, and then for the people's: for this He did once, when He offered up Himself.\"[fn-5-P598_415421:174-nf] And once more: \"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us: nor yet that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others; (for then must He often have suffered since the foundation of the world;) but now once, in the end of the world, hath He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment; so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many: and unto them that look for Him shall Hepear the second time, without sin, unto salvation.\"[fn-5-P599_416147:175-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_08_counter_statements_of_theodoret_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Against X.-The unchangeable nature was not changed into nature of flesh, but assumed human nature and set it over the common high priests, as the blessed Paul teaches in the words, \"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is encompassed with infirmity. And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people so also for himself.\"[fn-9-P914_163648:217-nf] And a little further on interpreting this he says, \"As was Aaron so also was the Christ.\"[fn-9-P915_163761:218-nf] , Then pointing out the infirmity of the assumed nature he says, \"Who in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplication with strong crying and tears unto Him that was able to save Him from death, and was heard for His godly fear, though He was a son yet learned obedience by the things that He suffered: and having been made perfect He became unto all that obey Him the author of eternal salvation; named of God a high priest of the order of Melchisedec.\"[fn-9-P916_164279:219-nf] Who then is He who was perfected by toils of virtue and who was not perfect by nature? Who is He who learnt obedience by experience, and before his experience was ignorant of it? Who is it that lived with godly fear and offered supplication with strong crying and tears,not able to save Himself but appealing to Him that is able to save Him and asking for release from death? Not God the Word, the impassible, the immortal, the incorporeal, whose memory is joy and release from tears, \"For he has wiped away tears from off all faces,\"[fn-9-P917_164850:220-nf] and again the prophet says, \"I remembered God and was glad,\"[fn-9-P918_164933:221-nf] Who crowneth them that live in godly fear, \"Who knoweth all things before they be,\"[fn-9-P919_165043:222-nf] \"Who hath all things that the Father hath;\"[fn-9-P920_165112:223-nf] Who is the unchangeable image of the Father,\"[fn-9-P921_165179:224-nf] \"Who sheweth the Father in himself.\"[fn-9-P922_165235:225-nf] It is on the contrary that which was assumed by Him of the seed of David, mortal, passible, and afraid of death; although this itself afterwards destroyed the power of death throughunion with the God who had assumed it;[fn-9-P923_165475:226-nf] which walked through all righteousness and said to John, \"Suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.\"[fn-9-P924_165630:227-nf] This took the name of the priesthood of Melchisedec, for it put on infirmity of nature;-not the Almighty God the Word. Wherefore also, a little before, the blessed Paul said, \"We have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin.\"[fn-9-P925_165979:228-nf] It was the nature taken from us for our sakes which experienced our feelings without sin, not He that on account of our salvation assumed it. And in the beginning of this part of his subject he teaches us in the words \"Consider the apostle and high priest of our profession, Jesus, who was faithful to Him that appointed Him as also Moses was faithful in all His house.\"[fn-9-P926_166369:229-nf] But no one holding the right faith would call the unmade the uncreate, God the Word coeternal with the Father, a creature; but on the contrary, Him of David's seed Who being free from all sin was made our high priest and victim, after Himself offering Himself on our behalf to God having in Himself the Word, God of God, united to Himself and inseparably conjoined.","title":"Counter-Statements of Theodoret.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":4,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"104","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Moreover, this our interpretation will be supported while (we find that) elsewhere as well the Scriptures designate Christ a warrior, as we gather from the names of certain weapons, and words of that kind.

For as He is called the Son of Man by reason of the kindred of His flesh to her of whom He was born, so also He is conceived, surely, as the Son of God, by reason of the connection of His essence with that from which He has His existence, and this argument is the greatest weapon of the truth.

For the mutual concurrence of heterogeneous elements in the formation of our body is a kind of a combination harmoniously conjoined out of several dissimilar elements; but when, at the due time, the tie is loosed which bound together this concurrence of the elements, the combined nature is once more dissolved into the elements of which it was composed. This then is rather a work than a passion of the nature[fn-17-P1709_981623:39-nf] . For we give the name of \"passion\" only to that which is opposed to the virtuous unimpassioned state and of this we believe that He Who granted us salvation was at all times devoid, Who \"was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin[fn-17-P1710_982335:40-nf] .\" Of that, at least, which is truly passion, which is a diseased condition of the will, He was not a partaker; for it says \"He did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth[fn-17-P1711_982530:41-nf] \"; but the peculiar attributes of our nature, which, by a kind of customary abuse of terms, are called by the same name of \"passion,\" -of these, we confess, the Lord did partake,-of birth, nourishment, growth, of sleep and toil,and all those natural dispositions which the, soul is wont to experience with regard to bodily inconveniences,-the desire of that which is lacking, when the longing passes from the body to the soul, the sense of pain, the dread of death, and all the like, save only such as, if followed, lead to sin. As, then, when we perceive His power extending through all things in heaven, and air, and earth, and sea, whatever there is in heaven, whatever there is beneath the earth, we believe that He is universally present, and yet do not say that He is any of those things in which He is (for He is not the Heaven, Who has marked it out with His enfolding span, nor is He the earth, Who upholds the circle of the earth, nor yet is He the water, Who encompasses the liquid nature), so neither do we say that in passing through those sufferings of the flesh of which we speak He was \"subject to passion,\" but, as we say that He is the cause of all things that are, that He holds the universe in His grasp, that He directs all that is in motion and keeps upon a settled foundation all that is stationary, by the unspeakable power of His own majesty, so we say that He was born among us for the cure of the disease of sin, adapting the exercise of His healing power in a manner corresponding to the suffering, applying the healing in that way which He knew to be for the good of that part of the creation which He knew to be in infirmity. And as it was expedient that He should heal the sufferings by touch, we say that He so healed it; yet is He not, because He is the Healer of our infirmity, to be deemed on this account to have been Himself passible. For even in the case of men, ordinary use does not allow us to affirm such a thing. We do not say that one who touches a sick man to heal him is himself partaker of the infirmity, but we say that he does give the sick man the boon of a return to health, and does not partake of the infirmity: for the suffering does not touch him, it is he who touches the disease. Now if he who by his art works any good in men's bodies is not called dull or feeble, but is called a lover of men and a benefactor and the like, why do they slander the dispensation to usward as being mean and inglorious, and use it to maintain that the essence of the Son is \"divergent by way of inferiority,\" on the ground that the Nature of the Father is superior to sufferings, while that of the Son is not pure from passion? Why, if the aim of the dispensation of the Incarnation was not that the Son should be subject to suffering, but that He should be manifested as a lover of men, while the Father also is undoubtedly a lover of men, it follows that if one will but regard the aim, the Son is in the same case with the Father. But if it was not the Father Who wrought the destruction of death, marvel not,-for all judgment also He hath committed unto the Son, Himself judging no man[fn-17-P1712_985680:42-nf] ; not doing all things by the Son for the reason that He is unable either to save the lost or judge the sinner, but because He does these things too by His own Power, by which He works all things. Then they who were saved by the Son were saved by the Power of the Father, and they who are judged by Him undergo judgment by the Righteousness of God. For \"Christ,\" as the Apostle says, \"is the Righteousness of God[fn-17-P1713_986118:43-nf] ,\" which is revealed by the Gospel; and whether you look at the world as a whole, or at the parts of the world which make up that complete whole, all these are works of the Father, in that they are works of His Power; and thus the word which says both that the Father made all things, and that none of these things that are came into being without the Son, speaks truly on both points; for the operation of the Power bears relation to Him Whose Power It is. Thus, since the Son is the Power of the Father, all the works of the Son are works of the Father. That He entered upon the dispensation of the Passion not by weakness of nature but by the power of His will, one might bring countless passages of the Gospel to show; but these, as the matter is clear, I will pretermit, that my discourse may not be prolonged by dwelling on points that are admitted. If, then, that which comes to pass is evil, we have to separate from that evil not the Father only, but the Son also; but if the saving of them that were lost is good, and if that which took place is not \"passion[fn-17-P1714_987204:44-nf] ,\" but love of men, why do you alienate from our thanksgiving for our salvation the Father, Who by His own Power, which is Christ, wrought for men their freedom from death?","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_16_hymn_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"Caleb the spy bore the cluster on the staff, and came and longed to see the Cluster, Whose wine should comfort the world.

For he had already spoken of the new heavens and the new earth, speaking repeatedly, and under many figures, of the things promised to the saints, and saying,\"There shall be new heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind; but they shall find in it gladness and exultation. Behold, I will make Jerusalem an exultation, and my people a joy. And I will exult in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her;\"[fn-39-P3957_2176778:105-nf] and other promises, which some endeavor to refer to carnal enjoyment during the thousand years. For, in the manner of prophecy, figurative and literal expressions are mingled, so that a serious mind may, by useful and salutary effort, reach the spiritual sense; but carnal sluggishness, or the slowness of an uneducated and undisciplined mind, rests in the superficial letter, and thinks there is nothing beneath to be looked for. But let this be enough regarding the style of those prophetic expressions just quoted. And now, to return to their interpretation. When he had said, \"And your bones shall rise up like a herb,\" in order to show that it was the resurrection of the good, though a bodily resurrection, to which he alluded, he added, \"And the hand of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers.\" What is this but the hand of Him who distinguishes those who worship from those who despise Him? Regarding these the context immediately adds, \"And He shall threaten the contumacious,\" or, as another translator has it, \"the unbelieving.\" He shall not actually threaten then, but the threats which are now uttered shall then be fulfilled in effect. \"For behold,\" he says, \"the Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword: many shall be wounded by the Lord.\" By fire, whirlwind, sword, he means the judicial punishment of God. For he says that the Lord Himself shall come as a fire, to those, that is to say, to whom His coming shall be penal. By His chariots (for the word is plural)we suitably understand the ministration of angels. And when he says that all flesh and all the earth shall be judged with His fire and sword, we do not understand the spiritual and holy to be included, but the earthly and carnal, of whom it is said that they \"mind earthly things,\"[fn-39-P3958_2178747:106-nf] and \"to be carnally minded is death,\"[fn-39-P3959_2178807:107-nf] and whom the Lord calls simply flesh when He says, \"My Spirit shall not always remain in these men, for they are flesh.\"[fn-39-P3960_2178949:108-nf] As to the words, \"Many shall be wounded by the Lord,\" this wounding shall produce the second death. It is possible, indeed, to understand fire, sword, and wound in a good sense. For the Lord said that He wished to send fire on the earth.[fn-39-P3961_2179206:109-nf] And the cloven tongues appeared to them as fire when the Holy Spirit came.[fn-39-P3962_2179302:110-nf] And our Lord says, \"I am not come to send peace on earth, but a sword.\"[fn-39-P3963_2179393:111-nf] And Scripture says that the word of God is a doubly sharp sword,[fn-39-P3964_2179478:112-nf] on account of the two edges, the two Testaments. And in the Song of Songs the holy Church says that she is wounded with love,[fn-39-P3965_2179624:113-nf] -pierced, as it were, with the arrow of love. But here, where we read or hear that the Lord shall come to execute vengeance, it is obvious in what sense we are to understand these expressions.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_22_demonstrations_by_syllogisms","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"5.

This we have done on account of our modern heretics, who cavil whenever concupiscence is censured, as if it involved a censure of marriage. Their object is to praise concupiscence as a natural good, that so they may defend their own baneful dogma, which asserts that those who are born by its means do not contract original sin. Now the blessed Ambrose, bishop of Milan, by whose priestly office I received the washing of regeneration, briefly spoke on this matter, when, expounding the prophet Isaiah, he gathered from him the nativity of Christ in the flesh: \"Thus,\" says the bishop, \"He was both tempted in all points as a man,[fn-40-P4074_1537453:131-nf] and in the likeness of man He bare all things; but inasmuch as He was born of the Spirit, He kept Himself from sin. For every man is a liar; and there is none without sin but God alone. It has, therefore, been ever firmly maintained, that it is clear that no man from husbandand wife, that is to say, by means of that conjunction of their persons, is free from sin. He who is free from sin is also free from conception of this kind.\" Well now, what is it which St. Ambrose has here condemned in the true doctrine of this deliverance?-is it the goodness of marriage, or not rather the worthless opinion of these heretics, although they had not then come upon the stage? I have thought it worth while to adduce this testimony, because Pelagius mentions Ambrose with such commendation as to say: \"The blessed Bishop Ambrose, in whose writings more than anywhere else the Roman faith is clearly stated, has flourished like a beautiful flower among the Latin writers.

Those of the tribes offer to God, through the levites and priests, tithes and first fruits; not everything which they possess do they regard as tithe or first fruit. The levites and priests, on the other hand, have no possessions but tithes and first fruits; yet they also in turn offer tithes to God through the high-priests, and, I believe, first fruits too. The same is the case with those who approach Christian studies. Most of us devote most of our time to the things of this life, and dedicate to God only a few special acts, thus resembling those members of the tribes who had but few transactions with the priest, and discharged their religious duties with no great expense of time. But those who devote themselves to the divine word and have no other employment but the service of God may not unnaturally, allowing for the difference of occupation in the two cases, be called our levites and priests. And those who fulfil a more distinguished office than their kinsmen[fn-61-P6107_930964:6-nf] will perhaps be high-priests, according to the order of Aaron, not that of Melchisedek. Here some one may object that it is somewhat too bold to apply the name of high-priests to men, when Jesus Himself is spoken of in many a prophetic passage as the one great priest, as[fn-61-P6108_931311:7-nf] \"We have a great high-priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God.\" But to this we reply that the Apostle clearly defined his meaning, and declared the prophet to have said about the Christ, \"Thou[fn-61-P6109_931545:8-nf] art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedek,\" and not according to the order of Aaron.

I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but tropically. But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term \"Word.\" I wonder at the stupidity of the general run of Christians in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity. The Son of God says in one passage, \"I am the light of the world,\" and in another, \"I am the resurrection,\" and again, \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" It is also written, \"I am the door,\" and we have the saying, \"I am the good shepherd,\" and when the woman of Samaria says, \"We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,\" Jesus answers, \"I that speak unto thee am He.\" Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared Himself in these words[fn-62-P6254_982473:92-nf] to be their Master and Lord: \"You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.\" He also distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says,[fn-62-P6255_982654:93-nf] \"He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? \"and[fn-62-P6256_982806:94-nf] \"Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.\" We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate's question,[fn-62-P6257_982993:95-nf] \"Art Thou the King of the Jews? \"by saying, \"My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence.\" We have also read the words,[fn-62-P6258_983272:96-nf] \"I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman,\" and again, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" Add to these testimonies also the saying,[fn-62-P6259_983437:97-nf] \"I am the bread of life, that came down from heaven and giveth life to the world.\" These texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son of God. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says,[fn-62-P6260_983747:98-nf] \"I am the first and the last, and the living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.\" And again,[fn-62-P6261_983876:99-nf] \"I am the A and the W, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" The careful student of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as where He calls Himself[fn-62-P6262_984111:100-nf] a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,[fn-62-P6263_984170:101-nf] and a light of the Gentiles.[fn-62-P6264_984225:102-nf] Isaiah also says,[fn-62-P6265_984264:103-nf] \"From my mother's womb hath He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.\" And a little farther on: \"And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of Israel. Behold I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" And in Jeremiah too[fn-62-P6266_984857:104-nf] He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: \"I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.\" These and other similar sayings He applies to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets proclaim in advance His coining advent and announce the things concerning Him under various names. Thus John calls Him the Lamb of God, saying,[fn-62-P6267_985471:105-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world,\" and in these words he declares Him as a man,[fn-62-P6268_985601:106-nf] \"This is He about whom I said, that there cometh after me a man who is there before me; for He was before me.\" And in his Catholic Epistle John says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus:[fn-62-P6269_985836:107-nf] \"And if any one sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,\" and he adds that He is a propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a propitiation:[fn-62-P6270_986050:108-nf] \"Whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast sins, in the forbearance of God.\" According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:[fn-62-P6271_986344:109-nf] \"Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: \"He was made to us of God,\" he says, \"wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\" But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest:[fn-62-P6272_986654:110-nf] \"Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.\" And the prophets have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons[fn-62-P6273_986898:111-nf] says, \"Judah, thy brethren shall extol thee; thy hands are on the necks of thine enemies. A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art thou sprung up; thou hast lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him? \"We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. What may be quoted against this view, viz., \"A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved; \"this can better be cleared up on another occasion . But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel, when he says,[fn-62-P6274_987528:112-nf] \"Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted Him. He shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break. and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope.\" That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says:[fn-62-P6275_988040:113-nf] \"That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry,\" etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God:[fn-62-P6276_988248:114-nf] \"I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd.\" For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower:[fn-62-P6277_988483:115-nf] \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of tits root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel slid of might, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as follows:[fn-62-P6278_988887:116-nf] \"The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the comer. It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.\" And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows:[fn-62-P6279_989155:117-nf] \"Have ye never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.\" And Luke writes in Acts:[fn-62-P6280_989407:118-nf] \"This is the stone, which was set at naught of you the builders, which has become the head of the corner.\" And one of the names applied to the Saviour is that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records;-the Word who was in the beginning with God, God the Word. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and ask, What is the Son of God when called the Word? The passage they employ most is that in the Psalms,[fn-62-P6281_990132:119-nf] \"My heart hath produced a good Word; \"and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are they clear about His essence. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said to be \"Word\" can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an essence of His own. We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it suggests slid apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course. To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have to say on the question, how the Son of God is the Word, we must begin with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him. This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression, but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these matters will clear the way for what is coming. And once we have entered upon the theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what diligence we can and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall necessarily understand more about Him not only in His character as the Word, but in His other characters also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"116","folder":"ANF-10","text":"The texts of the New Testament, which we have discussed, are things said by Himself about Himself.

And when it is said \"above thy fellows,\" it is meant that the grace of the Spirit was not given to it as to the prophets, but that the essential fulness of the Word of God Himself was in it, according to the saying of the apostle, \"In whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.\"[fn-65-P6594_1322181:88-nf] Finally, on this account he has not only said, \"Thou hast loved righteousness; \"but he adds, \"and Thou hast hated wickedness.\" For to have hated wickedness is what the Scripture says of Him, that \"He did no sin, neither was any guile found in His mouth,\"[fn-65-P6595_1322453:89-nf] and that \"He was tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.\"[fn-65-P6596_1322541:90-nf] Nay, the Lord Himself also said, \"Which of you will convince Me of sin? \"[fn-65-P6597_1322633:91-nf] And again He says with reference to Himself, \"Behold, the prince of this world cometh, and findeth nothing in Me.\"[fn-65-P6598_1322768:92-nf] All which (passages) show that in Him there was no sense of sin; and that the prophet might show more clearly that no sense of sin had ever entered into Him, he says, \"Before the boy could have knowledge to call upon father or mother, He turned away from wickedness.\"[fn-65-P6599_1323055:93-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_48_dialogue_of_justin","source_chapter":63,"source_paragraph":"409","folder":"ANF-01","text":"\"I shall give you another testimony, my friends,\" said I, \"from the Scriptures, that God begat before all creatures a Beginning,[fn-45-P4584_965230:220-nf] [who was] a certain rational power [proceeding] from Himself, who is called by the Holy Spirit, now the Glory of the Lord, now the Son, again Wisdom, again an Angel, then God, and then Lord and Logos; and on another occasion He calls Himself Captain, when He appeared in human form to Joshua the son of Nave (Nun).

Wherefore also Cleanthes, in the second book, On Pleasure, says that Socrates everywhere teaches that the just man and the happy are one and the same, and execrated the first man who separated the just from the useful, as having done an impious thing. For those are in truth impious who separate the useful from that which is tight according to the law. Plato himself says that happiness (eu0daimoni/a) is to possess rightly the daemon, and that the ruling faculty of the soul is called the daemon; and he terms happiness (eu0daimoni/a) the most perfect and complete good. Sometimes he calls it a consistent and harmonious life, sometimes the highest perfection in accordance with virtue; and this he places in the knowledge of the Good, and in likeness to God, demonstrating likeness to be justice and holiness with wisdom. For is it not thus that some of our writers have understood that man straightway on his creation received what is\"according to the image,\" but that what is according\"to the likeness\" he will receive afterwards on his perfection? Now Plato, teaching that the virtuous man shall have this likeness accompanied with humility, explains the following: \"He that humbleth himself shall be exalted.\"[fn-60-P6077_1854965:259-nf] He says, accordingly, in The Laws: \"God indeed, as the ancient saying has it, occupying the beginning, the middle, and the end of all things, goes straight through while He goes round the circumference. And He is always attended by Justice, the avenger of those who revolt from the divine law.\" You see how he connects fear with the divine law. He adds, therefore: \"To which he, who would be happy, cleaving, will follow lowly and beautified.\" Then, connecting what follows these words, and admonishing by fear, he adds: \"What conduct, then, is dear and conformable to God? That which is characterized by one word of old date: Like will be dear to like, as to what is in proportion; but things out of proportion are neither dear to one another, nor to those which are in proportion. And that therefore he that would be dear to God, must, to the best of his power, become such as He is. And in virtue of the same reason, our self-controlling man is dear to God. But he that has no self-control is unlike and diverse.\" In saying that it was an ancient dogma, he indicates the teaching which had come to him from the law. And having in the Theataetus admitted that evils make the circuit of mortal nature and of this spot, he adds: \"Wherefore we must try to flee hence as soon as possible. For flight is likeness to God as far as possible. And likeness is to become holy and just with wisdom.\" Speusippus, the nephew of Plato, says that happiness is a perfect state in those who conduct themselves in accordance with nature, or the state of the good: for which condition all men have a desire, but the good only attained to quietude; consequently the virtues are the authors of happiness. And Xenocrates the Chalcedonian defines happiness to be the possession of virtue, strictly so called, and of the power subservient to it. Then he clearly says, that the seat in which it resides is the soul; that by which it is effected, the virtues; and that of these as parts are formed praiseworthy actions, good habits and dispositions, and motions, and relations; and that corporeal and external objects are not without these. For Polemo, the disciple of Xenocrates, seems of the opinion that happiness is sufficiency of all good things, or of the most and greatest. He lays down the doctrine, then, that happiness never exists without virtue; and that virtue, apart from corporeal and external objects, is sufficient for happiness. Let these things be so. The contradictions to the opinions specified shall be adduced in due time. But on us it is incumbent to reach the unaccomplished end, obeying the commands-that is, God-and living according to them, irreproachably and intelligently, through knowledge of the divine will; and assimilation as far as possible in accordance with right reason is the end, and restoration to perfect adoption by the Son, which ever glorifies the Father by the great High Priest who has deigned to call us brethren and fellow-heirs. And the apostle, succinctly describing the end, writes in the Epistle to the Romans: \"But now, being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.\"[fn-60-P6078_1858156:260-nf] And viewing the hope as twofold-that which is expected, and that which has been received-he now teaches the end to be the restitution of the hope.\"For patience,\" he says, \"worketh experience, and experience hope: and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit that is given to us.\"[fn-60-P6079_1858512:261-nf] On account of which love and the restoration to hope, he says, in another place, \"which rest is laid up for us.\"[fn-60-P6080_1858646:262-nf] You will find in Ezekiel the like, as follows: \"The soul that sinneth, it shall die. And the man who shall be righteous, and shall do judgment and justice, who has not eaten on the mountains, nor lifted his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, and hath not approached to a woman in the time of her uncleanness (for he does not wish the seed of man to be dishonoured), and will not injure a man; will restore the debtor's pledge, and will not take usury; will turn away his hand from wrong; will do true judgment between a man and his neighbour; will walk in my ordinances, and keep my commandments, so as to do the truth; he is righteous, he shall surely live, saith Adonai the Lord.\"[fn-60-P6081_1859410:263-nf] Isaiah too, in exhorting him that hath not believed to gravity of life, and the Gnostic to attention, proving that man's virtue and God's are not the same, speaks thus: \"Seek the Lord, and on finding Him call on Him. And when He shall draw near to you, let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his ways; and let him return to the Lord, and he shall obtain mercy,\" down to \"and your thoughts from my thoughts.\"[fn-60-P6082_1859862:264-nf] \"We,\" then, according to the noble apostle, \"wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. For in Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.\"[fn-60-P6083_1860086:265-nf] And we desire that every one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope,\" down to \"made an high priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek.\"[fn-60-P6084_1860276:266-nf] Similarly with Paul \"the All-virtuous Wisdom\" says, \"He, that heareth me shall dwell trusting in hope.\"[fn-60-P6085_1860403:267-nf] For the restoration of hope is called by the same term \"hope.\" To the expression \"will dwell\" it has most beautifully added\" trusting,\" showing that such an one has obtained rest, having received the hope for which he hoped. Wherefore also it is added, \"and shall be quiet, without fear of any evil.\" And openly and expressly the apostle, in the first Epistle to the Corinthians says, \"Be ye followers of me, as also I am of Christ,\"[fn-60-P6086_1860857:268-nf] in order that that may take place. If ye are of me, and I am of Christ, then ye are imitators of Christ, and Christ of God.

For this reason a Lamb was chosen for its innocence, and its clothing of the original nakedness. For such is the Victim, That was offered for us, Who is both in Name and fact the Garment of incorruption. And He was a perfect Victim not only on account of His Godhead, than which nothing is more perfect; but also on account of that which He assumed having been anointed with Deity, and having become one with That which anointed It, and I am bold to say, made equal with God. A Male, because offered for Adam; or rather the Stronger for the strong, when the first Man had fallen under sin; and chiefly because there is in Him nothing feminine, nothing unmanly; but He burst from the bonds of thee Virgin-Mother's womb with much power, and a Male was brought forth by the Prophetess,[fn-59-P5905_2038352:17-nf] as Isaiah declares the good tidings. And of a year old, because He is the Sun of Righteousness[fn-59-P5906_2038466:18-nf] setting out from heaven, and circumscribed by His visible Nature, and returning unto Himself.[fn-59-P5907_2038577:19-nf] And \"The blessed crown of Goodness,\"-being on every side equal to Himself and alike; and not only this, but also as giving life to all the circle of the virtues, gently commingled and intermixed with each other, according to the Law of Love and Order.[fn-59-P5908_2039116:20-nf] And Immaculate and guileless, as being the Healer of faults, and of the defects and taints that come from sin. For though He both took on Him our sins and bare our diseases,[fn-59-P5909_2040574:21-nf] yet He did not Himself suffer aught that needed healing.

And what is the character of the arms of this centurion, and for what use in battle they are, hear the blessed Apostle declaring: \"The arms,\" he says \"of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God.\" He tells us their character; viz., that they are not carnal or weak, but spiritual and mighty to God. Then he next suggests in what struggles they are to be used: \"Unto the pulling down of fortifications, purging the thoughts, and every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ, and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be first fulfilled.\"[fn-44-P4426_1628570:12-nf] And since though useful, it yet belongs to another time to run through these one by one, I only want you to see the different sorts of these arms and their characteristics, as we also ought always to walk with them girt upon us if we mean to fight the Lord's battles and to serveamong the centurions of the gospel. \"Take,\" he says \"the shield of faith, wherewith ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the evil one.\"[fn-44-P4427_1629016:13-nf] Faith then is that which intercepts the flaming darts of lust, and destroys them by the fear of future judgment, and belief in the heavenly kingdom. \"And the breastplate,\" he says, \"of charity.\"[fn-44-P4428_1629229:14-nf] This indeed is that which going round the vital parts of the breast and protecting what is exposed to the deadly wounds of swelling thoughts, keeps off the blows opposed to it, and does not allow the darts of the devil to penetrate to our inner man. For it \"endureth all things, suffereth all things, beareth all things.\"[fn-44-P4429_1629571:15-nf] \"And for an helmet the hope of salvation.\"[fn-44-P4430_1629635:16-nf] The helmet is what protects the head. As then Christ is our head, we ought always in all temptations and persecutions to protect it with the hope of future good things to come, and especially to keep faith in Him whole and undefiled. For it is possible for one who has lost other parts of the body, weak as he may be, still to survive: but even a short time of living is extended to no one without a head. \"And the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.\"[fn-44-P4431_1630117:17-nf] For it is \"sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart:\"[fn-44-P4432_1630326:18-nf] as it divides and cuts off whatever carnal and earthly things it may find in us. And whosoever is protected by these arms will ever be defended from the weapons and ravages of his foes, and will not be led away bound in the chains of his spoilers, a captive and a prisoner, to the hostile land of vain thoughts, nor hear the words of the prophet: \"Why art thou grown old in a strange country?\"[fn-44-P4433_1630738:19-nf] But he will stand like a triumphant conqueror in the land of thoughts which he has chosen. Would you understand too the strength and courage of this centurion, by which he bears these arms of which we spoke before as not carnal but mighty to God?

The first stage of liberty is to be free from crimes. Give heed, my brethren, give heed, that I may not by any means mislead your understanding as to the nature of that liberty at present, and what it will be. Sift any one soever of the highest integrity in this life, and however worthy he may already be of the name of upright, yet is he not without sin. Listen to Saint John himself, the author of the Gospel before us, when he says in his epistle, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-17-P1754_1112093:22-nf] He alone could say this who was \"free among the dead:\" of Him only could it be said, who knew no sin. It could be said only of Him, for He also \"was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\"[fn-17-P1755_1112316:23-nf] He alone could say, \"Behold, the prince of this world cometh, and shall find nothing in me.\" Sift any one else, who is accounted righteous, yet is he not in all respects without sin; not even such as was Job, to whom the Lord bore such testimony, that the devil was filled with envy, and demanded that he should be tempted, and was himself defeated in the temptation, to the end that Job might be proved.[fn-17-P1756_1112739:24-nf] And he was proved for this reason, not that the certainty of his carrying off the conqueror's wreath was unknown to God, but that he might become known as an object of imitation to others. And what says Job himself? \"For who is clean? not even the infant whose life is but a day's span upon the earth.\"[fn-17-P1757_1113057:25-nf] But it is plain that many are called righteous without opposition, because the term is understood as meaning, free from crime; for in human affairs there is no just ground of complaint attaching to those who are free from criminal conduct. But crime is grievous sin, deserving in the highest measure to be denounced and condemned. Not, however, that God condemns certain sins, and justifies and praises certain others. He approves of none. He hates them all. As the physician dislikes the ailment of the ailing, and works by his healing measures to get the ailment removed and the ailing relieved; so God by his grace worketh in us, that sin may be consumed, and man made free. But when, you will be saying, is it consumed? If it is lessened, why is it not consumed? That is growing less in the life of those who are advancing onwards, which is consumed in the life of those who have attained to perfection.","title":"Tractate XLI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_80_letter_xi_for_339_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"This is the fruit of wickedness, these rewards are given to its familiars, for perverseness does not deliver its own.

And, `exercise thyself unto godliness, for it hath the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come[fn-93-P9374_3396454:68-nf] .' For this cause, the Ario-maniacs, who now have gone out from the Church, being opponents of Christ, have digged a pit of unbelief, into which they themselves have been thrust; and, since they have advanced in ungodliness, they `overthrow the faith of the simple[fn-93-P9375_3396752:69-nf] ;' blaspheming the Son of God, and saying that He is a creature, and has His being from things which are not. But as then against the adherents of Philetus and Hymenaeus, so now the Apostle forewarns all men against ungodliness like theirs, saying, `The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His; and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from iniquity[fn-93-P9376_3397185:70-nf] .' For it is well that a man should depart from wickedness and deeds of iniquity, that he may be able properly to celebrate the feast; for he who is defiled with the pollutions of the wicked is not able to sacrifice the Passover to the Lord our God. Hence, the people who were then in Egypt said, `We cannot sacrifice the Passover in Egypt to the Lord our God[fn-93-P9377_3397565:71-nf] .' For God, Who is over all, willed that they should go far away from the servants of Pharaoh, and from the furnace of iron; so that being set free from wickedness, and having carefully put away from them all strange notions, they might receive the knowledge of God and of virtuous actions. For He saith, `Go far from them: depart from the midst of them, and touch not the unclean things[fn-93-P9378_3397974:72-nf] .'

But I shall also offer, to the best of my ability, some expositions of the other words referred to; that is to say, I shall show that Jesus neither said nor did aught that was contrary to Moses. And first, as to the word, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\"[fn-37-P3743_1051433:461-nf] -that is the expression of justice. And as to His injunction, that a man, when struck on the one cheek, should offer the other also, that is the expression of goodness. Well, then, are justice and goodness opposed to each other? Far from it! There has only been an advance from simple justice to positive goodness. And again, we have the saying, \"The workman is worthy of his hire.\"[fn-37-P3744_1051836:462-nf] But if a person seeks to practise any fraud therein, it is surely most just[fn-37-P3745_1051932:463-nf] that what he has got possession of by fraud should be required of him, most especially when the hire is large. Now this I say, that when the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel by the taskmasters who were set over them in the process of making bricks, Moses required and exacted the whole at once, with penalties, within one moment of time. But is this, then, to be called iniquity? Far from it! Surely it is the abstinence [fn-37-P3746_1052606:464-nf] of goodness, indeed, when one makes but a moderate use of what is really necessary, and gives up all that goes beyond that. Let us look, again, at the fact that in the Old Testament we find the words, \"I make the rich man and the poor man,\"[fn-37-P3747_1052946:465-nf] whereas Jesus calls the poor blessed.[fn-37-P3748_1053006:466-nf] Well, in that saying Jesus did; not refer to those who are poor simply in worldly substance, but to those who are poor in spirit, that is to say, who are not inflamed[fn-37-P3749_1053192:467-nf] with pride, but have the gentle and lowly dispositions of humility, not thinking of themselves more than they ought to think.[fn-37-P3750_1053388:468-nf] This question, however, is one which our adversary has not propounded correctly. For here I perceive that Jesus also looks on willingly at the gifts of the rich men, when they are put into the treasury.[fn-37-P3751_1053611:469-nf] All too little, at the same time, is it[fn-37-P3752_1053672:470-nf] if gifts are cast into[fn-37-P3753_1053895:471-nf] the treasury by the rich alone; and so there are the two mites of the poor widow which are also received with gladness; and in that offering verily something is exhibited that goes beyond what Moses prescribed on the subject of the receipt of moneys. For he received gifts from those who had; but Jesus receives them even from those who have not. But this man says, further, that it is written, that \"except a man shall forsake all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.\"[fn-37-P3754_1054456:472-nf] Wall, I observe again, that the centurion, a man exceedingly wealthy and well dowered with worldly influence, possessed a faith surpassing that of all Israel;[fn-37-P3755_1054636:473-nf] so that, even if there was any one who had forsaken all, that man was surpassed in faith by this centurion. But some one may now reason with us thus: It is not a good thing, consequently, to give up riches. Well, I reply that it is a good thing for those who are capable of it; but, at the, same time, to employ[fn-37-P3756_1054971:474-nf] riches for the work of righteousness and mercy, is a thing as acceptable as though one were to give up the whole at once. Again, as to the assertion that the Sabbath has been abolished, we deny that He has abolished it plainly;[fn-37-P3757_1055410:475-nf] for He was Himself also Lord of the Sabbath.[fn-37-P3758_1055469:476-nf] And this, the law's relation to the Sabbath, was like the servant who has charge of the bridegroom's chamber, and who prepares the same with all carefulness, and does not suffer it to be disturbed or touched by any stranger, but keeps it intact against the time of the bridegroom's arrival; so that when he is come, the same may be used as it pleases himself, or as it is granted to those to use it whom he has bidden enter along with him. And the Lord Jesus Christ Himself gave His testimony to what we affirm, when He said with His heavenly voice, \"Can ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast so long as the bridegroom is with them? \"[fn-37-P3759_1056134:477-nf] And again, He did not actually reject circumcision; but we should rather say that He received in Himself and in our stead the cause of circumcision,[fn-37-P3760_1056364:478-nf] relieving us by what He Himself endured, and not permitting us to have to suffer any pain to no purpose.[fn-37-P3761_1056521:479-nf] For what, indeed, can it profit a man to circumcise himself, if nevertheless he cherishes the worst of thoughts against his neighbour? He desired, accordingly, rather to open up to us the ways of the fullest life by a brief path,[fn-37-P3762_1056873:480-nf] lest perchance, after we had traversed lengthened courses of our own, we should find our day prematurely closing upon us in night, and lest, while outwardly indeed we might appear splendid to men's view, we should inwardly he comparable only to ravening wolves,[fn-37-P3763_1057292:481-nf] or be likened to whited sepulchres.[fn-37-P3764_1057350:482-nf] For far above any person of that type of character is to be placed the man who, although clad only in squalid and threadbare attire, keeps no evil hidden in his heart against his neighbour. For it is only the circumcision of the heart that brings salvation; and that merely carnal circumcision can be of no advantage to men, unless they happen also to he fortified with the spiritual circumcision. Listen also to what Scripture has to say on this subject: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God? \"[fn-37-P3765_1057888:483-nf] What need, therefore, is there for me to labour and suffer, seeing that I have been made acquainted with the compendious way of life,[fn-37-P3766_1058041:484-nf] and know that it shall he mine if only I can be pure in heart? And that is quite in accordance with the truth which we have learned now, to wit, that if one prevails in the keeping of the two commandments, he fulfils the whole law and the prophets.[fn-37-P3767_1058313:485-nf] Moreover Paul, the chief of the apostles, after all these sayings, gives us yet clearer instruction on the subject, when be says, \"Or seek yea proof of that Christ who speaketh in me? \"[fn-37-P3768_1058522:486-nf] What have I then to do with circumcision, seeing that I may be justified in uncircumcision? For it is written: \"Is any man circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Or is any in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. For neither of these is anything, but only the keeping of the commandments of God.\"[fn-37-P3769_1058856:487-nf] Consequently, as circumcision is incompetent to save any, it is not greatly to be required, especially when we see that if a man has been called in uncircumcision, and wishes then to be circumcised, he is made forthwith a transgressor[fn-37-P3770_1059118:488-nf] of the law. For if I am circumcised, I also fulfil the commandments of the law with the view of being in a position to be saved; but if I am uncircumcised, and remain in uncircumcision, much more in keeping the commandments shall I have life. For I have received the circumcision of the heart, in the spirit, and not that of the letter in the mere ink,[fn-37-P3771_1059591:489-nf] in which former there is praise, not of men, but of God.[fn-37-P3772_1059667:490-nf] Wherefore let no charge of this kind be brought against me. For just as the man of wealth, who possesses great treasures of gold and silver, so that he gets everything which is necessary for the uses of his house made of these precious metals, has no need to display any vessel of earthen-ware in anything belonging to his family and yet it does follow from this circumstance that the productions of the potter, or the art of making vessels of pottery,[fn-37-P3773_1060140:491-nf] are to be held in abhor-fence by him; so also I, who have been made rich by the grace of God, and who have obtained the circumcision of the heart, cannot by any means[fn-37-P3774_1060481:492-nf] stand in need of that most profitless fleshly circumcision, and yet, for all that, it does not follow that I should call it evil. Far be it from me to do so! If, however, any one desires to receive still more exact instruction on these matters, he will find them discussed with the greatest fulness in the apostle's first epistle.[fn-37-P3775_1060860:493-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":4,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_278_letter_cclx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"9.
