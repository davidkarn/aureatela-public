{"verses":["Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we\nhave heard lest perhaps we should let them slip.","For if the word spoken by angels became steadfast and every\ntransgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward:","How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?  Which,\nhaving begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them\nthat heard him.","God also bearing them witness by signs and wonders and divers\nmiracles and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own\nwill.","For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come, whereof\nwe speak.","But one in a certain place hath testified, saying:  What is man,\nthat thou art mindful of him?  Or the son of man, that thou visitest\nhim?","Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels:  thou hast\ncrowned him with glory and honour and hast set him over the works of\nthy hands.","Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.  For in that he hath\nsubjected all things to him he left nothing not subject to him.  But now\nwe see not as yet all things subject to him.","But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for\nthe suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour:  that, through\nthe grace of God he might taste death for all.","For it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all\nthings, who had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author\nof their salvation, by his passion.","For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all\nof one.  For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,\nsaying:","I will declare thy name to my brethren:  in the midst of the\nchurch will I praise thee.","And again:  I will put my trust in him.  And again:  Behold I and\nmy children, whom God hath given me.","Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood,\nhe also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same:  that,\nthrough death, he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that\nis to say, the devil:","And might deliver them, who through the fear of death were all\ntheir lifetime subject to servitude.","For nowhere doth he take hold of the angels:  but of the seed of\nAbraham he taketh hold.","Wherefore, it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his\nbrethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest\nbefore God, that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people.","For in that wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted he\nis able to succour them also that are tempted."]}
