{"verses":["For this Melchisedech was king of Salem, priest of the most high\nGod, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and\nblessed him:","To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all:  who first indeed\nby interpretation is king of justice:  and then also king of Salem, that\nis, king of peace:","Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither\nbeginning of days nor end of life, but likened unto the Son of God,\ncontinueth a priest for ever.","Now consider how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the\npatriarch gave tithes out of the principal things.","And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the\npriesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according\nto the law, that is to say, of their brethren:  though they themselves\nalso came out of the loins of Abraham.","But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received tithes\nof Abraham and blessed him that had the promises.","And without all contradiction, that which is less is blessed by\nthe better.","And here indeed, men that die receive tithes:  but there, he hath\nwitness that he liveth.","And (as it may be said) even Levi who received tithes paid tithes\nin Abraham:","For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedech met\nhim.","If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood (for under it\nthe people received the law), what further need was there that another\npriest should rise according to the order of Melchisedech:  and not be\ncalled according to the order of Aaron?","For the priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a\ntranslation also be made of the law,","For he of whom these things are spoken is of another tribe, of\nwhich no one attended on the altar.","For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda:  in which\ntribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.","And it is yet far more evident:  if according to the similitude of\nMelchisedech there ariseth another priest,","Who is made, not according to the law of a law of a carnal\ncommandment, but according to the power of an indissoluble life.","For he testifieth:  Thou art a priest for ever according to the\norder of Melchisedech.","There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment,\nbecause of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof:","For the law brought nothing to perfection:  but a bringing in of a\nbetter hope, by which we draw nigh to God.","And inasmuch as it is not without an oath (for the others indeed\nwere made priests without an oath:","But this with an oath, by him that said unto him:  The Lord hath\nsworn and he will not repent:  Thou art a priest for ever).","By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament.","And the others indeed were made many priests, because by reason\nof death they were not suffered to continue:","But this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting\npriesthood:","Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by\nhim; always living to make intercession for us.","For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy,\ninnocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the\nheavens:","Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices,\nfirst for his own sins, and then for the people's:  for this he did\nonce, in offering himself.","For the law maketh men priests, who have infirmity:  but the word\nof the oath (which was since the law) the Son who is perfected for\nevermore."]}
