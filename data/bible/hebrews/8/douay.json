{"verses":["Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum:  We have\nsuch an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of\nmajesty in the heavens,","A minister of the holies and of the true tabernacle, which the\nLord hath pitched, and not man.","For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices:\nwherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.","If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest:  seeing that\nthere would be others to offer gifts according to the law.","Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things.  As it\nwas answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle:  See (saith\nhe) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn\nthee on the mount.","But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is\na mediator of a better testament which is established on better\npromises.","For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a\nplace have been sought for a second.","For, finding fault with them, he saith:  Behold the days shall\ncome, saith the Lord:  and I will perfect, unto the house of Israel and\nunto the house of Juda, a new testament:","Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on\nthe day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of\nEgypt:  because they continued not in my testament:  and I regarded them\nnot, saith the Lord.","For this is the testament which I will make to the house of\nIsrael after those days, saith the Lord:  I will give my laws into their\nmind:  and in their heart will I write them.  And I will be their God:\nand they shall be my people.","And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man\nhis brother, saying:  Know the Lord.  For all shall know me, from the\nleast to the greatest of them.","Because I will be merciful to their iniquities:  and their sins I\nwill remember no more.","Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old.  And that which\ndecayeth and groweth old is near its end."]}
