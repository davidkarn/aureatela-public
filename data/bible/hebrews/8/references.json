The Jews make use of the Old, we of the New: but yet they are not discordant, for the New is the fulfilling of the Old, and in both there is the same testator, even Christ, who, having suffered death for us, made us heirs of His everlasting kingdom, the people of the Jews being deprived and disinherited.[fn-15-P1538_626046:294-nf] As the prophet Jeremiah testifies when he speaks such things:[fn-15-P1539_626393:295-nf] \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new testament[fn-15-P1540_626492:296-nf] to the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they continued not in my testament, and I disregarded[fn-15-P1541_626869:297-nf] them, saith the Lord.\"Also in another place he says in like manner:[fn-15-P1542_626967:298-nf] \"I have forsaken my house, I have given up mine heritage into the hand of its enemies.

For he had \"accepted\"[fn-20-P2072_705290:38-nf] circumcision; but such as was to be for \"a sign\" of that time, not for a prerogative title to salvation. In fact, subsequent patriarchs were uncircumcised, like Melchizedek, who, uncircumcised, offered to Abraham himself, already circumcised, on his return from battle, bread and wine.[fn-20-P2073_705681:39-nf] \"But again,\" (you say) \"the son of Moses would upon one occasion have been choked by an angel, if Zipporah,[fn-20-P2074_706106:40-nf] had not circumcised the foreskin of the infant with a pebble; whence, \"there is the greatest peril if any fail to circumcise the foreskin of his flesh.\" Nay, but if circumcision altogether brought salvation, even Moses himself, in the case of his own son, would not have omitted to circumcise him on the eighth day; whereas it is agreed that Zipporah did it on the journey, at the compulsion of the angel.

For God, foreseeing that He was about to give this circumcision to the people of Israel for \"a sign,\" not for salvation, urges the circumcision of the son of Moses, their future leader, for this reason; that, since He had begun, through him, to give the People the precept of circumcision, the people should not despise it, from seeing this example (of neglect) already exhibited conspicuously in their leader's son. For circumcision had to be given; but as \"a sign,\" whence Israel in the last time would have to be distinguished, when, in accordance with their deserts, they should be prohibited from entering the holy city, as we see through the words of the prophets, saying, \"Your land is desert; your cities utterly burnt with fire; your country, in your sight, strangers shall eat up; and, deserted and subverted by strange peoples, the daughter of Zion shall be derelict, like a shed in a vineyard, and like a watchhouse in a cucumber-field, and as it were a city which is being stormed.\"[fn-20-P2075_707833:41-nf] Why so? Because the subsequent discourse of the prophet reproaches them, saying, \"Sons have I begotten and upraised, but they have reprobated me; \"[fn-20-P2076_708021:42-nf] and again, \"And if ye shall have outstretched hands, I will avert my face from you; and if ye shall have multiplied prayers, I will not hear you: for your hands are full of blood; \"[fn-20-P2077_708290:43-nf] and again, \"Woe! sinful nation; a people full of sins; wicked sons; ye have quite forsaken God, and have provoked unto indignation the Holy One of Israel.\"[fn-20-P2078_708463:44-nf] This, therefore, was God's foresight,-that of giving circumcision to Israel, for a sign whence they might be distinguished when the time should arrive wherein their above-mentioned deserts should prohibit their admission into Jerusalem: which circumstance, because it was to be, used to be announced; and, because we see it accomplished, is recognised by us. For, as the carnal circumcision, which was temporary, was in wrought for \"a sign\" in a contumacious people, so the spiritual has been given for salvation to an obedient people; while the prophet Jeremiah says, \"Make a renewal for you, and sow not in thorns; be circumcised to God, and circumcise the foreskin of your heart: \"[fn-20-P2079_709164:45-nf] and in another place he says, \"Behold, days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will draw up, for the house of Judah and for the house of Jacob,[fn-20-P2080_709404:46-nf] a new testament; not such as I once gave their fathers in the day wherein I led them out from the land of Egypt.\"[fn-20-P2081_709572:47-nf] Whence we understand that the coming cessation of the former circumcision l then given, and the coming procession of a new law (not such as He had already given to the fathers), are announced: just as Isaiah foretold, saying that in the last days the mount of the Lord and the house of God were to be manifest above the tops of the mounts: \"And it shall be exalted,\" he says, \"above the hills; and there shall come over it all nations; and many shall walk, and say, Come, ascend we unto the mount of the Lord, and unto the house of the God of Jacob,\"[fn-20-P2082_710202:48-nf] -not of Esau, the former son, but of Jacob, the second; that is, of our \"people,\" whose \"mount\" is Christ, \"prµcised without concisors' hands,[fn-20-P2083_710365:49-nf] filling every land,\" shown in the book of Daniel.[fn-20-P2084_710460:50-nf] In short, the coming procession of a new law out of this \"house of the God of Jacob\" Isaiah in the ensuing words announces, saying, \"For from Zion shall go out a law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem, and shall judge among the nations,\"-that is, among us, who have been called out of the nations,-\"and they shall join to beat their glaives into ploughs, and their lances into sickles; and nations shall not take up glaive against nation, and they shall no more learn to fight.\"[fn-20-P2085_710997:51-nf] Who else, therefore, are understood but we, who, fully taught by the new law, observe these practices,-the old law being obliterated, the coming of whose abolition the action itself[fn-20-P2086_711198:52-nf] demonstrates? For the wont of the old law was to avenge itself by the vengeance of the glaive, and to pluck out \"eye for eye,\" and to inflict retaliatory revenge for injury.[fn-20-P2087_711420:53-nf] But the new law's wont was to point to clemency, and to convert to tranquillity the pristine ferocity of \"glaives\" and \"lances,\" and to remodel the pristine execution of \"war\" upon the rivals and foes of the law into the pacific actions of \"ploughing\" and \"tilling\" the land.[fn-20-P2088_711772:54-nf] Therefore as we have shown above that the coming cessation of the old law and of the carnal circumcision was declared, so, too, the observance of the new law and the spiritual circumcision has shone out into the voluntary obediences[fn-20-P2089_712090:55-nf] of peace. For \"a people,\" he says, \"whom I knew not hath served me; in obedience of the ear it hath obeyed me.\"[fn-20-P2090_712243:56-nf] Prophets made the announcement.

For, as the carnal circumcision, which was temporary, was in wrought for \"a sign\" in a contumacious people, so the spiritual has been given for salvation to an obedient people; while the prophet Jeremiah says, \"Make a renewal for you, and sow not in thorns; be circumcised to God, and circumcise the foreskin of your heart: \"[fn-20-P2079_709164:45-nf] and in another place he says, \"Behold, days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will draw up, for the house of Judah and for the house of Jacob,[fn-20-P2080_709404:46-nf] a new testament; not such as I once gave their fathers in the day wherein I led them out from the land of Egypt.\"[fn-20-P2081_709572:47-nf] Whence we understand that the coming cessation of the former circumcision l then given, and the coming procession of a new law (not such as He had already given to the fathers), are announced: just as Isaiah foretold, saying that in the last days the mount of the Lord and the house of God were to be manifest above the tops of the mounts: \"And it shall be exalted,\" he says, \"above the hills; and there shall come over it all nations; and many shall walk, and say, Come, ascend we unto the mount of the Lord, and unto the house of the God of Jacob,\"[fn-20-P2082_710202:48-nf] -not of Esau, the former son, but of Jacob, the second; that is, of our \"people,\" whose \"mount\" is Christ, \"prµcised without concisors' hands,[fn-20-P2083_710365:49-nf] filling every land,\" shown in the book of Daniel.[fn-20-P2084_710460:50-nf] In short, the coming procession of a new law out of this \"house of the God of Jacob\" Isaiah in the ensuing words announces, saying, \"For from Zion shall go out a law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem, and shall judge among the nations,\"-that is, among us, who have been called out of the nations,-\"and they shall join to beat their glaives into ploughs, and their lances into sickles; and nations shall not take up glaive against nation, and they shall no more learn to fight.\"[fn-20-P2085_710997:51-nf] Who else, therefore, are understood but we, who, fully taught by the new law, observe these practices,-the old law being obliterated, the coming of whose abolition the action itself[fn-20-P2086_711198:52-nf] demonstrates? For the wont of the old law was to avenge itself by the vengeance of the glaive, and to pluck out \"eye for eye,\" and to inflict retaliatory revenge for injury.[fn-20-P2087_711420:53-nf] But the new law's wont was to point to clemency, and to convert to tranquillity the pristine ferocity of \"glaives\" and \"lances,\" and to remodel the pristine execution of \"war\" upon the rivals and foes of the law into the pacific actions of \"ploughing\" and \"tilling\" the land.[fn-20-P2088_711772:54-nf] Therefore as we have shown above that the coming cessation of the old law and of the carnal circumcision was declared, so, too, the observance of the new law and the spiritual circumcision has shone out into the voluntary obediences[fn-20-P2089_712090:55-nf] of peace. For \"a people,\" he says, \"whom I knew not hath served me; in obedience of the ear it hath obeyed me.\"[fn-20-P2090_712243:56-nf] Prophets made the announcement. But what is the \"people\" which was ignorant of God, but ours, who in days bygone knew not God? and who, in the hearing of the ear, gave heed to Him, but we, who, forsaking idols, have been converted to God? For Israel-who had been known to God, and who had by Him been \"upraised\"[fn-20-P2091_712742:57-nf] in Egypt, and was transported through the Red Sea, and who in the desert, fed forty years with manna, was wrought to the semblance of eternity, and not contaminated with human passions,[fn-20-P2092_712978:58-nf] or fed on this world's[fn-20-P2093_713015:59-nf] meats, but fed on \"angel's loaves\"[fn-20-P2094_713186:60-nf] -the manna-and sufficiently bound to God by His benefits-forgot his Lord and God, saying to Aaron: \"Make us gods, to go before us: for that Moses, who ejected us from the land of Egypt, hath quite forsaken us; and what hath befallen him we know not.\" And accordingly we, who \"were not the people of God\" in days bygone, have been made His people,[fn-20-P2095_713595:61-nf] by accepting the new law above mentioned, and the new circumcision before foretold.","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"The mighty Paul, knowing that the Only-begotten God, Who has the pre-eminence in all things[fn-10-P1067_578878:86-nf] , is the author and cause of all good, bears witness to Him that not only was the creation of all existent things wrought by Him, but that when the original creation of man had decayed and vanished away[fn-10-P1068_579102:87-nf] , to use his own language, and another new creation was wrought in Christ, in this too no other than He took the lead, but He is Himself the first-born of all that new creation of men which is effected by the Gospel. And that our view about this may be made clearer let us thus divide our argument. The inspired apostle on four occasions employs this term, once as here, calling Him, \"first-born of all creation[fn-10-P1069_579579:88-nf] ,\" another time, \"the first-born among many brethren[fn-10-P1070_579649:89-nf] ,\" again, \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1071_579705:90-nf] ,\" and on another occasion he employs the term absolutely, without combining it with other words, saying, \"But when again He bringeth the first-born into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him[fn-10-P1072_579955:91-nf] .\" Accordingly whatever view we entertain concerning this title in the other combinations, the same we shall in consistency apply to the phrase \"first-born of all creation.\" For since the title is one and the same it must needs be that the meaning conveyed is also one. In what sense then does He become \"the first-born among many brethren?\" in what sense does He become \"the first-born from the dead?\" Assuredly this is plain, that because we are by birth flesh and blood, as the Scripture saith, \"He Who for our sakes was born among us and was partaker of flesh and blood[fn-10-P1073_580545:92-nf] ,\" purposing to change us from corruption to incorruption by the birth from above, the birth by water and the Spirit, Himself led the way in this birth, drawing down upon the water, by His own baptism, the Holy Spirit; so that in all things He became the first-born of those who are spiritually born again, and gave the name of brethren to those who partook in a birth like to His own by water and the Spirit. But since it was also meet that He should implant in our nature the power of rising again from the dead, He becomes the \"first-fruits of them that slept[fn-10-P1074_581130:93-nf] \" and the \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1075_581186:94-nf] ,\" in that He first by His own act loosed the pains of death[fn-10-P1076_581264:95-nf] , so that His new birth from the dead was made a way for us also, since the pains of death, wherein we were held, were loosed by the resurrection of the Lord. Thus, just as by having shared in the washing of regeneration[fn-10-P1077_581533:96-nf] He became \"the first-born among many brethren,\" and again by having made Himself the first-fruits of the resurrection, He obtains the name of the \"first-born from the dead,\" so having in all things the pre-eminence, after that \"all old things,\" as the apostle says, \"have passed away[fn-10-P1078_581877:97-nf] ,\" He becomes the first-born of the new creation of men in Christ by the two-fold regeneration, alike that by Holy Baptism and that which is the consequence of the resurrection from the dead, becoming for us in both alike the Prince of Life[fn-10-P1079_582141:98-nf] , the first-fruits, the first-born. This first-born, then, hath also brethren, concerning whom He speaks to Mary, saying, \"Go and tell My brethren, I go to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God[fn-10-P1080_582374:99-nf] .\" In these words He sums up the whole aim of His dispensation as Man. For men revolted front God, and \"served them which by nature were no gods[fn-10-P1081_582574:100-nf] ,\" and though being the children of God became attached to an evil father falsely so called. For this cause the mediator between God and man[fn-10-P1082_582738:101-nf] having assumed the first-fruits of all human nature[fn-10-P1083_582815:102-nf] , sends to His brethren the announcement of Himself not in His divine character, but in that which He shares with us, saying, \"I am departing in order to make by My own self that true Father, from whom you were separated, to be your Father, and by My own self to make that true God from whom you had revolted to be your God, for by that first-fruits which I have assumed, I am in Myself presenting all humanity to its God and Father.\"","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":8,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_23_book_xvii","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"Therefore prophetic utterances of three kinds are to be found; forasmuch as there are some relating to the earthly Jerusalem, some to the heavenly, and some to both. I think it proper to prove what I say by examples. The prophet Nathan was sent to convict king David of heinous sin, and predict to him what future evils should be consequent on it. Who can question that this and the like pertain to the terrestrial city, whether publicly, that is, for the safety or help of the people, or privately, when there are given forth for each one's private good divine utterances whereby something of the future may be known for the use of temporal life? But where we read, \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make for the house of Israel, and for the house of Judah, a new testament: not according to the testament that I settled for their fathers in the day when I laid hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my testament, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. For this is the testament that I will make for the house of Israel: after those days, saith the Lord, I will give my laws in their mind, and will write them upon their hearts, and I will see to them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;\"[fn-30-P3026_1676594:5-nf] -without doubt this is prophesied to the Jerusalem above, whose reward is God Himself, and whose chief and entire good it is to have Him, and to be His. But this pertains to both, that the city of God is called Jerusalem, and that it is prophesied the house of God shall be in it; and this prophecy seems to be fulfilled when king Solomon builds that most noble temple. For these things both happened in the earthly Jerusalem, as history shows, and were types of the heavenly Jerusalem. And this kind of prophecy, as it were compacted and commingled of both the others in the ancient canonical books, containing historical narratives, is of very great significance, and has exercised and exercises greatly the wits of those who search holy writ. For example, what we read of historically as predicted and fulfilled in the seed of Abraham according to, the flesh, we must also inquire the allegorical meaning of, as it is to be fulfilled in the seed of Abraham according to faith. And so much is this the case, that some have thought there is nothing in these books either foretold and effected, or effected although not foretold, that does not insinuate something else which is to be referred by figurative signification to the city of God on high, and to her children who are pilgrims in this life. But if this be so, then the utterances of the prophets, or rather the whole of those Scriptures that are reckoned under the title of the Old Testament, will be not of three, but of two different kinds. For there will be nothing there which pertains to the terrestrial Jerusalem only, if whatever is there said and fulfilled of or concerning her signifies something which also refers by allegorical prefiguration to the celestial Jerusalem; but there will be only two kinds one that pertains to the free Jerusalem, the other to both. But just as, I think, they err greatly who are of opinion that none of the records of affairs in that kind of writings mean anything more than that they so happened, so I think those very daring who contend that the whole gist of their contents lies in allegorical significations. Therefore I have said they are threefold, not two-fold. Yet, in holding this opinion, I do not blame those who may be able to draw out of everything there a spiritual meaning, only saving, first of all, the historical truth. For the rest, what believer can doubt that those things are spoken vainly which are such that, whether said to have been done or to be yet to come, they do not beseem either human or divine affairs? Who would not recall these to spiritual understanding if he could, or confess that they should be recalled by him who is able?","title":"Book XVII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_19_dialogue_i_the_immutable_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"177","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Orth.-And yet we shewed how, being invisible, He was made manifest through flesh, and the relationship of this very flesh we have been taught by the sacred writers-\"He took on Him the seed of Abraham.\"[fn-30-P3043_901689:59-nf] And the Lord God said to the patriarch, \"in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,\"[fn-30-P3044_901808:60-nf] and the apostle, \"It is evident our Lord sprang out of Judah.\"[fn-30-P3045_901889:61-nf] We adduced further several similar testimonies; but, since you are desirous of hearing yet others, listen to the apostle when he says, \"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices, wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.\"[fn-30-P3046_902217:62-nf] ","title":"Dialogue I.-The Immutable.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":8,"verse":47,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_28_book_i_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The Euxine Sea, as it is called, is self-contradictory in its nature, and deceptive in its name.[fn-38-P3817_1268399:8-nf] As you would not account it hospitable from its situation, so is it severed from our more civilised waters by a certain stigma which attaches to its barbarous character. The fiercest nations inhabit it, if indeed it can be called habitation, when life is passed in waggons. They have no fixed abode; their life has[fn-38-P3818_1268862:9-nf] no germ of civilization; they indulge their libidinous desires without restraint, and for the most part naked.

I think, indeed, that Jeremiah the prophet, also, understanding what was the nature of the wisdom of God in him, which was the same also which he had assumed for the salvation of the world, said, \"The breath of our countenance is Christ the Lord, to whom we said, that under His shadow we shall live among the nations.\"[fn-66-P6606_1327626:97-nf] And inasmuch as the shadow of our body is inseparable from the body, and unavoidably performs and repeats its movements and gestures, I think that he, wishing to point out the work of Christ's soul, and the movements inseparably belonging to it, and which accomplished everything according to His movements and will, called this the shadow of Christ the Lord, under which shadow we were to live among the nations. For in the mystery of this assumption the nations live, who, imitating it through faith, come to salvation. David also, when saying, \"Be mindful of my reproach, O Lord, with which they reproached me in exchange for Thy Christ,\"[fn-66-P6607_1328286:98-nf] seems to me to indicate the same. And what else does Paul mean when he says, \"Your life is hid with Christ in God; \"[fn-66-P6608_1328428:99-nf] and again in another passage, \"Do you seek a proof of Christ, who speaketh in me? \"[fn-66-P6609_1328531:100-nf] And now he says that Christ was hid in God. The meaning of which expression, unless it be shown to be something such as we have pointed out above as intended by the prophet in the words \"shadow of Christ,\" exceeds, perhaps, the apprehension of the human mind. But we see also very many other statements in holy Scripture respecting the meaning of the word \"shadow,\" as that well-known one in the Gospel according to Luke, where Gabriel says to Mary, \"The Spirit of the Lord shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.\"[fn-66-P6610_1329103:101-nf] And the apostle says with reference to the law, that they who have circumcision in the flesh, \"serve for the similitude and shadow of heavenly things.\"[fn-66-P6611_1329274:102-nf] And elsewhere, \"Is not our life upon the earth a shadow? \"[fn-66-P6612_1329354:103-nf] If, then, not only the law which is upon the earth is a shadow, but also all our life which is upon the earth is the same, and we live among the nations under the shadow of Christ, we must see whether the truth of all these shadows may not come to be known in that revelation, when no longer through a glass, and darkly, but face to face, all the saints shall deserve to behold the glory of God, and the causes and truth of things. And the pledge of this truth being already received through the Holy Spirit, the apostle said, \"Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more.\"[fn-66-P6613_1329993:104-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":8,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_47_on_repentance_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Whatever, then, our poor ability has attempted to suggest with reference to laying hold of repentance once for all, and perpetually retaining it, does indeed bear upon all who are given up to the Lord, as being all competitors for salvation in earning the favour of God; but is chiefly urgent in the case of those young novices who are only just beginning to bedew[fn-113-P11327_3211450:45-nf] their ears with divine discourses, and who, as whelps in yet early infancy, and with eyes not yet perfect, creep about uncertainly, and say indeed that they renounce their former deed, and assume (the profession of) repentance, but neglect to complete it.[fn-113-P11328_3211727:46-nf] For the very end of desiring importunes them to desire somewhat of their former deeds; just as fruits, when they are already beginning to turn into the sourness or bitterness of age, do yet still in some part flatter[fn-113-P11329_3211967:47-nf] their own loveliness.

And now the point for investigation is, whether, when God shall be all in all, the whole of bodily nature will, in the consummation of all things, consist of one species, and the sole quality of body be that which shall shine in the indescribable glory which is to be regarded as the future possession of the spiritual body. For if we rightly understand the matter, this is the statement of Moses in the beginning of his book, when he says, \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\"[fn-73-P7317_1665979:423-nf] For this is the beginning of all creation: to this beginning the end and consummation of all things must be recalled, i.e., in order that that heaven and that earth may be the habitation and resting-place of the pious; so that all the holy ones, and the meek, may first obtain an inheritance in that land, since this is the teaching of the law, and of the prophets, and of the Gospel. In which land I believe there exist the true and living forms of that worship which Moses handed down under the shadow of the law; of which it is said, that \"they serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things\"[fn-73-P7318_1666600:424-nf] -those, viz., who were in subjection in the law.

Threatenings also are held out as impending over those who shall transgress the law; different kinds of purifications are moreover prescribed for those who required purification, as being persons who were liable to frequent pollution, that by means of these they may arrive at last at that one purification after which no further pollution is permitted. The very people are numbered, though not all; for the souls of children are not yet old enough to be numbered according to the divine command: nor are those souls who cannot become the head of another, but are themselves subordinated to others as to a head, who are called \"women,\" who certainly are not included in that numbering which is enjoined by God; but they alone are numbered who are called \"men,\" by which it might be shown that the women could not be counted separately,[fn-73-P7331_1671596:3-nf] but were included in those called men. Those, however, especially belong to the sacred number, who are prepared to go forth to the battles of the Israelites, and are able to fight against those public and private enemies[fn-73-P7332_1671833:4-nf] whom the Father subjects to the Son, who sits on His right hand that He may destroy all principality and power, and by means of these bands of His soldiery, who, being engaged in a warfare for God, do not entangle themselves in secular business, He may overturn the Kingdom of His adversary; by whom the shields of faith are borne, and the weapons of wisdom brandished; among whom also the helmet of hope and salvation gleams forth, and the breastplate of brightness fortifies the breast that is filled with God. Such soldiers appear to me to be indicated, and to be prepared for wars of this kind, in those persons who in the sacred books are ordered by God's command to be numbered. But of these, by far the more perfect and distinguished are shown to be those of whom the very hairs of the head are said to be numbered. Such, indeed, as were punished for their sins, whose bodies fell in the wilderness, appear to possess a resemblance to those who had made indeed no little progress, but who could not at all, for various reasons, attain to the end of perfection; because they are reported either to have murmured, or to have worshipped idols, or to have committed fornication, or to have done some evil work which the mind ought not even to conceive. I do not consider the following even to be without some mystical meaning,[fn-73-P7333_1673186:5-nf] viz., that certain (of the Israelites), possessing many flocks and animals, take possession by anticipation of a country adapted for pasture and the feeding of cattle, which was the very first that the right hand of the Hebrews had secured in war.[fn-73-P7334_1673485:6-nf] For, making a request of Moses to receive this region, they are divided off by the waters of the Jordan, and set apart from any possession in the holy land. And this Jordan, according to the form of heavenly things, may appear to water and irrigate thirsty souls, and the senses that are adjacent to it.[fn-73-P7335_1673848:7-nf] In connection with which, even this statement does not appear superfluous, that Moses indeed hears from God what is described in the book of Leviticus, while in Deuteronomy it is the people that are the auditors of Moses, and who learn from him what they could not hear from God. For as Deuteronomy is called, as it were, the second law, which to some will appear to convey this signification, that when the first law which was given through Moses had come to an end, so a second legislation seems to have been enacted, which was specially transmitted by Moses to his successor Joshua, who is certainly believed to embody a type[fn-73-P7336_1674544:8-nf] of our Saviour, by whose second law-that is, the precepts of the Gospel-all things are brought to perfection.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":8,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_50_exhortation_to_the_heathen","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"387","folder":"ANF-02","text":"having bestowed on us the truly great, divine, and inalienable inheritance of the Father, deifying man by heavenly teaching, putting His laws into our minds, and writing them on our hearts.

My brethren, I indeed am a disciple of Christ, and, moreover, an apostle of Jesus; and it is owing to the exceeding kindness of Marcellus that I have hastened hither, with the view of showing him clearly in what manner he ought to keep the system of divine religion, so that the said Marcellus verily, who at present has put himself, like one who has surrendered himself prisoner, under the doctrine of Archclaus, may not, like the dumb animals, which are destitute of intellect and understand not what they do, be fatally smitten to the ruin of his soul, in consequence of any failure in the possession of further facilities for setting about the right observance of divine worship. I know, furthermore, and am certain, that if Marcellus is once set right,[fn-33-P3347_874919:97-nf] it will be quite possible that all of you may also have your salvation effected; for your city hangs suspended upon his judgment. If vain presumption is rejected by every one of you, and if those things which are to be declared by me be heard with a real love for the truth, ye will receive the inheritance of the age to come, and the kingdom of heaven. I, in sooth, am the Paraclete, whose mission was announced of old time by Jesus, and who was to come to \"convince the world of sin and unrighteousness.\"[fn-33-P3348_875483:98-nf] And even as Paul, who was sent before me, said of himself, that \"he knew in part, and prophesied in part,\"[fn-33-P3349_875929:99-nf] so I reserve the perfect for myself, in order that I may do away with that which is in part. Therefore receive ye this third testimony, that I am an elect apostle of Christ; and if ye choose to accept my words, ye will find salvation; but if ye refuse them, eternal fire will have you to consume you. For as Hymenaeus and Alexander were\" delivered unto Satan, that they might learn not to blaspheme,\"[fn-33-P3350_876352:100-nf] so will all ye also be delivered unto the prince of punishments, because ye have done injury to the Father of Christ, in so far as ye declare Him to be the cause of all evils, and the founder of unrighteousness, and the creator of all iniquity. By such doctrine ye do, indeed, bring forth from the same fountain both sweet water and bitter,-a thing which can in no possible way be either done or apprehended. For who ought to be believed? Should it be those masters of yours whose enjoyment is in the flesh, and who pamper themselves with the richest delights; or our Saviour Jesus Christ, who says, as it is written in the book of the Gospels, \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,\"[fn-33-P3351_877114:101-nf] and who in another place assures us that the \"father of the devil[fn-33-P3352_877202:102-nf] is a liar and a murderer from the beginning,\"[fn-33-P3353_877271:103-nf] and tells us again that men's desire was for the darkness,[fn-33-P3354_877352:104-nf] so that they would not follow that Word that had been sent forth in the beginning from the light,[fn-33-P3355_877491:105-nf] and (once more shows us) the man who is the enemy of the same, the sower of tares,[fn-33-P3356_877871:106-nf] and the god and prince of the age of this world, who blinds the minds of men that they may not be obedient to the truth in the Gospel of Christ?[fn-33-P3357_878039:107-nf] Is that God good who has no wish that the men who are his own should be saved? And, not to go over a multitude of other matters, and waste much time, I may defer[fn-33-P3358_878235:108-nf] till another opportunity the exposition of the true doctrine; and taking it for granted that I have said enough on this subject for the present, I may revert to the matter immediately before me, and endeavour satisfactorily to demonstrate the absurdity of these men's teaching, and show that none of these things can be attributed to the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour, but that we must take Satan to be the cause of all our ills. To him, certainly, these must be carried back, for all ills of this kind are generated by him. But those things also which are written in the prophets and the law are none the less to be ascribed to him; for he it is who spake then in the prophets, introducing into their minds very many ignorant notions of God, as well as temptations and passions. They, too, set forth that devourer of blood and flesh; and to that Satan and to his prophets all these things properly pertain which he wished to transfer[fn-33-P3359_879243:109-nf] to the Father of Christ, prepared as he was to write a few things in the way of truth, that by means of these he might also gain credence for those other statements of his which are false. Hence it is well for us to receive nothing at all of all those things which have been written of old even down to John, and indeed to embrace only the kingdom of heaven, which has been preached in the Gospel since his days; for they verily but made a mockery of themselves, introducing as they did things ridiculous and ludicrous, keeping some small words given in obscure outline in the law, but not understanding that, if good things are mixed up with evil, the result is, that by the corruption of these evil things, even those others which are good are destroyed. And if, indeed, there is any one who may prove himself able to demonstrate that the law upholds the right, that law ought to be kept; but if we can show it to be evil, then it ought to be done away with and rejected, inasmuch as it contains the ministration of death, which was graven,[fn-33-P3360_880308:110-nf] which also covered and destroyed the glory on the countenance of Moses.[fn-33-P3361_880399:111-nf] It is a thing not without peril, therefore, for any one of you to teach the New Testament along with the law and the prophets, as if they were of one and the same origin; for the knowledge of our Saviour renews the one from day to day, while the other grows old and infirm, and passes almost into utter destruction.[fn-33-P3362_880737:112-nf] And this is a fact manifest to those who are capable of exercising discernment. For just as, when the branches of a tree become aged, or when the trunk ceases to bear fruit any more, they are cut down; and just as, when the members of the body suffer mortification, they are amputated, for the poison of the mortification diffuses itself from these members through the whole body, and unless some remedy be found for the disease by the skill of the physician, the whole body will be vitiated; so, too, if ye receive the law without understanding its origin, ye will ruin your souls, and lose your salvation. For \"the law and the prophets were until John; \"[fn-33-P3363_881420:113-nf] but since John the law of truth, the law of the promises, the law of heaven, the new law, is made known to the race of man. And, in sooth, as long as there was no one to exhibit to you this most true knowledge of our Lord Jesus, ye had not sin. Now, however, ye both see and hear, and yet ye desire to walk in ignorance,[fn-33-P3364_881762:114-nf] in order that ye may keep[fn-33-P3365_882007:115-nf] that law which has been destroyed and abandoned. And Paul, too, who is held to be the most approved apostle with us, expresses himself to the same effect in one of his epistles, when he says: \"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.\"[fn-33-P3366_882339:116-nf] And in saying this he pronounces on them as Gentiles, because they were under the elements of the world,[fn-33-P3367_882507:117-nf] before the fulness of faith came, believing then as they did in the law and the prophets.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":8,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_220_sermon_xcv_a_homily_on_the_beatitudes_st_matt_v_1_9_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"When our Lord Jesus Christ, beloved, was preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, and was healing divers sicknesses through the whole of Galilee, the fame of His mighty works had spread into all Syria: large crowds too from all parts of Judaea were flocking to the heavenly Physician[fn-42-P4200_1077292:1-nf] . For as human ignorance is slow in believing what it does not see, and in hoping for what it does not know, those who were to be instructed in the divine lore[fn-42-P4201_1077480:2-nf] , needed to be aroused by bodily benefits and visible miracles: so that they might have no doubt as to the wholesomeness of His teaching when they actually experienced His benignant power. And therefore that the Lord might use outward healings as an introduction to inward remedies, and after healing bodies might work cures in the soul, He separated Himself from the surrounding crowd, ascended into the retirement of a neighbouring mountain, and called His apostles to Him there, that from the height of that mystic seat He might instruct them in the lottier doctrines, signifying from the very nature of the place and act that He it was who had once honoured Moses by speaking to him: then indeed with a more terrifying justice, but now with a holier mercifulness, that what had been promised might be fulfilled when the Prophet Jeremiah says: \"behold the days come when I will complete a new covenant[fn-42-P4202_1078589:3-nf] for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah.
