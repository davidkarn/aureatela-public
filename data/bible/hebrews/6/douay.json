{"verses":["Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go\non to things more perfect:  not laying again the foundation of penance\nfrom dead works and of faith towards God,","Of the doctrine of baptisms and imposition of hands, and of the\nresurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.","And this will we do, if God permit.","For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have\ntasted also the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy\nGhost,","Have moreover tasted the good word of God and the powers of the\nworld to come,","And are fallen away:  to be renewed again to penance, crucifying\nagain to themselves the Son of God and making him a mockery.","For the earth, that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon\nit and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled,\nreceiveth blessing from God.","But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers is reprobate and\nvery near unto a curse:  whose end is to be burnt.","But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer\nto salvation; though we speak thus.","For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work and the\nlove which you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered and do\nminister to the saints.","And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same\ncarefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end:","That you become not slothful, but followers of them who through\nfaith and patience shall inherit the promises.","For God making promises to Abraham, because he had no one greater\nby whom he might swear, swore by himself,","Saying:  Unless blessing I shall bless thee and multiplying I\nshall multiply thee.","And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.","For men swear by one greater than themselves:  and an oath for\nconfirmation is the end of all their controversy.","Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the\npromise the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:","That by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to\nlie, we may have the strongest comfort, we who have fled for refuge to\nhold fast the hope set before us.","Which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and which\nentereth in even within the veil:","Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest\nfor ever according to the order of Melchisedech."]}
