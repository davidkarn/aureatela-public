{"verses":["For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in\nthe things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and\nsacrifices for sins:","Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err:\nbecause he himself also is compassed with infirmity.","And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to\noffer for sins.","Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is\ncalled by God, as Aaron was.","So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a\nhigh priest:  but he that said unto him:  Thou art my Son:  this day have\nI begotten thee.","As he saith also in another place:  Thou art a priest for ever,\naccording to the order of Melchisedech.","Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears,\noffering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him\nfrom death, was heard for his reverence.","And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by\nthe things which he suffered.","And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause\nof eternal salvation:","Called by God a high priest, according to the order of\nMelchisedech.","Of whom we have much to say and hard to be intelligibly uttered:\nbecause you are become weak to hear.","For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need\nto be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God:  and\nyou are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat.","For every one that is a partaker of milk is unskilful in the word\nof justice:  for he is a little child.","But strong meat is for the perfect:  for them who by custom have\ntheir senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil."]}
