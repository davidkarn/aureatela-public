{"verses":["Thou therefore, my son, be strong in Christ Jesus:","And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the\nsame commend to faithful men who shall be fit to teach others also.","Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.","No man, being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular\nbusinesses:  that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.","For he also that striveth for the mastery is not crowned, except\nhe strive lawfully.","The husbandman that laboureth must first partake of the fruits.","Understand what I say:  for the Lord will give thee in all things\nunderstanding.","Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the\ndead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:","Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an evildoer.  But the word of\nGod is not bound.","Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that\nthey also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with\nheavenly glory.","A faithful saying:  for if we be dead with him, we shall live also\nwith him.","If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.  If we deny him, he\nwill also deny us.","If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he cannot deny\nhimself.","Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord.\nContend not in words:  for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of\nthe hearers.","Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman\nthat needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.","But shun profane and vain babblings:  for they grow much towards\nungodliness.","And their speech spreadeth like a canker:  of whom are Hymeneus\nand Philetus:","Who have erred from the truth, saying that the resurrection is\npast already, and have subverted the faith of some.","But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal:\nthe Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity\nwho nameth the name of the Lord.","But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of\nsilver, but also of wood and of earth:  and some indeed unto honour, but\nsome unto dishonour.","If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall\nbe a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord,\nprepared unto every good work.","But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith,\ncharity and peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.","And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they\nbeget strifes.","But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle:  but be mild toward\nall men, apt to teach, patient,","With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth:  if\nperadventure God may give them repentance to know the truth;","And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil by\nwhom they are held captive at his will."]}
