I ask, therefore, how we are to understand, \"I will not judge him; but the Word which I have spoken shall judge him:\" which appears from what follows to be so said, as if He would say, I will not judge; but the Word of the Father will judge. But the Word of the Father is the Son of God Himself. Is it to be so understood: I will not judge, but I will judge? How can this be true, unless in this way: viz., I will not judge by human power, because I am the Son of man; but I will judge by the power of the Word, because I am the Son of God? Or if it still seems contradictory and inconsistent to say, I will not judge, but I will judge; what shall we say of that place where He says, \"My doctrine is not mine?\" How \"mine,\" when \"not mine?\" For He did not say, This doctrine is not mine, but \"My doctrine is not mine:\" that which He called His own, the same He called not His own. How can this be true, unless He has called it His own in one relation; not His own, in another? According to the form of God, His own; according to the form of a servant, not His own. For when He says, \"It is not mine, but His that sent me,\"[fn-3-P381_132251:160-nf] He makes us recur to the Word itself. For the doctrine of the Father is the Word of the Father, which is the Only Son. And what, too, does that mean, \"He that believeth on me, believeth not on me?\"[fn-3-P382_132470:161-nf] How believe on Him, yet not believe on Him? How canso opposite and inconsistent a thing be understood-\"Whoso believeth on me,\" He says, \"believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me;\"-unless you so understand it, Whoso believeth on me believeth not on that which he sees, lest our hope should be in the creature; but on Him who took the creature, whereby He might appear to human eyes, and so might cleanse our hearts by faith, to contemplate Himself as equal to the Father? So that in turning the attention of believers to the Father, and saying, \"Believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me,\" He certainly did not mean Himself to be separated from the Father, that is, from Him that sent Him; but that men might so believe on Himself, as they believe on the Father, to whom He is equal. And this He says in express terms in another place, \"Ye believe in God, believe also in me:\"[fn-3-P383_133374:162-nf] that is, in the same way as you believe in God, so also believe in me; because I and the Father are One God. As therefore, here, He has as it were withdrawn the faith of men from Himself, and transferred it to the Father, by saying, \"Believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me,\" from whom nevertheless He certainly did not separate Himself; so also, when He says, \"It is not mine to give, but lit shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared by my Father,\" it is I think plain in what relation both are to be taken. For that other also is of the same kind, \"I will not judge;\" whereas He Himself shall judge the quick and dead.[fn-3-P384_134028:163-nf] But because He will not do so by human power, therefore, reverting to the Godhead, He raises the hearts of men upwards; which to lift up, He Himself came down.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_10_the_chaplet_or_de_corona_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Keep for God His own property untainted; He will crown it if He choose.

Blush, ye fellow-soldiers of his, henceforth not to be condemned even by him, but by some soldier of Mithras, who, at his initiation in the gloomy cavern, in the camp, it may well be said, of darkness, when at the sword's point a crown is presented to him, as though in mimicry of martyrdom, and thereupon put upon his head, is admonished to resist and east it off, and, if you like, transfer it to his shoulder, saying that Mithras is his crown. And thenceforth he is never crowned; and he has that for a mark to show who he is, if anywhere he be subjected to trial in respect of his religion; and he is at once believed to be a soldier of Mithras if he throws the crown away-if he say that in his god he has his crown.

But the question before us is rendered more urgent by what the Apostle John says: \"If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and the Lord shall give him life for him who sinneth not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.\"[fn-5-P546_192159:213-nf] For he manifestly shows that there are certain brethren for whom we are not commanded to pray, although the Lord bids us pray even for our persecutors. Nor can the question in hand be solved, unless we acknowledge that there are certain sins in brethren which are more heinous than the persecution of enemies. Moreover, that brethren mean Christians can be proved by many examples from the divine Scriptures. Yet that one is plainest which the apostle thus states: \"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother.\"[fn-5-P547_192757:214-nf] For he has not added the word our; but has thought it plain, as he wished a Christian who had an unbelieving wife to be understood by the expression brother. And therefore he says a little after, \"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart: a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases.\"[fn-5-P548_193079:215-nf] Hence I am of opinion that the sin of a brother is unto death, when any one, after coming to the knowledge of God through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, makes an assault on the brotherhood, and is impelled by the fires of envy to oppose that grace itself by which he is reconciled to God. But the sin is not unto death, if any one has not withdrawn his love from a brother, but through some infirmity of disposition has failed to perform the incumbent duties of brotherhood. And on this accountour Lord also on the cross says, \"Father, forgive[fn-5-P549_193655:216-nf] them; for they know not what they do:\"[fn-5-P550_193728:217-nf] for, not yet having become partakers of thegrace of the Holy Spirit, they had not yet entered the fellowship of the holy brotherhood. And the blessed Stephen in the Acts of the Apostles prays for those by whom he is being stoned,[fn-5-P551_193982:218-nf] because they had not yet believed on Christ, and were not fighting against that common grace. And the Apostle Paul on this account, I believe, does not pray for Alexander, because he was already a brother, and had sinned unto death, viz. by making an assault on the brotherhood through envy. But for those who had not broken off their love, but had given way through fear, he prays that they may bepardoned. For thus he expresses it: \"Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works. Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatlywithstood our words.\"[fn-5-P552_194599:219-nf] Then he adds for whom he prays, thus expressing it: \"At my first defence no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.\"[fn-5-P553_194807:220-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"362","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"40. Love finds nothing hard; no task is difficult to the eager. Think of all that Jacob bore for Rachel, the wife who had been promised to him. \"Jacob,\" the Scripture says, \"served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her.\"[fn-9-P961_205482:653-nf] Afterwards he himself tells us what he had to undergo. \"In the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night.\"[fn-9-P962_205620:654-nf] So we must love Christ and always seek His embraces. Then everything difficult will seem easy; all things long we shall account short; and smitten with His arrows,[fn-9-P963_205806:655-nf] we shall say every moment: \"Woe is me that I have prolonged my pilgrimage.\"[fn-9-P964_205905:656-nf] For \"the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\"[fn-9-P965_206048:657-nf] For \"tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope maketh not ashamed.\"[fn-9-P966_206181:658-nf] When your lot seems hard to bear read Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians: \"In labors more abundant; in stripes above measure; in prisons more frequent; in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one; thrice was I beaten with rods; once was I stoned; thrice I suffered shipwreck; a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren, in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.\"[fn-9-P967_206900:659-nf] Which of us can claim the veriest fraction of the virtues here enumerated?

No young girl of sound and vigorous constitution could have delivered herself up to a regimen so rigid as that imposed upon herself by Paula whose physical powers age had impaired and enfeebled. I admit that in this she was too determined, refusing to spare herself or to listen to advice. I will relate what I know to be a fact. In the extreme heat of the month of July she was once attacked by a violent fever and we despaired of her life. However by God's mercy she rallied, and the doctors urged upon her the necessity of taking a little light wine to accelerate her recovery; saying that if she continued to drink water they feared that she might become dropsical. I on my side secretly appealed to the blessed pope Epiphanius to admonish, nay even to compel her, to take the wine. But she with her usual sagacity and quickness at once perceived the stratagem, and with a smile let him see that the advice he was giving her was after all not his but mine. Not to waste more words, the blessed prelate after many exhortations left her chamber; and, when I asked him what he had accomplished, replied, \"Only this that old as I am I have been almost persuaded to drink no more wine.\" I relate this story not because I approve of persons rashly taking upon themselves burthens beyond their strength (for does not the scripture say: \"Burden not thyself above thy power\"?[fn-40-P4098_1103758:2952-nf] ) but because I wish from this quality of perseverance in her to shew the passion of her mind and the yearning of her believing soul; both of which made her sing in David's words, \"My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth after thee.\"[fn-40-P4099_1104020:2953-nf] Difficult as it is always to avoid extremes, the philosophers[fn-41-P4100_1104119:2954-nf] are quite right in their opinion that virtue is a mean and vice an excess, or as we may express it in one short sentence \"In nothing too much.\"[fn-41-P4101_1104308:2955-nf] While thus unyielding in her contempt for food Paula was easily moved to sorrow and felt crushed by the deaths of her kinsfolk, especially those of her children. When one after another her husband and her daughters fell asleep, on each occasion the shock of their loss endangered her life. And although she signed her mouth and her breast with the sign of the cross, and endeavoured thus to alleviate a mother's grief; her feelings overpowered her and her maternal instincts were too much for her confiding mind. Thus while her intellect retained its mastery she was overcome by sheer physical weakness. On one occasion a sickness seized her and clung to her so long that it brought anxiety to us and danger to herself. Yet even then she was full of joy and repeated every moment the apostle's words: \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\"[fn-41-P4102_1105210:2956-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1374","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"7. When the needs of the Church at length brought me to Rome[fn-49-P4973_1366302:3548-nf] in company with the reverend pontiffs, Paulinus and Epiphanius-the first of whom ruled the church of the Syrian Antioch while the second presided over that of Salamis in Cyprus,-I in my modesty was for avoiding the eyes of highborn ladies, yet she pleaded so earnestly, \"both in season and out of season\"[fn-49-P4974_1366628:3549-nf] as the apostle says, that at last her perseverance overcame my reluctance. And, as in those days my name was held in some renown as that of a student of the scriptures, she never came to see me that she did not ask me some question concerning them, nor would she at once acquiesce in my explanations but on the contrary would dispute them; not, however, for argument's sake but to learn the answers to those objections which might, as she saw, be made to my statements. How much virtue and ability, how much holiness and purity I found in her I am afraid to say; both lest I may exceed the bounds of men's belief and lest I may increase your sorrow by reminding you of the blessings that you have lost. This much only will I say, that whatever in me was the fruit of long study and as such made by constant meditation a part of my nature, this she tasted, this she learned and made her own. Consequently after my departure from Rome, in case of a dispute arising as to the testimony of scripture on any subject, recourse was had to her to settle it. And so wise was she and so well did she understand what philosphers call to prepon, that is, the becoming, in what she did, that when she answered questions she gave her own opinion not as her own but as from me or some one else, thus admitting that what she taught she had herself learned from others.

Listen to the Apostle Paul acknowledging grace, and afterwards desiring the payment of a debt.

We may answer, that what is here written, was sufficient for those who would attend, and that the sacred writers ever addressed themselves to the matter of immediate importance, whatever it might be at the time it was no object with them to be writers of books: in fact, there are many things which they have delivered by unwritten tradition. Now while all that is contained in this Book is worthy of admiration, so is especially the way the Apostles have of coming down to the wants of their hearers: a condescension suggested by the Spirit who has so ordered it, that the subject on which they chiefly dwell is that which pertains to Christ as man. For so it is, that while they discourse so much about Christ, they have spoken but little concerning His Godhead; it was mostly of the Manhood that they discoursed, and of the Passion, and the Resurrection, and the Ascension. For the thing required in the first instance was this, that it should be believed that He was risen, and ascended into heaven. As then the point on which Christ himself most. insisted was, to have it known that He was come from the Father, so is it this writer's principal object to declare, that Christ was risen from the dead, and was received up into Heaven, and that He went to God, and came from God. For, if the fact of His coming from God were not first believed, much more, with the Resurrection and Ascension added thereto, would the Jews have found the entire doctrine incredible. Wherefore gently and by degrees he leads them on to higher truths. Nay, at Athens Paul even calls Him man simply, without saying more (Acts xvii. 31). For if, when Christ Himself spoke of His equality with the Father, they often attempted to stone Him, and called Him a blasphemer for this reason, it was little to be expected that they would receive this doctrine from the fishermen, and that too, with the Cross coming before it.","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":4,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_08_homily_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"The greater part, however, of this work is occupied with the acts of Paul, who \"laboured more abundantly than they all.\" (I.

Again, when he says, \"He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve,\" and, \"according to the Gospel which ye received\" (1 Cor. xv. 5, 1 Cor xv. 1), he means the Gospel of this Luke.[fn-1-P189_33236:3-nf] So that there can be no mistake in attributing this work to him: and when I say, to him, I mean, to Christ.[fn-1-P190_33683:4-nf] And why then did he not relate every thing, seeing he was with Paul to the end? We may answer, that what is here written, was sufficient for those who would attend, and that the sacred writers ever addressed themselves to the matter of immediate importance, whatever it might be at the time it was no object with them to be writers of books: in fact, there are many things which they have delivered by unwritten tradition. Now while all that is contained in this Book is worthy of admiration, so is especially the way the Apostles have of coming down to the wants of their hearers: a condescension suggested by the Spirit who has so ordered it, that the subject on which they chiefly dwell is that which pertains to Christ as man. For so it is, that while they discourse so much about Christ, they have spoken but little concerning His Godhead; it was mostly of the Manhood that they discoursed, and of the Passion, and the Resurrection, and the Ascension. For the thing required in the first instance was this, that it should be believed that He was risen, and ascended into heaven. As then the point on which Christ himself most. insisted was, to have it known that He was come from the Father, so is it this writer's principal object to declare, that Christ was risen from the dead, and was received up into Heaven, and that He went to God, and came from God. For, if the fact of His coming from God were not first believed, much more, with the Resurrection and Ascension added thereto, would the Jews have found the entire doctrine incredible. Wherefore gently and by degrees he leads them on to higher truths. Nay, at Athens Paul even calls Him man simply, without saying more (Acts xvii. 31). For if, when Christ Himself spoke of His equality with the Father, they often attempted to stone Him, and called Him a blasphemer for this reason, it was little to be expected that they would receive this doctrine from the fishermen, and that too, with the Cross coming before it.","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":4,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_08_homily_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"The greater part, however, of this work is occupied with the acts of Paul, who \"laboured more abundantly than they all.\" (I.

It will follow that we should next in order point out the character of the provision of blessings bestowed on us by the Father \"through him.\" Inasmuch as all created nature, both this visible world and all that is conceived of in the mind, cannot hold together without the care and providence of God, the Creator Word, the Only begotten God, apportioning His succour according to the measure of the needs of each, distributes mercies various and manifold on account of the many kinds and characters of the recipients of His bounty, but appropriate to the necessities of individual requirements. Those that are confined in the darkness of ignorance He enlightens: for this reason He is true Light.[fn-13-P1354_322518:171-nf] Portioning requital in accordance with the desert of deeds, He judges: for this reason He is righteous Judge.[fn-13-P1355_322649:172-nf] \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.\"[fn-13-P1356_322744:173-nf] Those that have lapsed from the lofty height of life into sin He raises from their fall: for this reason He is Resurrection.[fn-13-P1357_322890:174-nf] Effectually working by the much of His power and the will of His goodness He does all things. He shepherds; He enlightens; He nourishes; He heals; He guides; He raises up; He calls into being things that were not; He upholds what has been created. Thus the good things that come from God reach us \"through the Son,\" who works in each case with greater speed than speech can utter. For not lightnings, not light's course in air, is so swift; not eyes' sharp turn, not the movements of our very thought. Navy by the divine energy is each one of these in speed further surpassed than is the slowest of all living creatures outdone in motion by birds, or even winds, or the rush of the heavenly bodies: or, not to mention these, by our very thought itself. For what extent of time is needed by Him who \"upholds all things by the word of His power, \"[fn-13-P1358_323755:175-nf] and works not by bodily agency, nor requires the help of hands to form and fashion, but holds in obedient following and unforced consent the nature of all things that are? So as Judith says, \"Thou hast thought, and what things thou didst determine were ready at hand.\"[fn-13-P1359_324044:176-nf] On the other hand, and test we should ever be drawn away by the greatness of the works wrought to imagine that the Lord is without beginning,[fn-13-P1360_324204:177-nf] what saith the Self-Existent?[fn-13-P1361_324261:178-nf] \"I live through [by, A.V.] the Father, \"[fn-13-P1362_326414:179-nf] and the power of God; \"The Son hath power [can, A.V.] to do nothing of himself. \"[fn-13-P1363_326519:180-nf] And the self-complete Wisdom? I received \"a commandment what I should say and what I should speak.\"[fn-13-P1364_326639:181-nf] Through all these words He is guiding us to the knowledge of the Father, and referring our wonder at all that is brought into existence to Him, to the end that \"through Him\" we may know the Father. For the Father is not regarded from the difference of the operations, by the exhibition of a separate and peculiar energy; for whatsoever things He sees the Father doing, \"these also doeth the Son likewise; \"[fn-13-P1365_327065:182-nf] but He enjoys our wonder at all that comes to pass out of the glory which comes to Him from the Only Begotten, rejoicing in the Doer Himself as well as in the greatness of the deeds, and exalted by all who acknowledge Him as Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, \"through whom [by whom, A.V.] are all things, and for whom are all things.\"[fn-13-P1366_327420:183-nf] Wherefore, saith the Lord, \"All mine are thine,\"[fn-13-P1367_327488:184-nf] as though the sovereignty over created things were conferred on Him, and \"Thine are mine,\" as though the creating Cause came thence to Him. We are not to suppose that He used assistance in His action, or yet was entrusted with the ministry of each individual work by detailed commission, a condition distinctly menial and quite inadequate to the divine dignity. Rather was the Word full of His Father's excellences; He shines forth from the Father, and does all things according to the likeness of Him that begat Him. For if in essence He is without variation, so also is He without variation in power.[fn-13-P1368_328382:185-nf] And of those whose power is equal, the operation also is in all ways equal. And Christ is the power of God, and the wisdom of God.[fn-13-P1369_328536:186-nf] And so \"all things are made through [by, A.V.] him,\"[fn-13-P1370_328833:187-nf] and \"all things were created through [by, A.V.] him and for him,\"[fn-13-P1371_328920:188-nf] not in the discharge of any slavish service, but in the fulfilment of the Father's will as Creator.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"177","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"66.[fn-18-P1856_483019:561-nf] Of the beliefs and practices whether generally accepted or publicly enjoined which are preserved in the Church[fn-18-P1857_483150:562-nf] some we possess derived from written teaching; others we have received delivered to us \"in a mystery\"[fn-18-P1858_483474:563-nf] by the tradition of the apostles; and both of these in relation to true religion have the same force. And these no one will gainsay;-no one, at all events, who is even moderately versed in the institutions of the Church. For were we to attempt to reject such customs as have no written authority, on the ground that the importance they possess is small, we should unintentionally injure the Gospel in its very vitals; or, rather, should make our public definition a mere phrase and nothing more.[fn-18-P1859_486470:564-nf] For instance, to take the first and most general example, who is thence who has taught us in writing to sign with the sign of the cross those who have trusted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ? What writing has taught us to turn to the East at the prayer? Which of the saints has left us in writing the words of tim invocation at the displaying[fn-18-P1860_491290:565-nf] of the bread of the Eucharist and the cup of blessing? For we are not, as is well known, content with what the apostle or the Gospel has recorded, but both in preface and conclusion we add other words as being of great importance to the validity of the ministry, and these we derive from unwritten teaching. Moreover we bless the water of baptism andthe oil of the chrism, and besides this the catechumen who is being baptized. On what written authority do we do this? Is not our authority silent and mystical tradition? Nay, by what written word is the anointing of oil[fn-18-P1861_492104:566-nf] itself taught? And whence comes the custom of baptizing thrice?[fn-18-P1862_492340:567-nf] And as to the other customs of baptism from what Scripture do we derive the renunciation of Satan and his angels? Does not this come from that unpublished and secret teaching which oar fathers guarded in a silence out of the reach of curious meddling and inquisitive investigation? Well had they learnt the lesson that the awful dignity of the mysteries is best preserved by silence. What the uninitiated are not even allowed: to look at was hardly likely to be publiclyparaded about in written documents. What was the meaning of the mighty Moses in not making all the parts of the tabernacle open to every one? The profane he stationed without the sacred barriers; the first courts he conceded to the purer; the Levites alone he judged worthy of being servants of the Deity; sacrifices and burnt offerings and the rest of the priestly functions he allotted to the priests; one chosen out of all he admitted to the shrine, and even this one not always but on only one day in the year, and of this one day a time was fixed for his entry so that he might gaze on the Holy of Holies amazed at the strangeness and novelty of the sight. Moses was wise enough to know that contempt stretches to the trite and to the obvious, while a keen interest is naturally associated with the unusual and the unfamiliar. In the same manner the Apostles and Fathers who laid down laws for the Church from the beginning thus guarded the awful dignity of the mysteries in secrecy and silence, for what is bruited abroad random among the common folk is no mystery at all. This is the reason for our tradition of unwritten precepts and practices, that the knowledge of our dogmas may not become neglected and contemned by the multitude through familiarity. \"Dogma\" and \"Kerugma\" are two distinct things; the former is observed in silence; the latter is proclaimed to all the world. One form of this silence is the obscurity employed in Scripture, which makes the meaning of \"dogmas\" difficult to be understood for the very advantage of the reader: Thus we all look to the East[fn-18-P1863_496971:568-nf] at our prayers, but few of us know that we are seeking our own old country,[fn-18-P1864_497282:569-nf] Paradise, which God planted in Eden in the East.[fn-18-P1865_497529:570-nf] We pray standing,[fn-18-P1866_497603:571-nf] on the first day of the week, but we do not all know the reason. On the day of the resurrection (or \"standing again\" Grk. a0na/stasij we remind ourselves of the grace given to us by standing at prayer, not only because we rose with Christ,[fn-18-P1867_497868:572-nf] and are bound to \"seek those things which are above,\"[fn-18-P1868_497941:573-nf] but because the day seems to us to be in some sense an image of the age which we expect, wherefore, though it is the beginning of days, it is not called by Moses first, but one.[fn-18-P1869_498455:574-nf] For he says \"There was evening, and therewas morning, one day,\" as though the same day often recurred. Now \"one and \"eighth\" are the same, in itself distinctly indicating that really \"one\" and \"eighth\" of which the Psalmist makes mention in certain titles of the Psalms, the state which follows after this present time, the day which knows no waning or eventide, and no successor, that age which endeth not or groweth old.[fn-18-P1870_498922:575-nf] Of necessity, then, the church teaches her own foster children to offer their prayers on that day standing, to the end that through continual reminder of the endless life we may not neglect to make provision for our removal thither. Moreover all Pentecost is a reminder of the resurrection expected in the age to come. For that one and first day, if seven times multiplied by seven, completes the seven weeks of the holy Pentecost; for, beginning at the first, Pentecost ends with the same, making fifty revolutions through the like intervening days. And so it is a likeness of eternity, beginning as it does and ending, as in a circling course, at the same point. On this day the rules of the church have educated us to prefer the upright attitude of prayer, for by their plain reminder they, as It were, make our mind to dwell no longer in the present but in the future. Moreover every time we fall upon our knees and rise from off them we shew by the very deed that by our sin we fell down to earth, and by the loving kindness of our Creator were called hack to heaven.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_12_book_ii_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"109","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"But see,\" say they, \"how the apostle says, `I have fought a good fight, I have kept the faith, I have finished my course: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness;'[fn-9-P905_515970:108-nf] which he would not have said if he had any sin.\" It is for them, then, to explain how he could have said this, when there still remained for him to encounter the great conflict, the grievous and excessive weight of that suffering which he had just said awaited him.[fn-9-P906_516257:109-nf] In order to finish his course, was there yet wanting only a small thing, when that in fact was still left to suffer wherein would be a fiercer and more cruel foe?

It is such whom the apostle foresaw through the Holy Spirit, when he said: \"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\"[fn-32-P3222_1801871:5-nf] For that mentioning of secrecy and theft, whereof it is said, \"Partake with pleasure of hidden bread and the sweetness of stolen waters,\" creates an itching in those who listen with ears that are lusting after spiritual fornication, just as by a kind of itching also of desire in the flesh the soundness of chastity is corrupted. Hear, therefore, how the apostle foresaw such things, and gave salutary admonition about avoiding them, when be said, \"Shun profane novelties of words; for they increase unto much ungodliness, and their speech insinuates itself as cloth a cancer.\"[fn-32-P3223_1802469:6-nf] He did not say novelties of words merely; but added, \"profane.\" For there are also novelties of words in perfect harmony with religious doctrine, as is told us in Scripture of the very name of Christians, when it began to be used. For itwas in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians after the Lord's ascension, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles:[fn-32-P3224_1802999:7-nf] and certain houses were afterwards called by the new names of hospices[fn-32-P3225_1803086:8-nf] and monasteries; but the things themselves existed prior to their names, and are confirmed by religious truth, which also forms their defense against the wicked. In opposition also to the impiety of Arian heretics, they coined the new term, Patris Homousios;[fn-32-P3226_1803399:9-nf] but there was nothing new signified by such a name; for what is called Homousios is just this: \"I and my Father are one,\"[fn-32-P3227_1803601:10-nf] to wit, of one and the same substance. For if every novelty were profane, as little should we have it said by the Lord, \"A new commandment I give unto. you;\"[fn-32-P3228_1803778:11-nf] nor would the Testament be called New, nor the new song be sung throughout the whole earth. But there is profanity in the novelties of words, when it is said by \"the foolish and audacious woman, Come and enjoy the tasting of hidden bread, and the sweetness of stolen waters.\" From such enticing words of false science the apostle also gives his prohibitory warning, in the passage where he says, \"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane novelties of expression, and oppositions of science falsely so called; which some professing, have erred concerning the faith.\"[fn-32-P3229_1804395:12-nf] For there is nothing that these men so love as to profess science, and to deride as utter silliness faith in those verities which the young are enjoined to believe.","title":"Tractate XCVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_08_book_i_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"139","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"58.

So you make what you call the kingdom of falsehood keep honestly to its own nature, while truth is changeable in order to deceive. Jesus Christ, according to you, is the son of this First Man. Truth springs, forsooth, from your fiction. You praise this First Man for using changeable and delusive forms in the contest. If you, then, speak the truth, you do not imitate him. If you imitate him, you deceive as he did. But our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the true and truthful Son of God, the true and truthful Son of man, both of which He testifies of Himself, derived the eternity of His godhead from true God, and His incarnation from true man. Your First Man is not the first man of the apostle. \"The first man,\" he says, \"was of the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven, heavenly.

Why do you conjure up this fabulous First Man of yours, and refuse to acknowledge the first man of the apostle? Is this not a fulfillment of what the apostle says: \"Turning away their ears from the truth, they will give heed to fables?\"[fn-11-P1165_607996:6-nf] According to Paul, the first man is of the earth, earthy; according to Manichaeus, he is not earthy, and is equipped with five elements of some unreal, unintelligible kind.

For if all were of the same mind as your present advisers, how would you have become a Christian, since there would be no bishops? Or if our successors are to inherit this state of mind, how will the Churches be able to hold together? Or do your advisers think that you have received nothing, that they despise it? If so surely they are wrong. For it is time for them to think that the grace of the Font is nothing, if some are found to despise it. But you have received it, beloved Dracontius; do not tolerate your advisers nor deceive yourself. For this will be required of you by the God who gave it. Have you not heard the Apostle say, `Neglect not the gift that is in thee[fn-98-P9843_3516232:11-nf] ?' or have you not read how he accepts the man that had doubled his money, while he condemned the one that had hidden it? But may it come to pass that you may quickly return, in order that you too may be one of those who are praised. Or tell me, whom do your advisers wish you to imitate? For we ought to walk by the standard of the saints and the fathers, and imitate them, and to be sure that if we depart from them we put ourselves also out of their fellowship. Whom then do they wish you to imitate? The one who hesitated, and while wishing to follow, delayed it and took counsel because of his family[fn-98-P9844_3516858:12-nf] , or blessed Paul, who, the moment the stewardship was entrusted to him, `straightway conferred not with flesh and blood[fn-98-P9845_3516997:13-nf] ?' For although he said, `I am not worthy to be called an Apostle[fn-98-P9846_3517080:14-nf] ,' yet, knowing what he had received, and being not ignorant of the giver, he wrote, `For woe is me if I preach not the gospel[fn-98-P9847_3517226:15-nf] .' But, as it was `woe to me' if he did not preach, so, in teaching and preaching the gospel, he had his converts as his joy and crown[fn-98-P9848_3517378:16-nf] . This explains why the saint[fn-98-P9849_3517427:17-nf] was zealous to preach as far as Illyricum, and not to shrink from proceeding to Rome[fn-98-P9850_3517555:18-nf] , or even going as far as the Spains[fn-98-P9851_3517609:19-nf] , in order that the more he laboured, he might receive so much the greater reward for his labour. He boasted then that he had fought the good fight, and was confident that he should receive the great crown[fn-98-P9852_3517836:20-nf] . Therefore, beloved Dracontius, whom are you imitating in your present action? Paul, or men unlike him? For my part, I pray that you, and myself, may prove an imitator of all the saints.","title":"Letter XLIX. Letter to Dracontius .

Critobulus, I am obliged to you for reminding me of the fact. For it is just my own view that no creature can be perfect in respect of true and finished righteousness. But that one differs from another, and that one man's righteousness is not the same as another's, no one doubts; nor again that one may be greater or less than another, and yet that, relatively to their own status and capacity, men may be called righteous who are not righteous when compared with others. For instance, the Apostle Paul, the chosen vessel who laboured more than all the Apostles, was, I suppose, righteous when he wrote to Timothy,[fn-73-P7353_2433538:50-nf] \"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day: and not only to me, but also to all them that love His appearing.\" Timothy, his disciple and imitator, whom he taught the rules of action and the limits of virtue, was also righteous. Are we to think there was one and the same righteousness in them both, and that he had not more merit who laboured more than all? \"In my Father's house are many mansions.\" I suppose there are also different degrees of merit. \"One star differeth from another star in glory,\" and in the one body of the Church there are different members. The sun has its own splendour, the moon tempers the darkness of the night; and the five heavenly bodies which are called planets traverse the sky in different tracks and with different degrees of luminousness. There are countless other stars whose movements we trace in the firmament. Each has its own brightness, and though each in respect of its own is perfect, yet, in comparison with one of greater magnitude, it lacks perfection. In the body also with its different members, the eye has one function, the hand another, the foot another. Whence the Apostle says,[fn-73-P7354_2434872:51-nf] \"The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Are all Apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? have all gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? But desire earnestly the greater gifts. But all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as He will.\" And here mark carefully that he does not say, as each member desires, but as the Spirit Himself will. For the vessel cannot say to him that makes it,[fn-73-P7355_2435481:52-nf] \"Why dost thou make me thus or thus? Hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?\" And so in close sequence he added, \"Desire earnestly the greater gifts,\" so that, by the exercise of faith and diligence, we may win something in addition to other gifts, and may be superior to those who, compared with us, are in the second or third class. In a great house there are different vessels, some of gold, some of silver, brass, iron, wood. And yet while in its kind a vessel of brass is perfect, in comparison with one of silver it is called imperfect, and again one of silver, compared with one of gold, is inferior. And thus, when compared with one another, all things are imperfect and perfect. In a field of good soil, and from one sowing, there springs a crop thirty-fold, sixty-fold, or a hundred-fold. The very numbers show that there is disparity in the parts of the produce, and yet in its own kind each is perfect. Elizabeth and Zacharias, whom you adduce and with whom you cover yourself as with an impenetrable shield, may teach us how far they are beneath the holiness of blessed Mary, the Lord's Mother, who, conscious that God was dwelling in her, proclaims without reserve,[fn-73-P7356_2436768:53-nf] \"Behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. For He that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is His name. And His mercy is unto generations and generations of them that fear Him: He hath showed strength with His arm.\" Where, observe, she says she is blessed not by her own merit and virtue, but by the mercy of God dwelling in her. And John himself, a greater than whom has not arisen among the sons of men, is better than his parents. For not only does our Lord compare him with men, but with angels also. And yet he, who was greater on earth than all other men, is said to be less than the least in the kingdom of heaven.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_20_on_the_proceedings_of_pelagius_","source_chapter":38,"source_paragraph":"149","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"What, then, is the meaning of that which the same apostle says: `I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day;'[fn-30-P3015_1168304:106-nf] if these are not recompenses paid to the worthy, but gifts, bestowed on the unworthy?\" He who says this, does not consider that the crown could not have been given to the man who is worthy of it, unless grace had been first bestowed on him whilst unworthy of it.

What will be your crime will be my sleep. \"Shall not He that sleeps also rise again?\" And yet he indicates in the following verses that they should not commit so great an impiety with impunity, saying,\" Yea, the man of my peace in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, hath enlarged the heel over me;\"[fn-32-P3204_1763044:120-nf] that is, hath trampled me under foot. \"But Thou,\" he saith, \"O Lord, he merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.\"[fn-32-P3205_1763197:121-nf] Who can now deny this who sees the Jews, after the passion and resurrection of Christ, utterly rooted up from their abodes by warlike slaughter and destruction?

For when their unhallowed zeal shall drive them beyond the endurance of sound doctrine, they will heap up teachers for their lusts, that is, construct schemes of doctrine to suit their own desires, not wishing to be taught, hut getting together teachers who will tell them what they wish: that the crowd of teachers whom they have ferreted out and gathered together, may satisfy them with the doctrines of their own tumultuous desires. And if these madmen in their godless folly do not know with what spirit they reject the sound, and yearn after the corrupt doctrine, let them hear the words of the same Apostle to the same Timothy, But the Spirit saith expressly that in the last days some shall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils through the hypocrisy of lying talk[fn-19-P1955_1280773:2-nf] .

They confirm the falsehoods of pretended godliness, for a canting hypocrisy always succeeds to defection from the faith: so that at least in word the reverence is retained, which the conscience has lost. Even that pretended piety they make impious by all manner of lies, violating by schemes of false doctrine the sacredness of the faith: for they pile up doctrines to suit their desires, and not according to the faith of the Gospel. They delight, with an uncontrollable pleasure, to have their itching ears tickled by the novelty of their favourite preaching; they estrange themselves utterly from the hearing of the truth, and surrender themselves entirely to fables: so that their incapacity for either speaking or understanding the truth invests their discourse with what is, to them, a semblance of truth.","title":"Book X","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":4,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_17_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"46.

The suffering which the mind despises in its desire of glory, the body does not feel, so long as the soul invigorates it. It is, then, a natural effect in man, that the zeal of the soul glowing for glory should make him unconscious of suffering, heedless of wounds, and regardless of death.

Hatred of the brethren makes room next for Antichrist; for the devil prepares beforehand the divisions among the people, that he who is to come may be acceptable to them.

I turn now to thee, thou deluded and deluding congregation of Manichaeus,-wedded to so many elements, or rather prostituted to so many devils, and impregnated with blasphemous falsehoods,-dost thou dare to slander as unchaste the marriage of the Catholic Church with thy Lord? Behold thy lovers, one balancing creation, and the other bearing it up like Atlas. For one, by thy account, holds the sources of the elements, and hangs the world in space; while the other keeps him up by kneeling down and carrying the weight on his shoulders. Where are those beings? And if they are so occupied, how can they come to visit thee, to spend an idle hour in getting their shoulders or their fingers relieved by thy soft, soothing touch? But thou art deceived by evil spirits which commit adultery with thee, that thou mayest conceive falsehoods and bring forth vanities. Well mayest thou reject the message of the true God, as opposed to thy parchments, where in the vain imaginations of a wanton mind thou hast gone after so many false gods. The fictions of the poets are more respectable than thine, in this at least, that they deceive no one; while the fables in thy books, by assuming an appearance of truth, mislead the childish, both young and old, and pervert their minds.

And thou canst not say that this description or representation has a typical meaning, for thou art wont to praise Manichaeus for nothing more than for speaking to thee the simple naked truth without the disguise of figures. So the God of thy song is a real king, bearing a sceptre and crowned with flowers. When he wears a crown of flowers, he ought to put aside his sceptre; for effeminacy and majesty are incongruous. And then he is not thy only lover; for the song goes on to tell of twelve seasons clothed in flowers, and filled with song, throwing their flowers at their father's face. These are twelve great gods of thine, three in each of the four regions surrounding the first deity. How this deity can be infinite, when he is thus circumscribed, no one can say.

In the passage, \"Thou shalt see thy life hanging, and shalt not believe thy life,\"[fn-17-P1714_959924:37-nf] Faustus is deceived by the ambiguity of the words. The words may be differently interpreted; but that they cannot be understood of Christ is not said by Faustus, nor can be said by anyone who does not deny that Christ is life, or that He was seen by the Jews hanging on the cross, or that they did not believe Him. Since Christ Himself says, \"I am the life,\"[fn-17-P1715_960306:38-nf] and since there is no doubt that He was seen hanging by the unbelieving Jews, I see no reason for doubting that this was written of Christ; for, as Christ says, Moses wrote of Him. Since we have already refuted Faustus' arguments by which he tries to show that the words, \"I will raise up from among their brethren a prophet like unto thee,\" do not apply to Christ, because Christ is not like Moses, we need not insist on this other prophecy. Since, in the one case, his argument is that Christ is unlike Moses, so here he ought to argue that Christ is not the life, or that He was not seen hanging by the unbelieving Jews. But as he has not said this, and as no one will now venture to say so, there should be no difficulty in accepting this too as a prophecy of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, uttered by His servant. These words, says Faustus, occur in a chapter of curses. But why should it be the less a prophecy because it occurs in the midst of prophecies? Or why should it not be a prophecy of Christ, although the context does not seem to refer to Christ? Indeed, among all the curses which the Jews brought on themselves by their sinful pride, nothing could be worse than this, that they should see their Life-that is, the Son of God -hanging, and should not believe their Life. For the curses of prophecy are not hostile imprecations, but announcements of coming judgment. Hostile imprecations are forbidden, for it is said, \"Bless, and curse not.\"[fn-17-P1716_961788:39-nf] But prophetic announcements are often found in the writings of the saints, as when the Apostle Paul says: \"Alexander the coppersmith has done me much evil; the Lord shall reward him according to his works.\"[fn-17-P1717_962014:40-nf] So it might be thought that the apostle was prompted by angry feeling to utter this imprecation: \"I would that they were even made eunuchs that trouble you.\"[fn-17-P1718_962192:41-nf] But if we remember who the writer is, we may see in this ambiguous expression an ingenious style of benediction. For there are eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.[fn-17-P1719_962413:42-nf] If Faustus had a pious appetite for Christian food, he would have found a similar ambiguity in the words of Moses. By the Jews the declaration, \"Thou shalt see thy life hanging, and shalt not believe thy life,\" may have been understood to mean that they would see their life to be in danger from the threats and plots of their enemies, and would not expect to live. But the child of the Gospel, who has heard Christ say, \"He wrote of me.\" distinguishes in the ambiguity of the prophecy between what is thrown to swine and what is addressed to man. To his mind the thought immediately suggests itself of Christ hanging as the life of man, and of the Jews not believing in Him for this very reason, that they saw Him hanging. As to the objection that these words, \"Thou shalt see thy life hanging, and shalt not believe thy life,\" are the only words referring to Christ in a passage containing maledictions not applicable to Christ, some might grant that this is true. For this prophecy might very well occur among the curses pronounced by the prophet upon the ungodly people, for these curses are of different kinds. But I, and those who with me. consider more closely the saying of the Lord in His Gospel, which is not, He wrote also of me, as admitting that Moses wrote other things not referring to Christ, but, \"He wrote of me,\" as teaching that in searching the Scriptures we should view them as intended solely to illustrate the grace of Christ, see a reference to Christ in the rest of the passage also. But it would take too much time to explain this here.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_116_tractate_cxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"6. \"And I have made known to them,\" He says, \"Thy name, and will make it known.\" I have made it known by faith, I will make it known by sight: I have made it known to those whose present sojourn in a strange land has its appointed end, I will make it known to those whose reign as kings shall be endless. \"That the love,\" He adds, \"wherewith [literally, which] Thou hast loved me,[fn-35-P3595_1994756:25-nf] may be in them, and I in them. (The form of speech is unusual, \"the love, which Thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them;\" for the common way of speaking is, the love wherewith thou hast loved me. Here, of course, it is a translation from the Greek: but there are similar forms also in Latin; as we say. He served a faithful service, He served as a soldier a strenuous soldier-service; when apparently we ought to have said, He served with a faithful service, he served as a soldier with a strenuous soldier-service. But such as the form of expression is, \"the love which Thou hast loved me;\" one similar to it is also used by the apostle, \"I have fought a good fight;\"[fn-35-P3596_1995607:26-nf] he does not say, in a good fight, which would be the more usual and perhaps correcter form of expression. ) But how else is the love wherewith the Father loved the Son in us also, but because we are His members and are loved in Him, since He is loved in the totality of His person, as both Head and members? Therefore He added, \"and I in them;\" as if saying, Since I am also in them. For in one sense He is in us as in His temple; but in another, because we are also Himself, seeing that, in accordance with His becoming man, that He might be our Head, we are His body.

Now if any one says that we need not direct men how or what they should teach, since the Holy Spirit makes them teachers, he may as well say that we need not pray, since our Lord says, \"Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask Him;\"[fn-53-P5379_2855324:25-nf] or that the Apostle Paul should not have given directions to Timothy and Titus as to how or what they should teach others. And these three apostolic epistles ought to be constantly before the eyes of every one who has obtained the position of a teacher in the Church. In the First Epistle to Timothy do we not read: \"These things command and teach?\"[fn-53-P5380_2855691:26-nf] What these things are, has been told previously. Do we not read there: \"Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father?\"[fn-53-P5381_2855834:27-nf] Is it not said in the Second Epistle: \"Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me?\"[fn-53-P5382_2855956:28-nf] And is he not be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth?\"[fn-53-P5383_2856038:29-nf] And in the same place: \"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine.\"[fn-53-P5384_2856199:30-nf] And so in the Epistle to Titus, does he not say that a bishop ought to \"hold fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers?\"[fn-53-P5385_2856427:31-nf] There, too, he says: \"But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: that the aged men be sober,\" and so on.[fn-53-P5386_2856560:32-nf] And there, too: \"These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee. Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers\"[fn-53-P5387_2856746:33-nf] and so on. What then are we to think? Does the apostle in any way contradict himself, when, though he says that men are made teachers by the operation of the Holy Spirit, he yet himself gives them directions how and what they should teach? Or are we to understand, that though the duty of men to teach even the teachers does not cease when the Holy Spirit is given, yet that neither is he who planteth anything, nor he who watereth, but God who giveth the increase?[fn-53-P5388_2857237:34-nf] Wherefore though holy men be our helpers, or even holy angels assist us, no one learns aright the things that pertain to life with God, until God makes him ready to learn from Himself, that God who is thus addressed in the psalm: \"Teach me to do Thy will; for Thou art my God.\"[fn-53-P5389_2857535:35-nf] And so the same apostle says to Timothy himself, speaking, of course, as teacher to disciple: \"But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.\"[fn-53-P5390_2857775:36-nf] For as the medicines which men apply to the bodies of their fellow-men are of no avail except God gives them virtue (who can heal without their aid, though they cannot without His), and yet they are applied; and if it be done from a sense of duty, it is esteemed a work of mercy or benevolence; so the aids of teaching, applied through the instrumentality of man, are of advantage to the soul only when God works to make them of advantage, who could give the gospel to man even without the help or agency of men.

We maintain, moreover, that what has been abolished in Christ is not carnem peccati, \"sinful flesh,\" but peccatum carnis, \"sin in the flesh,\"-not the material thing, but its condition;[fn-95-P9522_2612675:234-nf] not the substance, but its flaw;[fn-95-P9523_2612724:235-nf] and (this we aver) on the authority of the apostle, who says, \"He abolished sin in the flesh.\"[fn-95-P9524_2612834:236-nf] Now in another sentence he says that Christ was \"in the likeness of sinful flesh,\"[fn-95-P9525_2613643:237-nf] not, however, as if He had taken on Him \"the likeness of the flesh,\" in the sense of a semblance of body instead of its reality; but he means us to understand likeness to the flesh which sinned,[fn-95-P9526_2613867:238-nf] because the flesh of Christ, which committed no sin itself, resembled that which had sinned,-resembled it in its nature, but not in the corruption it received from Adam; whence we also affirm that there was in Christ the same flesh as that whose nature in man is sinful. In the flesh, therefore, we say that sin has been abolished, because in Christ that same flesh is maintained without sin, which in than was not maintained without sin. Now, it would not contribute to the purpose of Christ's abolishing sin in the flesh, if He did not abolish it in that flesh in which was the nature of sin, nor (would it conduce) to His glory. For surely it would have been no strange thing if He had removed the stain of sin in some better flesh, and one which should possess a different, even a sinless, nature! Then, you say, if He took our flesh, Christ's was a sinful one. Do not, however, fetter with mystery a sense which is quite intelligible.

Observe, therefore, what he says concerning these very thoughts. His words, when writing to the Corinthians, are: \"Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.\"[fn-60-P6021_2344357:91-nf] Then let us look at each several merit. \"I have fought the good fight.\" Well, now, I want to know by what power he fought. Was it by a power which he possessed of himself, or by strength given to him from above? It is impossible to suppose that so great a teacher as the apostle was ignorant of the law of God, which proclaims the following in Deuteronomy: \"Say not in thine heart, My own strength and energy of hand hath wrought for me this great power; but thou shall remember the Lord thy God, how it is He that giveth thee strength to acquire such power.\"[fn-60-P6022_2344937:92-nf] And what avails \"the good fight,\" unless followed by victory? And who gives the victory but He of whom the apostle says himself, \"Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ\"?[fn-60-P6023_2345164:93-nf] Then, in another passage, having quoted from the Psalm these words: \"Because for Thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for slaughter,\"[fn-60-P6024_2345348:94-nf] he went on to declare: \"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through Him that loved us.\"[fn-60-P6025_2345473:95-nf] Not by ourselves, therefore, is the victory accomplished, but by Him who hath loved us.

And to this the choirs of the monks bear witness, whom they have planted everywhere, clearing out not the habitable only, but even the uninhabitable land. And what is yet more marvellous, they did not this in fair conflict, but in the enduring of evil they accomplished it all. Since men actually had them in the midst, twelve unlearned persons, binding, scourging, dragging them about, and were not able to stop their mouths; but as it is impossible to bind the sunbeam, so also their tongue. And the reason was, \"it was not they\" themselves \"that spake,\" but the power of the Spirit. Thus for instance did Paul overcome Agrippa, and Nero, who surpassed all men in wickedness. \"For the Lord,\" saith he, \"stood with me, and strengthened me, and delivered me out of the mouth of the lion.\"[fn-34-P3437_1104275:16-nf] ","title":"Homily XXXIII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":4,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_45_scorpiace_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But how Paul, an apostle, from being a persecutor, who first of all shed the blood of the church, though afterwards he exchanged the sword for the pen, and turned the dagger into a plough, being first a ravening wolf of Benjamin, then himself supplying food as did Jacob,[fn-110-P11090_3148521:92-nf] -how he, (I say, ) speaks in favour of martyrdoms, now to be chosen by himself also, when, rejoicing over the Thessalonians, he says, \"So that we glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations, in which ye endure a manifestation of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be accounted worthy of His kingdom, for which ye also suffer![fn-110-P11091_3148948:93-nf] As also in his Epistle to the Romans: \"And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, being sure that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope maketh not ashamed.\"[fn-110-P11092_3149181:94-nf] And again: \"And if children, then heirs, heirs indeed of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\"[fn-110-P11093_3149485:95-nf] And therefore he afterward says: \"Who shall separate us from the love of God? Shall tribulation, or distress, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is written: For Thy sake we are killed all the day long; we have been counted as sheep for the slaughter, ) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through Him who loved us. For we are persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor power, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"[fn-110-P11094_3150053:96-nf] But further, in recounting his own sufferings to the Corinthians, he certainly decided that suffering must be borne: \"In labours, (he says, ) more abundant, in prisons very frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes, save one; thrice was I beaten with rods; once was I stoned,\"[fn-110-P11095_3150381:97-nf] and the rest. And if these severities will seem to be more grievous than martyrdoms, yet once more he says: \"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake.\"[fn-110-P11096_3150634:98-nf] He also says, in verses occurring in a previous part of the epistle: \"Our condition is such, that we are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; and are in need, but not in utter want; since we are harassed by persecutions, but not forsaken; it is such that we are east down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in our body the dying of Christ.\"[fn-110-P11097_3151009:99-nf] \"But though,\" says he, \"our outward man perisheth\"-the flesh doubtless, by the violence of persecutions-\"yet the inward man is renewed day by day\"-the soul, doubtless, by hope in the promises. \"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal\"-he is speaking of troubles; \"but the things which are not seen are eternal\"-he is promising rewards. But writing in bonds to the Thessalonians,[fn-110-P11098_3151615:100-nf] he certainly affirmed that they were blessed, since to them it had been given not only to believe on Christ, but also to suffer for His sake. \"Having,\" says he, \"the same conflier which ye both saw in me, and now hear to be in me.\"[fn-110-P11099_3151899:101-nf] \"For though I are offered upon the sacrifice, I joy and rejoice with you all; in like manner do ye also joy and rejoice with me.\" You see what he decides the bliss of martyrdom to be, in honour of which he is providing a festival of mutual joy. When at length he had come to be very near the attainment of his desire, greatly rejoicing in what he saw before him, he writes in these terms to Timothy: \"For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; there is laid up for me the crown which the Lord will give me on that day\"[fn-111-P11100_3152549:102-nf] -doubtless of his suffering. Admonition enough did he for his part also give in preceding passages: \"It is a faithful saying: For if we are dead with Christ, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us; if we believe not, yet He is faithful: He cannot deny Himself.\"[fn-111-P11101_3152903:103-nf] \"Be not thou, therefore, ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; \"[fn-111-P11102_3153013:104-nf] for he had said before: \"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.\"[fn-111-P11103_3153153:105-nf] For we suffer with power from love toward God, and with a sound mind, when we suffer for our blamelessness. But further, if He anywhere enjoins endurance, for what more than for sufferings is He providing it? If anywhere He tears men away from idolatry, what more than martyrdoms takes the lead, in tearing them away to its injury?","title":"Scorpiace.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_39_book_v_of_the_spirit_of_gluttony_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Would You like to hear a true athlete of Christ striving according to the rules and laws of the conflict? \"I,\" said he, \"so run, not as uncertainly; I so fight, not as one that beateth the air: but I chastise my body and bring it into subjection, lest by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a castaway.\"[fn-25-P2536_1055227:26-nf] You see how he made the chief part of the struggle depend upon himself, that is upon his flesh, as if on a most sure foundation, and placed the result of the battle simply in the chastisement of the flesh and the subjection of his body. \"I then so run not as uncertainly.\" He does not run uncertainly, because,[fn-25-P2537_1055562:27-nf] looking to the heavenly Jerusalem, he has a mark set, towards which his heart is swiftly directed without swerving.

Having sent for the rulers, through those he discourses to them (the Ephesians): but it is worthy of admiration, how finding himself under a necessity of saying certain great things about himself, he tries to make the least he can of it (peirata metriazein). \"Ye know.\" For just as Samuel, when about to deliver up the government to Saul says in their presence, \"Have I taken aught of your hands? Ye are witnesses, and God also\" (1 Sam. xii. 3, 1Sam. xii. 5); (so Paul here). David also, when disbelieved, says, \"I was with the flock keeping my father's sheep: and when the bear came, I scared her away with my hands\" (1 Sam. xvii. 34, xvii. 35): and Paul himself too says to the Corinthians \"I am become a fool; ye have compelled me.\" (2 Cor. xii. 11.) Nay, God Himself also does the same, not speaking of himself upon any and every occasion, but only when He is disbelieved, then He brings up His benefits. Accordingly, see what Paul does here: first he adduces their own testimony: that you may not imagine his words to be mere boasting, he calls the hearers themselves as witnesses of the things he says, since he was not likely to speak lies in their presence. This is the excellence of a teacher, to have for witnesses of his merits those who are his disciples. And what is wonderful, Not for one day nor for two, says he, have I continued doing this. He wishes to cheer them for the future, that they may bravely bear all things, both the parting from him, and the trials about to take place-just as it was in the case of Moses and Joshua. And see how he begins: \"How I have been with you the whole time, serving the Lord with all humility of mind.\" Observe, what most becomes rulers: \"hating pride\" (Exod. xviii. 21,LXX.), says (Moses): which (qualification) is especially in point for rulers, because to them there is (almost) a necessity of becoming arrogant. This (humility) is the groundwork of all that is good, as in fact Christ saith,[fn-16-P1659_1605099:1-nf] \"Blessed are the poor in spirit.\" (Matt. v. 3.) And (here) not simply, \"with humility of mind,\" but, \"with all humility.\" For there are many kinds of humility, in word and in action, towards rulers, and toward the ruled. Will you that I mention to you some kinds of humility? There are some who are lowly towards those who are lowly, and high towards the high: this is not the character of humility.[fn-16-P1660_1605549:2-nf] Some then are such. Then, that he may not seem to be arrogant, he lays a foundation beforehand, removing that suspicion: For, \"if, says he, I have acted `with all humility of mind,' it is not from arrogance that I say the things I say.\" Then for his gentleness, ever with much condescension making them his fellows. \"With you,\" he says, \"have I been, serving the Lord;\" he makes the good works common to them with himself: none of it his own peculiar. \"What?\" (you will say) \"why, against God could he possibly bear himself arrogantly?\" And yet there are many who do bear themselves arrogantly against God: but this man not even against his own disciples. This is the merit of a teacher, by his own achievements of virtue to form the character of his disciples. Then for his fortitude, upon which also he is very concise. \"With many tears,\" he says, \"and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews.\" Do you see that he grieves at their doings? But here too he seems to show how sympathizing he was: for he suffered for those who were going to perdition, for the doers themselves: what was done to himself, he even rejoiced at it; for he belonged to that band which \"rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for that Name (Acts v. 41): and again he says, \"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you\" (Col. i. 24): and again, \"For our light affliction, which is but for the moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\" (2 Cor. iv. 17). These things, however, he says, by way of making the least of his merits (metriazwn). But there he show his fortitude, not so much of daring, as of enduring: \"I,\" says he, \"have been evil entreated, but it was with you: and what is indeed the grievous part of the business, at the hands of Jews.\" Observe, he puts here both love and fortitude. Mark, here, I pray you, a character of teaching: \"I kept back nothing,\" he says, ungruding fulness, unshrinking promptness-\" of what was profitable unto you :\" because there were things which they did not need to learn. For as the hiding some things would have been like grudging, so the saying all things would be folly. This is why he adds, \"that was profitable unto you. But have showed you, and have taught you :\" have not only said, but also taught: not doing this either as a mere matter of form. For that this is what he means, observe what he says: \"publicly, and from house to house:\" thereby representing the exceeding toil, the great earnestness and endurance. \"Both Jews, and Greeks.\" Not (addressing myself) to you alone. \"Testifying:\" here, the boldness of speech: and that, even though we do no good, yet we must speak: for[fn-16-P1661_1608611:3-nf] this is the meaning of \"testifying,\" when we speak to those who do not pay attention: and so the word diamarturasqai is for the most part used. \"I call heaven and earth to witness\" (Deut. iv. 26), diamarturomai, Moses, says: and now Paul himself, Diamarturomenoj \"both to Jews and Greeks repentance toward God.\" What testifiest thou? That they should be careful about their manner of life: that they should repent, and draw near to God. \"Both to Jews and Greeks\"-for neither did the Jews know Him-both[fn-16-P1662_1609214:4-nf] by reason of their works, he says, \"repentance towards God,\" and, by reason that they knew not the Son, he adds, \"and faith in the Lord Jesus\" To what end, then, sayest thou these things? to what end dost thou put them in mind of them? What has come of it? hast thou anything to lay to their charge? Having first alarmed their feeling, then he adds, \"And now, behold, I go bound in the Spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the grace of God.\" (v. 22-24). Wherefore says he this? By way of preparing them to be always ready to meet dangers, whether seen or unseen, and in all things to obey the Spirit.[fn-16-P1663_1610572:5-nf] He shows that it is for great objects that he is led away from them. \"Save that the Holy Ghost,\" he says, me, \"in every city witnesseth to me saying\"-to show that he departs willingly; that (see Hom. xlv. p. 273) you may not imagine it any bond or necessity, when he says, \"bound in the Spirit-that in every city bonds and afflictions await me.\" Then also he adds this, \"I count not my life dear, until I shall have fulfilled my course and the ministry, which I received of the Lord Jesus.\" Until I shall have finished my course, says he, with joy. Do you mark how (clearly) these were the words not of one lamenting, but of one who forbore to make the most (of his troubles) (metriazontoj) of one who would instruct those (whom he addressed), and sympathize with them in the things which were befalling He says not, \"I grieve indeed,[fn-16-P1664_1612032:6-nf] but one must needs bear it:\" \"but,\" says he, \"of none of those things do I make account, neither do I have,\" i. e. account \"my life dear to me.\" Why this again? not to extol himself, but to teach them, as by the former words, humility, so by these, fortitude and boldness: \"I have it not precious,\" i.e. \"I love it not before this: I account it more precious to finish my course, to testify.\" And he says not, \"to preach,\" \"to teach\"-but what says he? \"to testify (diamarturasqai)-the Gospel of the grace of God.\" He is about to say something more uncomfortable (fortikwteron), namely, \"I am pure from the blood of all men (because on my part) there is nothing lacking:\" he is about to lay upon them the whole weight and burden: so he first mollifies their feelings by saying, \"And now behold I know that ye shall see my face no more.\" The consolation[fn-16-P1665_1613077:7-nf] is twofold: both that \"my face ye shall see no more,\" for in heart I am with you: and that it was not they alone (who should see him no more): for, \"ye shall see my face no more, ye all, among whom I have gone about preaching the Kingdom.\"[fn-16-P1666_1613777:8-nf] So that he may well (say), \"Wherefore I take you to record (read dio mart. for diamart.),-seeing I shall be with you no more-\" that I am pure from the blood of all men.\" (v. 26.) Do you mark how he terrifies them, and troubled and afflicted as their souls are, how hard he rubs them (epitribei)? But it was necessary. \"For I have not shunned,\" he says, \"to declare unto you all the counsel of God.\" (v. 27.) Why then, he who does not speak, has blood to answer for: that is, murder! Nothing could be more terrifying than this. He shows that they also, if they do it not, have blood to answer for. So, whereas he seems to be justifying himself, in fact he is terrifying them. \"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers (or, bishops) to feed the Church of God (see note 3), which He hath purchased with His own blood.\" (v. 28.) Do you mark? he enjoins them two things. Neither success in bringing others right of itself is any gain-for, I fear, he says, \"lest by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away\" (1 Cor. ix. 27); nor the being diligent for one's self alone. For such an one is selfish, and seeks his own good only, and is like to him who buried his talent. \"Take heed to yourselves:\" this he says, not because our own salvation is more precious than that of the flock, but because, when we take heed to ourselves, then the flock also is a gainer. \"In which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of God.\" See, it is from the Spirit ye have your ordination. This is one constraint: then he says, \"To feed the Church of the Lord.\"[fn-16-P1667_1616235:9-nf] Lo! another obligation: the Church is the Lord's.[fn-16-P1668_1616439:10-nf] And a third: \"which He hath purchased with His own blood.\" It shows[fn-16-P1669_1617136:11-nf] how precious the concern is; that the peril is about no small matters, seeing that even His own blood He spared not. He indeed, that he might reconcile those who were enemies, poured out even His blood: but thou, even when they are become thy friends, art not able to retain them. \"For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.\" (v. 29.) Again he engages (enistrefei) them from another quarter, from the things which should come after: as when he says, \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood. After my departing,\" he says, \"grievous wolves shall enter in among you\" (Eph. vi. 12); twofold the evil, both that he himself would not be present, and that others would assail them. \"Then why depart, if thou knowest this beforehand?\" The Spirit draws me, he says. Both \"wolves,\" and \"grievous, not sparing the flock;\" and what is worse, even \"from among your own selves:\" the grievous thing (this), when the war is moreover an intestine war. The matter is exceeding serious, for it is \"the Church of the Lord :\" great the peril for with blood He redeemed it: mighty the war, and twofold. \"Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.\" (v. 30.) \"How then? what comfort shall there be?\" \"Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.\" (v. 31.) See how many strong expressions are here: \"with tears,\" and \"night and day,\" and \"every one.\" For it was not that if he saw many,[fn-16-P1670_1618836:12-nf] then he came in (to the work), but even were it for a single soul, he was capable of doing everything (for that one soul). So it was, in fact, that he compacted them together (unekrothsen) (so firmly as he did). \"Enough done on my part: three years have I remained:\" they had establishing enough, he says; enough of roofing. \"With tears,\" he says. Seest thou that the tears were on this account? The bad man grieves not: grieve thou: perhaps he will grieve also. As, when the sick man sees his physician partaking of food, he also is incited to do the same: so likewise here, when he sees thee weeping, he is softened: he will be a good and great man.[fn-16-P1671_1619649:13-nf] ","title":"Homily XLIV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":4,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_51_homily_xliv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"See him, hasting to sail by, and yet not overlooking them, but taking order for all.

He wishes to cheer them for the future, that they may bravely bear all things, both the parting from him, and the trials about to take place-just as it was in the case of Moses and Joshua. And see how he begins: \"How I have been with you the whole time, serving the Lord with all humility of mind.\" Observe, what most becomes rulers: \"hating pride\" (Exod. xviii. 21,LXX.), says (Moses): which (qualification) is especially in point for rulers, because to them there is (almost) a necessity of becoming arrogant. This (humility) is the groundwork of all that is good, as in fact Christ saith,[fn-16-P1659_1605099:1-nf] \"Blessed are the poor in spirit.\" (Matt. v. 3.) And (here) not simply, \"with humility of mind,\" but, \"with all humility.\" For there are many kinds of humility, in word and in action, towards rulers, and toward the ruled. Will you that I mention to you some kinds of humility? There are some who are lowly towards those who are lowly, and high towards the high: this is not the character of humility.[fn-16-P1660_1605549:2-nf] Some then are such. Then, that he may not seem to be arrogant, he lays a foundation beforehand, removing that suspicion: For, \"if, says he, I have acted `with all humility of mind,' it is not from arrogance that I say the things I say.\" Then for his gentleness, ever with much condescension making them his fellows. \"With you,\" he says, \"have I been, serving the Lord;\" he makes the good works common to them with himself: none of it his own peculiar. \"What?\" (you will say) \"why, against God could he possibly bear himself arrogantly?\" And yet there are many who do bear themselves arrogantly against God: but this man not even against his own disciples. This is the merit of a teacher, by his own achievements of virtue to form the character of his disciples. Then for his fortitude, upon which also he is very concise. \"With many tears,\" he says, \"and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews.\" Do you see that he grieves at their doings? But here too he seems to show how sympathizing he was: for he suffered for those who were going to perdition, for the doers themselves: what was done to himself, he even rejoiced at it; for he belonged to that band which \"rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for that Name (Acts v. 41): and again he says, \"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you\" (Col. i. 24): and again, \"For our light affliction, which is but for the moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\" (2 Cor. iv. 17). These things, however, he says, by way of making the least of his merits (metriazwn). But there he show his fortitude, not so much of daring, as of enduring: \"I,\" says he, \"have been evil entreated, but it was with you: and what is indeed the grievous part of the business, at the hands of Jews.\" Observe, he puts here both love and fortitude. Mark, here, I pray you, a character of teaching: \"I kept back nothing,\" he says, ungruding fulness, unshrinking promptness-\" of what was profitable unto you :\" because there were things which they did not need to learn. For as the hiding some things would have been like grudging, so the saying all things would be folly. This is why he adds, \"that was profitable unto you. But have showed you, and have taught you :\" have not only said, but also taught: not doing this either as a mere matter of form. For that this is what he means, observe what he says: \"publicly, and from house to house:\" thereby representing the exceeding toil, the great earnestness and endurance. \"Both Jews, and Greeks.\" Not (addressing myself) to you alone. \"Testifying:\" here, the boldness of speech: and that, even though we do no good, yet we must speak: for[fn-16-P1661_1608611:3-nf] this is the meaning of \"testifying,\" when we speak to those who do not pay attention: and so the word diamarturasqai is for the most part used. \"I call heaven and earth to witness\" (Deut. iv. 26), diamarturomai, Moses, says: and now Paul himself, Diamarturomenoj \"both to Jews and Greeks repentance toward God.\" What testifiest thou? That they should be careful about their manner of life: that they should repent, and draw near to God. \"Both to Jews and Greeks\"-for neither did the Jews know Him-both[fn-16-P1662_1609214:4-nf] by reason of their works, he says, \"repentance towards God,\" and, by reason that they knew not the Son, he adds, \"and faith in the Lord Jesus\" To what end, then, sayest thou these things? to what end dost thou put them in mind of them? What has come of it? hast thou anything to lay to their charge? Having first alarmed their feeling, then he adds, \"And now, behold, I go bound in the Spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the grace of God.\" (v. 22-24). Wherefore says he this? By way of preparing them to be always ready to meet dangers, whether seen or unseen, and in all things to obey the Spirit.[fn-16-P1663_1610572:5-nf] He shows that it is for great objects that he is led away from them. \"Save that the Holy Ghost,\" he says, me, \"in every city witnesseth to me saying\"-to show that he departs willingly; that (see Hom. xlv. p. 273) you may not imagine it any bond or necessity, when he says, \"bound in the Spirit-that in every city bonds and afflictions await me.\" Then also he adds this, \"I count not my life dear, until I shall have fulfilled my course and the ministry, which I received of the Lord Jesus.\" Until I shall have finished my course, says he, with joy. Do you mark how (clearly) these were the words not of one lamenting, but of one who forbore to make the most (of his troubles) (metriazontoj) of one who would instruct those (whom he addressed), and sympathize with them in the things which were befalling He says not, \"I grieve indeed,[fn-16-P1664_1612032:6-nf] but one must needs bear it:\" \"but,\" says he, \"of none of those things do I make account, neither do I have,\" i. e. account \"my life dear to me.\" Why this again? not to extol himself, but to teach them, as by the former words, humility, so by these, fortitude and boldness: \"I have it not precious,\" i.e. \"I love it not before this: I account it more precious to finish my course, to testify.\" And he says not, \"to preach,\" \"to teach\"-but what says he? \"to testify (diamarturasqai)-the Gospel of the grace of God.\" He is about to say something more uncomfortable (fortikwteron), namely, \"I am pure from the blood of all men (because on my part) there is nothing lacking:\" he is about to lay upon them the whole weight and burden: so he first mollifies their feelings by saying, \"And now behold I know that ye shall see my face no more.\" The consolation[fn-16-P1665_1613077:7-nf] is twofold: both that \"my face ye shall see no more,\" for in heart I am with you: and that it was not they alone (who should see him no more): for, \"ye shall see my face no more, ye all, among whom I have gone about preaching the Kingdom.\"[fn-16-P1666_1613777:8-nf] So that he may well (say), \"Wherefore I take you to record (read dio mart. for diamart.),-seeing I shall be with you no more-\" that I am pure from the blood of all men.\" (v. 26.) Do you mark how he terrifies them, and troubled and afflicted as their souls are, how hard he rubs them (epitribei)? But it was necessary. \"For I have not shunned,\" he says, \"to declare unto you all the counsel of God.\" (v. 27.) Why then, he who does not speak, has blood to answer for: that is, murder! Nothing could be more terrifying than this. He shows that they also, if they do it not, have blood to answer for. So, whereas he seems to be justifying himself, in fact he is terrifying them. \"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers (or, bishops) to feed the Church of God (see note 3), which He hath purchased with His own blood.\" (v. 28.) Do you mark? he enjoins them two things. Neither success in bringing others right of itself is any gain-for, I fear, he says, \"lest by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away\" (1 Cor. ix. 27); nor the being diligent for one's self alone. For such an one is selfish, and seeks his own good only, and is like to him who buried his talent. \"Take heed to yourselves:\" this he says, not because our own salvation is more precious than that of the flock, but because, when we take heed to ourselves, then the flock also is a gainer. \"In which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of God.\" See, it is from the Spirit ye have your ordination. This is one constraint: then he says, \"To feed the Church of the Lord.\"[fn-16-P1667_1616235:9-nf] Lo! another obligation: the Church is the Lord's.[fn-16-P1668_1616439:10-nf] And a third: \"which He hath purchased with His own blood.\" It shows[fn-16-P1669_1617136:11-nf] how precious the concern is; that the peril is about no small matters, seeing that even His own blood He spared not. He indeed, that he might reconcile those who were enemies, poured out even His blood: but thou, even when they are become thy friends, art not able to retain them. \"For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.\" (v. 29.) Again he engages (enistrefei) them from another quarter, from the things which should come after: as when he says, \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood. After my departing,\" he says, \"grievous wolves shall enter in among you\" (Eph. vi. 12); twofold the evil, both that he himself would not be present, and that others would assail them. \"Then why depart, if thou knowest this beforehand?\" The Spirit draws me, he says. Both \"wolves,\" and \"grievous, not sparing the flock;\" and what is worse, even \"from among your own selves:\" the grievous thing (this), when the war is moreover an intestine war. The matter is exceeding serious, for it is \"the Church of the Lord :\" great the peril for with blood He redeemed it: mighty the war, and twofold. \"Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.\" (v. 30.) \"How then? what comfort shall there be?\" \"Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.\" (v. 31.) See how many strong expressions are here: \"with tears,\" and \"night and day,\" and \"every one.\" For it was not that if he saw many,[fn-16-P1670_1618836:12-nf] then he came in (to the work), but even were it for a single soul, he was capable of doing everything (for that one soul). So it was, in fact, that he compacted them together (unekrothsen) (so firmly as he did). \"Enough done on my part: three years have I remained:\" they had establishing enough, he says; enough of roofing. \"With tears,\" he says. Seest thou that the tears were on this account? The bad man grieves not: grieve thou: perhaps he will grieve also. As, when the sick man sees his physician partaking of food, he also is incited to do the same: so likewise here, when he sees thee weeping, he is softened: he will be a good and great man.[fn-16-P1671_1619649:13-nf] ","title":"Homily XLIV.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":4,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_59_book_ii","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"171","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2. Moreover we must not keep silence respecting Paul, but demand from them after the type of what Aeon that apostle has been handed down to us, unless perchance [they affirm that he is a representative] of the Saviour compounded of them [all], who derived his being from the collected gifts of the whole, and whom they term All Things, as having been formed out of them all. Respecting this being the poet Hesiod has strikingly expressed himself, styling him Pandora-that is, \"The gift of all\"-for this reason, that the best gift in the possession of all was centred in him. In describing these gifts the following account is given: Hermes (so[fn-70-P7001_1800890:126-nf] he is called in the Greek language), Ai9muli/ou;[fn-70-P7002_1801015:127-nf] te lo/gouj kai\\ e0pi/klopon h\\qoj au0tou=j Ka/tqeto (or to express this in the English[fn-70-P7003_1801221:128-nf] language), \"implanted words of fraud and deceit in their minds, and thievish habits,\" for the purpose of leading foolish men astray, that such should believe their falsehoods.

But that this Luke was inseparable from Paul, and his fellow-labourer in the Gospel, he himself clearly evinces, not as a matter of boasting, but as bound to do so by the truth itself. For he says that when Barnabas, and John who was called Mark, had parted company from Paul, and sailed to Cyprus, \"we came to Troas; \"[fn-76-P7622_2066992:232-nf] and when Paul had beheld in a dream a man of Macedonia, saying, \"Come into Macedonia, Paul, and help us,\" \"immediately,\" he says, \"we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, understanding that the Lord had called us to preach the Gospel unto them. Therefore, sailing from Troas, we directed our ship's course towards Samothracia.\" And then he carefully indicates all the rest of their journey as far as Philippi, and how they delivered their first address: \"for, sitting down,\" he says, \"we spake unto the women who had assembled; \"[fn-76-P7623_2067544:233-nf] and certain believed, even a great many. And again does he say, \"But we sailed from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to Troas, where we abode seven days.\"[fn-76-P7624_2067741:234-nf] And all the remaining [details] of his course with Paul he recounts, indicating with all diligence both places, and cities, and number of days, until they went up to Jerusalem; and what befell Paul there,[fn-76-P7625_2067968:235-nf] how he was sent to Rome in bonds; the name of the centurion who took him in charge;[fn-76-P7626_2068069:236-nf] and the signs of the ships, and how they made shipwreck;[fn-76-P7627_2068145:237-nf] and the island upon which they escaped, and how they received kindness there, Paul healing the chief man of that island; and how they sailed from thence to Puteoli, and from that arrived at Rome; and for what period they sojourned at Rome. As Luke was present at all these occurrences, he carefully noted them down in writing, so that he cannot be convicted of falsehood or boastfulness, because all these [particulars] proved both that he was senior to all those who now teach otherwise, and that he was not ignorant of the truth. That he was not merely a follower, but also a fellow-labourer of the apostles, but especially of Paul, Paul has himself declared also in the Epistles, saying: \"Demas hath forsaken me, ... and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me.\"[fn-76-P7628_2068986:238-nf] From this he shows that he was always attached to and inseparable from him.

Nor can this question be solved except we acknowledge, that there are some sins in brethren that are worse than the sin of enemies in persecuting. That \"brethren\" mean Christians, may be proved by many texts of Holy Writ; the plainest, however, is that of the apostle which he puts thus: \"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother.\"[fn-47-P4705_2527848:64-nf] For he has not added our; but thought it plain enough, when by the term brother he spake of the Christian that should have an unbelieving wife. And accordingly he says just afterwards, \"But if the unbelieving depart, let her depart: but a brother or sister is not put under servitude in a matter of this sort.\" The \"sin,\" therefore, of a brother, \"unto death,\" I suppose to be when, after the acknowledging of God through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, one fights against the brotherhood, and is set on by the fire-brands of hatred[fn-47-P4706_2528408:65-nf] against the very grace through which he was reconciled to God.[fn-47-P4707_2528496:66-nf] But \"a sin not unto death\" is when a person, not having alienated his love from his brother. yet through some infirmity of mind may have failed to exhibit the due offices of brotherhood. Wherefore, on the one hand, the Lord on the cross said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,\"[fn-47-P4708_2528813:67-nf] since they had not yet, by being made partakers of the grace of the Holy Spirit, entered into the fellowship of holy brotherhood; and blessed Stephen in the Acts of the Apostles prays for them who are stoning him;[fn-47-P4709_2529460:68-nf] because they had not yet believed Christ, and were not fighting against that grace of communion. On the other hand, the apostle Paul does not pray for Alexander, and the reason I suppose, is, that this man was a brother, and had sinned \"unto death,\" i.e. by opposing the brotherhood in a spirit of hatred.[fn-47-P4710_2529788:69-nf] Whereas for such as had not broken off the bonds of love, but had given way through fear, he prays that they may be forgiven. For so he says: \"Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.\"[fn-47-P4711_2530107:70-nf] Then he subjoins for whom he prays, saying, \"At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.\" This difference of sins it is that distinguishes Judas with his treason from Peter with his denial. Not that to him who repenteth there is to be no forgiveness: lest we go against that sentence of the Lord, in which He commands always to forgive the brother who asks his brother's forgiveness:[fn-47-P4712_2531135:71-nf] but that the mischief of that sin is, that the man cannot submit to the humiliation of begging for pardon, even when he is forced by his evil conscience both to acknowledge and to publish his sin. For when Judas had said, \"I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood,\"[fn-47-P4713_2531442:72-nf] he went and hanged himself in desperation, rather than pray for forgiveness in humiliation. Wherefore it makes a great difference, what sort of repentance God forgives. For many are much quicker than others to confess that they have sinned, and are angry with themselves in such sort that they vehemently wish they had not sinned, while yet they cannot lay down their pride, and submit to have the heart humbled and broken so as to implore pardon: a state of mind which one may well believe to be, for the greatness of their sin, a part of their already begun damnation.","title":"Homily X.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_52_letter_xl_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"3.

But as I know thee weIl, thou dost wish to have both thine own and another's. Thou wilt commit fraud that thou mayest have what is another's; submit then to robbery that thou mayest lose thine own. Thou dost not wish to seek thine own, but then thou takest away what is another's. Now this if thou do, thou doest not well. Hear and listen, thou covetous one: the Apostle explains to thee in another place more clearly this that he said, \"Let no man seek his own, but another's.\" He says of himself, \"Not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.\"[fn-43-P4327_1837525:23-nf] This Peter understood not yet when he desired to live on the mount with Christ. He was reserving this for thee, Peter, after death. But now He saith Himself, \"Come down, to labour in the earth; in the earth to serve, to be despised, and crucified in the earth. The Life came down, that He might be slain; the Bread came down, that He might hunger; the Way came down, that life might be wearied in the way; the Fountain came down, that He might thirst; and dost thou refuse to labour? `Seek not thine own.' Have charity, preach the truth; so shall thou come to eternity, where thou shalt find security.\" ","title":"Sermon XXVIII. [LXXVII.

Augustin answered: We do not make a pretense of peace by wickedness, but we preach peace out of the gospel; and if you were at peace with it, you would be at peace also with us. The risen Lord, when presenting Himself to the disciples, not only that they should gaze on Him with their eyes, but also that they should handle Him with their hands, began His discourse to them with the words, \"Peace be unto you.\" And how this peace itself was to be maintained, He disclosed to them in the words which followed. For \"then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus is it written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\"[fn-52-P5201_2524828:197-nf] If you will keep peace with these words, you will not be at variance with us. For if we seek unity by war, our war could not be praised in more glorious terms, seeing that it is written, \"Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.\"[fn-52-P5202_2525087:198-nf] And again it is written, \"No man ever yet hated his own flesh.\"[fn-52-P5203_2525174:199-nf] And yet the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.[fn-52-P5204_2525273:200-nf] But if no man ever yet hated his own flesh, and yet a man lusteth against his own flesh, here you have unity sought by war, that the body, being subject to correction, may be brought under submission. But what the spirit does against the flesh, waging war with it, not in hatred but in love, this those who are spiritual do against those who are carnal, that they may do towards them what they do towards themselves, because they love their neighbors as neighbors indeed. But the war which the spiritual wage is that correction which is in love: their sword is the word of God. To such a war they are aroused by the trumpet of the apostle sounding with a mighty force: \"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine.\"[fn-52-P5205_2526081:201-nf] See then that we act not with the sword, but with the word. But you answer what is not true, while you accuse us falsely. You do not correct your own faults, and you bring against us those of other men. Christ bears true witness concerning the nations of the earth; you, in opposition to Christ, bear false witness against the nations of the earth. If we were to believe you rather than Christ, you would call us peacemakers; because we believe Christ rather than you, we are said to make a pretense of peace by our wickedness. And while you say and do such things as this, you have the further impudence to quote the words, \"Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":4,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_55_vii_first_conference_of_abbot_serenus_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"100","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"But our belief is that they undertake this struggle not without effort on their part.

For the Patriarch Jacob who had before fled from Esau, feared not death when it came, but at that very time blessed the Patriarchs, each according to his deserts. And the great Moses, who previously had hid himself from Pharaoh, and had withdrawn into Midian for fear of him, when he received the commandment, `Return into Egypt[fn-44-P4469_1838427:83-nf] ,' feared not to do so. And again, when he was bidden to go up into the mountain Abarim[fn-44-P4470_1838538:84-nf] and die, he delayed not through cowardice, but even joyfully proceeded thither. And David, who had before fled from Saul, feared not to risk his life in war in defence of his people; but having the choice of death or of flight set before him, when he might have fled and lived, he wisely preferred death. And the great Elijah, who had at a former time hid himself from Jezebel, shewed no cowardice when he was commanded by the Spirit to meet Ahab, and to reprove Ahaziah. And Peter, who had hid himself for fear of the Jews, and the Apostle Paul who was let down in a basket, and fled, when they were told, `Ye must bear witness at Rome[fn-44-P4471_1839197:85-nf] ,' deferred not the journey; yea, rather, they departed rejoicing[fn-44-P4472_1839471:86-nf] ; the one as hastening to meet his friends, received his death with exultation; and the other shrunk not from the time when it came, but gloried in it, saying, `For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand[fn-44-P4473_1839737:87-nf] .'","title":"Defence of His Flight","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":4,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_71_homily_lxv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And if He hath expressed these things somewhat obscurely, marvel not.

I gladly rejoice and am thankful, most brave and blessed brethren, at hearing of your faith and virtue, wherein the Church, our Mother, glories. Lately, indeed, she gloried, when, in consequence of an enduring confession, that punishment was undergone which drove the confessors of Christ into exile; yet the present confession is so much the more illustrious and greater in honour as it is braver in suffering. The combat has increased, and the glory of the combatants has increased also. Nor were you kept back from the struggle by fear of tortures, but by the very tortures themselves you were more and more stimulated to the conflict; bravely and firmly you have returned with ready devotion, to contend in the extremest contest. Of you I find that some are already crowned, while some are even now within reach of the crown of victory; but all whom the danger has shut up in a glorious company are animated to carry on the struggle with an equal and common warmth of virtue, as it behoves the soldiers of Christ in the divine camp: that no allurements may deceive the incorruptible stedfastness of your faith, no threats terrify you, no sufferings or tortures overcome you, because \"greater is He that is in us, than he that is in the world; \"[fn-49-P4900_1484451:2-nf] nor is the earthly punishment able to do more towards casting down, than is the divine protection towards lifting up. This truth is proved by the glorious struggle of the brethren, who, having become leaders to the rest in overcoming their tortures, afforded an example of virtue and faith, contending in the strife, until the strife yielded, being overcome. With what praises can I commend you, most courageous brethren? With what vocal proclamation can I extol the strength of your heart and the perseverance of your faith? You have borne the sharpest examination by torture, even unto the glorious consummation, and have not yielded to sufferings, but rather the sufferings have given way to you. The end of torments, which the tortures themselves did not give, the crown has given. The examination by torture waxing severer, continued for a long time to this result, not to overthrow the stedfast faith, but to send the men of God more quickly to the Lord. The multitude of those who were present saw with admiration the heavenly contest,-the contest of God, the spiritual contest, the battle of Christ,-saw that His servants stood with free voice, with unyielding mind, with divine virtue-bare, indeed, of weapons of this world, but believing and armed with the weapons of faith. The tortured stood more brave than the torturers; and the limbs, beaten and torn as they were, overcame the hooks that bent and tore them. The scourge, often repeated with all its rage, could not conquer invincible faith, even although the membrane which enclosed the entrails were broken, and it was no longer the limbs but the wounds of the servants of God that were tortured. Blood was flowing which might quench the blaze of persecution, which might subdue the flames of Gehenna with its glorious gore.[fn-49-P4901_1486260:3-nf] Oh, what a spectacle was that to the Lord,-how sublime, how great, how acceptable to the eyes of God in the allegiance and devotion of His soldiers! As it is written in the Psalms, when the Holy Spirit at once speaks to us and warns us: \"Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.\"[fn-49-P4902_1486804:4-nf] Precious is the death which has bought immortality at the cost of its blood, which has received the crown from the consummation of its virtues. How did Christ rejoice therein! How willingly did He both fight and conquer in such servants of His, as the protector of their faith, and giving to believers as much as he who taketh believes that he receives! He was present at His own contest; He lifted up, strengthened, animated the champions and assertors of His name. And He who once conquered death on our behalf, always conquers it in us. \"When they,\" says He, \"deliver you up, take no thought what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.\"[fn-49-P4903_1487580:5-nf] The present struggle has afforded a proof of this saying. A voice filled with the Holy Spirit broke forth from the martyr's mouth when the most blessed Mappalicus said to the proconsul in the midst of his torments, \"You shall see a contest to-morrow.\" And that which he said with the testimony of virtue and faith, the Lord fulfilled. A heavenly contest was exhibited, and the servant of God was crowned ill the struggle of the promised fight. This is the contest which the prophet Isaiah of old predicted, saying, \"It shall be no light contest for you with men, since God appoints the struggle.\"[fn-49-P4904_1488197:6-nf] And in order to show what this struggle would be, he added the words, \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and ye shall call His name Emmanuel.\"[fn-49-P4905_1488390:7-nf] This is the struggle of our faith in which we engage, in which we conquer, in which we are crowned. This is the struggle which the blessed Apostle Paul has shown to us, in which it behoves us to run and to attain the crown of glory. \"Do ye not know,\" says he, \"that they which run in a race, run all indeed, but one receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain.\" \"Now they do it that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.\"[fn-49-P4906_1488857:8-nf] Moreover, setting forth his own struggle, and declaring that he himself should soon be a sacrifice for the Lord's sake, he says, \"I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my assumption is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.\"[fn-49-P4907_1489354:9-nf] This fight, therefore, predicted of old by the prophets, begun by the Lord, waged by the apostles, Mappalicus promised again to the proconsul in his own name and that of his colleagues. Nor did the faithful voice deceive in his promise; he exhibited the fight to which he had pledged himself, and he received the reward which he deserved. I not only beseech but exhort the rest of you, that you all should follow that martyr now most blessed, and the other partners of that engagement,-soldiers and comrades, stedfast in faith, patient in suffering, victors in tortures,-that those who are united at once by the bond of confession, and the entertainment of a dungeon, may also be united in the consummation of their virtue and a celestial crown; that you by your joy may dry the tears of our Mother, the Church, who mourns over the wreck and death of very many; and that you may confirm, by the provocation of your example, the stedfastness of others who stand also. If the battle shall call you out, if the day of your contest shall come engage bravely, fight with constancy, as knowing that you are fighting under the eyes of a present Lord, that you are attaining by the confession of His name to His own glory; who is not such a one as that He only looks on His servants, but He Himself also wrestles in us, Himself is engaged,-Himself also in the struggles of our conflict not only crowns, but is crowned. But if before the day of your contest, of the mercy of God, peace shall supervene, let there still remain to you the sound will and the glorious conscience.[fn-49-P4908_1490942:10-nf] Nor let any one of you be saddened as if he were inferior to those who before you have suffered tortures, have overcome the world and trodden it under foot, and so have come to the Lord by a glorious road. For the Lord is the \"searcher out of the reins and the hearts.\"[fn-49-P4909_1491389:11-nf] He looks through secret things, and beholds that which is concealed. In order to merit the crown from Him, His own testimony alone is sufficient, who will judge us. Therefore, beloved brethren, either case is equally lofty and illustrious,-the former more secure, to wit, to hasten to the Lord with the consummation of our victory,-the latter more joyous; a leave of absence, after glory, being received to flourish in the praises of the Church. O blessed Church of ours, which the honour of the divine condescension illuminates, Which in our own times the glorious blood of martyrs renders illustrious! She was white before in the works of the brethren; now she has become purple in the blood of the martyrs. Among her flowers are wanting neither roses nor lilies. Now let each one strive for the largest dignity of either honour. Let them receive crowns, either white, as of labours, or of purple, as of suffering. In the heavenly camp both peace and strife have their own flowers, with which the soldier of Christ may be crowned for glory. I bid you, most brave and beloved brethren, always heartily farewell in the Lord; and have me in remembrance.Fare ye well.","title":"Epistle VIII.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_72_letter_i_for_329_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Come, my beloved, the season calls us to keep the feast.

And in all these things they entangle themselves in an inextricable maze, not listening to the Apostle when he says. \"See that no one deceive you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ; for in Him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, and in Him ye are made full, who is the head of every principality and power[fn-8-P812_171458:23-nf] .\" And again: \"let no man beguile you by a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, treading on things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by the senses of his flesh, not holding fast the Head from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and bands, increaseth withthe increase of God[fn-8-P813_171802:24-nf] .\" What then is the use of admitting into the heart what the law has not taught, prophecy has not sung, the truth of the Gospel has not proclaimed, the Apostles' teaching has not handed down?

These things, moreover. he has said with the view of showing us that all others who may come alter him will be false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed, like an angel of light. What great thing therefore is it, if his ministers also be transformed into the ministers of righteousness?-whose end shall be according to their works.[fn-36-P3621_1005288:348-nf] He indicates, further, what manner of men these were, and points out by whom they were being circumvented. And when the Galatians are minded to turn away from the Gospel, he says to them: \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you unto another gospel: which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would turn you away[fn-36-P3622_1005837:349-nf] from the Gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which has been delivered to you, let him be accursed.\"[fn-36-P3623_1006023:350-nf] And again he says: \"To me, who am the least of all the apostles,[fn-36-P3624_1006108:351-nf] is this grace given; \"[fn-36-P3625_1006165:352-nf] and,\" I fill up that which was behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-36-P3626_1006266:353-nf] And once more, in another place, he declares of himself that he was a minister of Christ more than all others,[fn-36-P3627_1006396:354-nf] as though after him none other was to be looked for at all; for he enjoins that not even an angel from heaven is thus to be received. And how, then, shall we credit the professions of this Manes, who comes from Persis,[fn-36-P3628_1006637:355-nf] and declares himself to be the Paraclete? By this very thing, indeed, I rather recognise in him one of those men who transform themselves, and of whom the Apostle Paul, that elect vessel, has given us very clear indication when he says: \"Now in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; for-bidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received[fn-36-P3629_1007318:356-nf] with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.\"[fn-36-P3630_1007567:357-nf] The Spirit in the evangelist Matthew is also careful to give note of these words of our Lord Jesus Christ: \"Take heed that no man deceive you: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. But if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false apostles,[fn-36-P3631_1007948:358-nf] and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. If they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: if they shall say, Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.\"[fn-36-P3632_1008388:359-nf] And yet, after all these directions, this man, who has neither sign nor portent of any kind to show, who has no affinity to exhibit, who never even had a place among the number of the disciples, who never was a follower of our departed Lord, in whose inheritance we rejoice,-this man, I say, although he never stood by our Lord in His weakness, and although he never came forward as a witness of His testament, yea rather, although he never came even within the acquaintance of those who ministered to Him in His sickness, and, in fine, although he obtains the testimony of no person whatsoever, desires us to believe this profession which he makes of being the Paraclete; whereas, even were you to do signs and wonders, we would still have to reckon you a false Christ, and a false prophet, according to the Scriptures. And therefore it is well for us to act with the greater caution, in accordance with the warning which the sainted apostle gives us, when, in the epistle which he wrote to the Colossians, he speaks in the following terms: \"Continue in the faith grounded and rooted,[fn-36-P3633_1009506:360-nf] and not to be moved away[fn-36-P3634_1009548:361-nf] from the hope of the Gospel, which we have heard,[fn-36-P3635_1009616:362-nf] and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven.\"[fn-36-P3636_1009699:363-nf] And again: \"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him; rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware lest any one spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead.\"[fn-36-P3637_1010095:364-nf] And after all these matters have been thus carefully set forth, the blessed apostle, like a father speaking to his children, adds the following words, which serve as a sort of seal to his testament: \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,[fn-36-P3638_1010371:365-nf] I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.\"[fn-36-P3639_1010695:366-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_222_letter_cciv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"4.

But [there are bishops; let appeal be made to them. There is a clergy in each of God's dioceses;[fn-50-P5004_1557477:16-nf] let the most eminent be assembled. Let whoso will, speak freely, that I may have to deal with a charge, not a slander.] Let my secret wickedness be brought into full view; let me no longer be hated, but admonished as a brother. It is more just that we sinners should be pitied by the blessed and the sinless, than that we should be treated angrily.","title":"Letter CCIV","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":4,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_40_letter_xxii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"3.
