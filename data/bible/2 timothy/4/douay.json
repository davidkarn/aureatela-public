{"verses":["I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the\nliving and the dead, by his coming and his kingdom:","Preach the word:  be instant in season, out of season:  reprove,\nentreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.","For there shall be a time when they will not endure sound doctrine\nbut, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves\nteachers having itching ears:","And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will\nbe turned unto fables.","But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an\nevangelist, fulfil thy ministry.  Be sober.","For I am even now ready to be sacrificed:  and the time of my\ndissolution is at hand.","I have fought a good fight:  I have finished my course:  I have kept\nthe faith.","As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice which\nthe Lord the just judge will render to me in that day:  and not only to\nme, but to them also that love his coming.
