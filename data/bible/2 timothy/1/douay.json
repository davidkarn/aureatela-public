{"verses":["Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, according to\nthe promise of life which is in Christ Jesus:","To Timothy, my dearly beloved son.  Grace, mercy and peace, from\nGod the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord.","I give thanks to God, whom I serve from my forefathers, with a\npure conscience, that without ceasing I have a remembrance of thee in\nmy prayers, night and day.","Desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be\nfilled with joy:","Calling to mind that faith which is in thee unfeigned, which also\ndwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice, and I am\ncertain that in thee also.","For which cause I admonish thee that thou stir up the grace of God\nwhich is in thee by the imposition of my hands.","For God hath not given us the spirit of fear:  but of power and of\nlove and of sobriety.","Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of\nme his prisoner:  but labour with the gospel, according to the power of\nGod.","Who hath delivered us and called us by his holy calling, not\naccording to our own works, but according to his own purpose and grace,\nwhich was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the world:","But is now made manifest by the illumination of our Saviour Jesus\nChrist, who hath destroyed death and hath brought to light life and\nincorruption by the gospel.","Wherein I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and teacher of\nthe Gentiles.","For which cause, I also suffer these things:  but I am not\nashamed.  For I know whom I have believed and I am certain that he is\nable to keep that which I have committed unto him, against that day.","Hold the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me:  in\nfaith and in the love which is in Christ Jesus.","Keep the good thing committed to thy trust by the Holy Ghost who\ndwelleth in us.","Thou knowest this, that all they who are in Asia are turned away\nfrom me:  of whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes.","The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus:  because he hath\noften refreshed me and hath not been ashamed of my chain:","But when he was come to Rome, he carefully sought me and found\nme.","The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day.\nAnd in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou very well\nknowest."]}
