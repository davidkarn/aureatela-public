{"verses":["Queen Esther also, fearing the danger that was at hand, had\nrecourse to the Lord.","And when she had laid away her royal apparel, she put on garments\nsuitable for weeping and mourning:  instead of divers precious\nointments, she covered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled\nher body with fasts:  and all the places in which before she was\naccustomed to rejoice, she filled with her torn hair.","And she prayed to the Lord the God of Israel, saying:  O my Lord,\nwho alone art our king, help me a desolate woman, and who have no other\nhelper but thee.","My danger is in my hands.","I have heard of my father that thou, O Lord, didst take Israel\nfrom among all nations, and our fathers from all their predecessors, to\npossess them as an everlasting inheritance, and thou hast done to them\nas thou hast promised.","We have sinned in thy sight, and therefore thou hast delivered us\ninto the hands of our enemies:","For we have worshipped their gods.  Thou art just, O Lord.","And now they are not content to oppress us with most hard\nbondage, but attributing the strength of their hands to the power of\ntheir idols.","They design to change thy promises, and destroy thy inheritance,\nand shut the mouths of them that praise thee, and extinguish the glory\nof thy temple and altar,","That they may open the mouths of Gentiles, and praise the\nstrength of idols, and magnify for ever a carnal king.","Give not, O Lord, thy sceptre to them that are not, lest they\nlaugh at our ruin:  but turn their counsel upon themselves, and destroy\nhim that hath begun to rage against us.","Remember, O Lord, and shew thyself to us in the time of our\ntribulation, and give me boldness, O Lord, king of gods, and of all\npower:","Give me a well ordered speech in my mouth in the presence of the\nlion, and turn his heart to the hatred of our enemy, that both he\nhimself may perish, and the rest that consent to him.","But deliver us by thy hand, and help me, who have no other\nhelper, but thee, O Lord, who hast the knowledge of all things.","And thou knowest that I hate the glory of the wicked, and abhor\nthe bed of the uncircumcised, and of every stranger.","Thou knowest my necessity, that I abominate the sign of my pride\nand glory, which is upon my head in the days of my public appearance,\nand detest it as a menstruous rag, and wear it not in the days of my\nsilence,","And that I have not eaten at Aman's table, nor hath the king's\nbanquet pleased me, and that I have not drunk the wine of the drink\nofferings:","And that thy handmaid hath never rejoiced, since I was brought\nhither unto this day but in thee, O Lord, the God of Abraham.","O God, who art mighty above all, hear the voice of them, that\nhave no other hope, and deliver us from the hand of the wicked, and\ndeliver me from my fear."]}
