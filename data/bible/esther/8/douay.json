{"verses":["On that day king Assuerus gave the house of Aman, the Jews' enemy,\nto queen Esther, and Mardochai came in before the king.  For Esther had\nconfessed to him that he was her uncle.","And the king took the ring which he had commanded to be taken\nagain from Aman, and gave it to Mardochai.  And Esther set Mardochai\nover her house.","And not content with these things, she fell down at the king's\nfeet and wept, and speaking to him besought him, that he would give\norders that the malice of Aman the Agagite, and his most wicked devices\nwhich he had invented against the Jews, should be of no effect.","But he, as the manner was, held out the golden sceptre with his\nhand, which was the sign of clemency:  and she arose up and stood before\nhim,","And said:  If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his\nsight, and my request be not disagreeable to him, I beseech thee, that\nthe former letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews, by which\nhe commanded that they should be destroyed in all the king's provinces,\nmay be reversed by new letters.","For how can I endure the murdering and slaughter of my people?","And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen, and Mardochai the\nJew:  I have given Aman's house to Esther, and I have commanded him to\nbe hanged on a gibbet, because he durst lay hands on the Jews.","Write ye therefore to the Jews, as it pleaseth you in the king's\nname, and seal the letters with my ring.  For this was the custom, that\nno man durst gainsay the letters which were sent in the king's name,\nand were sealed with his ring.","Then the king's scribes and secretaries were called for (now it\nwas the time of the third month which is called Siban) the three and\ntwentieth day of the month, and letters were written, as Mardochai had\na mind, to the Jews, and to the governors, and to the deputies, and to\nthe judges, who were rulers over the hundred and twenty-seven\nprovinces, from India even to Ethiopia:  to province and province, to\npeople and people, according to their languages and characters, and to\nthe Jews, according as they could read and hear.","And these letters which were sent in the king's name, were sealed\nwith his ring, and sent by posts:  who were to run through all the\nprovinces, to prevent the former letters with new messages.","And the king gave orders to them, to speak to the Jews in every\ncity, and to command them to gather themselves together, and to stand\nfor their lives, and to kill and destroy all their enemies with their\nwives and children and all their houses, and to take their spoil.","And one day of revenge was appointed through all the provinces,\nto wit, the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar.","And this was the content of the letter, that it should be\nnotified in all lands and peoples that were subject to the empire of\nking Assuerus, that the Jews were ready to be revenged of their\nenemies.","So the swift posts went out carrying the messages, and the king's\nedict was hung up in Susan.","And Mardochai going forth out of the palace, and from the king's\npresence, shone in royal apparel, to wit, of violet and sky colour,\nwearing a golden crown on his head, and clothed with a cloak of silk\nand purple.  And all the city rejoiced, and was glad.","But to the Jews, a new light seemed to rise, joy, honour, and\ndancing.","And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the\nking's commandments came, there was wonderful rejoicing, feasts and\nbanquets, and keeping holy day:  Insomuch that many of other nations and\nreligion, joined themselves to their worship and ceremonies.  For a\ngreat dread of the name of the Jews had fallen upon all."]}
