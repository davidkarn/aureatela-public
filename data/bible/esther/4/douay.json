{"verses":["Now when Mardochai had heard these things, he rent his garments,\nand put on sackcloth, strewing ashes on his head and he cried with a\nloud voice in the street in the midst of the city, shewing the anguish\nof his mind.","And he came lamenting in this manner even to the gate of the\npalace:  for no one clothed with sackcloth might enter the king's court.","And in all provinces, towns, and places, to which the king's cruel\nedict was come, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting,\nwailing, and weeping, many using sackcloth and ashes for their bed.","Then Esther's maids and her eunuchs went in, and told her.  And\nwhen she heard it she was in a consternation and she sent a garment, to\nclothe him, and to take away the sackcloth:  but he would not receive\nit.","And she called for Athach the eunuch, whom the king had appointed\nto attend upon her, and she commanded him to go to Mardochai, and learn\nof him why he did this.","And Athach going out went to Mardochai, who was standing in the\nstreet of the city, before the palace gate:","And Mardochai told him all that had happened, how Aman had\npromised to pay money into the king's treasures, to have the Jews\ndestroyed.","He gave him also a copy of the edict which was hanging up in\nSusan, that he should shew it to the queen, and admonish her to go in\nto the king, and to entreat him for her people.","And Athach went back and told Esther all that Mardochai had said.","She answered him, and bade him say to Mardochai:","All the king's servants, and all the provinces that are under his\ndominion, know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, cometh into the\nking's inner court, who is not called for, is immediately to be put to\ndeath without any delay:  except the king shall hold out the golden\nsceptre to him, in token of clemency, that so he may live.  How then can\nI go in to the king, who for these thirty days now have not been called\nunto him?","And when Mardochai had heard this,","He sent word to Esther again, saying:  Think not that thou mayst\nsave thy life only, because thou art in the king's house, more than all\nthe Jews:","For if thou wilt now hold thy peace, the Jews shall be delivered\nby some other occasion:  and thou, and thy father's house shall perish.\nAnd who knoweth whether thou art not therefore come to the kingdom,\nthat thou mightest be ready in such a time as this?","And again Esther sent to Mardochai in these words:","Go, and gather together all the Jews whom thou shalt find in\nSusan, and pray ye for me.  Neither eat nor drink for three days and\nthree nights:  and I with my handmaids will fast in like manner, and\nthen I will go in to the king, against the law, not being called, and\nexpose myself to death and to danger.","So Mardochai went, and did all that Esther had commanded him."]}
