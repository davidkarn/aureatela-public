{"verses":["So the king and Aman went in, to drink with the queen.","And the king said to her again the second day, after he was warm\nwith wine:  What is thy petition, Esther, that it may be granted thee?\nand what wilt thou have done:  although thou ask the half of my kingdom,\nthou shalt have it.","Then she answered:  If I have found favour in thy sight, O king,\nand if it please thee, give me my life for which I ask, and my people\nfor which I request.","For we are given up, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be\nslain, and to perish.  And would God we were sold for bondmen and\nbondwomen:  the evil might be borne with, and I would have mourned in\nsilence:  but now we have an enemy, whose cruelty redoundeth upon the\nking.","And king Assuerus answered and said:  Who is this, and of what\npower, that he should do these things?","And Esther said:  It is this Aman that is our adversary and most\nwicked enemy.  Aman hearing this was forthwith astonished, not being\nable to bear the countenance of the king and of the queen.","But the king being angry rose up, and went from the place of the\nbanquet into the garden set with trees.  Aman also rose up to entreat\nEsther the queen for his life, for he understood that evil was prepared\nfor him by the king.","And when the king came back out of the garden set with trees, and\nentered into the place of the banquet, he found Aman was fallen upon\nthe bed on which Esther lay, and he said:  He will force the queen also\nin my presence, in my own house.  The word was not yet gone out of the\nking's mouth, and immediately they covered his face.","And Harbona, one of the eunuchs that stood waiting on the king,\nsaid:  Behold the gibbet which he hath prepared for Mardochai, who spoke\nfor the king, standeth in Aman's house, being fifty cubits high.  And\nthe king said to him:  Hang him upon it.","So Aman was hanged on the gibbet, which he had prepared for\nMardochai:  and the king's wrath ceased."]}
