{"verses":["And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed\nwith a cloud.  And a rainbow was on his head:  and his face, as the sun,\nand his feet as pillars of fire.","And he had in his hand a little book, open.  And he set his right\nfoot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth.","And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth.  And when\nhe had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.","And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about\nto write.  And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me:  Seal up the\nthings which the seven thunders have spoken.  And write them not.","And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth\nlifted up his hand to heaven.","And he swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created\nheaven and the things which are therein, and the earth and the things\nwhich are in it, and the sea and the things which are therein:  That\ntime shall be no longer.","But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall\nbegin to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished, as he\nhath declared by his servants the prophets.","And I heard a voice from heaven, again speaking to me and saying:\nGo and take the book that is open, from the hand of the angel who\nstandeth upon the sea and upon the earth.","And I went to the angel, saying unto him that he should give me\nthe book.  And he said to me:  Take the book and eat it up.  And it shall\nmake thy belly bitter:  but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey.","And I took the book from the hand of the angel and ate it up:\nand it was in my mouth, sweet as honey.  And when I had eaten it, my\nbelly was bitter.","And he said to me:  Thou must prophesy again to many nations and\npeoples and tongues and kings."]}
