{"verses":["And I saw that the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals:  and I\nheard one of the four living creatures, as it were the voice of\nthunder, saying:  Come and see.","And I saw:  and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a\nbow, and there was a crown given him, and he went forth conquering that\nhe might conquer.","And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second living\ncreature saying:  Come and see.","And there went out another horse that was red.  And to him that sat\nthereon, it was given that he should take peace from the earth:  and\nthat they should kill one another.  And a great sword was given to him.","And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third living\ncreature saying:  Come and see.  And behold a black horse.  And he that\nsat on him had a pair of scales in his hand.","And I heard, as it were a voice in the midst of the four living\ncreatures, saying:  Two pounds of wheat for a penny, and thrice two\npounds of barley for a penny:  and see thou hurt not the wine and the\noil.","And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the\nfourth living creature saying:  Come and see.","And behold a pale horse:  and he that sat upon him, his name was\nDeath.  And hell followed him.  And power was given to him over the four\nparts of the earth, to kill with sword, with famine and with death and\nwith the beasts of the earth.","And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the\nsouls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony\nwhich they held.","And they cried with a loud voice, saying:  How long, O Lord (Holy\nand True), dost thou not judge and revenge our blood on them that dwell\non the earth?","And white robes were given to every one of them one; And it was\nsaid to them that they should rest for a little time till their fellow\nservants and their brethren, who are to be slain even as they, should\nbe filled up.","And I saw, when he had opened the sixth seal:  and behold there\nwas a great earthquake.  And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair:\nand the whole moon became as blood.","And the stars from heaven fell upon the earth, as the fig tree\ncasteth its green figs when it is shaken by a great wind.","And the heaven departed as a book folded up.  And every mountain,\nand the islands, were moved out of their places.","And the kings of the earth and the princes and tribunes and the\nrich and the strong and every bondman and every freeman hid themselves\nin the dens and in the rocks of mountains:","And they say to the mountains and the rocks:  Fall upon us and\nhide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne and from the\nwrath of the Lamb.","For the great day of their wrath is come.  And who shall be able\nto stand?"]}
