{"verses":["The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to make\nknown to his servants the things which must shortly come to pass:  and\nsignified, sending by his angel to his servant John,","Who hath given testimony to the word of God and the testimony of\nJesus Christ, what things soever he hath seen.","Blessed is he that readeth and heareth the words of this prophecy:\nand keepeth those things which are written in it.  For the time is at\nhand.","John to the seven churches which are in Asia.  Grace be unto you\nand peace, from him that is and that was and that is to come:  and from\nthe seven spirits which are before his throne:","And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first\nbegotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth, who hath\nloved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood","And hath made us a kingdom, and priests to God and his Father.  To\nhim be glory and empire for ever and ever.  Amen.","Behold, he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see him:\nand they also that pierced him.  And all the tribes of the earth shall\nbewail themselves because of him.  Even so.  Amen.","I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord\nGod, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.","I, John, your brother and your partner in tribulation and in the\nkingdom and patience in Christ Jesus, was in the island which is called\nPatmos, for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus.","I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great\nvoice, as of a trumpet,","Saying:  What thou seest, write in a book and send to the seven\nchurches which are in Asia:  to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamus\nand to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.","And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.  And being\nturned, I saw seven golden candlesticks:","And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, one like to\nthe Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girt about\nthe paps with a golden girdle.","And his head and his hairs were white as white wool and as snow.\nAnd his eyes were as a flame of fire:","And his feet like unto fine brass, as in a burning furnace.  And\nhis voice as the sound of many waters.","And he had in his right hand seven stars.  And from his mouth came\nout a sharp two-edged sword.  And his face was as the sun shineth in his\npower.","And when I had seen him, I fell at his feet as dead.  And he laid\nhis right hand upon me, saying:  Fear not.  I am the First and the Last,","And alive, and was dead.  And behold I am living for ever and ever\nand have the keys of death and of hell.","Write therefore the things which thou hast seen:  and which are:\nand which must be done hereafter.","The mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest in my right\nhand and the seven golden candlesticks.  The seven stars are the angels\nof the seven churches.  And the seven candlesticks are the seven\nchurches."]}
