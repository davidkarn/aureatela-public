For, according to the form of God, He is the beginning,[fn-3-P360_124270:142-nf] that also speaketh unto us, in which \"beginning\" God created the heaven and the earth;[fn-3-P361_124379:143-nf] but according to the form of a servant, \"He is a bridegroom coming out of His chamber.\"[fn-3-P362_124488:144-nf] According to the form of God, \"He is the first-born of every creature, and He is before all things and by him all things consist;\" according to the form of a servant, \"He is the head of the body, the Church.\"[fn-3-P363_124716:145-nf] According to the form of God, \"He is the Lord of glory.\"[fn-3-P364_124801:146-nf] From which it is evident that He Himself glorifies His saints: for, \"Whom He did predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified.\"[fn-3-P365_125030:147-nf] Of Him accordingly it is said, that He justifieth the ungodly;[fn-3-P366_125115:148-nf] of Him it is said, that He is just and a justifier.[fn-3-P367_125186:149-nf] If, therefore, He has also glorified those whom He has justified, He who justifies, Himself also glorifies; who is, as I have said, the Lord of glory. Yet, according to the form of a servant, He replied to His disciples, when inquiring about their own glorification: \"To sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but [it shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared by my Father.\"[fn-3-P368_125606:150-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"31. He is \"good,\" according to that sight, according to which God appears to the pure in heart; for \"truly God is good unto Israel even to such as are of a clean heart.\"[fn-4-P410_146275:183-nf] But when the wicked shall see the Judge, He will not seem good to them; because they will not rejoice in their heart to see Him, but all \"kindreds of the earth shall then wail because of Him,\"[fn-4-P411_146490:184-nf] namely, as being reckoned in the number of all the wicked and unbelievers. On this account also He replied to him, who had called Him Good Master, when seeking advice of Him how he might attain eternal life, \"Why askest thou me about good?[fn-4-P412_146749:185-nf] there is none good but One, that is, God.\"[fn-4-P413_146927:186-nf] And yet the Lord Himself, in another place, calls man good: \"A good man,\" He says, \"out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth evil things.\"[fn-4-P414_147184:187-nf] But because that man was seeking eternal life, and eternal life consists in that contemplation in which God is seen, not for punishment, but for everlasting joy; and because he did not understand with whom he was speaking, and thought Him to be only the Son of man:[fn-4-P415_147472:188-nf] Why, He says, askest thou me about good? that is, with respect to that form which thou seest, why askest thou about good, and callest me, according to what thou seest, Good Master? This is the form of the Son of man, the form which has been taken, the form that will appear in judgment, not only to the righteous, but also to the ungodly; and the sight of this form will not be for good to those who are wicked. But there is a sight of that form of mine, in which when I was, I thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but in order to take this form I emptied myself.[fn-4-P416_148519:189-nf] That one God, therefore, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, who will not appear, except for joy which cannot be taken away from the just; for which future joy he sighs, who says, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord:\"[fn-4-P417_148895:190-nf] that one God, therefore, Himself, I say, is alone good, for this reason, that no one sees Him for sorrow and wailing, but only for salvation and true joy. If you understand me after this latter form, then I am good; but if according to that former only, then why askest thou me about good? If thou art amongthose who \"shall look upon Him whom they have pierced,\"[fn-4-P418_149279:191-nf] that very sight itself will be evil to them, because it will be penal. That after this meaning, then, the Lord said, \"Why askest thou me about good? there is none good but One, that is, God,\" is probable upon those proofs which I have alleged, because that sight of God, whereby we shall contemplate the substance of God unchangeable and invisible to human eyes (which is promised to the saints alone; which the Apostle Paul speaks of, as \"face to face;\"[fn-4-P419_149756:192-nf] and of which the Apostle John says, \"We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is;\"[fn-4-P420_149871:193-nf] and of which it is said, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I may behold the beauty of the Lord,\" and of which the Lord Himself says, \"I will both love him, and will manifest myself to him;\"[fn-4-P421_150093:194-nf] and on account of which alone we cleanse our hearts by faith, that we may be those \"pure in heart who are blessed for they shall see God:\"[fn-4-P422_150253:195-nf] and whatever else is spoken of that sight: which whosoever turns the eye of love to seek it, may find most copiously scattered through all the Scriptures),-that sight alone, I say, is our chief good, for the attaining of which we are directed to do whatever we do aright. But that sight of the Son of man which is foretold, when all nations shall be gathered before Him, and shall say to Him, \"Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, or thirsty, etc.?\" will neither be a good to the ungodly, who shall be sent into everlasting fire, nor the chief good to the righteous. For He still goes on to call these to the kingdom which has been prepared for them from the foundation of the world. For, as He will say to those, \"Depart into everlasting fire;\" so to these,\" Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.\" And as those will go into everlasting burning; so the righteous will go into life eternal. But what is life eternal, except \"that they may know Thee,\" He says, \"the One true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent?\"[fn-4-P423_151320:196-nf] but know Him now in that glory of which He says to the Father, \"Which I had with Thee before the world was.\"[fn-4-P424_151459:197-nf] For then He will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father,[fn-4-P425_151547:198-nf] that the good servant may enter into the joy of his Lord,[fn-4-P426_151627:199-nf] and that He may hide those whom God keeps in the hiding of His countenance from the confusion of men, namely, of those men who shall then be confounded by hearing this sentence; of which evil hearing \"the righteous man shall not be afraid\"[fn-4-P427_151893:200-nf] if only he be kept in \"the tabernacle,\" that is, in the true faith of the Catholic Church, from \"the strife of tongues,\"[fn-4-P428_152034:201-nf] that is, from the sophistries of heretics. But if there is any other explanation of the words of the Lord, where He says, \"Why asketh thou me about good? there is none good, but One, that is, God;\" provided only that the substance of the Father be not therefore believed to be of greater goodness than that of the Son, according to which He is the Word by whom all things were made; and if there is nothing in it abhorrent from sound doctrine; let us securely use it, and not one explanation only, but as many as we are able to find. For so much the more powerfully are the heretics proved wrong, the more outlets are open for avoiding their snares. But let us now start afresh, and address ourselves to the consideration of that which still remains.

The faith has been preached there by an apostle, heathenism has been trodden down, the name of Christian is daily exalted higher and higher. But the display, power, and size of the city, the seeing and the being seen, the paying and the receiving of visits, the alternate flattery and detraction, talking and listening, as well as the necessity of facing so great a throng even when one is least in the mood to do so-all these things are alike foreign to the principles and fatal to the repose of the monastic life. For when people come in our way we either see them coming and are compelled to speak, or we do not see them and lay ourselves open to the charge of haughtiness. Sometimes, also, in returning visits we are obliged to pass through proud portals and gilded doors and to face the clamor of carping lackeys. But, as we have said above, in the cottage of Christ all is simple and rustic: and except for the chanting of psalms there is complete silence. Wherever one turns the laborer at his plough sings alleluia, the toiling mower cheers himself with psalms, and the vine-dresser while he prunes his vine sings one of the lays of David.

For look, in the old law I find the pruning-knife applied to the licence of repeated marriage. There is a caution in Leviticus: \"My priests shall not pluralize marriages.\"[fn-10-P1002_249840:33-nf] I may affirm even that that is plural which is not once for all. That which is not unity is number. In short, after unity begins number. Unity, moreover, is everything which is once for all. But for Christ was reserved, as in all other points so in this also, the \"fulfilling of the law.\"[fn-10-P1003_250272:34-nf] Thence, therefore, among us the prescript is more fully and more carefully laid down, that they who are chosen into the sacerdotal order must be men of one marriage;[fn-10-P1004_250494:35-nf] which rule is so rigidly observed, that I remember some removed from their office for digamy.

Are not even we laics priests? It is written: \"A kingdom also, and priests to His God and Father, hath He made us.\"[fn-10-P1006_250960:37-nf] It is the authority of the Church, and the honour which has acquired sanctity through the joint session of the Order, which has established the difference between the Order and the laity. Accordingly, where there is no joint session of the ecclesiastical Order, you offer, and baptize, and are priest, alone for yourself. But where three are, a church is, albeit they be laics. For each individual lives by his own faith,[fn-10-P1007_251398:38-nf] nor is there exception of persons with God; since it is not hearers of the law who are justified by the Lord, but doers, according to what the apostle withal says.[fn-10-P1008_251621:39-nf] Therefore, if you have the right of a priest in your own person, in cases of necessity, it behoves you to have likewise the discipline of a priest whenever it may be necessary to have the fight of a priest. If you are a digamist, do you baptize? If you are a digamist, do you offer? How much more capital (a crime) is it for a digamist laic to act as a priest, when the priest himself, if he turn digamist, is deprived of the power of acting the priest! \"But to necessity,\" you say, \"indulgence is granted.\" No necessity is excusable which is avoidable. In a word, shun to be found guilty of digamy, and you do not expose yourself to the necessity of administering what a digamist may not lawfully administer. God wills us all to he so conditioned, as to be ready at all times and places to undertake (the duties of) His sacraments. There is \"one God, one faith,\"[fn-10-P1009_252556:40-nf] one discipline too. So truly is this the case, that unless the laics as well observe the rules which are to guide the choice of presbyters, how will there be presbyters at all, who are chosen to that office from among the laics?

And since there are some who sometimes assert that they have nothing to do with the law (which Christ has not dissolved, but fulfilled),[fn-11-P1139_297094:41-nf] sometimes catch at such parts of the law as they choose; plainly do we too assert that the law has deceased in this sense, that its burdens-according to the sentence of the apostles-which not even the fathers were able to sustain,[fn-11-P1140_297347:42-nf] have wholly ceased: such (parts), however. as relate to righteousness not only permanently remain reserved, but even amplified; in order, to be sure, that our righteousness may be able to redound above the righteousness of the scribes and of the Pharisees.[fn-11-P1141_297627:43-nf] If \"righteousness\" must, of course chastity must too. If, then, forasmuch as there is in the law a precept that a man is to take in marriage the wife of his brother if he have died without children,[fn-11-P1142_297844:44-nf] for the purpose of raising up seed to his brother; and this may happen repeatedly to the same person, according to that crafty question of the Sadducees;[fn-11-P1143_298020:45-nf] men for that reason think that frequency of marriage is permitted in other cases as well: it will be their duty to understand first the reason of the precept itself; and thus they will come to know that that reason, now ceasing, is among those parts of the law which have been cancelled. Necessary it was that there should be a succession to the marriage of a brother if he died childless: first, because that ancient benediction, \"Grow and multiply,\"[fn-11-P1144_298553:46-nf] had still to run its course; secondly, because the sins of the fathers used to be exacted even from the sons;[fn-11-P1145_298707:47-nf] thirdly, because eunuchs and barren persons used to be regarded as ignominious. And thus, for fear that such as had died childless, not from natural inability, but from being prematurely overtaken by death, should be judged equally accursed (with the other class); for this reason a vicarious and (so to say) posthumous offspring used to be supplied them. But (now), when the \"extremity of the times\" has cancelled (the command) \"Grow and multiply,\" since the apostles (another command), \"It remaineth, that both they who have wives so be as if they have not,\" because \"the time is compressed;[fn-11-P1146_299388:48-nf] and \"the sour grape\" chewed by \"the fathers\" has ceased \"to set the sons' teeth on edge,\"[fn-11-P1147_299510:49-nf] for, \"each one shall die in his own sin; \"and \"eunuchs\" not only have lost ignominy, but have even deserved grace, being invited into \"the kingdoms of the heavens: \"[fn-11-P1148_299748:50-nf] the law of succeeding to the wife of a brother being buried, its contrary has obtained-that of not succeeding to the wife of a brother. And thus, as we have said before, what has ceased to be valid, on the cessation of its reason, cannot furnish a ground of argument to another. Therefore a wife, when her husband is dead, will not marry; for if she marry, she will of course be marrying (his) brother: for \"all we are brethren.\"[fn-11-P1149_300212:51-nf] Again, the woman, if intending to marry, has to marry \"in the Lord; \"[fn-11-P1150_300303:52-nf] that is, not to an heathen, but to a brother, inasmuch as even the ancient law forbids[fn-11-P1151_300411:53-nf] marriage with members of another tribe. Since, moreover, even in Leviticus there is a caution, \"Whoever shall have taken (his) brother's wife, (it) is uncleanness-turpitude; without children shall (he) die; \"[fn-11-P1152_300702:54-nf] beyond doubt, while the man is prohibited from marrying a second time, the woman is prohibited too, having no one to marry except a brother. In what way, then, an agreement shall be established between the apostle and the Law (which he is not impugning in its entirety), shall be shown when we shall have come to his own epistle. Meantime, so far as pertains to the law, the lines of argument drawn from it are more suitable for us (than for our opponents). In short, the same (law) prohibits priests from marrying a second time. The daughter also of a priest it bids, if widowed or repudiated, if she have had no seed, to return into her father's home and be nourished from his bread.[fn-11-P1153_301425:55-nf] The reason why (it is said), \"If she have had no seed,\" is not that if she have she may marry again-for how much more will she abstain from marrying if she have sons?-but that, if she have, she may be \"nourished\" by her son rather than by her father; in order that the son, too, may carry out the precept of God, \"Honour father and mother.\"[fn-11-P1154_301870:56-nf] Us, moreover, Jesus, the Father's Highest and Great Priest,[fn-11-P1155_301956:57-nf] clothing us from His own store[fn-11-P1156_302153:58-nf] -inasmuch as they \"who are baptized in Christ[fn-11-P1157_302352:59-nf] have put on Christ\"-has made \"priests to God His Father,\"[fn-11-P1158_302463:60-nf] according to John. For the reason why He recalls that young man who was hastening to his father's obsequies,[fn-11-P1159_302592:61-nf] is that He may show that we are called priests by Him; (priests) whom the Law used to forbid to be present at the sepulture of parents:[fn-11-P1160_302770:62-nf] \"Over every dead soul,\" it says, \"the priest shall not enter, and over his own father and over his own mother he shall not be contaminated.\" \"Does it follow that we too are bound to observe this prohibition? \"No, of course. For our one Father, God, lives, and our mother, the Church; and neither are we dead who live to God, nor do we bury our dead, inasmuch as they too are living in Christ.

The day would not be long enough were I to attempt to relate all that the Apostle enjoins concerning purity. These things are those concerning which our Lord said to the Apostles:[fn-64-P6463_2000307:292-nf] \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth.\" After the crucifixion of Christ, we find in the[fn-64-P6464_2000551:293-nf] Acts of the Apostles that one house, that of Philip the Evangelist, produced four virgin daughters, to the end that Caesarea, where the Gentile Church had been consecrated in the person of Cornelius the centurion, might afford an illustration of virginity. And whereas our Lord said in the Gospel:[fn-64-P6465_2000865:294-nf] \"The law and the prophets were until John,\" they because they were virgins are related to have prophesied even after John. For they could not be bound by the law of the Old Testament, who had shone with the brightness of virginity. Let us pass on to James, who was called the brother of the Lord, a man of such sanctity and righteousness, and distinguished by so rigid and perpetual a virginity, that even[fn-64-P6466_2001292:295-nf] Josephus, the Jewish historian, relates that the overthrow of Jerusalem was due to his death. He, the first bishop of the Church at Jerusalem, which was composed of Jewish believers, to whom Paul went, accompanied by Titus and Barnabas, says in his Epistle:[fn-64-P6467_2001614:296-nf] \"Be not deceived, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect boon is from above, coming down from the Father of lights,[fn-64-P6468_2001772:297-nf] with whom there is no difference, neither shadow that is cast by turning. Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.\" Himself a virgin, he teaches virginity in a mystery. Every perfect gift cometh down from above, where marriage is unknown; and it cometh down, not from any one you please, but from the Father of lights, Who says to the apostles, \"Ye are the light of the world;\" with Whom there is no difference of Jew, or Gentile, nor does that shadow which was the companion of the law, trouble those who have believed from among the nations; but with His word He begat us, and with the word of truth, because some shadow, image, and likeness of truth went before in the law, that we might be the first-fruits of His creatures. And as He who was Himself the[fn-64-P6469_2002714:298-nf] first begotten from the dead has raised all that have died in Him: so He who was a virgin, consecrated the first-fruits of His virgins in His own virgin self. Let us also consider what Peter thinks of the calling of the Gentiles:[fn-64-P6470_2002962:299-nf] \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who by the power of God are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.\" Where we read of an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, prepared in heaven and reserved for the last time, and of the hope of eternal life when they will neither marry, nor be given in marriage, there, in other words, the privileges of virginity are described. For he shows as much in what follows:[fn-64-P6471_2003701:300-nf] \"Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance; but like as he which called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living; because it is written, ye shall be holy; for I am holy.[fn-64-P6472_2004148:301-nf] For we were not redeemed with contemptible things, with silver or gold; but with the precious blood of a lamb without spot, Jesus Christ,[fn-64-P6473_2004321:302-nf] that we might purify our souls in obedience to the truth, having been begotten again not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God,[fn-64-P6474_2004513:303-nf] who liveth and abideth. And as living stones let us be built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood offering up spiritual sacrifices through Christ our Lord.[fn-64-P6475_2004872:304-nf] For we are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession.[fn-64-P6476_2004989:305-nf] Christ died for us in the flesh. Let us arm ourselves with the same conversation as did Christ; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that we should no longer live the rest of our time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. For the time past is sufficient for us when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, and other vices. Great and precious are the promises attaching to virginity which He has given us,[fn-64-P6477_2005458:306-nf] that through it we may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world through lust.[fn-64-P6478_2005610:307-nf] The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgement, but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion, daring, self-willed. For they, as beasts of burden, without reason, think only of their belly and their lusts, railers who shall in their corruption be destroyed, and shall receive the reward of iniquity: men that count unrighteousness delight, spots and blemishes, thinking of nothing but their pleasures; having eyes full of adultery and insatiable lust, deceiving souls not yet strengthened by the love of Christ. For they utter swelling words and easily snare the unlearned with the seduction of the flesh; promising them liberty while they themselves are the slaves of vice, luxury, and corruption. For of what a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage. But if, after they had escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again overcome by that which they before overcame, the last state is become worse with them than the first.

And that our view about this may be made clearer let us thus divide our argument. The inspired apostle on four occasions employs this term, once as here, calling Him, \"first-born of all creation[fn-10-P1069_579579:88-nf] ,\" another time, \"the first-born among many brethren[fn-10-P1070_579649:89-nf] ,\" again, \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1071_579705:90-nf] ,\" and on another occasion he employs the term absolutely, without combining it with other words, saying, \"But when again He bringeth the first-born into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him[fn-10-P1072_579955:91-nf] .\" Accordingly whatever view we entertain concerning this title in the other combinations, the same we shall in consistency apply to the phrase \"first-born of all creation.\" For since the title is one and the same it must needs be that the meaning conveyed is also one. In what sense then does He become \"the first-born among many brethren?\" in what sense does He become \"the first-born from the dead?\" Assuredly this is plain, that because we are by birth flesh and blood, as the Scripture saith, \"He Who for our sakes was born among us and was partaker of flesh and blood[fn-10-P1073_580545:92-nf] ,\" purposing to change us from corruption to incorruption by the birth from above, the birth by water and the Spirit, Himself led the way in this birth, drawing down upon the water, by His own baptism, the Holy Spirit; so that in all things He became the first-born of those who are spiritually born again, and gave the name of brethren to those who partook in a birth like to His own by water and the Spirit. But since it was also meet that He should implant in our nature the power of rising again from the dead, He becomes the \"first-fruits of them that slept[fn-10-P1074_581130:93-nf] \" and the \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1075_581186:94-nf] ,\" in that He first by His own act loosed the pains of death[fn-10-P1076_581264:95-nf] , so that His new birth from the dead was made a way for us also, since the pains of death, wherein we were held, were loosed by the resurrection of the Lord. Thus, just as by having shared in the washing of regeneration[fn-10-P1077_581533:96-nf] He became \"the first-born among many brethren,\" and again by having made Himself the first-fruits of the resurrection, He obtains the name of the \"first-born from the dead,\" so having in all things the pre-eminence, after that \"all old things,\" as the apostle says, \"have passed away[fn-10-P1078_581877:97-nf] ,\" He becomes the first-born of the new creation of men in Christ by the two-fold regeneration, alike that by Holy Baptism and that which is the consequence of the resurrection from the dead, becoming for us in both alike the Prince of Life[fn-10-P1079_582141:98-nf] , the first-fruits, the first-born. This first-born, then, hath also brethren, concerning whom He speaks to Mary, saying, \"Go and tell My brethren, I go to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God[fn-10-P1080_582374:99-nf] .\" In these words He sums up the whole aim of His dispensation as Man.

And where individual creature's possess various properties, does not this variety in works of the same class indicate the greatness of the Creator, in making them at the same time different and yet like, amicable yet rivals? Indeed, the philosophers themselves agree in saying that the universe consists of harmonious oppositions, according to Empedocles' (theory of) friendship and enmity. Thus, then, although corporeal essences are opposed to incorporeal ones, they yet differ from each other in such sort as to amplify their species by their variety, without changing their genus, remaining all alike corporeal; contributing to God's glory in their manifold existence by reason of their variety; so various, by reason of their differences; so diverse, in that some of them possess one kind of perception, others another; some feeding on one kind of aliment, others on another; some, again, possessing visibility, while others are invisible; some being weighty, others light. They are in the habit of saying that the soul must be pronounced incorporeal on this account, because the bodies of the dead, after its departure from them, become heavier, whereas they ought to be lighter, being deprived of the weight of a body-since the soul is a bodily substance. But what, says Soranus (in answer to this argument), if men should deny that the sea is a bodily substance, because a ship out of the water becomes a heavy and motionless mass? How much truer and stronger, then, is the soul's corporeal essence, which carries about the body, which eventually assumes so great a weight with the nimblest motion! Again, even if the soul is invisible, it is only in strict accordance with the condition of its own corporeality, and suitably to the property of its own essence, as well as to the nature of even those beings to which its destiny made it to be invisible. The eyes of the owl cannot endure the sun, whilst the eagle is so well able to face his glory, that the noble character of its young is determined by the unblinking strength of their gaze; while the eaglet, which turns away its eye from the sun's ray, is expelled from the nest as a degenerate creature! So true is it, therefore, than to one eye an object is invisible, which may be quite plainly seen by another,-without implying any incorporeality in that which is not endued with an equally strong power (of vision). The sun is indeed a bodily substance, because it is (composed of) fire; the object, however, which the eaglet at once admits the existence of, the owl denies, without. any prejudice, nevertheless, to the testimony of the eagle. There is the selfsame difference in respect of the soul's corporeality, which is (perhaps) invisible to the flesh, but perfectly visible to the spirit.

O Christ, Thou Saviour of the world, merciful Creator and Redeemer, the only offspring from the Godhead of the Father, flowing in an indescribable[fn-43-P4349_1705736:20-nf] manner from the heart of Thy Parent, Thou self-existing Word, and powerful from the mouth of Thy Father, equal to Him, of one mind with Him, His fellow, coeval with the Father, from whom at first[fn-43-P4350_1705954:21-nf] the world derived its origin! Thou dost suspend the firmament,[fn-43-P4351_1706033:22-nf] Thou heapest together the soil, Thou dost pour forth the seas, by whose[fn-43-P4352_1706119:23-nf] government all things which are fixed in their places flourish. Who seeing that the human race was plunged in the depth[fn-43-P4353_1706289:24-nf] of misery, that Thou mightest rescue man, didst Thyself also become man: nor wert Thou willing only to be born with a body,[fn-43-P4354_1706428:25-nf] but Thou becamest flesh, which endured to be born and to die. Thou dost undergo[fn-43-P4355_1706565:26-nf] funeral obsequies, Thyself the author of life and framer of the world, Thou dost enter[fn-43-P4356_1706714:27-nf] the path of death, in giving the aid of salvation. The gloomy chains of the infernal law yielded, and chaos feared to be pressed by the presence[fn-43-P4357_1706889:28-nf] of the light. Darkness perishes, put to flight by the brightness of Christ; the think pall of eternal[fn-43-P4358_1707009:29-nf] night falls. But restore the promised[fn-43-P4359_1707094:30-nf] pledge, I pray Thee, O power benign! The third day has returned; arise, my buried One; it is not becoming that Thy limbs should lie in the lowly sepulchre, nor that worthless stones should press that which is the ransom[fn-43-P4360_1707357:31-nf] of the world. It is unworthy that a stone should shut in with a confining[fn-43-P4361_1707451:32-nf] rock, and cover Him in whose fist[fn-43-P4362_1707504:33-nf] all things are enclosed. Take away the linen clothes, I pray; leave the napkins in the tomb: Thou art sufficient for us, and without Thee there is nothing. Release the chained shades of the infernal prison, and recall to the upper regions[fn-43-P4363_1707819:34-nf] whatever sinks to the lowest depths. Give back Thy face, that the world may see the light; give back the day which flees from us at Thy death. But returning, O holy conqueror! Thou didst altogether fill the heaven![fn-43-P4364_1708054:35-nf] Tartarus lies depressed, nor retains its rights. The ruler of the lower regions, insatiably opening his hollow jaws, who has always been a spoiler, becomes[fn-43-P4365_1708273:36-nf] a prey to Thee. Thou rescuest an innumerable people from the prison of death, and they follow in freedom to the place whither their leader[fn-43-P4366_1708442:37-nf] approaches. The fierce monster in alarm vomits forth the multitude whom he had swallowed up, and the Lamb[fn-43-P4367_1708561:38-nf] withdraws the sheep from the jaw of the wolf. Hence re-seeking the tomb from the lower regions,[fn-43-P4368_1708687:39-nf] having resumed Thy flesh, as a warrior Thou carriest back ample trophies to the heavens. Those whom chaos held in punishment[fn-43-P4369_1708885:40-nf] he[fn-43-P4370_1708902:41-nf] has now restored; and those whom death might seek, a new life holds, Oh, sacred King, behold a great part of Thy triumph shines forth, when the sacred layer blesses pure souls! A host, clad in white,[fn-43-P4371_1709142:42-nf] come forth from the bright waves, and cleanse their old[fn-43-P4372_1709279:43-nf] fault in a new stream. The white garment also designates bright souls, and the shepherd has enjoyments from the snow-white flock. The priest Felix is added sharing[fn-43-P4373_1709517:44-nf] in this reward, who wishes to give double talents to his Lord. Drawing those who wander in Gentile error to better things, that a beast of prey may not carry them away, He guards the fold of God. Those whom guilty Eve had before infected, He now restores, fed[fn-43-P4374_1709826:45-nf] with abundant milk at the bosom of the Church. By cultivating rustic hearts with mild conversations, a crop is produced from a briar by the bounty of Felix. The Saxon, a fierce nation, living as it were after the manner of wild beasts, when you, 0 sacred One! apply a remedy, the beast of prey resembles[fn-43-P4375_1710161:46-nf] the sheep. About to remain with you through an age with the return[fn-43-P4376_1710241:47-nf] of a hundred-fold, you fill the barns with the produce of an abundant harvest.

If, however, you will not acknowledge John, you have our common master Paul, who \"girds our loins about with truth, and puts on us the breastplate of righteousness, and shoes us with the preparation of the gospel of peace, not of war; who bids us take the shield of faith, wherewith we may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the devil, and the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which (he says) is the word of God.\"[fn-50-P5008_1579280:200-nf] This sword the Lord Himself came to send on earth, and not peace.[fn-50-P5009_1579369:201-nf] If he is your Christ, then even he is a warrior. If he is not a warrior, and the sword he brandishes is an allegorical one, then the Creator's Christ in the psalm too may have been girded with the figurative sword of the Word, without any martial gear. The above-mentioned \"fairness\" of His beauty and \"grace of His lips\" would quite suit such a sword, girt as it even then was upon His thigh in the passage of David, and sent as it would one day be by Him on earth. For this is what He says: \"Ride on prosperously in Thy majesty[fn-50-P5010_1579919:202-nf] \"-advancing His word into every land, so as to call all nations: destined to prosper in the success of that faith which received Him, and reigning, from the fact that[fn-50-P5011_1580128:203-nf] He conquered death by His resurrection. \"Thy right hand,\" says He, \"shall wonderfully lead Thee forth,\"[fn-50-P5012_1580251:204-nf] even the might of Thy spiritual grace, whereby the knowledge of Christ is spread. \"Thine arrows are sharp; \"[fn-50-P5013_1580392:205-nf] everywhere Thy precepts fly about, Thy threatenings also, and convictions[fn-50-P5014_1580485:206-nf] of heart, pricking and piercing each conscience. \"The people shall fall under Thee,\"[fn-50-P5015_1580591:207-nf] that is, in adoration.

Then, after a little, he says: If then, O Origen, you maintain that the resurrection of the body changed into a spiritual body is to be expected only in appearance, and put forth the vision of Moses and Elias as a most convincing proof of it; saying that they appeared after their departure from life, preserving no different appearance from that which they had from the beginning; in the same way will be the resurrection of all men. But Moses and Elias arose and appeared with this form of which you speak, before Christ suffered and rose. How then could Christ be celebrated by prophets and apostles as \"the first begotten of the dead? \"[fn-59-P5921_1800195:112-nf] For if the Christ is believed to be the first begotten of the dead, He is the first begotten of the dead as having risen before all others. But Moses appeared to the apostles before Christ suffered, having this form in which you say the resurrection is fulfilled. Hence then, there is no resurrection of the form without the flesh. For either there is a resurrection of the form as you teach, and then Christ is no longer \"the first begotten of the dead,\" from the fact that souls appeared before Him, having this form after death; or He is truly the first begotten, and it is quite impossible that any should have been thought meet for a resurrection before Him, so as not to die again. But if no one arose before Him, and Moses and Elias appeared to the apostles not having flesh, but only its appearance, the resurrection in the flesh is clearly manifested. For it is most absurd that the resurrection should be set forth only in form, since the souls, after their departure from the flesh, never appear to lay aside the form which, he says, rises again. But if that remains with them, so that it cannot be taken away, as with the soul of Moses and Elias; and neither perishes, as you think, nor is destroyed, but is everywhere present with them; then surely that form which never fell cannot be said to rise again.","title":"From the Discourse on the Resurrection.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_32_the_oration_in_praise_of_the_emperor_constantine_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"6 Lastly, he who is in all, before, and after all,[fn-84-P8467_3451641:7-nf] his only begotten, pre-existent Word, the great High Priest of the mighty God, elder than all time and every age, devoted to his Father's glory, first and alone makes intercession with him for the salvation of mankind.[fn-84-P8468_3452118:8-nf] Supreme and pre-eminent Ruler of the universe, he shares the glory of his Father's kingdom: for he is that Light, which, transcendent above the universe, encircles the Father's Person, interposing and dividing between the eternal and uncreated Essence and all derived existence: that Light which, streaming from on high, proceeds from that Deity who knows not origin or end, and illumines the super-celestial regions, and all that heaven itself contains, with the radiance of wisdom bright beyond the splendor of the sun.

I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but tropically. But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term \"Word.\" I wonder at the stupidity of the general run of Christians in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity. The Son of God says in one passage, \"I am the light of the world,\" and in another, \"I am the resurrection,\" and again, \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" It is also written, \"I am the door,\" and we have the saying, \"I am the good shepherd,\" and when the woman of Samaria says, \"We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,\" Jesus answers, \"I that speak unto thee am He.\" Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared Himself in these words[fn-62-P6254_982473:92-nf] to be their Master and Lord: \"You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.\" He also distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says,[fn-62-P6255_982654:93-nf] \"He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? \"and[fn-62-P6256_982806:94-nf] \"Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.\" We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate's question,[fn-62-P6257_982993:95-nf] \"Art Thou the King of the Jews? \"by saying, \"My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence.\" We have also read the words,[fn-62-P6258_983272:96-nf] \"I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman,\" and again, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" Add to these testimonies also the saying,[fn-62-P6259_983437:97-nf] \"I am the bread of life, that came down from heaven and giveth life to the world.\" These texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son of God. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says,[fn-62-P6260_983747:98-nf] \"I am the first and the last, and the living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.\" And again,[fn-62-P6261_983876:99-nf] \"I am the A and the W, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" The careful student of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as where He calls Himself[fn-62-P6262_984111:100-nf] a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,[fn-62-P6263_984170:101-nf] and a light of the Gentiles.[fn-62-P6264_984225:102-nf] Isaiah also says,[fn-62-P6265_984264:103-nf] \"From my mother's womb hath He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.\" And a little farther on: \"And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of Israel. Behold I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" And in Jeremiah too[fn-62-P6266_984857:104-nf] He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: \"I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.\" These and other similar sayings He applies to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets proclaim in advance His coining advent and announce the things concerning Him under various names. Thus John calls Him the Lamb of God, saying,[fn-62-P6267_985471:105-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world,\" and in these words he declares Him as a man,[fn-62-P6268_985601:106-nf] \"This is He about whom I said, that there cometh after me a man who is there before me; for He was before me.\" And in his Catholic Epistle John says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus:[fn-62-P6269_985836:107-nf] \"And if any one sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,\" and he adds that He is a propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a propitiation:[fn-62-P6270_986050:108-nf] \"Whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast sins, in the forbearance of God.\" According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:[fn-62-P6271_986344:109-nf] \"Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: \"He was made to us of God,\" he says, \"wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\" But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest:[fn-62-P6272_986654:110-nf] \"Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.\" And the prophets have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons[fn-62-P6273_986898:111-nf] says, \"Judah, thy brethren shall extol thee; thy hands are on the necks of thine enemies. A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art thou sprung up; thou hast lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him? \"We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. What may be quoted against this view, viz., \"A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved; \"this can better be cleared up on another occasion . But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel, when he says,[fn-62-P6274_987528:112-nf] \"Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted Him. He shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break. and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope.\" That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says:[fn-62-P6275_988040:113-nf] \"That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry,\" etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God:[fn-62-P6276_988248:114-nf] \"I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd.\" For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower:[fn-62-P6277_988483:115-nf] \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of tits root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel slid of might, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as follows:[fn-62-P6278_988887:116-nf] \"The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the comer. It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.\" And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows:[fn-62-P6279_989155:117-nf] \"Have ye never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.\" And Luke writes in Acts:[fn-62-P6280_989407:118-nf] \"This is the stone, which was set at naught of you the builders, which has become the head of the corner.\" And one of the names applied to the Saviour is that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records;-the Word who was in the beginning with God, God the Word. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and ask, What is the Son of God when called the Word? The passage they employ most is that in the Psalms,[fn-62-P6281_990132:119-nf] \"My heart hath produced a good Word; \"and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are they clear about His essence. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said to be \"Word\" can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an essence of His own. We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it suggests slid apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course. To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have to say on the question, how the Son of God is the Word, we must begin with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him. This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression, but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these matters will clear the way for what is coming. And once we have entered upon the theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what diligence we can and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall necessarily understand more about Him not only in His character as the Word, but in His other characters also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"ANF-10","text":"In what has been said about the first and the last, and about the beginning and the end, we have referred these words at one point to the different forms of reasonable beings, at another to the different conceptions of the Son of God.

Now, if ever before, saintliness abounds and penetrates our world; by gradual advances it has reached the highest mark of perfectness; and one who follows such footsteps in his daily rounds may catch this halo; one who tracks the scent of this preceding perfume may be drenched in the sweet odours of Christ Himself. As, when one torch has been fired, flame is transmitted to all the neighbouring candlesticks, without either the first light being lessened or blazing with unequal brilliance on the other points where it has been caught; so the saintliness of a life is transmitted from him who has achieved it, to those who come within his circle; for there is truth in the Prophet's saying[fn-28-P2899_1946733:178-nf] , that one who lives with a man who is \"holy\" and \"clean\" and \"elect,\" will become such himself. If you would wish to know the sure signs, which will secure you the real model, it is not hard to take a sketch from life. If you see a man so standing between death and life, as to select from each helps for the contemplative course, never letting death's stupor paralyze his zeal to keep all the commandments, nor yet placing both feet in the world of the living, since he has weaned himself from secular ambitions;-a man who remains more insensate than the dead themselves to everything that is found on examination to be living for the flesh, but instinct with life and energy and strength in the achievements of virtue, which are the sure marks of the spiritual life;-then look to that man for the rule of your life; let him be the leading light of your course of devotion, as the constellations that never set are to the pilot; imitate his youth and his gray hairs: or, rather, imitate the old man and the stripling who are joined in him; for even now in his declining years time has not blunted the keen activity of his soul, nor was his youth active in the sphere of youth's well-known employments; in both seasons of life he has shown a wonderful combination of opposites, or rather an exchange of the peculiar qualities of each; for in age he shows, in the direction of the good, a young man's energy, while, in the hours of youth, in the direction of evil, his passions were powerless. If you wish to know what were the passions of that glorious youth of his, you will have for your imitation the intensity and glow of his godlike love of wisdom, which grew with him from his childhood, and has continued with him into his old age. But if you cannot gaze upon him, as the weak-sighted cannot gaze upon the sun, at all events watch that band of holy men who are ranged beneath him, and who by the illumination of their lives are a model for this age. God has placed them as a beacon for us who live around; many among them have been young men there in their prime, and have grown gray in the unbroken practice of continence and temperance; they were old in reasonableness before their time, and in character outstripped their years. The only love they tasted was that of wisdom; not that their natural instincts were different from the rest; for in all alike \"the flesh lusteth against the spirit[fn-29-P2900_1949181:179-nf] ;\" but they listened to some purpose to him who said that Temperance \"is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her[fn-29-P2901_1949319:180-nf] ;\" and they sailed across the swelling billows of existence upon this tree of life, as upon a skiff; and anchored in the haven of the will of God; enviable now after so fair a voyage, they rest their souls in that sunny cloudless calm. They now ride safe themselves at the anchor of a good hope, far out of reach of the tumult of the billows; and for others who will follow they radiate the splendour of their lives as beacon-fires on some high watch-tower. We have indeed a mark to guide us safely over the ocean of temptations; and why make the too curious inquiry, whether some with such thoughts as these have not fallen nevertheless, and why therefore despair, as if the achievement was beyond your reach? Look on him who has succeeded, and boldly launch upon the voyage with confidence that it will be prosperous, and sail on under the breeze of the Holy Spirit with Christ your pilot and with the oarage of good cheer[fn-29-P2902_1950286:181-nf] . For those who \"go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waters\" do not let the shipwreck that has befallen some one else prevent their being of good cheer; they rather shield their hearts in this very, confidence, and so sweep on to accomplish their successful feat. Surely it is the most absurd thing in the world to reprobate him who has slipped in a course which requires the greatest nicety, while one considers those who all their lives have been growing old in failures and in errors, to have chosen the better part. If one single approach to sin is such an awful thing that you deem it safer not to take in hand at all this loftier aim, how much more awful a thing it is to make sin the practice of a whole life, and to remain thereby absolutely ignorant of the purer course! How can you in your full life obey the Crucified? How can you, hale in sin, obey Him Who died to sin? How can you, who are not crucified to the world, and will not accept the mortification of the flesh, obey Him Who bids you follow after Him, and Who bore the Cross in His own body, as a trophy from the foe? How can you obey Paul when he exhorts you \"to present your body a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God[fn-29-P2903_1951546:182-nf] ,\" when you are \"conformed to this world,\" and not transformed by the renewing of your mind, when you are not \"walking\" in this \"newness of life,\" but still pursuing the routine of \"the old man\"? How can you be a priest unto God[fn-29-P2904_1951820:183-nf] , anointed though you are for this very office, to offer a gift to God; a gift in no way another's, no counterfeited gift from sources outside yourself, but a gift that is really your own, namely, \"the inner man[fn-29-P2905_1952128:184-nf] ,\" who must be perfect and blameless, as it is required of a lamb to be without spot or blemish? How can you offer this to God, when you do not listen to the law forbidding the unclean to offer sacrifices? If you long for God to manifest Himself to you, why do you not hear Moses, when he commands the people to be pure from the stains of marriage, that they may take in the vision of God[fn-29-P2906_1952539:185-nf] If this all seems little in your eyes, to be crucified with Christ, to present yourself a sacrifice to God, to become a priest unto the most high God, to make yourself worthy of the vision of the Almighty, what higher blessings than these can we imagine for you, if indeed you make light of the consequences of these as well? And the consequence of being crucified with Christ is that we shall live with Him, and be glorified with Him, and reign with Him; and the consequence of presenting ourselves to God is that we shall be changed from the rank of human nature and human dignity to that of Angels; for so speaks Daniel, that \"thousand thousands stood before him[fn-29-P2907_1953227:186-nf] .\" He too who has taken his share in the true priesthood and placed himself beside the Great High Priest remains altogether himself a priest for ever, prevented for eternity from remaining any more in death. To say, again, that one makes oneself worthy to see God, produces no less a result than this; that one is made worthy to see God. Indeed, the crown of every hope, and of every desire, of every blessing, and of every promise of God, and of all those unspeakable delights which we believe to exist beyond our perception and our knowledge,-the crowning result of them all, I say, is this. Moses longed earnestly to see it, and many prophets and kings have desired to see the same: but the only class deemed worthy of it are the pure in heart, those who are, and are named \"blessed,\" for this very reason, that \"they shall see God[fn-29-P2908_1954083:187-nf] .\" Wherefore we would that you too should become crucified with Christ, a holy priest standing before God, a pure offering in all chastity, preparing yourself by your own holiness for God's coming; that you also may have a pure heart in which to see God, according to the promise of God, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, to Whom be gloryfor ever and ever.

Let us now examine the expression, \"Wisdom is the purest efflux of the glory of the Almighty; \"and let us first consider what the glory of the omnipotent God is, and then we shall also understand what is its efflux. As no one can be a father without having a son, nor a master without possessing a servant, so even God cannot be called omnipotent unless there exist those over whom He may exercise His power; and therefore, that God may be shown to be almighty, it is necessary that all things should exist. For if any one would have some ages or portions of time, or whatever else he likes to call them, to have passed away, while those things which were afterwards made did not yet exist, he would undoubtedly show that during those ages or periods God was not omnipotent, but became so afterwards, viz., from the time that He began to have persons over whom to exercise power; and in this way He will appear to have received a certain increase, and to have risen from a lower to a higher condition; since there can be no doubt that it is better for Him to be omnipotent than not to be so. And now how can it appear otherwise than absurd, that when God possessed none of those things which it was befitting for Him to possess, He should afterwards, by a kind of progress, come into the possession of them? But if there never was a time when He was not omnipotent, of necessity those things by which He receives that title must also exist; and He must always have had those over whom He exercised power, and which were governed by Him either as king or prince, of which we shall speak more fully in the proper place, when we come to discuss the subject of the creatures. But even now I think it necessary to drop a word, although cursorily, of warning, since the question before us is, how wisdom is the purest efflux of the glory of the Almighty, lest any one should think that the title of Omnipotent was anterior in God to the birth of Wisdom, through whom He is called Father, seeing that Wisdom, which is the Son of God, is the purest efflux of the glory of the Almighty. Let him who is inclined to entertain this suspicion hear the undoubted declaration of Scripture pronouncing, \"In wisdom hast Thou made them all,\"[fn-63-P6317_1146264:48-nf] and the teaching of the Gospel, that \"by Him were all things made, and without Him nothing was made; \"[fn-63-P6318_1146385:49-nf] and let him understand from this that the title of Omnipotent in God cannot be older than that of Father; for it is through the Son that the Father is almighty. But from the expression \"glory of the Almighty,\" of which glory Wisdom is the efflux, this is to be understood, that Wisdom, through which God is called omnipotent, has a share in the glory of the Almighty. For through Wisdom, which is Christ, God has power over all things, not only by the authority of a ruler, but also by the voluntary obedience of subjects. And that you may understand that the omnipotence of Father and Son is one and the same, as God and the Lord are one and the same with the Father, listen to the manner in which John speaks in the Apocalypse: \"Thus saith the Lord God, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.\"[fn-63-P6319_1147219:50-nf] For who else was \"He which is to come\" than Christ? And as no one ought to be offended, seeing God is the Father, that the Saviour is also God; so also, since the Father is called omnipotent, no one ought to be offended that the Son of God is also cared omnipotent. For in this way will that saying be true which He utters to the Father, \"All Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine, and I am glorified in them.\"[fn-63-P6320_1147643:51-nf] Now, if all things which are the Father's are also Christ's, certainly among those things which exist is the omnipotence of the Father; and doubtless the only-begotten Son ought to be omnipotent, that the Son also may have all things which the Father possesses. \"And I am glorified in them,\" He declares. For \"at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and every tongue shall confess that the Lord Jesus is in the glory of God the Father.\"[fn-63-P6321_1148173:52-nf] Therefore He is the efflux of the glory of God in this respect, that He is omnipotent-the pure and limpid Wisdom herself-glorified as the efflux of omnipotence or of glory. And that it may be more clearly understood what the glory of omnipotence is, we shall add the following. God the Father is omnipotent, because He has power over all things, i.e., over heaven and earth, sun, moon, and stars, and all things in them. And He exercises His power over them by means of His Word, because at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, both of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth. And if every knee is bent to Jesus, then, without doubt, it is Jesus to whom all things are subject, and He it is who exercises power over all things, and through whom all things are subject to the Father; for through wisdom, i.e., by word and reason, not by force and necessity, are all things subject. And therefore His glory consists in this very thing, that He possesses all things, and this is the purest and most limpid glory of omnipotence, that by reason and wisdom, not by force and necessity, all things are subject. Now the purest and most limpid glory of wisdom is a convenient expression to distinguish it from that glory which cannot be called pure and sincere. But every nature which is convertible and changeable, although glorified in the works of righteousness or wisdom, yet by the fact that righteousness or wisdom are accidental qualifies, and because that which is accidental may also fall away, its glory cannot be called sincere and pure. But the Wisdom of God, which is His only-begotten Son, being in all respects incapable of change or alteration, and every good quality in Him being essential, and such as cannot be changed and converted, His glory is therefore declared to be pure and sincere.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_46_appendix_against_all_heresies_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"ANF-03","text":"After these there were not wanting a Marcus and a Colarbasus, composing a novel heresy out of the Greek alphabet.

And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creeping things that creep on the earth.

Listen, therefore, to the following from the book of Joshua, that what I say may become manifest to you; it is this: `And it came to pass, when Joshua was near Jericho, he lifted up his eyes, and sees a man standing over against him. And Joshua approached to Him, and said, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? And He said to him, I am Captain of the Lord's host: now have I come.

And the Lord's Captain says to Joshua, Loose the shoes off thy feet; for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. And Jericho was shut up and fortified, and no one went out of it.

For it seems to me that he made a point of keeping the feasts in the large cities. \"From Philippi,\" where the affair of the prison had taken place. This was his third coming into Macedonia, and it is a high testimony that be bears to the Philippians, which is the reason why he makes some stay there. \"And upon the day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.\" (v. 7.) It was then the (season between Easter and) Pentecost.[fn-16-P1637_1581716:3-nf] See how everything was subordinate to the preaching. It was also, it says, the Lord's day.[fn-16-P1638_1582282:4-nf] Not even during night-time was he silent, nay he discoursed the rather then, because of stillness. Mark how he both made a long discourse, and beyond the time of supper itself. But the Devil disturbed the feast-not that he prevailed, however-by plunging the hearer in sleep, and causing him to fall down. \"And,\" it says, \"there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together. And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him, said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.\" (v. 8-12.) But observe, I pray you, the theatre, how crowded it was: and the miracle, what it was. \"He was sitting in a window,\" at dead of night. Such was their eagerness to hear him! Let us take shame to ourselves! \"Aye, but a Paul\" say you, \"was discoursing then.\" Yes, and Paul discourses now, or rather not Paul, either then or now, but Christ, and yet none cares to hear. No window in the case now, no importunity of hunger, or sleep, and yet we do not care to hear: no crowding in a narrow space here, nor any other such comfort. And the wonderful circumstance is, that though he was a youth, he was not listless and indifferent; and though (he felt himself) weighed down by sleep, he did not go away,[fn-16-P1639_1584337:5-nf] nor yet fear the danger of falling down. It was not from listlessness that he slumbered, but from necessity of nature. But observe, I beseech you, so fervent was their zeal, that they even assembled in a third loft: for they had not a Church yet. \"Trouble not yourselves,\" he says. He said not, \"He shall come to life again, for I will raise him up:\" but mark the unassuming way in which he comforts them: \"for his life,\" says he, \"is in him. When he was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten.\" This thing cut short the discourse; it did no harm, however. \"When he had eaten,\" it says, \"and discoursed a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.\" Do you mark the frugality of the supper? Do you observe how they passed the whole night? Such were their meals, that the hearers came away sober, and fit for hearing. But we, in what do we differ from dogs? Do you mark what a difference (between us and those men)? \"And they brought the young man alive, and,\" it says, \"were not a little comforted,\" both because they received him back alive, and because a miracle had been wrought.[fn-16-P1640_1585592:6-nf] \"And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Thasos,[fn-16-P1641_1586434:7-nf] there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.\" (v. 13.) We often find Paul parting from the disciples. For behold again, he himself goes afoot: giving them the easier way, and himself choosing the more painful. He went afoot, both that he might arrange many matters, and by way of training them to bear a parting from him.[fn-16-P1642_1586918:8-nf] \"And when he had joined us at Thasos, having taken him on board, we came to Mytilene; and having sailed thence on the morrow, we come over against Chios\"-then they pass the island-\"and on the next day we touched at Samos, and having stopped at Trogylium, on the following day we came to Miletus. For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.\" (v. 14-16.) Why this haste? Not for the sake of the feast, but of the multitude. At the same time, by this he conciliated the Jews, as being one that did honor the feasts, wishing to gain even his adversaries: at the same time also he delivers the word.[fn-16-P1643_1588072:9-nf] Accordingly, see what great gain accrued, from all being present.

There are many cups, it is plain, both in private houses, and in the public market; and if a person breaks one of them, he is not guilty of impiety. But the cup which belongs to the mysteries, and which if it be broken intentionally, makes the perpetrator of the deed an impious person, is found only among those who lawfully preside. This is the only description that can be given of this kind of cup; there is none other; this you legally give to the people to drink; this you have received according to the canon of the Church[fn-27-P2703_1019292:39-nf] ; this belongs only to those who preside over the Catholic Church. for to you only it appertains to administer the Blood of Christ, and to none besides.

And on this account does the law term a woman betrothed to a man, the wife of him who had betrothed her, although she was as yet a virgin; thus indicating the back-reference from Mary to Eve, because what is joined together could not otherwise be put asunder than by inversion of the process by which these bonds of union had arisen;[fn-78-P7895_2165331:442-nf] so that the former ties be cancelled by the latter, that the latter may set the former again at liberty. And it has, in fact, happened that the first compact looses from the second tie, but that the second tie takes the position of the first which has been cancelled.[fn-78-P7896_2165668:443-nf] For this reason did the Lord declare that the first should in truth be last, and the last first.[fn-78-P7897_2166064:444-nf] And the prophet, too, indicates the same, saying, \"instead of fathers, children have been born unto thee.\"[fn-78-P7898_2166201:445-nf] For the Lord, having been born \"the First-begotten of the dead,\"[fn-78-P7899_2166286:446-nf] and receiving into His bosom the ancient fathers, has regenerated them into the life of God, He having been made Himself the beginning of those that live, as Adam became the beginning of those who die.[fn-79-P7900_2166506:447-nf] Wherefore also Luke, commencing the genealogy with the Lord, carried it back to Adam, indicating that it was He who regenerated them into the Gospel of life, and not they Him.

Again, the illustration of the Light and the Radiance has this meaning. For the Saints have not said that the Word was related to God as fire kindled from the heat of the sun, which is commonly put out again, for this is an external work and a creature of its author, but they all preach of Him as Radiance[fn-34-P3406_1351386:171-nf] , thereby to signify His being from the essence, proper and indivisible, and His oneness with the Father. This also will secure His true unchangableness and immutability; for how can these be His, unless He be proper Offspring of the Father's essence? for this too must be taken to confirm His identity with His own Father. Our explanation then having so religious an aspect, Christ's enemies should not be startled at the `One in essence,' either, since this term also has a sound sense and good reasons. Indeed, if we say that the Word is from the essence of God (for after what has been said this must be a phrase admitted by them), what does this mean but the truth and eternity of the essence from which He is begotten? for it is not different in kind, lest it be combined with the essence of God as something foreign and unlike it.

And this is why they stood against one another and Aristotle rose up against Plato, and the Stoics blustered (efruacanto 6 mss. \"fenced themselves,\" efracanto: which Field inclines to prefer) against him, and one has become hostile to one, another to another. So that one should not so much marvel at them for their wisdom, as turn away from them indignant and hate them, because through this very thing they have become fools. For had they not trusted what they have to reasonings, and syllogisms, and sophistries, they would not have suffered what they did suffer. Then, to strengthen the accusation against them he holds the whole of their idolatry up to ridicule. For in the first place the changing even were a very fit subject of scorn. But to change to such things too, is beyond all excuse. For what then did they change it, and what was it which they invested with His Glory? Some conceptions they ought to have had about Him, as, for instance, that He is God, that He is Lord of all, that He made them, which were not, that He exerciseth a Providence, that He careth for them. For these things are the \"Glory of God.\" To whom then did they ascribe it? Not even to men, but \"to an image made like to corruptible man.\" Neither did they stop here, but even dropped down to the brutes, or rather to the images of these. But consider, I pray, the wisdom of Paul, how he has taken the two extremes, God the Highest, and creeping things the lowest: or rather, not the creeping things, but the images of these; that he might clearly show their evident madness. For what knowledge they ought to have had concerning Him Who is incomparably more excellent than all, with that they invested what was incomparably more worthless than all. But what has this to do with the philosophers? a man may say. To these belongs most of all what I have said to do with them. For they have the Egyptians who were the inventors of these things to their masters. And Plato, who is thought more reverend than the rest of them, glories in these masters. (Plat. Tim. 21. B. etc.) And his master is in a stupid awe of these idols, for he it is that bids them sacrifice the cock to Aesculapius[fn-20-P2050_2047108:5-nf] (his last words, Phaedo), where (i.e. in his temple. So Field from Mss.) are the images of these beasts, and creeping things. And one may see Apollo and Bacchus worshipped along with these creeping things. And some of the philosophers even lifted up to Heaven bulls, and scorpions, and dragons, and all the rest of that vanity. For in all parts did the devil zealously strive to bring men down before the images of creeping things, and to range beneath the most senseless of all things, him whom God hath willed to lift up above the heavens. And it is not from this only, but also from other grounds, that you will see their chief man to come under the remarks now made.

This they have not confined to words, but Arius composed in his Thalia, and the Sophist Asterius wrote, what we have stated above, as follows: `Blessed Paul said not that he preached Christ, the Power of God or the Wisdom of God,' but without the addition of the article, `God's power' and `God's wisdom[fn-60-P6097_2428590:244-nf] ,' thus preaching that the proper Power of God Himself which is natural to Him, and co-existent in Him ingenerately, is something besides, generative indeed of Christ, and creative of the whole world, concerning which he teaches in his Epistle to the Romans thus,-`The invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead[fn-60-P6098_2429034:245-nf] .'

And he teaches that there is another power and wisdom of God, manifested through Christ. And shortly after the same Asterius says, `However His eternal power and wisdom, which truth argues to be without beginning and ingenerate, the same must surely be one. For there are many wisdoms which are one by one created by Him, of whom Christ is the first-born and only-begotten; all however equally depend on their Possessor. And all the powers are rightly called His who created and uses them:-as the Prophet says that the locust, which came to be a divine punishment of human sins, was called by God Himself not only a power, but a great power; and blessed David in most of the Psalms invites, not the Angels alone, but the Powers to praise God.'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"73","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"47.

For, as when John says, `The Word was made flesh[fn-61-P6177_2465056:311-nf] ,' we do not conceive the whole Word Himself to be flesh[fn-61-P6178_2465132:312-nf] , but to have put on flesh and become man, and on hearing, `Christ hath become a curse for us,' and `He hath made Him sin for us who knew no sin[fn-61-P6179_2465295:313-nf] ,' we do not simply conceive this, that whole Christ has become curse and sin, but that He has taken on Him the curse which lay against us (as the Apostle has said, `Has redeemed us from the curse,' and `has carried,' as Isaiah has said, `our sins,' and as Peter has written, `has borne them in the body on the wood[fn-61-P6180_2465646:314-nf] '); so, if it is said in the Proverbs `He created,' we must not conceive that the whole Word is in nature a creature, but that He put on the created body[fn-61-P6181_2465849:315-nf] and that God created Him for our sakes, preparing for Him the created body, as it is written, for us, that in Him we might be capable of being renewed and deified. What then deceived you, O senseless, to call the Creator a creature? or whence did you purchase for you this new thought, to parade it[fn-61-P6182_2467351:316-nf] ? For the Proverbs say `He created,' but they call not the Son creature, but Offspring; and, according to the distinction in Scripture aforesaid of `He created' and `creature,' they acknowledge, what is by nature proper to the Son, that He is the Only-begotten Wisdom and Framer of the creatures, and when they say `He created,' they say it not in respect of His Essence, but signify that He was becoming a beginning of many ways; so that `He created' is in contrast to `Offspring,' and His being called the `Beginning of ways[fn-61-P6183_2467906:317-nf] ' to His being the Only-begotten Word.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"61. Such then being the difference between `created' and `begat me,' and between `beginning of ways' and `before all,' God, being first Creator, next, as has been said, becomes Father of men, because of His Word dwelling in them. But in the case of the Word the reverse; for God, being His Father by nature, becomes afterwards both His Creator and Maker, when the Word puts on that flesh which was created and made, and becomes man. For, as men, receiving the Spirit of the Son, become children through Him, so the Word of God, when He Himself puts on the flesh of man, then is said both to be created and to have been made. If then we are by nature sons, then is He by nature creature and work; but if we become sons by adoption and grace, then has the Word also, when in grace towards us He became man, said, `The Lord created me.' And in the next place, when He put on a created nature and became like us in body, reasonably was He therefore called both our Brother and `First-born[fn-62-P6290_2508583:404-nf] .' For though it was after us[fn-62-P6291_2508899:405-nf] that He was made man for us, and our brother by similitude of body, still He is therefore called and is the `First-born' of us, because, all men being lost, according to the transgression of Adam, His flesh before all others was saved and liberated, as being the Word's body[fn-62-P6292_2509543:406-nf] ; and henceforth we, becoming incorporate with It, are saved after Its pattern. For in It the Lord becomes our guide to the Kingdom of Heaven and to His own Father, saying, `I am the way' and `the door[fn-62-P6293_2509784:407-nf] ,' and `through Me all must enter.' Whence also is He said to be `First-born from the dead[fn-62-P6294_2509906:408-nf] ,' not that He died before us, for we had died first; but because having undergone death for us and abolished it, He was the first to rise, as man, for our sakes raising His own Body. Henceforth He having risen, we too from Him and because of Him rise in due course from the dead.

On this account and reasonably, having said before, `I and the Father are One,' He added, `I in the Father and the Father in Me,[fn-65-P6525_2591232:27-nf] ' by way of shewing the identity[fn-65-P6526_2591282:28-nf] of Godhead and the unity of Essence. For they are one, not[fn-65-P6527_2591364:29-nf] as one thing divided into two parts, and these nothing but one, nor as one thing twice named, so that the Same becomes at one time Father, at another His own Son, for this Sabellius holding was judged an heretic. But They are two, because the Father is Father and is not also Son, and the Son is Son and not also Father[fn-65-P6528_2591708:30-nf] ; but the nature is one; (for the offspring is not unlike[fn-65-P6529_2591781:31-nf] its parent, for it is his image), and all that is the Father's, is the Son's[fn-65-P6530_2591995:32-nf] . Wherefore neither is the Son another God, for He was not procured from without, else were there many, if a godhead be procured foreign from the Father's[fn-65-P6531_2592274:33-nf] ; for if the Son be other, as an Offspring, still He is the Same as God; and He and the Father are one in propriety and peculiarity of nature, and in the identity of the one Godhead, as has been said. For the radiance also is light, not second to the sun, nor a different light, nor from participation of it, but a whole and proper offspring of it. And such an offspring is necessarily one light; and no one would say that they are two lights[fn-65-P6532_2592732:34-nf] , but sun and radiance two, yet one the light from the sun enlightening in its radiance all things. So also the Godhead of the Son is the Father's; whence also it is indivisible; and thus there is one God and none other but He. And so, since they are one, and the Godhead itself one, the same things are said of the Son, which are said of the Father, except His being said to be Father[fn-65-P6533_2593166:35-nf] :-for instance[fn-65-P6534_2593200:36-nf] , that He is God, `And the Word was God[fn-65-P6535_2593269:37-nf] ;' Almighty, `Thus saith He which was and is and is to come, the Almighty[fn-65-P6536_2593359:38-nf] ;' Lord, `One Lord Jesus Christ[fn-65-P6537_2593407:39-nf] ;' that He is Light, `I am the Light[fn-65-P6538_2593465:40-nf] ;' that He wipes out sins, `that ye may know,' He says, `that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins[fn-65-P6539_2593600:41-nf] ;' and so with other attributes.
