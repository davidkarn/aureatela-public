{"verses":["And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet:  and I saw a star fall\nfrom heaven upon the earth.  And there was given to him the key of the\nbottomless pit.","And he opened the bottomless pit:  and the smoke of the pit arose,\nas the smoke of a great furnace.  And the sun and the air were darkened\nwith the smoke of the pit.","And from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon the\nearth.  And power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have\npower.","And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of\nthe earth nor any green thing nor any tree:  but only the men who have\nnot the sign of God on their foreheads.","And it was given unto them that they should not kill them:  but\nthat they should torment them five months.  And their torment was as the\ntorment of a scorpion when he striketh a man.","And in those days, men shall seek death and shall not find it.  And\nthey shall desire to die:  and death shall fly from them.","And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto\nbattle.  And on their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold:  and\ntheir faces were as the faces of men.","And they had hair as the hair of women:  and their teeth were as\nlions.","And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron:  and the noise\nof their wings was as the noise of chariots and many horses running to\nbattle.","And they had tails like to scorpions:  and there were stings in\ntheir tails.  And their power was to hurt men, five months.  And they had\nover them","A king, the angel of the bottomless pit (whose name in Hebrew is\nAbaddon and in Greek Apollyon, in Latin Exterminans).","One woe is past:  and behold there come yet two woes more\nhereafter.","And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet:  and I heard a voice from\nthe four horns of the golden altar which is before the eyes of God,","Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet:  Loose the four\nangels who are bound in the great river Euphrates.","And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an hour,\nand a day, and a month, and a year:  for to kill the third part of men.","And the number of the army of horsemen was twenty thousand times\nten thousand.  And I heard the number of them.","And thus I saw the horses in the vision.  And they that sat on\nthem had breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of brimstone.  And the\nheads of the horses were as the heads of lions:  and from their mouths\nproceeded fire and smoke and brimstone.","And by these three plagues was slain the third part of men, by\nthe fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of\ntheir mouths.","For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their\ntails.  For, their tails are like to serpents and have heads:  and with\nthem they hurt.","And the rest of the men, who were not slain by these plagues, did\nnot do penance from the works of their hands, that they should not\nadore devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood,\nwhich neither can see nor hear nor walk:","Neither did they penance from their murders nor from their\nsorceries nor from their fornication nor from their thefts."]}
