{"verses":["And I saw a beast coming up out the sea, having seven heads and\nten horns:  and upon his horns, ten diadems:  and upon his heads, names\nof blasphemy.","And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard:  and his feet\nwere as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion.  And\nthe dragon gave him his own strength and great power.","And I saw one of his heads as it were slain to death:  and his\ndeath's wound was healed.  And all the earth was in admiration after the\nbeast.","And they adored the dragon which gave power to the beast.  And\nthey adored the beast, saying:  Who is like to the beast?  And who shall\nbe able to fight with him?","And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and\nblasphemies:  and power was given to him to do, two and forty months.","And he opened his mouth unto blasphemies against God, to\nblaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven.","And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to\novercome them.  And power was given him over every tribe and people and\ntongue and nation.","And all that dwell upon the earth adored him, whose names are not\nwritten in the book of life of the Lamb which was slain from the\nbeginning of the world.","If any man have an ear, let him hear.","He that shall lead into captivity shall go into captivity:  he\nthat shall kill by the sword must be killed by the sword.  Here is the\npatience and the faith of the saints.","And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth:  and he had\ntwo horns, like a lamb:  and he spoke as a dragon.","And he executed all the power of the former beast in his sight.\nAnd he caused the earth and them that dwell therein to adore the first\nbeast, whose wound to death was healed.","And he did great signs, so that he made also fire to come down\nfrom heaven unto the earth, in the sight of men.","And he seduced them that dwell on the earth, for the signs which\nwere given him to do in the sight of the beast:  saying to them that\ndwell on the earth that they should make the image of the beast which\nhad the wound by the sword and lived.","And it was given him to give life to the image of the beast:  and\nthat the image of the beast should speak:  and should cause that\nwhosoever will not adore the image of the beast should be slain.","And he shall make all, both little and great, rich and poor,\nfreemen and bondmen, to have a character in their right hand or on\ntheir foreheads:","And that no man might buy or sell, but he that hath the\ncharacter, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.","Here is wisdom.  He that hath understanding, let him count the\nnumber of the beast.  For it is the number of a man:  and the number of\nhim is six hundred sixty-six."]}
