Now if we extend our inquiry to the passion of our Lord and Saviour, it may indeed be overbold to suppose that He will suffer in heaven; yet if there is spiritual wickedness in heavenly places[fn-47-P4754_1301424:3392-nf] and if we confess without a blush that the Lord has once been crucified to destroy those thing's which He has destroyed by His passion; why need we fear to imagine a like occurrence in the upper world? the fulness of time, so that the nations of all realms shall be saved by a passion of Christ?\"","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":14,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1422","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"8.

And the evil angels indeed found no place in him, but the good took possession of[fn-85-P8509_2746598:12-nf] the soul of the righteous man, and said to it: Take note of the body whence thou art coming out; for it is necessary for thee again to return to it in the day of the resurrection, that thou mayst receive what God hath promised to the righteous. And the good angels who had received the soul of the righteous man, saluted it, as being well known to them. And it went with them; and the Spirit came forth to meet them, saying: Come, soul, enter into the place of the resurrection, which God hath prepared for His righteous ones. And the angel said to me: Look down to the earth, and behold the soul of the impious, how it goes forth from its tabernacle, which has provoked God to anger, saying, Let us eat and drink;[fn-85-P8510_2747338:13-nf] for who is it that has gone down to Hades, and come up and announced that there is judgment and retribution? And take heed, and see all his works which he has done standing before him. And the evil angels came and the good. The good therefore found no place of rest in it, but the evil took possession of it, saying: O wretched soul, pay heed to thy flesh; take note of that whence thou art coming forth, for thou must return into thy flesh in the day of the resurrection, that thou mayst receive the recompense of thy sins. And when it had gone forth from its tabernacle, the angel who had lived along with it ran up to it, saying to it: O wretched soul, whither goest thou? I am he who each day wrote down thy sins. Thou hast destroyed the time of repentance; be exceedingly ashamed.

And a voice came to it. saying: Thou wast altogether merciless, and for this reason thou hast been delivered up to such an angel. Confess thy sins which thou hast done in the world.

Knowest thou not that whensoever any one dies, his deeds run before him, whether they are good or evil? And when it heard this, it was silent. And I heard the Judge saying: Let the angel come, having in his hands the record of thy sins. And the Judge says to the angel: I say to thee the angel, Disclose all. Say what he has done five years before his death. By myself I swear to thee, that in the first period of his life there was forgetfulness of all his former sins. And the angel answered and said: Lord, command the souls to stand beside their angels; and that same hour they stood beside them. And the lord of that soul said: Take note of these souls, and whether thou hast in any way sinned against them. And it answered and said: Lord, a year has not been completed since I killed the one and lived with the other. And not only this, but I also wronged it. And the Lord said to it: Knowest thou not that he who wrongs any one in the world is kept, as soon as he dies, in the place until he whom he has wronged come, and both shall be judged before me, and each receive according to his works?

I say this because in your short treatise you quote Solomon as if he were on your side, though Solomon never wrote the words in question at all; so that, as you have a second Esdras you may have a second Solomon. And, if you like, you may read the imaginary revelations of all the patriarchs and prophets, and, when you have learned them, you may sing them among the women in their weaving-shops, or rattler order them to be read in your taverns, the more easily by these melancholy ditties to stimulate the ignorant mob to replenish their cups.","title":"Against Vigilantius","author":false},{"chapter":14,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_13_to_pammachius_against_john_of_jerusalem","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"34.

In few words he shows the whole mystery of the resurrection, that is, both the reality of the flesh and the growth in glory. And the meaning is: Who is he that cometh up from the earth, cometh up from blood? According to the[fn-71-P7131_2353827:97-nf] prophecy of Jacob, He has bound His foal to the vine, and has trodden the wine-press alone, and His garments are red with new wine from Bosor, that is from flesh, or from the tribulation of the world: for He Himself[fn-71-P7132_2354063:98-nf] has conquered the world. And, therefore, His garments are red and shining, because He is[fn-71-P7133_2354171:99-nf] beauteous in form more than the sons of men, and on account of the glory of His triumph they have been changed into a white robe; and then, in truth, as concerns Christ's flesh, were fulfilled the words,[fn-71-P7134_2354395:100-nf] \"Who is this that cometh up all in white, leaning upon her beloved?\" And that which is written in the same book:[fn-71-P7135_2354530:101-nf] \"My beloved is white and ruddy.\" These men are his true followers who have not[fn-71-P7136_2354629:102-nf] defiled their garments with women, for they have continued virgins, who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.

Then shall the sheep which was[fn-71-P7138_2355146:104-nf] lost, and was wandering in the lower world, be carried whole on the Saviour's shoulders, and the sheep which was sick with sin shall be supported by the mercy of the Judge. Then shall they see him who pierced Him, who shouted,[fn-71-P7139_2355395:105-nf] \"Crucify Him, crucify Him.\" Again and again shall they beat their breasts, they and their women, those women to whom our Lord said, as He carried His cross,[fn-71-P7140_2355572:106-nf] \"Ye daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves, and for your children.\" Then shall be fulfilled the prophecy of the angels, who said to the stupefied Apostles,[fn-71-P7141_2355776:107-nf] \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking with astonishment into heaven? This Jesus who is taken from you into heaven, shall come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.\" But what are we to think of a man saying that our Lord[fn-71-P7142_2356031:108-nf] ate with the Apostles for forty days after His resurrection in order that they might not think Him to be a phantom, and then asserting that it was a phantom which did this very thing, which ate and which was seen by many in the flesh. That which was seen is either real, or false. If it is real, it follows that He really ate, and really had members. But if it is false, how could He be willing to give false impressions in order to prove the truth of His resurrection? For no one proves what is true by means of what is false. You will say, are we then going to eat after our resurrection? I know not. Scripture does not tell us; and yet, if the question be asked, I do not think we shall eat. For I have read that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, while it promises[fn-71-P7143_2356821:109-nf] such things as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man. Moses fasted forty days and forty nights. Human nature does not allow of this, but what is impossible with men is not impossible with God. Just as, in foretelling the future, it matters not whether a person announces what will take place after ten years or after a hundred, since the knowledge of futurity is all one; so he who can fast for forty days and yet live,-not, indeed, that he can of himself fast, but that he lives by the power of God,-will also be able to live for ever without food and drink. Why did our Lord eat an honeycomb? To prove the resurrection: not to give your palate the pleasure of tasting of honey. He asked for a fish broiled on the coals that He might[fn-71-P7144_2357612:110-nf] confirm the doubting Apostles, who did not dare approach Him because they thought they saw not a body, but a spirit.[fn-71-P7145_2357749:111-nf] The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue was raised to life and took food.[fn-71-P7146_2357841:112-nf] Lazarus, who had been four days dead, rose again, and comes before us at a dinner; not because he was accustomed to eat in the lower world, but because a case which presented such difficulties challenged the believer's criticism. As He showed them real hands and a real side, so He really ate with His disciples; really walked with Cleophas; conversed with men with a real tongue; really reclined at supper; with real hands took bread, blessed and brake it, and was offering it to them. And as for His suddenly vanishing out of their sight, that is the power of God, not of a shadowy phantom. Besides, even before His resurrection, when they had led Him out from Nazareth that they might cast Him down headlong from the brow of the hill, He passed through the midst of them, that is, escaped out of their hands. Can we follow Marcion, and say that because, when He was held fast, He escaped in a manner contrary to nature, therefore His birth must have been only apparent? Has not the Lord a privilege which is conceded to magicians? It is related of Apollonius of Tyana that, when standing in court before Domitian, he all at once disappeared. Do not put the power of the Lord on a level with the tricks of magicians, so that He may appear to have been what He was not, and may be thought to have eaten without teeth, walked without feet, broken bread without hands, spoken without a tongue, and showed a side which had no ribs.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":14,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"\"Moreover,\" says he, \"in Job himself it is said: `And he maintained the miracle of a true man.'[fn-26-P2616_1037335:129-nf] Again we read in Solomon, touching wisdom: `Men that are liars cannot remember her, but men of truth shall be found in her.'[fn-26-P2617_1037480:130-nf] Again in the Apocalypse: `And in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without fault.' \"[fn-26-P2618_1037598:131-nf] To all these statements we reply with a reminder to our opponents, of how a man may be called true, through the grace and truth of God, who is in himself without doubt a liar.

But whence shall we be able to know this?From the following passages (if I mistake not) in which it is written, \"These were[fn-8-P809_323851:45-nf] purchased from among men as the first fruits to God and the Lamb, and in their mouth there was found no falsehood, for they are without spot before the throne of God.\" You see, then, that they are spoken of as closely following in the footsteps of the Lord, not in virtue of one member only, but those are said to do so, who, besides virginity, had passed a life freed from all the pollution of sin. Wherefore, let the virgin especially despise marriage on this account, that, while she is safer than others, she may the more easily accomplish what is also required from those who are married; viz. keep herself from all sin, and obey all the commandments of the law. For if she does not marry, and nevertheless indulges in those things from which even married women are enjoined to keep themselves free, what will it profit her not to have married?For although it is not allowed to any Christian to commit sin, and it befits all without exception who are purified through the sanctification of the spiritual bath, to lead an unstained life, that they may be thoroughly identified[fn-8-P810_324960:46-nf] with the Church, which is described as being \"without[fn-8-P811_325031:47-nf] spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,\" much more is it requisite that a virgin should reach this standard, whom neither the existence of a husband, nor of sons, nor of any other necessity, prevents from fully carrying out the demands of holy Scripture; nor shall she be able, if she fail, to defend herself by any sort of excuse.","title":"Letter II.

This may be more plainly gathered from John in his Apocalyse, though the other prophets also do not by any means conceal the state of matters from those who have the faculty of hearing them. John speaks as follows:[fn-60-P6097_925740:2-nf] \"And I saw another angel ascending from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God, and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not either the earth, or the sea, or the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads. And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand who were sealed, out of every tribe of the children of lsrael; of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe of Roubem twelve thousand.\" And he mentioned each of the tribes singly, with the exception of Dan. Then, some way further on,[fn-60-P6098_926411:3-nf] he continues: \"And I saw, and behold the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder. And the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers harping with their harps; and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders, and no one could learn the song but the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb whithersover He goeth. These were purchased from among men, a first fruits to God and to the Lamb; and in their mouth was found no lie, for they are without blemish.\" Now this is said in John with reference to those who have believed in Christ, for they also, even if their bodily descent cannot be traced to the seed of the Patriarchs, are yet gathered out of the tribes. That this is so we may conclude from what is further said about them: \"Hurt not,\" he says, \"the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.

Whence by how much we love the former, by so much ought we to hate the latter. Yet in truth there be some lies which to believe does no harm: although even by such son of lie to wish to deceive, is hurtful to him that tells it, not to him that believes it.

For if Jehu (whom it seems they do prudently to single out unto themselves to look unto as an example of lying) falsely gave himself out for a servant of Baal, that he might slay Baal's servants: how much more justly, according to their perversity, might, in time of persecution, the servants of Christ falsely give themselves out, for servants of demons, that the servants of demons might not slay servants of Christ; and sacrifice to idols that men might not be killed, it Jehu sacrificed to Baal that he might kill men? For what harm would it do them, according to the egregious doctrine of these speakers of lies, if they should lyingly pretend a worship of the Devil in the body, when the worship of God was preserved in the heart? But not so have the Martyrs understood the Apostle, the true, the holy Martyrs. They saw and held that which is written, \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation;\"[fn-43-P4394_2123448:7-nf] and, \"In their mouth was found no lie:\"[fn-43-P4395_2123503:8-nf] and so they departed irreproachable, to that place where to be tempted by liars any further they will not fear; because they will not have liars any more in their heavenly assemblies, either for strangers or neighbors. As for that Jehu, by an impious lie and a sacrilegious sacrifice making inquisition for impious and sacrilegious men for to kill them, they would not imitate him, no, not though the Scripture had said nothing concerning him, what manner of man he was. But, seeing it is written that he had not his heart right with God;[fn-43-P4396_2124111:9-nf] what profited it him, that for some obedience which, concerning the utter destruction of the house of Ahab, he exhibited for the lust of his own domination. he received some amount of transitory wages in a temporal kingdom? Let, rather, the truth-telling sentence of the Martyrs be thine to defend: to this I exhort thee, my brother, that thou mayst be against liars, not say, that thou mayest find how needful to be shunned is that which, with laudable zeal indeed towards impious men, that they may be caught and corrected, or avoided, but yet too incautiously, is thought fit to be taught.4. Of lies are many sorts, which indeed all, universally, we ought to hate. For there is no lie that is not contrary to truth. For, as light and darkness, piety and impiety, judge and iniquity, sin and right-doing, heath and weakness, life and death, so are truth and a lie contrary the one to the other. Whence by how much we love the former, by so much ought we to hate the latter. Yet in truth there be some lies which to believe does no harm: although even by such son of lie to wish to deceive, is hurtful to him that tells it, not to him that believes it. As though, if that brother, the servant of God, Fronto, in the information which he gave thee, should (though far be the thought!) say some things falsely; he would have hurt himself assuredly, not thee, although thou, without iniquity of thine, hadst believed all, upon his telling it. Because, whether those things did so take place or not so, yet they have not any thing, which if a person believe to have been so, though it were not so, he by the rule of truth and doctrine of eternal salvation should be judged worthy of blame. Whereas, if a person tell a lie which if any believe he will be an heretic against the doctrine of Christ, by so much is he who tells the lie more hurtful, by how much he that believes it is more miserable. See then, what manner of thing it is, if against the doctrine of Christ we shall tell a lie which whoso believes shall perish, in order that we may catch the enemies of the same doctrine, to the end we may bring them to the truth, while we recede from it; nay rather, when we catch liars by lying, teach worse lies. For it is one thing what they say when they lie, another when they are deceived. For, when they teach their heresy, they speak the things in which they are deceived; but when they say that they think what they do not think, or that they do not think what they do think, they say the things in perisheth not. For it is no receding from the catholic rule, if, when a heretic lyingly professes the catholic doctrines, one believes him to be a catholic: and therefore it is not pernicious to him; because he is mistaken in the mind of a man, of which, when latent, he cannot judge, not in the faith of God which it is his duty to keep safe planted within him. Moreover, when they teach their heresy, whoso shall believe them, in thinking it truth, will be partaker, as of their error, so of their damnation. So it comes to pass, that when they fable their nefarious dogmas in which they are with deadly error deceived, then whoso believeth them is lost: whereas when we preach catholic dogmas, in which we hold the right faith, then if he shall believe, that man is found, whoso was lost. But when, they being Priscillianists, do, in order that they may not betray their venom, lyingly give themselves out to be of us; whoever of us believes them, even while they escape detection, himself perseveres a Catholic: we on the other hand, if, in order to attain to the discovery of them, we falsely give ourselves out for Priscillianists, because we shall praise their dogmas as though they were our own, whoso shall believe the same, will either be confirmed among them, or will be transferred to them in the meantime straightway: but what the coming hour may bring forth, whether they shall be afterwards set free therefrom by us when speaking true things, who were deceived by us when speaking false; and whether they will be willing to hear one teaching whom they have thus experienced telling a lie,who can know for certain? who can be ignorant that this is uncertain? Whence it is gathered, that it is more pernicious, or to speak more mildly, that it is more perilous for Catholics to lie that they may catch heretics, than for heretics to lie that they may not be found out by Catholics.s. Because, whoso believes Catholics when they tall a lie to tempt people, is either made or confirmed a heretic; but whoso believes heretics when they tall a lie to conceal themselves, doth not cease to be a Catholic. But that this may become more plain, let us propose some cases by way of example, and from those writings in preference which thou hast sent me to read.","title":"Against Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":14,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_36_against_lying_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"40","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"33. It remains then that we understand as concerning those women, whether in Egypt or in Jericho, that for their humanity and mercy they received a reward, in any wise temporal, which indeed itself, while they wist not of it, should by prophetical signification prefigure somewhat eternal. But whether it be ever right, even for the saving of a man's life, to tell a lie, as it is a question in resolving which even the most learned do weary themselves, it did vastly surpass the capacity of those poor women, set in the midst of those nations, and accustomed to those manners. Therefore their ignorance in this as well as in those other things of which they were alike unknowing, but which are to be known by the children not of this world but of that which is to come, the patience of God did bear withal: Who yet, for their human kindness which they had shown to His servants, rendered unto them rewards of an earthly sort, albeit signifying somewhat of an heavenly. And Rahab, indeed, delivered out of Jericho, made transition into the people of God, where, being proficient, she might attain to eternal and immortal prizes which are not to be sought by any lie. Yet at that time when she did for the Israelite spies that good, and, for her condition of life, laudable work, she was not as yet such that it should be required of her, \"In your mouth let Yea be yea, Nay nay.\"[fn-44-P4482_2194768:66-nf] But as for those midwives, albeit Hebrewesses, if they savored only after the flesh, what or how great is the good they got of their temporal reward in that they made them houses, unless by making proficiency they attained unto that house of which is sung unto God, \"Blessed are they that dwell in thine house; for ever and ever they will praise thee?\"[fn-44-P4483_2195139:67-nf] It must be confessed, however, that it approacheth much unto righteousness, and though not yet in reality, even now in respect of hopefulness and disposition that mind is to be praised, which never lies except with intention and will to do good to some man, but to hurt no man.

Here they find it to be the name of the sex, not a class of the sex: if, that is, God gave to Eve, when she had not yet known a man, the surname \"woman\" and \"female\"[fn-119-P11946_3335110:116-nf] -(\"female,\" whereby the sex generally; \"woman,\" hereby a class of the sex, is marked).[fn-119-P11947_3335285:117-nf] So, since at that time the as yet unwedded Eve was called by the word \"woman,\" that word has been made common even to a virgin.[fn-119-P11948_3335569:118-nf] Nor is it wonderful that the apostle-guided, of course, by the same Spirit by whom, as all the divine Scripture, so that book Genesis, was drawn up-has used the selfsame word in writing \"women,\" which, by the example of Eve unwedded, is applicable too to a \"virgin.\" In fact, all the other passages are in consonance herewith. For even by this very fact, that he has not named \"virgins\" (as he does in another place[fn-119-P11949_3336175:119-nf] where he is teaching touching marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made touching every woman, and touching the whole sex; and that there is no distinction made between a \"virgin\" and any other, while he does not name her at all. For he who elsewhere-namely, where the difference requires-remembers to make the distinction, (moreover, he makes it by designating each species by their appropriate names, ) wishes, where he makes no distinction (while he does not name each), no difference to be understood. What of the fact that in the Greek speech, in which the apostle wrote his letters, it is usual to say, \"women\" rather than \"females; \"that is, gunai=kaj (gunaikas) rather than qhlei/aj (theleias)? Therefore if that word,[fn-119-P11950_3336952:120-nf] which by interpretation represents what \"female\" (femina) represents,[fn-119-P11951_3337036:121-nf] is frequently used instead of the name of the sex[fn-119-P11952_3337467:122-nf] he has named the sex in saying gunai=ka; but in the sex even the virgin is embraced. But, withal, the declaration is plain: \"Every woman,\" saith he, \"praying and prophesying with head uncovered,[fn-119-P11953_3337678:123-nf] dishonoureth her own head.\"[fn-119-P11954_3337729:124-nf] What is \"every woman, but woman of every age, of every rank, of every condition? By saying\" every\" he excepts nought of womanhood, just as he excepts nought of manhood either from not being covered; for just so he says, \"Every man.\"[fn-119-P11955_3337983:125-nf] As, then, in the masculine sex, under the name of\" man\" even the\" youth\" is forbidden to be veiled; so, too, in the feminine, under the name of \"woman,\" even the \"virgin\" is bidden to be veiled. Equally in each sex let the younger age follow the discipline of the elder; or else let the male \"virgins,\"[fn-119-P11956_3338307:126-nf] too, be veiled, if the female virgins withal are not veiled, because they are not mentioned by name. Let \"man\" and \"youth\" be different, if \"woman\" and \"virgin\" are different. For indeed it is \"on account of the angels\"[fn-119-P11957_3338591:127-nf] that he saith women must be veiled, because on account of \"the daughters of men\" angels revolted from God.[fn-119-P11958_3338720:128-nf] Who then, would contend that \"women\" alone-that is,[fn-119-P11959_3339001:129-nf] such as were already wedded and had lost their virginity-were the objects of angelic concupiscence, unless \"virgins\" are incapable of excelling in beauty and finding lovers? Nay, let us see whether it were not virgins alone whom they lusted after; since Scriptures saith \"the daughters of men; \"[fn-119-P11960_3339369:130-nf] inasmuch as it might have named \"wives of men,\" or \"females,\" indifferently.[fn-119-P11961_3339465:131-nf] Likewise, in that it saith, \"And they took them to themselves for wives,\"[fn-119-P11962_3339657:132-nf] it does so on this ground, that, of course, such are \"received for wives\" as are devoid of that title. But it would have expressed itself differently concerning such as were not thus devoid. And so (they who are named) are devoid as much of widowhood as of virginity. So completely has Paul by naming the sex generally, mingled \"daughters\" and species together in the genus. Again, while he says that \"nature herself,\"[fn-119-P11963_3340095:133-nf] which has assigned hair as a tegument and ornament to women, \"teaches that veiling is the duty of females,\" has not the same tegument and the same honour of the head been assigned also to virgins? If \"it is shameful\" for a woman to be shorn it is similarly so to a virgin too. From them, then, to whom is assigned one and the same law of the head,[fn-119-P11964_3340465:134-nf] one and the same discipline[fn-119-P11965_3340516:135-nf] of the head is exacted,-(which extends) even unto those virgins whom their childhood defends,[fn-119-P11966_3340631:136-nf] for from the first[fn-119-P11967_3340673:137-nf] a virgin was named \"female.\" This custom,[fn-119-P11968_3340746:138-nf] in short, even Israel observes; but if Israel did not observe it, our Law,[fn-119-P11969_3340865:139-nf] amplified and supplemented, would vindicate the addition for itself; let it be excused for imposing the veil on virgins also. Under our dispensation, let that age which is ignorant of its sex[fn-119-P11970_3341104:140-nf] retain the privilege of simplicity. For both Eve and Adam, when it befell them to be \"wise,\"[fn-119-P11971_3341223:141-nf] forthwith veiled what they had learnt to know?[fn-119-P11972_3341290:142-nf] At all events, with regard to those in whom girlhood has changed (into maturity), their age ought to remember its duties as to nature, so also, to discipline; for they are being transferred to the rank of \"women\" both in their persons and in their functions. No one is a \"virgin\" from the time when she is capable of marriage; seeing that, in her, age has by that time been wedded to its own husband, that is, to time.[fn-119-P11973_3341773:143-nf] \"But some particular virgin has devoted herself to God. From that very moment she both changes the fashion of her hair, and converts all her garb into that of a `woman.'\" Let her, then, maintain the character wholly, and perform the whole function of a \"virgin: \"what she conceals[fn-119-P11974_3342101:144-nf] for the sake of God, let her cover quite over.[fn-119-P11975_3342188:145-nf] It is our business to entrust to the knowledge of God alone that which the grace of God effects in us, test we receive from man the reward we hope for from God.[fn-119-P11976_3342372:146-nf] Why do you denude before God[fn-119-P11977_3342659:147-nf] what you cover before men?[fn-119-P11978_3342710:148-nf] Will you be more modest in public than in the church? If your self-devotion is a grace of God, and you have received it, \"why do you boast,\" saith he, \"as if you have not received it? \"[fn-119-P11979_3342939:149-nf] Why, by your ostentation of yourself, do you judge others? Is it that, by your boasting, you invite others unto good? Nay, but even you yourself run the risk of losing, if you boast; and you drive others unto the same perils What is assumed from love of boasting is easily destroyed. Be veiled, virgin, if virgin you are; for you ought to blush. If you are a virgin, shrink from (the gaze of) many eyes. Let no one wonder at your face; let no one perceive your falsehood.[fn-119-P11980_3343432:150-nf] You do well in falsely assuming the married character, if you veil your head; nay, you do not seem to assume it falsely, for you are wedded to Christ: to Him you have surrendered your body; act as becomes your Husband's discipline. If He bids the brides of others to be veiled, His own, of course, much more. \"But each individual man[fn-119-P11981_3344005:151-nf] is not to think that the institution of his predecessor is to be overturned.\" Many yield up their own judgment, and its consistency, to the custom of others. Granted that virgins be not compelled to be veiled, at all events such as voluntarily are so should not be prohibited; who, likewise, cannot deny themselves to be virgins,[fn-119-P11982_3344386:152-nf] content, in the security of a good conscience before God, to damage their own fame.[fn-119-P11983_3344561:153-nf] Touching such, however, as are betrothed, I can with constancy \"above my small measure\"[fn-119-P11984_3344741:154-nf] pronounce and attest that they are to be veiled from that day forth on which they shuddered at the first bodily touch of a man by kiss and hand. For in them everything has been forewedded: their age, through maturity; their flesh, through age; their spirit, through consciousness; their modesty, through the experience of the kiss their hope, through expectation; their mind through volition.
