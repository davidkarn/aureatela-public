{"verses":["And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials\nand spoke with me, saying:  Come, I will shew thee the condemnation of\nthe great harlot, who sitteth upon many waters:","With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication.  And\nthey who inhabit the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her\nwhoredom.","And he took me away in spirit into the desert.  And I saw a woman\nsitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy,\nhaving seven heads and ten horns.","And the woman was clothed round about with purple and scarlet,\nand gilt with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup\nin her hand, full of the abomination and filthiness of her fornication.","And on her forehead a name was written:  A mystery:  Babylon the\ngreat, the mother of the fornications and the abominations of the\nearth.","And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with\nthe blood of the martyrs of Jesus.  And I wondered, when I had seen her,\nwith great admiration.","And the angel said to me:  Why dost thou wonder?  I will tell thee\nthe mystery of the woman and of the beast which carrieth her, which\nhath the seven heads and ten horns.","The beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall come up\nout of the bottomless pit and go into destruction.  And the inhabitants\non the earth (whose names are not written in the book of life from the\nfoundation of the world) shall wonder, seeing the beast that was and is\nnot.","And here is the understanding that hath wisdom.  The seven heads\nare seven mountains, upon which the woman sitteth:  and they are seven\nkings.","Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come:  and when\nhe is come, he must remain a short time.","And the beast which was and is not:  the same also is the eighth,\nand is of the seven, and goeth into destruction.","And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have not\nyet received a kingdom:  but shall receive power as kings, one hour\nafter the beast.","These have one design:  and their strength and power they shall\ndeliver to the beast.","These shall fight with the Lamb.  And the Lamb shall overcome\nthem because he is Lord of lords and King of kings:  and they that are\nwith him are called and elect and faithful.","And he said to me:  The waters which thou sawest, where the\nharlot sitteth, are peoples and nations and tongues.","And the ten horns which thou sawest in the beast:  These shall\nhate the harlot and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her\nflesh and shall burn her with fire.","For God hath given into their hearts to do that which pleaseth\nhim:  that they give their kingdom to the beast, till the words of God\nbe fulfilled.","And the woman which thou sawest is the great city which hath\nkingdom over the kings of the earth."]}
