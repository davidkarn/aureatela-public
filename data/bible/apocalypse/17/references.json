Some time after, I saw her bathe in the river Tiber; and I gave her my hand, and drew her out of the river. The sight of her beauty made me think with myself, \"I should be a happy man if I could but get a wife as handsome and good as she is.\" This was the only thought that passed through me: this and nothing more. A short time after this, as I was walking on my road to the villages,[fn-2-P213_24827:2-nf] and magnifying the creatures of God, and thinking how magnificent, and beautiful, and powerful they are,[fn-2-P214_25409:3-nf] I fell asleep. And the Spirit carried me away, and took me through a pathless place,[fn-2-P215_25549:4-nf] through which a man could not travel, for it was situated in the midst of rocks; it was rugged and impassible on account of water. Having passed over this river, I came to a plain. I then bent down on my knees, and began to pray to the Lord[fn-2-P216_25888:5-nf] and to confess my sins. And as I prayed, the heavens were opened, and I see the woman whom I had desired saluting me from the sky, and saying, \"Hail, Hermas!\" And looking up to her, I said, \"Lady, what doest thou here? \"And she answered me, \"I have been taken up here to accuse you of your sins before the Lord.\" \"Lady,\" said I, \"are you to be the subject of my accusation? \"[fn-2-P217_26290:6-nf] \"No,\" said she; \"but hear the words which I am going to speak to you. God, who dwells in the heavens, and made out of nothing the things that exist, and multiplied and increased them on account of His holy Church,[fn-2-P218_26592:7-nf] is angry with you for having sinned against me.\" I answered her, \"Lady, have I sinned against you? How?[fn-2-P219_26718:8-nf] or when spoke I an unseemly word to you? Did I not always think of you as a lady? Did I not always respect you as a sister? Why do you falsely accuse me of this wickedness and impurity? \"With a smile she replied to me, \"The desire of wickedness[fn-2-P220_26997:9-nf] arose within your heart. Is it not your opinion that a righteous man commits sin when an evil desire arises in his heart? There is sin in such a case, and the sin is great,\" said she; \"for the thoughts of a righteous man should be righteous. For by thinking righteously his character is established in the heavens,[fn-2-P221_27400:10-nf] and he has the Lord merciful to him in every business. But such as entertain wicked thoughts in their minds are bringing upon themselves death and captivity; and especially is this the case with those who set their affections on this world,[fn-2-P222_28033:11-nf] and glory in their riches, and look not forward to the blessings of the life to come. For many will their regrets be; for they have no hope, but have despaired of themselves and their life.[fn-2-P223_28256:12-nf] But do thou pray to God, and He will heal thy sins, and the sins of thy whole house, and of all the saints.\"[fn-2-P224_28665:13-nf] ","title":"Vision First","author":"The Pastor of Hermas"},{"chapter":17,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"505","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"12.

The faith has been preached there by an apostle, heathenism has been trodden down, the name of Christian is daily exalted higher and higher. But the display, power, and size of the city, the seeing and the being seen, the paying and the receiving of visits, the alternate flattery and detraction, talking and listening, as well as the necessity of facing so great a throng even when one is least in the mood to do so-all these things are alike foreign to the principles and fatal to the repose of the monastic life. For when people come in our way we either see them coming and are compelled to speak, or we do not see them and lay ourselves open to the charge of haughtiness. Sometimes, also, in returning visits we are obliged to pass through proud portals and gilded doors and to face the clamor of carping lackeys. But, as we have said above, in the cottage of Christ all is simple and rustic: and except for the chanting of psalms there is complete silence. Wherever one turns the laborer at his plough sings alleluia, the toiling mower cheers himself with psalms, and the vine-dresser while he prunes his vine sings one of the lays of David.

Now the rule in regard to this variation has two forms. For things that signify now one thing and now another, signify either things that are contrary, or things that are only different. They signify contraries, for example, when they are used metaphorically at one time in a good sense, at another in a bad, as in the case of the leaven mentioned above. Another example of the same is that a lion stands for Christ in the place where it is said, \"The lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed;\"[fn-51-P5185_2763286:51-nf] and again, stands for the devil where it is written, \"Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour.\"[fn-51-P5186_2763444:52-nf] In the same way the serpent is used in a good sense, \"Be wise as serpents;\"[fn-51-P5187_2763538:53-nf] and again, in a bad sense, \"The serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty.\"[fn-51-P5188_2763632:54-nf] Bread is used in a good sense, \"I am the living bread which came down from heaven;\"[fn-51-P5189_2763735:55-nf] in a bad, \"Bread eaten in secret is pleasant.\"[fn-51-P5190_2763800:56-nf] And so in a great many other cases. The examples I have adduced are indeed by no means doubtful in their signification, because only plain instances ought to be used as examples.

To whom would He have rather made known the veiled import of His own language, than to him to whom He disclosed the likeness of His own glory-to Peter, John, and James, and afterwards to Paul, to whom He granted participation in (the joys of) paradise too, prior to his martyrdom? Or do they also write differently from what they think-teachers using deceit, not truth? Addressing the Christians of Pontus, Peter, at all events, says, \"How great indeed is the glory, if ye suffer patiently, without being punished as evildoers! For this is a lovely feature, and even hereunto were ye called, since Christ also suffered for us, leaving you Himself as an example, that ye should follow His own steps.\"[fn-110-P11074_3143848:79-nf] And again: \"Beloved, be not alarmed by the fiery trial which is taking place among you, as though some strange thing happened unto you.

If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; because glory and the Spirit of God rest upon you: if only none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a busybody in other men's matters; yet (if any man suffer) as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf.\"[fn-110-P11075_3144490:80-nf] John, in fact, exhorts us to lay down our lives even for our brethren,[fn-110-P11076_3144618:81-nf] affirming that there is no fear in love: \"For perfect love casteth out fear, since fear has punishment; and he who fears is not perfect in love.\"[fn-110-P11077_3144785:82-nf] What fear would it be better to understand (as here meant), than that which gives rise to denial? What love does he assert to be perfect, but that which puts fear to flight, and gives courage to confess? What penalty will he appoint as the punishment of fear, but that which he who denies is about to pay, who has to be slain, body and soul, in hell? And if he teaches that we must die for the brethren, how much more for the Lord,-he being sufficiently prepared, by his own Revelation too, forgiving such advice! For indeed the Spirit had sent the injunction to the angel of the church in Smyrna: \"Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.\"[fn-110-P11078_3145557:83-nf] Also to the angel of the church in Pergamus (mention was made) of Antipas,[fn-110-P11079_3145650:84-nf] the very faithful martyr, who was slain where Satan dwelleth. Also to the angel of the church in Philadelphia[fn-110-P11080_3145778:85-nf] (it was signified) that he who had not denied the name of the Lord was delivered from the last trial. Then to every conqueror the Spirit promises now the tree of life, and exemption from the second death; now the hidden manna with the stone of glistening whiteness, and the name unknown ( to every man save him that receiveth it); now power to rule with a rod of iron, and the brightness of the morning star; now the being clothed in white raiment, and not having the name blotted out of the book of life, and being made in the temple of God a pillar with the inscription on it of the name of God and of the Lord, and of the heavenly Jerusalem; now a sitting with the Lord on His throne,-which once was persistently refused to the sons of Zebedee.[fn-110-P11081_3146545:86-nf] Who, pray, are these so blessed conquerors, but martyrs in the strict sense of the word? For indeed theirs are the victories whose also are the fights; theirs, however, are the fights whose also is the blood. But the souls of the martyrs both peacefully rest in the meantime under the altar,[fn-110-P11082_3146859:87-nf] and support their patience by the assured hope of revenge; and, clothed in their robes, wear the dazzling halo of brightness, until others also may fully share in their glory. For yet again a countless throng are revealed, clothed in white and distinguished by palms of victory, celebrating their triumph doubtless over Antichrist, since one of the elders says, \"These are they who come out of that great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\"[fn-110-P11083_3147370:88-nf] For the flesh is the clothing of the soul.

A hard matter has he put to us, my brethren! It is well for us that he should tell us himself how we are to discern them. He is about to tell us: fear not: but first see; mark: see that hereby is expressed the very thing that vain heretics[fn-44-P4403_2379452:47-nf] taunt us withal. Mark, see what he says, \"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they be from God.\" The Holy Spirit is spoken of in the Gospel by the name of water; where the Lord \"cried and said, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\"[fn-44-P4404_2379821:48-nf] But the evangelist has expounded of what He said this: for he goes on to say, \"But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believed on Him should receive.\" Wherefore did not the Lord baptize many? But what saith he? \"For the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\" Then seeing those had baptism, and had not yet received the Holy Ghost, whom on the day of Pentecost the Lord sent from heaven, the glorifying of the Lord was first waited for, so that the Spirit might be given. Even before He was glorified, and before He sent the Spirit, He yet invited men to prepare themselves for the receiving of the water of which He said, \"Whoso thirsteth, let him come and drink;\" and, \"He that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\" What meaneth, \"Rivers of living water\"? What is that water? Let no man ask me; ask the Gospel. \"But this,\" saith it, \"He said of the Spirit, which they should receive that should believe on Him.\" Consequently, the water of the sacrament is one thing: another, the water which betokens the Spirit of God. The water of the sacrament is visible: the water of the Spirit invisible. That washes the body, and betokens that which is done in the soul. By this Spirit the soul itself is cleansed and fed. This is the Spirit of God, which heretics and all that cut themselves off from the Church, cannot have. And whosoever do not openly cut themselves off, but by iniquity are cut off, and being within, whirl about as chaff and are not grain; these have not this Spirit. This Spirit is denoted by the Lord under the name of water: and we have heard from this epistle, \"Believe not every spirit;\" and those words of Solomon bear witness, \"From strange water keep thee far.\"[fn-44-P4405_2381603:49-nf] What meaneth, \"water\"? Spirit. Does water always signify spirit? Not always: but in some places it signifies the Spirit, in some places it signifies baptism, in some places signifies peoples,[fn-44-P4406_2381819:50-nf] in some places signifies counsel: thus thou findest it said in a certain place, \"Counsel is a fountain of life to them that possess it.\"[fn-44-P4407_2381976:51-nf] So then, in divers places of the Scriptures, the term \"water\" signifies divers things. Now however by the term water ye have heard the Holy Spirit spoken of, not by an interpretation of ours but by witness of the Gospel, where it saith, \"But this said He of the Spirit, which they should receive that should believe on Him.\" If then by the name of water is signified the Holy Spirit, and this epistle saith to us, \"Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they be of God;\" let us understand that of this it is said, \"From strange water keep thee far, and from a strange fountain drink thou not.\"[fn-44-P4408_2382608:52-nf] What meaneth, \"From a strange fountain drink thou not\"?

He teaches us what the ten horns shall be which were seen by Daniel, telling us that thus it had been said to him: \"And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet, but shall receive power as if kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and give their strength and power to the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, because He is the Lord of lords and the King of kings.\"[fn-92-P9263_2699664:228-nf] It is manifest, therefore, that of these [potentates], he who is to come shall slay three, and subject the remainder to his power, and that he shall be himself the eighth among them. And they shall lay Babylon waste, and burn her with fire, and shall give their kingdom to the beast, and put the Church to flight. After that they shall be destroyed by the coming of our Lord. For that the kingdom must be divided, and thus come to ruin, the Lord [declares when He] says: \"Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.\"[fn-92-P9264_2700292:229-nf] It must be, therefore, that the kingdom, the city, and the house be divided into ten; and for this reason He has already foreshadowed the partition and division [which shall take place]. Daniel also says particularly, that the end of the fourth kingdom consists in the toes of the image seen by Nebuchadnezzar, upon which came the stone cut out without hands; and as he does himself say: \"The feet were indeed the one part iron, the other part clay, until the stone was cut out without hands, and struck the image upon the iron and clay feet, and dashed them into pieces, even to the end.\"[fn-92-P9265_2700904:230-nf] Then afterwards, when interpreting this, he says: \"And as thou sawest the feet and the toes, partly indeed of clay, and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided, and there shall be in it a root of iron, as thou sawest iron mixed with baked clay. And the toes were indeed the one part iron, but the other part clay.\"[fn-92-P9266_2701248:231-nf] The ten toes, therefore, are these ten kings, among whom the kingdom shall be partitioned, of whom some indeed shall be strong and active, or energetic; others, again, shall be sluggish and useless, and shall not agree; as also Daniel says: \"Some part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part shall be broken from it. As thou sawest the iron mixed with the baked clay, there shall be minglings among the human race, but no cohesion one with the other, just as iron cannot be welded on to pottery ware.\"[fn-92-P9267_2701775:232-nf] And since an end shall take place, he says: \"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven raise up a kingdom which shall never decay, and His kingdom shall not be left to another people. It shall break in pieces and shatter all kingdoms, and shall itself be exalted for ever. As thou sawest that the stone was cut without hands from the mountain, and brake in pieces the baked clay, the iron, the brass, the silver, and the gold, God has pointed out to the king what shall come to pass after these things; and the dream is true, and the interpretation trustworthy.\"[fn-92-P9268_2702375:233-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":17,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_63_book_v_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"163","folder":"ANF-01","text":"4.

Augustin answered: Any one that hears these words, without being acquainted with the Scriptures, and who does not believe that you are either so far astray as not to know what you are saying, or deceiving in such wise that he whom you have deceived should not know what he says, would believe that the prophet Jeremiah, wishing to be baptized, had taken precautions not to be baptized by impious men, and had used these words with this intent. For what was your object in saying, previous to your quotation of this passage, \"Imitate indeed the prophets, who feared to have their holy souls deceived with false baptism?\" Just as though, in the days of Jeremiah, any one were washed with the sacrament of baptism, except so far as the Pharisees almost every moment bathed themselves, and their couches and cups and platters, with the washings which the Lord condemned, as we read in the gospel.[fn-54-P5469_2645962:316-nf] How then could Jeremiah have said this, as though he desired to be baptized, and sought to avoid being baptized by impious men? He said it, then, when he was complaining of a faithless people, by the corruption of whose morals he was vexed, not wishing to associate with their deeds; and yet he did not separate himself bodily from their congregation, nor seek other sacraments than those which the people received as suitable to that time, according to the law of Moses. To this people, therefore, in their evil mode of life, he gave the name of \"a wound,\" with which the heart of the righteous man was grievously smitten, whether speaking thus of himself, or fore-shadowing in himself what he foresaw would come to pass. For he speaks as follows: \"O Lord, remember me, and visit me; make clear my innocence before those who persecute me in no spirit of long-suffering: know that for Thy sake I have suffered rebuke from those that scorn Thy words. Make their portion complete; and Thy word shall be unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, O Lord God of hosts. I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, but was afraid of the presence of Thy hand; I sat alone, because I was filled with bitterness. Why do those who make me sad prevail against me? My wound is grievous; whence shall I be healed? It is become unto me as lying water, that has no faith.\"[fn-54-P5470_2647369:317-nf] In all this it is manifest what the prophet wished to be understood, but manifest only to those who do not wish to distort to their own perverse cause the meaning of what they read. For Jeremiah says that his wound has become unto him as lying water, which cannot inspire faith; but he wished that by his wound those should be understood who made him sad by the evil conduct of their lives. Whence also the apostle says, \"Without were fightings, within were fears;\"[fn-54-P5471_2647867:318-nf] and again, \"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?\"[fn-54-P5472_2647967:319-nf] And because he had no hopes that they could be reformed, therefore he said, \"Whence shall I be healed?\" as though his own pain must needs continue so long as those among whom he was compelled to live continued what they were. But that a people is commonly understood under the appellation of water is shown in the Apocalypse, where we understand \"many waters\" to mean \"many peoples,\" not by any conjecture of our own, but by an express explanation in the place itself.[fn-54-P5473_2648458:320-nf] Abstain then from blaspheming the sacrament of baptism from any misunderstanding, or rather error, even when found in a man of most abandoned character; for not even in the lying Simon was the baptism which he received a lying water,[fn-54-P5474_2648714:321-nf] nor do all the liars of your party administer a lying water when they baptize in the name of the Trinity. For neither do they begin to be liars only when they are betrayed and convicted, and so forced to acknowledge their misdeeds; but rather they were already liars, when, being adulterers and accursed, they pretended to be chaste and innocent.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":17,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_62_book_iii_","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"38. See now how Petilianus, to avoid answering this question, or to avoid being proved to be incapable of answering it, wanders off vainly into irrelevant matter in abuse of us, accusing us and proving nothing; and when he chances to make an endeavor to resist, with something like a show of fighting for his cause, he is everywhere overcome with the greatest ease. But yet he nowhere gives an answer of any kind to this one question which we ask: If the conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, by what means is he to be cleansed who received baptism while the conscience of the giver was polluted, without the knowledge of him who was to receive it? for in these words, which he quoted from my epistle, he set me forth as asking a question, while he showed himself as giving no answer. For after saying what I have just now recited, and when, on being brought into a great strait on every side, he had been compelled to say that the baptizer ought to be examined by the candidate for baptism, and the candidate in turn by the baptizer; and when he had tried to fortify this statement by the example of John, in hopes that he might find auditors either of the greatest negligence or of the greatest ignorance, he then went on to advance other testimonies of Scripture wholly irrelevant to the matter in hand, as the saying of the eunuch to Philip, \"See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?\"[fn-57-P5710_2758591:74-nf] \"inasmuch as he knew,\" says he, \"that those of abandoned character were prevented;\" arguing that the reason why Philip did not forbid him to be baptized was because he had proved, in his reading of the Scriptures, how far he believed in Christ,-as though he had prohibited Simon Magus. And again, he urges that the prophets were afraid of being deceived by false baptism, and that therefore Isaiah said, \"Lying water that has not faith,\"[fn-57-P5711_2759049:75-nf] as though showing that water among faithless men is lying; whereas it is not Isaiah but Jeremiah that says this of lying men, calling the people in a figure water, as is most clearly shown in the Apocalypse.[fn-57-P5712_2759306:76-nf] And again, he quotes as words of David, \"Let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head,\" when David has been speaking of the flattery of the smooth speaker deceiving with false praise, so as to lead the head of the man praised to wax great with pride. And this meaning is made manifest by the words immediately preceding in the same psalm. For he says, \"Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me: but the oil of the sinner shall not break my head.\"[fn-57-P5713_2759807:77-nf] What can be clearer than this sentence? what more manifest? For he declares that he had rather be reproved in kindness with the sharp correction of the righteous, so that he may be healed, than anointed with the soft speaking of the flatterer, so as to be puffed up with pride.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":17,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_17_part_i_exegetical_fragments_from_commentaries_on_various_books_of_scripture_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"203","folder":"ANF-05","text":"4.

Of this pool, which was surrounded with five porches, in which lay a great multitude of sick folk, I remember that I have very often treated; and most of you will with me recollect what I am about to say, rather than gain the knowledge of it for the first time. But it is by no means unprofitable to go back upon matters already known, that both they who know not may be instructed, and they who do know may be confirmed. Therefore, as being already known, these things must be touched upon briefly, not leisurely inculcated. That pool and that water seem to me to have signified the Jewish people. For that peoples are signified under the name of waters the Apocalypse of John clearly indicates to us, where, after he had been shown many waters, and he had asked what they were, was answered that they were peoples.[fn-9-P929_519960:1-nf] That water, then-namely, that people-was shut in by the five books of Moses, as by five porches. But those books brought forth the sick, not healed them. For the law convicted, not acquitted sinners. Accordingly the letter, without grace, made men guilty, whom on confessing grace delivered. For this is what the apostle saith: \"For if a law had been given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.\" Why, then, was the law given? He goes on to say, \"But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\"[fn-9-P930_520593:2-nf] What more evident? Have not these words expounded to us both the five porches, and also the multitude of sick folk? The five porches are the law. Why did not the five porches heal the sick folk? Because, \"if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.\" Why, then, did the porches contain those whom they did not heal? Because \"the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\"","title":"Tractate XVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":17,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_92_sermon_lxxv_cxxv_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"3. Give heed then. Those five porches were significative of the Law, bearing the sick, not healing them; discovering, not curing them. But who did cure the sick? He that descended into the pool. And when did the sick man descend into the pool? When the Angel gave the sign by the moving of the water. For thus was that pool sanctified, for that the Angel came down and moved the water. Men saw the water; and from the motion of the troubled water they understood the presence of the Angel. If any one then went down, he was cured. Why then was not that sick man cured? Let us consider his own words; \"I have no man,\" he says, \"when the water is moved, to put me into the pool, but while I am coming, another steppeth down.\"[fn-59-P5952_2521315:8-nf] Couldest not thou then step down afterwards, if another step down before thee? Here it is shown us, that only one was cured at the moving of the water. Whosoever stepped down first, he alone was cured: but whoever stepped down afterwards, at that moving of the water was not cured, but waited till it was moved again. What then does this mystery[fn-59-P5953_2521675:9-nf] mean? For it is not without a meaning. Attend, Beloved. Waters are put in the Apocalypse for a figure of peoples. For when in the Apocalypse John saw many waters, he asked what it meant, and it was told him that they were peoples.[fn-59-P5954_2521924:10-nf] The water then of the pool signified the people of the Jews. For as that people was held in by the five books of Moses in the Law, so that water too was enclosed by five porches. When was the water troubled? When the people of the Jews was troubled. And when was the people of the Jews troubled, but when the Lord Jesus Christ came? The Lord's Passion was the troubling of the water. For the Jews were troubled when the Lord suffered. See, what was just now read had relation to this troubling. \"The Jews wished to kill Him, not only because He did these things on the sabbaths, but because He called Himself the Son of God, making Himself equal with God.\"[fn-59-P5955_2522601:11-nf] For Christ called Himself the Son after one manner, in another was it said to men, \"I said, Ye are Gods, and ye are all children of the Most High.\"[fn-59-P5956_2522766:12-nf] For if He had made Himself the Son of God in such sort as any man whatever may be called the son of God (for by the grace of God men are called sons of God); the Jews would not have been enraged. But because they understand Him to call Himself the Son of God in another way, according to that, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;\"[fn-59-P5957_2523162:13-nf] and according to what the Apostle saith, \"Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God;\"[fn-59-P5958_2523296:14-nf] they saw a than, and they were enraged, because He made Himself equal with God. But He well knew that He was equal, but wherein they saw not. For that which they saw they wished to crucify; by That which they saw not, they were judged. What did the Jews see? What the Apostles also saw, when Philip said, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\"[fn-59-P5959_2523662:15-nf] But what did the Jews not see? What not even the Apostles saw, when the Lord answered, \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet have ye not known Me? He that seeth Me, seeth the Father also.\"[fn-59-P5960_2523875:16-nf] Because then the Jews were not able to see This in Him, they held Him for a proud and ungodly man, making Himself equal with God. Here was a troubling, the water was troubled, the Angel had come. For the Lord is called also the \"Angel of the Great Counsel,\"[fn-59-P5961_2524151:17-nf] in that He is the messenger of the Father's will. For Angel in Greek is in Latin \"messenger\". So you have the Lord saying that He announces to us the kingdom of Heaven. He then bad come, the \"Angel of the Great Counsel,\" but the Lord of all the Angels. \"Angel\" on this account, because He took Flesh; the \"Lord of Angels,\" in that by \"Him all things were made, and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-59-P5962_2524570:18-nf] For if all things, Angels too. And therefore Himself was not made, because by Him all things were made. Now what was made, was not made without the operation of the Word.
