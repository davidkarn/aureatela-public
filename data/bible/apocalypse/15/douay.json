{"verses":["And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful:  seven\nangels having the seven last plagues.  For in them is filled up the\nwrath of God.","And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire:  and them\nthat had overcome the beast and his image and the number of his name,\nstanding on the sea of glass, having the harps of God:","And singing the canticle of Moses, the servant of God, and the\ncanticle of the Lamb, saying:  Great and wonderful are thy works, O Lord\nGod Almighty.  Just and true are thy ways, O King of ages.","Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and magnify thy name?  For thou\nonly art holy.  For all nations shall come and shall adore in thy sight,\nbecause thy judgments are manifest.","And after these things, I looked:  and behold, the temple of the\ntabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.","And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven\nplagues, clothed with clean and white linen and girt about the breasts\nwith golden girdles.","And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels\nseven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and\never.","And the temple was filled with smoke from the majesty of God and\nfrom his power.  And no man was able to enter into the temple, till the\nseven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled."]}
