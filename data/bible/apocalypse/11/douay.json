And it was said\nto me:  Arise, and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that\nadore therein.","But the court which is without the temple, cast out and measure\nit not:  because it is given unto the Gentiles.  And the holy city they\nshall tread under foot, two and forty months:","And I will give unto my two witnesses:  and they shall prophesy, a\nthousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.","These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks that stand\nbefore the Lord of the earth.","And if any man will hurt them, fire shall come out of their\nmouths and shall devour their enemies.  And if any man will hurt them,\nin this manner must he be slain.","These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of\ntheir prophecy:  And they have power over waters, to turn them into\nblood and to strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.","And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that\nascendeth out of the abyss shall make war against them and shall\novercome them and kill them.","And their bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city which\nis called spiritually, Sodom and Egypt:  where their Lord also was\ncrucified.","And they of the tribes and peoples and tongues and nations shall\nsee their bodies for three days and a half:  and they shall not suffer\ntheir bodies to be laid in sepulchres.","And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and\nmake merry:  and shall send gifts one to another, because these two\nprophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth.","And after three days and a half, the spirit of life from God\nentered into them.  And they stood upon their feet:  and great fear fell\nupon them that saw them.","And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them:  Come\nup hither.  And they went up to heaven in a cloud:  and their enemies saw\nthem.","And at that hour there was made a great earthquake:  and the\ntenth part of the city fell.
