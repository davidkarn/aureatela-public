For as he brought down from above the paternal marks, so again he carries up from thence those marks roused from a dormant condition and rendered paternal characteristics, substantial ones from the unsubstantial Being, transferring them hither from thence. This, he says, is what is spoken: \"I am the door.\"[fn-12-P1241_336681:192-nf] And he transfers (those marks), he says,[fn-12-P1242_336740:193-nf] to those who close the eyelid, as the naphtha drawing the fire in every direction towards itself; nay rather, as the magnet (attracting) the iron and not anything else, or just as the backbone of the sea falcon, the gold and nothing else, or as the chaff is led by the amber. In this manner, he says, is the portrayed, perfect, and con-substantial genus drawn again from the world by the Serpent; nor does he (attract) anything else, as it has been sent down by him. For a proof of this, they adduce the anatomy[fn-12-P1243_337587:194-nf] of the brain, assimilating, from the fact of its immobility, the brain itself to the Father, and the cerebellum to the Son, because of its being moved and being of the form of (the head of) a serpent. And they allege that this (cerebellum), by an ineffable and inscrutable process, attracts through the pineal gland the spiritual and life-giving substance emanating from the vaulted chamber[fn-12-P1244_338074:195-nf] (in which the brain is embedded). And on receiving this, the cerebellum in an ineffable manner imparts the ideas, just as the Son does, to matter; or, in other words, the seeds and the genera of the things produced according to the flesh flow along into the spinal marrow.

For this contemplation is held forth to us as the end of all actions, and the everlasting fullness of joy. For \"we are the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.\"[fn-2-P275_96558:73-nf] For that which He said to His servant Moses, \"I am that I am; thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me to you;\"[fn-2-P276_96714:74-nf] this it is which we shall contemplate when we shall live in eternity. For so it is said, \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\"[fn-2-P277_96933:75-nf] This shall be when the Lord shall have come, and \"shall have brought to light the hidden things of darkness;\"[fn-2-P278_97062:76-nf] when the darkness of this present mortality and corruption shall have passed away. Then will be our morning, which is spoken of in the Psalm, \"In the morning will I direct my prayer unto Thee, and will contemplate Thee.\"[fn-2-P279_97302:77-nf] Of this contemplation I understand it to be said, \"When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father;\" that is, when He shall have brought the just, over whom now, living by faith, the Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, reigns, to the contemplation of God, even the Father. If herein I am foolish, let him who knows better correct me; to me at least the case seems as I have said.[fn-2-P280_97733:78-nf] For we shall not seek anything else, when we shall have come to the contemplation of Him. But that contemplation is not yet, so long as our joy is in hope. For \"hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it,\"[fn-2-P281_98566:79-nf] viz. \"as long as the King sitteth at His table.\"[fn-2-P282_98639:80-nf] Then will take place that which is written, \"In Thy presence is fullness of joy.\"[fn-2-P283_98739:81-nf] Nothing more than that joy will be required; because there will be nothing more than can be required. For the Father will be manifested to us, and that will suffice for us. And this much Philip had well understood, so that he said to the Lord, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\" But he had not yet understood that he himself was able to say this very same thing in this way also: Lord, show Thyself to us, and it sufficeth us. For, that he might understand this, the Lord replied to him, \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\" But because He intended him, before he could see this, to live by faith, He went on to say, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?\"[fn-2-P284_99533:82-nf] For \"while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: for we walk by faith, not by sight.\"[fn-2-P285_99661:83-nf] For contemplation is the recompense of faith, for which recompense our hearts are purified by faith; as it is written, \"Purifying their hearts by faith.\"[fn-2-P286_99836:84-nf] And that our hearts are to be purified for this contemplation, is proved above all by this text, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-2-P287_100007:85-nf] And that this is life eternal, God says in the Psalm, \"With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation,\"[fn-2-P288_100142:86-nf] Whether, therefore, we hear, Show us the Son; or whether we hear, Show us the Father; it is even all one, since neither can be manifested without the other. For they are one, as He also Himself says, \"My Father and I are one.\"[fn-2-P289_100387:87-nf] Finally, on account of this very indivisibility, it suffices that sometimes the Father alone, or the Son alone, should be named, as hereafter to fill us with the joy of His countenance.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"19.

Wherefore, having mastered this rule for interpreting the Scriptures concerning the Son of God, that we are to distinguish in them what relates to the form of God, in which He is equal to the Father, and what to the form of a servant which He took, in which He is less than the Father; we shall not be disquieted by apparently contrary and mutually repugnant sayings of the sacred books. For both the Son and the Holy Spirit, according to the form of God, are equal to the Father, because neither of them is a creature, as we have already shown: but according to the form of a servant He is less than the Father, because He Himself has said, \"My Father is greater than I;\"[fn-3-P327_117822:113-nf] and He is less than Himself, because it is said of Him, He emptied Himself;\"[fn-3-P328_117921:114-nf] and He is less than the Holy Spirit, because He Himself says, \"Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven Him.\"[fn-3-P329_118158:115-nf] And in the Spirit too He wrought miracles, saying: \"But if I with the Spirit of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.\"[fn-3-P330_118327:116-nf] And in Isaiah He says,-in the lesson which He Himself read in the synagogue, and showed without a scruple of doubt to be fulfilled concerning Himself,-\"The Spirit of the Lord God,\" He says, \"is upon me: because He hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek He hath sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives,\"[fn-3-P331_118671:117-nf] etc.: for the doing of which things He therefore declares Himself to be \"sent,\" because the Spirit of God is upon Him.

But that which is prepared by His Father is prepared also by the Son Himself, because He and the Father are one.[fn-3-P370_125744:151-nf] For we have already shown, by many modes of speech in the divine Scriptures, that, in this Trinity, what is said of each is also said of all, on account of the indivisible working of the one and same substance.

But this is the very thing which we have already laid down to be said according to the form of a servant: viz., that we are so to understand \"It is not mine to give,\" as if it were said, This is not in the power of man to give; that so He may be understood to give it through that wherein He is God equal to the Father. \"It is not mine,\" He says, \"to give;\" that is, I do not give these things by human power, but \"to those for whom it is prepared by my Father;\" but then take care you understand also, that if \"all things which the Father hath are mine,\"[fn-3-P373_127657:154-nf] then this certainly is mine also, and I with the Father have prepared these things.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_10_book_vi_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"139","folder":"ANF-05","text":"All the prophets, therefore, and the law spoke by means of the Demiurge,-a silly god,[fn-16-P1606_478065:93-nf] he says, (and themselves) fools, who knew nothing.

Some things, then, are so put in the Scriptures concerning the Father and the Son, as to intimate the unity and equality of their substance; as, for instance, \"I and the Father are one;\"[fn-4-P445_158446:5-nf] and, \"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God;\"[fn-4-P446_158544:6-nf] and whatever ether texts there are of the kind. And some, again, are so put that they show the Son as less on account of the form of a servant, that is, of His having taken upon Him the creature of a changeable and human substance; as, for instance, that which says, \"For my Father is greater than I;\"[fn-4-P447_158862:7-nf] and, \"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.\" For a little after he goes on to say, \"And hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man.\" And further, some are so put, as to show Him at that time neither as lessnor as equal, but only to intimate that He isof the Father; as, for instance, that whichsays, \"For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself;\" and that other: \"The Soncan do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do.\"[fn-4-P448_159431:8-nf] For if we shall take this to be therefore so said, because the Son is less in the form taken from the creature, it will follow that the Father must have walked on the water, or opened the eyes with clay and spittle of some other one born blind, and have done the other things which the Son appearing in the flesh did among men, before the Son did them;[fn-4-P449_159811:9-nf] in order that He might be able to do those things, who said that the Son was not able to do anything of Himself, except what He hath seen the Father do. Yet who, even though he were mad, would think this? It remains, therefore, that these texts are so expressed, because the life of the Son is unchangeable as that of the Father is, and yet He is of the Father; and the working of the Father and of the Son is indivisible, and yet so to work is given to the Son from Him of whom He Himself is, that is, from the Father; and the Son so sees theFather, as that He is the Son in the very seeing Him. For to be of the Father, that is, to be born of the Father. is to Him nothing else than to see the Father; and to see Him working, is nothing else than to work with Him: but therefore not from Himself, because Heis not from Himself. And, therefore, those things which \"He sees the Father do, these also doeth the Son likewise,\" because He is of the Father. For He neither does other things in like manner, as a painter paints other pictures, in the same way as he sees others to have been painted by another man; nor the same things in a different manner, as the body expresses the same letters, which the mind has thought; but \"whatsoever things,\" saith He, \"the Father doeth, these same things also doeth the Son likewise.\"[fn-4-P450_161172:10-nf] He has said both these same things,\" and \"likewise;\" and hence the working of both the Father and the Son is indivisible and equal, but it is from the Father to the Son. Therefore the Son cannot do anything of Himself, except what He seeth the Father do. From this rule, then, whereby the Scriptures so speak as to mean, not to set forth one as less than another, but only to show which is of which, some have drawn this meaning, as if the Son were said to be less. And some among ourselves who are more unlearned and least instructed in these things, endeavoring to take these texts according to the form of a servant, and so mis-interpreting them, are troubled. And to prevent this, the rule in question is to be observed whereby the Son is not less, but it is simply intimated that He is of the Father, in which words not His inequality but His birth is declared.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"9. Perhaps some one may wish to drive us to say, that the Son is sent also by Himself, because the conception and childbirth of Mary is the working of the Trinity, by whose act of creating all things are created. And how, he will go on to say, has the Father sent Him, if He sent Himself? To whom I answer first, by asking him to tell me, if he can, in what manner the Father hath sanctified Him, if He hath sanctified Himself? For the same Lord says both; \"Say ye of Him,\" He says, \"whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God;\"[fn-4-P482_172618:28-nf] while in another place He says, \"And for their sake I sanctify myself.\"[fn-4-P483_172707:29-nf] I ask, also, in what manner the Father delivered Him, if He delivered Himself? For the Apostle Paul says both: \"Who,\" he says, \"spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all;\"[fn-4-P484_172913:30-nf] while elsewhere he says of the Saviour Himself, \"Who loved me, and delivered Himself for me.\"[fn-4-P485_173027:31-nf] He will reply, I suppose, if he has a right sense in these things, Because the will of the Father and the Son is one, and their working indivisible. In like manner, then, let him understand the incarnation and nativity of the Virgin, wherein the Son is understood as sent, to have been wrought by one and the same operation of the Father and of the Son indivisibly; the Holy Spirit certainly not being thence excluded, of whom it is expressly said, \"She was found with child by the Holy Ghost.\" For perhaps our meaning will be more plainly unfolded, if we ask in what manner God sent His Son. He commanded that He should come, and He, complying with the commandment, came. Did He then request, or did He only suggest? But whichever of these it was, certainly it was done by a word, and the Word of God is the Son of God Himself. Wherefore, since the Father sent Him by a word, His being sent was the work of both the Father and His Word; therefore the same Son was sent by the Father and the Son, because the Son Himself is the Word of the Father. For who would embrace so impious an opinion as to think the Father to have uttered a word in time, in order thatthe eternal Son might thereby be sent and might appear in the flesh in the fullness oftime? But assuredly it was in that Word of God itself which was in the beginning with God and was God, namely, in the wisdom itself of God, apart from time, at what time that wisdom must needs appear in the flesh. Therefore, since without any commencement of time, the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, it was in the Word itself without any time, at what time the Word was to be made flesh and dwell among us.[fn-4-P486_174743:32-nf] And when this fullness of time had come, \"God sent His Son, made of a woman,\"[fn-4-P487_174844:33-nf] that is, made in time, that the Incarnate Word might appear to men; while it was in that Word Himself, apart from time, at what time this was to be done; for the order of times is in the eternal wisdom of God without time. Since, then, that the Son should appear in the flesh was wrought by both the Father and the Son, it is fitly said that He who appeared in that flesh was sent, and that He who did not appear in it, sent Him; because those things which are transacted outwardly before the bodily eyes have their existence from the inward structure (apparatu) of the spiritual nature, and on that account are filly said to be sent. Further, that form of man which He took is the person of the Son, not also of the Father; on which account the invisible Father, together with the Son, who with the Father is invisible, is said to have sent the same Son by making Him visible. But if He became visible in such way as to cease to be invisible with the Father, that is, if the substance of the invisible Word were turned by a change and transition into a visible creature, then the Son would be so understood to be sent by the Father, that He would be found to be only sent; not also, with the Father, sending. But since He so took the form of a servant, as that the unchangeable form of God remained, it is clear that that which became apparent in the Son was done by the Father and the Son not being apparent; that is, that by the invisible Father, with the invisible Son, the same Son Himself was sent so as to be visible. Why, therefore, does He say, \"Neither came I of myself?\" This, we may now say, is said according to the form of a servant, in the same way as it is said, \"I judge no man.\"[fn-4-P488_176558:34-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"946","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"3.

In the same book he writes: \"it remains that God is invisible. But if He is by nature invisible, He must beso even to the Saviour.\" And lower down: \"no soul which has descended into a human body has borne upon it so true an impress of its previous character as Christ's soul of which He says: `no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.'\"[fn-47-P4728_1284793:3372-nf] And in another place: \"we must carefully consider whether souls, when they have won salvation and have attained to the blessed life, may not cease to be souls. For as the Lord and Saviour came to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-47-P4729_1285047:3373-nf] that it might cease to be lost; so the lost soul which the Lord came to save, when saved, will cease to be a soul. We must ask ourselves whether, as the lost was not lost once and again will not be, the soul likewise may have been and again may be not a soul.\"[fn-47-P4730_1285331:3374-nf] And after a good many remarks upon the soul he brings in the following, \"nouj or\" intelligence by falling becomes a soul; and by acquiring virtue this will become intelligence again. This at least is a fair inference from the case of Esau who for his old sins is condemned to lead a lower life. And concerning the heavenly bodies we must make a similar acknowledgment. The soul of the sun-or whatever else you like to call it-does not date its existence from the creation of the world; it already existed before it entered its shining and glowing body. So also with the moon and stars. From antecedent causes they have been made subject to vanity not willingly but for future reward,[fn-47-P4731_1286149:3375-nf] and are forced to do not their own will but the creator's who has assigned to them their several spheres.\"7. Hellfire, moreover, and the torments with which holy scripture threatens sinners he explains not as external punishments but as the pangs of guilty consciences when by God's power the memory of our transgressions is set before our eyes. \"The whole crop of our sins grows up afresh from seeds which remain in the soul, and all our dishonourable and undutiful acts are again pictured before our gaze. Thus it is the fire of conscience and the stings of remorse which torture the mind as it looks back on former self-indulgence.\" And again: \"but perhaps this coarse and earthly body ought to be described as mist and darkness; for at the end of this world and when it becomes necessary to pass into another, the like darkness will lead to the like physical birth.\" In speaking thus he clearly pleads for the transmigration of souls as taught by Pythagoras and Plato.[fn-47-P4732_1287147:3376-nf] . And at the end of the second book in dealing with our perfection he has said: \"when we shall have made such progress as not only to cease to be flesh or body but perhaps also to cease to be souls our perfect intelligence and perception, undimmed with any mist of passion, will discern reasonable and intelligible substances face to face.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_100_epistle_lxxv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"ANF-05","text":"5.

Wherefore, since the spirit is to be preferred to the body, and the death of thespirit means that God has left it, but the death of the body that the spirit has left it; and since herein lies the punishment in the death of the body, that the spirit leaves the body against its will, because it left God willingly; so that, whereas the spirit left God because it would, it leaves the body although it would not; nor leaves it when it would, unless it has offered violence to itself, whereby the body itself is slain: the spirit of the Mediator showed how it was through no punishment of sin that He came to the death of the flesh, because He did not leave it against His will, but because He willed, when He willed, as He willed. For because He is so commingled [with the flesh] by the Word of God as to be one, He says: \"I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay down my life that I might take it again.\"[fn-9-P920_352013:73-nf] And, as the Gospel tells us, they who were present were most astonished at this, that after that [last] word, in which He set forth the figure of our sin, He immediately gave up His spirit. For they who are hung on the cross are commonly tortured by a prolonged death. Whence it was that the legs of the thieves were broken, in order that they might die directly, and be taken down from the cross before the Sabbath. And that He was found to be dead already, caused wonder.

As, therefore, the Father begat, the Son is begotten; so the Father sent, the Son was sent. But in like manner as He who begat and He who was begotten, so both He who sent and He who was sent, are one, since the Father and the Son are one.[fn-9-P985_386032:111-nf] So also the Holy Spirit is one with them, since these three are one. For as to be born, in respect to the Son, means to be from the Father; so to be sent, in respect to the Son, means to be known to be from the Father. And as to be the gift of God in respect to the Holy Spirit, means to proceed from the Father; so to be sent, is to be known to proceed from the Father. Neither can we say that the Holy Spirit does not also proceed from the Son, for the same Spirit is not without reason said to be the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son.[fn-9-P986_386597:112-nf] Nor do I see what else He intended to signify, when He breathed on the face of the disciples, and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P987_386852:113-nf] For that bodily breathing, proceeding from the body with the feeling of bodily touching, was not the substance of the Holy Spirit, but a declaration by a fitting sign, that the Holy Spirit proceeds not only from the Father, but also from the Son. For the veriest of madmen would not say, that it was one Spirit which He gave when He breathed on them, and another which He sent after His ascension.[fn-9-P988_387270:114-nf] For the Spirit of God is one, the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, the Holy Spirit, who worketh all in all.[fn-9-P989_387403:115-nf] But that He was given twice was certainly a significant economy, which we will discuss in its place, as far as the Lord may grant. That then which the Lord says,-\"Whom I will send unto you from the Father,\"[fn-9-P990_387633:116-nf] -shows the Spirit to be both of the Father and of the Son; because, also, when He had said, \"Whom the Father will send,\" He added also, \"in my name.\"[fn-9-P991_387803:117-nf] Yet He did not say, Whom the Father will send from me, as He said, \"Whom Iwill send unto you from the Father,\"-showing, namely, that the Father is the beginning (principium) of the whole divinity, or if it is better so expressed, deity.[fn-9-P992_388061:118-nf] He, therefore, who proceeds from the Father and from the Son, is referred back to Him from whom the Son was born (natus). And that which the evangelist says, \"For the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified;\"[fn-9-P993_389484:119-nf] how is this to be understood, unless because the special giving or sending of the Holy Spirit after the glorification of Christ was to be such as it had never been before? For it was not previously none at all, but it had not been such as this. For if the Holy Spirit was not given before, wherewith were the prophets who spoke filled? Whereas the Scripture plainly says, and shows in many places, that they spake by the Holy Spirit. Whereas, also, it is said of John the Baptist, \"And he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.\" And his father Zacharias is found to have been filled with the Holy Ghost, so as to say such things of him. And Mary, too, was filled with the Holy Ghost, so as to foretell such things of the Lord, whom she was bearing in her womb.[fn-9-P994_390293:120-nf] And Simeon and Anna were filled with the Holy Spirit, so as to acknowledge the greatness of the little child Christ.[fn-9-P995_390437:121-nf] How, then, was \"the Spirit not yet given, since Jesus was not yet glorified,\" unless because that giving, or granting, or mission of the Holy Spirit was to have a certain speciality of its own in its very advent, such as never was before? For we read nowhere that men spoke in tongues which they did not know, through the Holy Spirit coming upon them; as happened then, when it was needful that His coming should be made plain by visible signs, in order to show that the whole world, and all nations constituted with different tongues, should believe in Christ through the gift of the Holy Spirit, to fulfill that which is sung in the Psalm, \"There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard; their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"[fn-9-P996_391256:122-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_06_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Some one accordingly asked them whether the Word of God could be changed, as the devil has been? and they feared not to say, `Yes, he could; for being begotten, he is susceptible of change' We then, with the bishops of Egypt and Libya, being assembled together to the number of nearly a hundred, have anathematized Arius for his shameless avowal of these heresies, together with all such as have countenanced them.

Moreover we have intimated this to your piety, beloved and most honored fellow-ministers, in order the ye might neither receive any of them, if they should presume to come to you, nor be induced to put confidence in Eusebius, or any other who may write to you about them. For it is incumbent on us who are Christians, to turn away from all those who speak or entertain a thought against Christ, as from those who are resisting God, and are destroyers of the souls of men: neither does it become us even `to saute such men,'[fn-2-P234_63088:33-nf] as the blessed John has prohibited, `lest we should at any time be made partakers of their sins.'

Wherefore,-to being now to answer the adversaries of our faith, respecting those things also, which are neither said as they are thought, nor thought as they really are:-among the many things which the Arians are wont to dispute against the Catholic faith, they seem chiefly to set forth this, as their most crafty device, namely, that whatsoever is said or understood of God, is said not according to accident, but according to substance: and therefore, to be unbegotten belongs to the Father according to substance, and to be begotten belongs to the Son according to substance; but to be unbegotten and to be begotten are different; therefore the substance of the Father and that of the Son are different. To whom we reply, If whatever is spoken of God is spoken according to substance, then that which is said, \"I and the Father are one,\"[fn-10-P1026_405129:5-nf] is spoken according to substance. Therefore there is one substance of the Father and the Son. Or if this is not said according to substance, then something is said of God not according to substance, and therefore we are no longer compelled to understand unbegotten and begotten according to substance. it is also said of the Son, \"He thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\"[fn-10-P1027_405524:6-nf] We ask, equal according to what? For if He is not said to be equal according to substance, then they admit that something may be said of God not according to substance.

If then \"he that speaketh a lie speaketh of his own,\" he who speaketh the truth speaketh of God. John is true, Christ is the Truth; John is true, but every true man is true from the Truth.

It is manifest that it was this; who, then, sent thee? Perhaps the Father. True God is the Father, and the Truth is God the Son: if the Father without the Son sent thee, God without the Truth sent thee; but if thou art true, because thou dost speak the truth, and dost, speak of the Truth, the Father did not send thee without the Son, but the Father and the Son together sent thee. If, then, the Son sent thee with the Father, how didst thou not know Him by whom thou wast sent?

But if nothing is spoken of the Father as such, except that which is spoken of Him in relation to the Son, that is, that He is His father, or begetter, or beginning; and if also the begetter is by consequence a beginning to that which he begets of himself; but whatever else is spoken of Him is so spoken as with the Son, or rather in the Son; whether that He is great with that greatness which He begat, or just with that justice which He begat, or good with that goodness which He begat, or powerful with that force or power which He begat, or wise with that wisdom which He begat: yet the Father is not said to be greatness itself, but the begetter of greatness; but the Son, as He is called the Son as such, is not so called with the Father but in relation to the Father, so is not great in and by himself, but with the Father, of whom He is the greatness; and so also is called wise with the Father, of whom He Himself is the wisdom; just as the Father is called wise with the Son, because He is wise with that wisdom which He begat; therefore the one is not called without the other, whatever they are called in respect to themselves; that is, whatever they are called that manifests their essential nature, both are so called together;-if these things are so, then the Father is not God without the Son, nor the Son God without the Father, but both together are God. And that which is said, \"In the beginning was the Word,\" means that the Word was in the Father, Or if \"In the beginning\" is intended to mean, Before all things; then in that which follows, \"And the Word was with God,\" the Son alone is understood to be the Word, not the Father and Son together, as though both were one Word (for He is the Word in the same way as He is the Image, but the Father and Son are not both together the Image, but the Son alone is the Image of the Father: just as He is also the Son of the Father, for both together are not the Son). But in that which is added, \"And the Word was with God,\" there is much reason to understand thus: \"The Word,\" which is the Son alone, \"was with God,\" which is not the Father alone, but God the Father and the Son together.[fn-11-P1113_455739:2-nf] But what wonder is there, if this can be said in the case of some twofold things widely different from each other? For what are so different as soul and body? Yet we can say the soul was with a man, that is, in a man; although the soul is not the body, and man is both soul and body together. So that what follows in the Scripture, \"And the Word was God,\"[fn-11-P1114_456733:3-nf] may be understood thus: The Word, which is not the Father, was God together with the Father. Are we then to say thus, that the Father is the begetter of His own greatness, that is, the begetter of His own power, or the begetter of His own wisdom; and that the Son is greatness, and power, and wisdom; but that the great, omnipotent, and wise God, is both together? How then God of God, Light of Light? For not both together are God of God, but only the Son is of God, that is to say, of the Father; nor are both together Light of Light, but the Son only is of Light, that is, of the Father. Unless, perhaps, it was in order to intimate and inculcate briefly that the Son is co-eternal with the Father, that it is said, God of God, and Light of Light, or anything else of the like kind: as if to say, This which is not the Son without the Father, of this which is not the Father without the Son; that is, this Light which is not Light without the Father, of that Light, viz. the Father, which is not Light without the Son; so that, when it is said, God which is not the Son without the Father, and of God which is not the Father without the Son, it may be perfectly understood that the Begetter did not precede that which He begot. And if this be so, then this alone cannot be said of them, namely, this or that of this or that, which they are not both together. Just as the Word cannot be said to be of the Word, because both are not the Word together, but only the Son; nor image of image, since they are not both together the image; nor Son of Son, since both together are not the Son, according to that which is said, \"I and my Father are one.\"[fn-11-P1115_458396:4-nf] For \"we are one\" means, what He is, that am I also; according to essence, not according to relation.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"81","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"17.

Let us then examine the points one by one. He is good by nature, in the same way as the Father is good, and the Son is good; the creature on the other hand shares in goodness by choosing the good.

Now, short and simple as this utter-ante is, it appears to me, as I consider it that its meanings are many and various. For of the senses in which \"in\" is used, we find that all help our conceptions of the Spirit. Form is said to be in Matter; Power to be in what is capable of it; Habit to be in him who is affected by it; and so on.[fn-18-P1809_468427:522-nf] Therefore, inasmuch as the Holy Spirit perfects rational beings, completing their excellence, He is analogous to Form. For he, who no longer \"lives after the flesh,\"[fn-18-P1810_468612:523-nf] but, being\"led by the Spirit of God,\"[fn-18-P1811_468786:524-nf] is called a Son of God, being\"conformed to tile image of the Son of God,\"[fn-18-P1812_468885:525-nf] is described as spiritual. And as is the power of seeing in the healthy eye, so is the operation of the Spirit in the purified soul. Wherefore also Paul prays for the Ephesians that they may have their\"eyes enlightened\" by \"the Spirit of wisdom.\"[fn-18-P1813_469516:526-nf] And as the art in him who has acquired it, so is the grace of the Spirit in the recipient ever present, though not continuously in operation. For as the art is potentially in the artist, but only in operation when he is working in accordance with it, so also the Spirit is ever present with those that are worthy, but works, as need requires, in prophecies, or in healings, or in some other actual carrying into effect of His potential action.[fn-18-P1814_469982:527-nf] Furthermore as in our bodies is health, or heat, or, generally, their variable conditions, so, very frequently is the Spirit in the soul; since He does not abide with those who, on account of the instability of their will, easily reject the grace which they have received. An instance of this is seen in Saul,[fn-18-P1815_470314:528-nf] and the seventy elders of the children of Israel, except Eldad and Medad, with whom alone the Spirit appears to have remained,[fn-18-P1816_470462:529-nf] and, generally, any one similar to these in character. And like reason in the soul, which is at one time the thought in the heart, and at another speech uttered by the tongue,[fn-18-P1817_470661:530-nf] so is the Holy Spirit, as when He\"beareth witness with our spirit,\"[fn-18-P1818_471173:531-nf] and when lie \"cries in our hearts, Abba, Father,\"[fn-18-P1819_471246:532-nf] or when He speaks on our behalf, as it is said, \"It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of our Father which speaketh in you.\"[fn-18-P1820_471457:533-nf] Again, the Spirit is conceived of, in relation to the distribution of gifts, as a whole in parts. For we all are \"members one of another, having girls differing according to the grace that is given us.\"[fn-18-P1821_471960:534-nf] Wherefore \"the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you,\"[fn-18-P1822_472105:535-nf] but all together complete the Body of Christ in the Unity of the Spirit, and render to one another the needful aid that comes of the gifts. \"But God hath set the members in the body, every one of them, as it hath pleased Him.\"[fn-18-P1823_472351:536-nf] But \"the members have the same care for one another,\"[fn-18-P1824_472425:537-nf] according to the inborn spiritual communion of their sympathy. Wherefore, \"whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.\"[fn-18-P1825_472643:538-nf] And as parts in the whole so are we individually in the Spirit, because we all \"were baptized in one body into one spirit.\"[fn-18-P1826_472791:539-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_12_against_the_epistle_of_manichaeus_called_fundamental_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"7. For I am at a loss to see why this epistle begins, \"Manichaeus, an apostle of Jesus Christ,\" and not Paraclete, an apostle of Jesus Christ. Or if the Paraclete sent by Christ sent Manichaeus, why do we read, \"Manichaeus, an apostle of Jesus Christ,\" instead of Manichaeus, an apostle of the Paraclete?

Why then this new fashion? Does it not savor of trickery of some kind or other?

But in every one that I know of, he writes, of Christ; and not once, of the Paraclete. What do we suppose to be the reason of this, but that pride, the mother of all heretics, impelled the man to desire to seem to have been sent by the Paraclete, but to have been taken into so close a relation as to get the name of Paraclete himself? As the man Jesus Christ was not sent by the Son of God, that is, the power and wisdom of God-by which all things were made, but, according to the Catholic faith, was taken into such a relation as to be Himself the Son of God-that is, that in Himself the wisdom of God was displayed in the healing of sinners,-so Manichaeus wished it to be thought that he was so taken up by the Holy Spirit, whom Christ promised, that we are henceforth to understand that the names Manichaeus and Holy Spirit alike signify the apostle of Jesus Christ,-that is, one sent by Jesus Christ, who promised to send him.

If such is our fear, we ought to erase the words of the Apostle, There is one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus[fn-9-P900_559324:49-nf] , because Photinus uses this to support his heresy, and refuse to read it because he interprets it mischievously. And the fire or the sponge should annihilate the Epistle to the Philippians, lest Marcion should read again in it, And was found in fashion as a man[fn-9-P901_559606:50-nf] , and say Christ's body was only a phantasm and not a body.

We must dispense, too, with the books of Moses, lest the darkness be thought coeval with God who dwells in the unborn light, since in Genesis the day began to be after the night; lest the years of Methuselah extend later than the date of the deluge, and consequently more than eight souls were saved[fn-9-P905_560420:54-nf] lest God hearing the cry of Sodom when the measure of its sins was full should come down as though ignorant of the cry to see if the measure of its sins was full according to the cry, and be found to be ignorant of what He knew; lest any one of those who buried Moses should have known his sepulchre when he was buried; lest these passages, as the heretics think, should prove that the contradictions of the law make it its own enemy. So as they do not understand them, we ought not to read them. And though I should not have said it myself unless forced by the argument, we must, if it seems fit, abolish all the divine and holy Gospels with their message of our salvation, lest their statements be found inconsistent; lest we should read that the Lord who was to send the Holy Spirit was Himself born of the Holy Spirit; lest He who was to threaten death by the sword to those who should take the sword, should before His passion command that a sword should be brought; lest He who was about to descend into hell should say that He would be in paradise with the thief; lest finally the Apostles should be found at fault, in that when commanded to baptize in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, they baptized in the name of Jesus only. I speak to ton, brethren, to you, who are no longer nourished with milk, but with meat, and are strong[fn-9-P906_562291:55-nf] . Shall we, because the wise men of the world have not understood these things, and they are foolish unto them, be wise as the world is wise and believe these things foolish?

Again, if Janus is the world, and the world consists of four quarters, then the image of the two-faced Janus is false. Or if it is true, because the whole world is sometimes understood by the expression east and west, will any one call the world double when north and south also are mentioned, as they call Janus double when he has four faces? They have no way at all of interpreting, in relation to the world, four doorways by which to go in and to come out as they did in the case of the two-faced Janus, where they found, at any rate in the human mouth, something which answered to what they said about him; unless perhaps Neptune come to their aid, and hand them a fish, which, besides the mouth and gullet, has also the openings of the gills, one on each side.

And until he be purged from this uncleanness, let him believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one God, alone, great, omnipotent, good, just, merciful, Creator of all things visible and invisible, and whatsoever can be worthily and truly said of Him in proportion to human capacity. And when he is told that the Father only is God, let him not separate from Him the Son or the Holy Spirit; for together with Him He is the only God, together with whom also He is one God; because, when we are told that the Son also is the only God, we must needs take it without any separation of the Father or the Holy Spirit. And let him so say one essence, as not to think one to be either greater or better than, or in any respect differing from, another. Yet not that the Father Himself is both Son and Holy Spirit, or whatever else each is singly called in relation to either of the others; as Word, which is not said except of the Son, or Gift, which is not said except of the Holy Spirit. And on this account also they admit the plural number, as it is written in the Gospel, \"I and my Father are one.\"[fn-12-P1217_530105:25-nf] He has both said \"one,\"[fn-12-P1218_530147:26-nf] and \"we are[fn-12-P1219_530170:27-nf] one,\" according to essence, because they are the same God;\"we are,\" according to relation, because theone is Father, the other is Son.

Sometimes the meaning isaltogether latent, as in Genesis: \"Let us make man after our image and likeness.\"[fn-12-P1221_530814:29-nf] Both let us make and our is said in the plural, and ought not to be received except as of relatives. For it was not that gods might make, or make after the image and likeness of gods; but that the Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit might make after the image of the Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, that man might subsist as the image of God. And God is the Trinity. But because that image of God was not made altogether equal to Him, as being not born of Him, but created by Him; in order to signify this, he is in such way the image as that he is \"after the image,\" that is, he is not made equal by parity, but approaches to Him by a sort of likeness. For approach to God is not by intervals of place, but by likeness, and withdrawal from Him is by unlikeness. For there are some who draw this distinction, that they will have the Son to be the image, but man not to be the image, but \"after the image.\" But the apostle refutes them, saying, \"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God.\"[fn-12-P1222_531869:30-nf] He did not say after the image, but the image. And this image, since it is elsewhere spoken of as after the image, is not as if it were said relatively to the Son, who is the image equal to the Father; otherwise he would not say after our image. For how our, when the Son is the image of the Father alone? But man is said to be \"after the image,\" on account, as we have said, of the inequality of the likeness; and therefore after our image, that man might be the image of the Trinity;[fn-12-P1223_532374:31-nf] not equal to the Trinity as the Son is equal to the Father, but approaching to it, as has been said, by a certain likeness; just as nearness may in a sense be signified in things distant from each other, not in respect of place, but of a sort of imitation. For it is also said, \"Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind;\"[fn-12-P1224_533193:32-nf] to whom he likewise says, \"Be ye therefore imitators of God as dear children.\"[fn-12-P1225_533290:33-nf] For it is said to the new man, \"which is renewed to the knowledge of God, after the image of Him that created him.\"[fn-12-P1226_533422:34-nf] Or if we choose to admit the plural number, in order to meet the needs of argument, even putting aside relative terms, that so we may answer in one term when it is asked what three, and say three substances or three persons; then let no one think of any bulk or interval, or of any distance of howsoever little unlikeness, so that in the Trinity any should be understood to be even a little less than another, in whatsoever way one thing can be less than another: in order that there may be neither a confusion of persons, nor such a distinction as that there should be any inequality.

And three bishops in Syria, having been, in some manner, consecrated on account of their agreement with them, incite them to worse things. But let the judgment concerning these be reserved for your trial. For they, retaining in their memory the words which came to be used with respect to His saving Passion, and abasement, and examination, and what they call His poverty, and in short of all those things to which the Saviour submitted for our sakes, bring them forward to refute His supreme and eternal Godhead. But of those words which signify His natural glory and nobility, and abiding with the Father, they have become unmindful.

Again, nothing that was made in Him was made without Him, for the reason that God the Begotten was life, and was born as Life, not made life after His birth; for there are not two elements in Him, one inborn and one afterwards conferred. There is no interval in His case between birth and maturity. None of the things that were created in Him was made without Him, for He is the Life which made their creation possible. Moreover God, the Son of God, became God by virtue of His birth, not after He was born. Being born the Living from the Living, the True from the True, the Perfect from the Perfect, He was born in full possession of His powers. He needed not to learn in after time what His birth was, but was conscious of His Godhead by the very fact that He was born as God of God.

Did not the Lord come for this end, that He might establish a Church, and separate those Jews who had a good faith, and a good hope, and a good love, as wheat from the chaff, and might make them one wall of the circumcision, to which should be joined another wall from the uncircumcision of the Gentiles, of which two walls coming from different directions, Himself should be the Corner-Stone? Did not the same Lord therefore say of these two people who were to be one, \"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold\"? Now He was speaking to the Jews; \"Them also,\" said He, \"must I bring, that there may be one fold, and One Shepherd.\"[fn-65-P6523_2749370:17-nf] Therefore there were two ships[fn-65-P6524_2749418:18-nf] out of which He had called His disciples. They figured these two people, when they let down their nets, and took up so great a draught[fn-65-P6525_2749569:19-nf] and so large a number of fishes, that the nets were almost broken. \"And they laded,\" it is said, \"both the ships.\" The two ships figured the One Church, but made out of two peoples, joined together in Christ, though coming from different parts. Of this too the two wives, who had one husband Jacob, Leah and Rachel, are a figure.[fn-65-P6526_2749909:20-nf] Of these two, the two blind men also are a figure, who sat by the way side, to whom the Lord gave sight.[fn-65-P6527_2750038:21-nf] And if ye pay attention to the Scriptures, ye will find the two Churches, which are not two but One, figured out in many places. For to this end the Corner-Stone serveth, for to make of two One. To this end serveth That Shepherd, for to make of two flocks One. So then the Lord who was to teach the Church, and to have a school of His Own beyond the Jews, as we see at present, would He be likely to send those who believe on Him unto the Jews, to learn? But under the name of the Scribes and Pharisees He intimated that there would be some in His Church who would say and not do; but, in the person of Moses He designated Himself. For Moses represented Him, and for this reason did he put a vail before him, when he was speaking to the people; because as long as they were in the law given up to carnal joys and pleasures, and looking for an earthly kingdom, a vail was put upon their face, that they should not see Christ in the Scriptures. For when the vail was taken away, after that the Lord had suffered, the secrets of the temple were discovered. Accordingly when He was hanging on the Cross, the vail of the temple was rent from the top even to the bottom;[fn-65-P6528_2751222:22-nf] and the Apostle Paul says expressly, \"But when thou shalt turn to Christ, the vail shall be taken away.\"[fn-65-P6529_2751349:23-nf] Whereas with him who turneth not to Christ, though he read the law of Moses, the vail is laid upon his heart, as the Apostle says. When the Lord then would signify beforehand that there would be some such in His Church, what did He say? \"The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. What they say, do; but do not what they do.\"[fn-65-P6530_2751699:24-nf] ","title":"Sermon LXXXVII. [CXXXVII.

But we will now speak of the hirelings. \"The hireling when he seeth the wolf lying in wait for the sheep, fleeth.\" This the Lord said. Why? \"Because he careth not for the sheep.\"[fn-65-P6553_2760622:41-nf] So long then is the hireling of use, as the seeth not the wolf coming, as he seeth not the thief and the robber; but when he seeth them, he fleeth. And who is there of the hirelings, who fleeth not from the Church, when he seeth the wolf and the robber? And wolves and robbers abound. They are they who go up by another way. Who are these who go up? They who of Donatus' way[fn-65-P6554_2761018:42-nf] wish to make havoc of Christ's sheep, they go up by another way. They do not enter in by Christ, because they, are not humble. Because they are proud, they go up. What is, \"they go up\"? They arelifted up. Whereby do they go up? By another way: whence they wish to be named from theirway. They who are not in unity are of another way, and by this way they go up, that is, are lifted up, and wish to spoil the sheep. Now mark how they go up. \"It is we,\" they say, \"who sanctify we justify we make righteous\" See whither they havegot up.\"But he that exalteth himself, shall be abased.\"[fn-65-P6555_2761613:43-nf] Our Lord God is able to abase them. Now the wolf is the devil, he lieth in wait to deceive, and they that follow him; for it is said that \"they are clothed indeed with the skins of sleep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\"[fn-65-P6556_2761860:44-nf] If the hireling observe anyone indulging in wicked talking, or in sentiments to the deadly hurt of his soul, or doing ought that is abominable and unclean, and notwithstanding that he seems to bear a character of some importance in the Church (from which if he hopes for advantage he is an hireling); says nothing, and when he sees the man perishing in his sin, sees the wolf following him, sees his throat dragged by his teeth to punishment; says not to him, \"Thou sinnest;\" does not chide him, lest he lose his own advantage. This I say is, \"When he seeth the wolf, he fleeth;\" he does not say to him, \"Thou art doing wickedly.\" This is no flight of the body, but of the soul. He whom thou seest standing still in body flies in heart, when he sees a sinner, and does not say to him, \"Thou sinnest;\" yea when he even is in concert with him.","title":"Sermon LXXXVII.

If, then, the idea of humanityin Adam and Abel does not vary with the difference of their origin, neither the order nor the manner of their coming into existence making any difference in their nature, which is the same in both, according to the testimony of every one in his senses, and no one, not greatly needing treatment for insanity, would deny it; what necessity is there that against the divine nature we should admit this strange thought? Having heard of Father and Son from the Truth, we are taught in those two subjects the oneness of their nature; their natural relation to each other expressed by those names indicates that nature; and so do Our Lord's own words. For when He said, \"I and My Father are one[fn-8-P815_414598:120-nf] ,\" He conveys by that confession of a Father exactly the truth that He Himself is not a first cause, at the same time that He asserts by His union with the Father their common nature; so that these words of His secure our faith from the taint of heretical error on either side: for Sabellius has no ground for his confusion of the individuality of each Person, when the Only-begotten has so distinctly marked Himself off from the Father in those words, \"I and My Father;\" and Arius finds no confirmation of his doctrine of the strangeness of either nature to the other, since this oneness of both cannot admit distinction in nature. For that which is signified in these words by the oneness of Father and Son is nothing else but what belongs to them on the score of their actual being; all the other moral excellences which are to be observed in them as over and above[fn-8-P816_415486:121-nf] their nature may without error be set down as shared in by all created beings. For instance, Our Lord is called merciful and pitiful by the prophet[fn-8-P817_415668:122-nf] , and He wills us to be and to be called the same;. \"Be ye therefore merciful[fn-8-P818_415768:123-nf] ,\" and \"Blessed are the merciful[fn-8-P819_415821:124-nf] ,\" and many such passages. If, then, any one by diligence and attention has modelled himself according to the divine will, and become kind and pitiful and compassionate, or meek and lowly of heart, such as many of the saints are testified to have become in the pursuit of such excellences, does it follow that they are therefore one with God, or united to Him by virtue of any one of them? Not so. That which is not in every respect the same, cannot be `one' with him whose nature thus varies from it. Accordingly, a man becomes `one' with another, when in will, as our Lord says, they are `perfected into ones[fn-8-P820_416453:125-nf] ,' this union of wills being added to the connexion of nature. So also the Father and Son are one, the community of nature and the community of will running, in them, into one.

Since then, the expression of the Faith comprehends the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, what agreement has this construction of theirs to show with the utterances of the Lord, so as to refer such a doctrine to the teaching of those utterances? They cannot manage to show where in the Gospels the Lord said that we should believe on \"the one and only true God:\" unless they have some new Gospel. For the Gospels which are read in the churches continuously from ancient times to the present day, do not contain this saying which tells us that we should believe in or baptize into \"the one and only true God,\" as these people say, but \"in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\" But as we were taught by the voice of the Lord, this we say, that the word \"one\" does not indicate the Father alone, but comprehends in its significance the Son with the Father, inasmuch as the Lord said, \"I and My Father are one[fn-9-P981_535963:24-nf] .\" In like manner also the name \"God\" belongs equally to the Beginning in which the Word was, and to the Word Who was in the Beginning. For the Evangelist tells us that \"the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-9-P982_536197:25-nf] .\" So that when Deity is expressed the Son is included no less than the Father. Moreover, the true cannot be conceived as something alien from and unconnected with the truth. But that the Lord is the Truth no one at all will dispute, unless he be one estranged from the truth. If, then, the Word is in the One, and is God and Truth, as is proclaimed in the Gospels, on what teaching of the Lord does be base his doctrine who makes use of these distinctive terms? For the antithesis is between \"only\" and \"not only,\" between \"God\" and \"no God,\" between \"true\" and \"untrue.\" If it is with respect to idols that they make their distinction of phrases, we too agree. For the name of \"deity\" is given, in an equivocal sense, to the idols of the heathen, seeing that \"all the gods of the heathen are demons,\" and in another sense marks the contrast of the one with the many, of the true with the false, of those who are not Gods with Him who is God[fn-9-P983_537159:26-nf] . But if the contrast is one with the Only-begotten God[fn-9-P984_537373:27-nf] , let our sages learn that truth has its opposite only in falsehood, and God in one who is not God. But inasmuch as the Lord Who is the Truth is God, and is in the Father and is one relatively to the Father[fn-9-P985_537662:28-nf] , there is no room in the true doctrine for these distinctions of phrases. For he who truly believes in the One sees in the One Him Who is completely united with Him in truth, and deity, and essence, and life, and wisdom, and in all attributes whatsoever: or, if he does not see in the One Him Who is all these it si in nothing that he believes. For without the Son the Father has neither existence nor name, any more than the Powerful without Power, or the Wise without Wisdom. For Christ is \"the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-9-P986_538538:29-nf] ;\" so that he who imagines he sees the One God apart from power, truth, wisdom, life, or the true light, either sees nothing at all or else assuredly that which is evil.

For if he uses such expressions with reference to vain idols and to the erroneous conceptions of those who worship them (even as Paul assures us that there is no agreement between Christ and Belial, and no fellowship between the temple of God and idols[fn-10-P1017_548895:49-nf] ) we agree with him. But if by these assertions he means to sever the Only-begotten God from the Godhead of the Father, let him be informed that he is providing us with a dilemma that may be turned against himself to refute his own impiety. For either he denies the Only-begotten God to be God at all, that he may preserve for the Father those prerogatives of deity which (according to him) are incapable of being shared with the Son, and thus is convicted as a transgressor by denying the God Whom Christians worship, or if he were to grant that the Son also is God, yet not agreeing in nature with the true God, he would be necessarily obliged to acknowledge that he maintains Gods sundered from one another by the difference of their natures. Let him choose which of these he will,-either to deny the Godhead of the Son, or to introduce into his creed a plurality of Gods. For whichever of these he chooses, it is all one as regards impiety: for we who are initiated intothe mystery of godliness by the Divinely inspired words of the Scripture do not see between the Father and the Son a partnership of Godhead, but unity, inasmuch as the Lord hath taught us this by His own words, when He saith, \"I and the Father are one[fn-10-P1018_550159:50-nf] ,\" and \"he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-10-P1019_550229:51-nf] .\" For if He were not of the same nature as the Father, how could He either have had in Himself that which was different[fn-10-P1020_550371:52-nf] ? or how could He have shown in Himself that which was unlike, if the foreign and alien nature did not receive the stamp of that which was of a different kind from itself? But he says, \"nor has He a divider of His glory.\" Herein he speaks in accordance with the fact, even though he does not know what he is saying: for the Son does not divide the glory with the Father, but has the glory of the Father in its entirety, even as the Father has all the glory of the Son. For thus He spake to the Father \"All Mine are Thine and Thine are Mine[fn-10-P1021_550934:53-nf] .\" Wherefore also He says that He will appear on the Judgment Day \"in the glory of the Father[fn-10-P1022_551051:54-nf] ,\" when He will render to every man according to his works. And by this phrase He shows the unity of nature that subsists between them. For as \"there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon[fn-10-P1023_551278:55-nf] ,\" because of the difference between the natures of those luminaries (since if both had the same glory there would not be deemed to be any difference in their nature), so He Who foretold of Himself that He would appear in the glory of the Father indicated by the identity of glory their community of nature.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":10,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"For he says that He was so constituted that His nature was adapted to obedience alone[fn-11-P1165_631060:165-nf] , just as among instruments that which is fashioned with regard to a certain figure necessarily produces in that which is subjected to its operation the form which the artificer implanted in the construction of the instrument, and cannot possibly trace a straight line upon that which receives its mark, if its own working is in a curve; nor can the instrument, if fashioned to draw a straight line, produce a circle by its impress. What need is there of any words of ours to reveal how great is the profanity of such a notion, when the heretical utterance of itself proclaims aloud its monstrosity? For if He was obedient for this reason only that He was so made, then of course He is not on an equal footing even with humanity, since on this theory, while our soul is self-determining and independent, choosing as it will with sovereignty over itself that which is pleasing to it, He on the contrary exercises, or rather experiences, obedience under the constraint of a compulsory law of His nature, while His nature suffers Him not to disobey, even if He would.

Their object in such a malignant perversion of the true doctrine, is to show that the less exalted statements, which our Lord utters in tits humanity, are to be thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show their blasphemy to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual acknowledgment of the Lord. For this reason it is that Eunomius says, \"He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man made up of soul and body.\" But, after searching through all the inspired and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came \"to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-12-P1204_656584:193-nf] .\" Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster of our nature bad its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was twofold, death correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the deprivation of the twofold life that operates in him who is thus mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body into its kindred elements: but \"the soul that sinneth,\" he saith, \"it shall die[fn-12-P1205_657543:194-nf] .\" Now sin is nothing else than alienation from God, Who is the true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived many hundred years after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, \"In the day that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die[fn-12-P1206_657814:195-nf] .\" For by the fact of his alienation from the true life, the sentence of death was ratified against him that self-same day: and after this, at a much later time, there followed also the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this cause that He might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries home on His shoulders the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may make the man of God complete, united to the deity in body and in soul. And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now the soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the result of being ill-advised: and this He sanctifies by union with Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy along with the first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the destruction of the enemies of the Lord, said, \"They are dead which sought the young Child's life[fn-12-P1207_658887:196-nf] ,\" (or \"soul\"): and the Lord says to the Jews, \"Ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth[fn-12-P1208_659073:197-nf] .\" Now by \"Man\" is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is composed of both, soul and body. And again, He says to them, \"Are ye angry at Me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day[fn-12-P1209_659388:198-nf] ?\" And what He meant by \"every whit whole,\" He showed in the other Gospels, when He said to the man who was let down on a couch in the midst, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee,\" which is a healing of the soul, and, \"Arise and walk[fn-12-P1210_659636:199-nf] ,\" which has regard to the body: and in the Gospel of S. John, by liberating the soul also from its own malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, \"Thou art made whole, sin no more[fn-12-P1211_659932:200-nf] ,\" thou, that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul and in body. For so too does S. Paul speak, \"for to make in Himself of twain one new man[fn-12-P1212_660105:201-nf] .\" And so too He foretells that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul from His body, saying, \"No man taketh\" my soul \"from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again[fn-12-P1213_660370:202-nf] .\" Yea, the prophet David also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with foresight of Him, \"Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption[fn-12-P1214_660678:203-nf] ,\" while the Apostle Peter thus expounds the saying, that \"His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption.\" For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh and in the flesh and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at all times what It was by nature, and so continuing for ever. But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter said, \"This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ[fn-12-P1215_661720:204-nf] ;\" and we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them through His body.

Their object in such a malignant perversion of the true doctrine, is to show that the less exalted statements, which our Lord utters in tits humanity, are to be thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show their blasphemy to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual acknowledgment of the Lord. For this reason it is that Eunomius says, \"He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man made up of soul and body.\" But, after searching through all the inspired and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came \"to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-12-P1204_656584:193-nf] .\" Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster of our nature bad its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without respite would attach to the act.

Now let us see what he says about the Holy Spirit. \"After Him, we believe,\" he says, \"on the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth.\" I think it will be plain to all who come across this passage what object he has in view in thus perverting the declaration of the faith delivered to us by the Lord, in his statements concerning the Son and the Father. Though this absurdity has already been exposed, I will nevertheless endeavour, in few words, to make plain the aim of his knavery. As in the former case, he avoided using the name \"Father,\" that so he might not include the Son in the eternity of the Father, so he avoided employing the title Son, that he might not by it suggest His natural affinity to the Father; so here, too, he refrains from saying \"Holy Spirit,\" that he may not by this name acknowledge the majesty of His glory, and His complete union with the Father and the Son. For since the appellation of \"Spirit,\" and that of \"Holy,\" are by the Scriptures equally applied to the Father and the Son (for \"God is a Spirits[fn-12-P1225_665183:210-nf] ,\" and \"the anointed Lord is the Spirit before our face[fn-12-P1226_665262:211-nf] ,\" and \"the Lord our God is Holy[fn-12-P1227_665326:212-nf] ,\" and there is \"one Holy, one Lord Jesus Christ[fn-12-P1228_665395:213-nf] \") lest there should, by the use of these terms, be bred in the minds of his readers some orthodox conception of the Holy Spirit, such as would naturally arise in them from His sharing His glorious appellation with the Father and the Son, for this reason, deluding the ears of the foolish, he changes the words of the Faith as set forth by God in the delivery of this mystery, making a way, so to speak, by this sequence, for the entrance of his impiety against the Holy Spirit. For if he had said, \"We believe in the Holy Spirit,\" and \"God is a Spirit,\" any one instructed in things divine would have interposed the remark, that if we are to believe in the Holy Spirit, while God is called a Spirit, He is assuredly not distinct in nature from that which receives the same titles in a proper sense. For of all those things which are indicated not unreally, nor metaphorically, but properly and absolutely, by the same names, we are necessarily compelled to acknowledge that the nature also, which is signified by this identity of names, is one and the same. For this reason it is that, suppressing the name appointed by the Lord in the formula of the faith, he says, \"We believe in the Comforter.\" But I have been taught that this very name is also applied by the inspired Scripture to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost alike. For the Son gives the name of \"Comforter\" equally to Himself and to the Holy Spirit[fn-12-P1229_666903:214-nf] ; and the Father, where He is said to work comfort, surely claims as His own the name of \"Comforter.\" For assuredly he Who does the work of a Comforter does not disdain the name belonging to the work: for David says to the Father, \"Thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me[fn-12-P1230_667203:215-nf] ,\" and the great Apostle applies to the Father the same language, when he says, \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1231_667403:216-nf] \"; and John, in one of his Catholic Epistles, expressly gives to the Son the name of Comforter[fn-12-P1232_667520:217-nf] . Nay, more, the Lord Himself, in saying that another Comforter would be sent us, when speaking of the Spirit, clearly asserted this title of Himself in the first place. But as there are two senses of the parakalein[fn-12-P1233_667807:218-nf] ,-one to beseech, by words and gestures of respect, to induce him to whom we apply for anything, to feel with us in respect of those things for which we apply,-the other to comfort, to take remedial thought for affections of body and soul,-the Holy Scripture affirms the conception of the Paraclete, in either sense alike, to belong to the Divine nature. For at one time Paul sets before us by the word parakalein the healing power of God, as when he says, \"God, Who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus[fn-12-P1234_668424:219-nf] \"; and at another time he uses this word in its other meaning, when he says, writing to the Corinthians, \"Now we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God[fn-12-P1235_668680:220-nf] .\" Now since these things are so, in whatever way you understand the title \"Paraclete,\" when used of the Spirit, you will not in either of its significations detach Him from His community in it with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, he has not been able, even though he wished it, to belittle the glory of the Spirit by ascribing to Him the very attribute which Holy Scripture refers also to the Father and to the Son. But in styling Him \"the Spirit of Truth,\" Eunomius' own wish, I suppose, was to suggest by this phrase subjection, since Christ is the Truth, and he called Him the Spirit of Truth, as if one should say that He is a possession and chattel of the Truth, without being aware that God is called a God of righteousness[fn-12-P1236_669437:221-nf] ; and we certainly do not understand thereby that God is a possession of righteousness. Wherefore also, when we hear of the \"Spirit of Truth,\" we acquire by that phrase such a conception as befits the Deity, being guided to the loftier interpretation by the words which follow it. For when the Lord said \"The Spirit of Truth,\" He immediately added \"Which proceedeth from the Father[fn-12-P1237_669966:222-nf] ,\" a fact which the voice of the Lord never asserted of any conceivable thing in creation, not of aught visible or invisible, not of thrones, principalities, powers, or dominions, nor of any other name that is named either in this world or in that which is to come. It is plain then that that, from share in which all creation is excluded, is something special and peculiar to uncreated being. But this man bids us believe in \"the Guide of godliness.\" Let a man then believe in Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and all those by whom we have been led into the way of thefaith. For if we are to believe in \"that which guides us to godliness,\" along with the Father and the Son, all the prophets and lawgivers and patriarchs, heralds, evangelists, apostles, pastors,and teachers, have equal honour with the Holy Spirit, as they bare been \"guides to godliness\" to those who came after them. \"Who came into being,\" he goes on, \"by the only God through the Only-begotten.\" In these words he gathers up in one head all his blasphemy. Once more he calls the Father \"only God,\" who employs the Only-begotten as an instrument for the production of the Spirit. What shadow of such a notion did he find in Scripture, that he ventures upon this assertion? by deduction from what premises did he bring his profanity to such a conclusion as this?Which of the Evangelists says it? what apostle? what prophet? Nay, on the contrary every scripture divinely inspired, written by the afflatus of the Spirit, attests the Divinity of the Spirit. For example (for it is better to prove my position from the actual testimonies), those who receive power to become children of God bear witness to the Divinity of the Spirit. Who knows not that utterance of the Lord which tells us that they who are born of the Spirit are the children of God? For thus He expressly ascribes the birth of the children of God to the Spirit, saying, that as that which is born of the flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. But as many as are born of the Spirit are called the children of God[fn-12-P1238_672086:223-nf] . So also when the Lord by breathing upon His disciples had imparted to them the Holy Spirit, John says, \"Of His fulness have all we received[fn-12-P1239_672321:224-nf] .\" And that \"in Him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead[fn-12-P1240_672419:225-nf] ,\" the mighty Paul attests: yea, moreover, through the prophet Isaiah it is attested, as to the manifestation of the Divine appearance vouchsafed to him, when he saw Him that sat \"on the throne high and lifted up[fn-12-P1241_672651:226-nf] ;\" the older tradition, it is true, says that it was the Father Who appeared to him, but the evangelist John refers the prophecy to our Lord, saying, touching those of the Jews who did not believe the words uttered by the prophet concerning the Lord, \"These things said Esaias, when he saw His glory and spoke of Him[fn-12-P1242_672986:227-nf] .\" But the mighty Paul attributes the same passage to the Holy Spirit in his speech made to the Jews at Rome, when he says, \"Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet concerning you, saying, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand[fn-12-P1243_673333:228-nf] ,\" showing, in my opinion, by Holy Scripture itself, that every specially divine vision, every theophany, every word uttered in the Person of God, is to be understood to refer to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hence when David says, \"they provoked God in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert[fn-12-P1244_673719:229-nf] ,\" the apostle refers to the Holy Spirit the despite done by the Israelites to God, in these terms: \"Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me[fn-12-P1245_674004:230-nf] ,\" and goes on to refer all that the prophecy refers to God, to the Person of the Holy Ghost. Those who keep repeating against us the phrase \"three Gods,\" because we hold these views, have perhaps not yet learnt how to count. For if the Father and the Son are not divided into duality, (for they are, according to the Lord's words, One, and not Two[fn-12-P1246_674374:231-nf] ) and if the Holy Ghost is also one, how can one added to one be divided into the number of three Gods? Is it not rather plain that no one can charge us with believing in the number of three Gods, without himself first maintaining in his own doctrine a pair of Gods? For it is by being added to two that the one completes the triad of Gods. But what room is there for the charge of tritheism against those by whom one God is worshipped, the God expressed by the Name ofthe Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost?","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_107_sermon_xc_cxl_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"4.

Thus, too, with the leaders turning their backs, who of the common rank will hope to persuade men to stand firm in the battle? Most assuredly a good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep, according to the word of Moses, when the Lord Christ had not as yet been revealed, but was already shadowed forth in himself: \"If you destroy this people,\" he says, \"destroy me also along with it.\"[fn-19-P1985_600348:43-nf] But Christ, confirming these foreshadowings Himself, adds: \"The bad shepherd is he who, on seeing the wolf, flees, and leaves the sheep to be torn in pieces.\"[fn-19-P1986_600527:44-nf] Why, a shepherd like this will be tuned off from the farm; the wages to have been given him at the time of his discharge will be kept from him as compensation; nay, even from his former savings a restoration of the master's loss will be required; for \"to him who hath shall be given, but from him who hath not shall be taken away even that which he seemeth to have.[fn-19-P1987_600910:45-nf] Thus Zechariah threatens: \"Arise, O sword, against the shepherds, and pluck ye out the sheep; and I will turn my hand against the shepherds.\"[fn-19-P1988_601072:46-nf] And against them both Ezekiel and Jeremiah declaim with kindred threatenings, for their not only wickedly eating of the Sheep,-they feeding themselves rather than those committed to their charge,-but also scattering the flock, and giving it over, shepherdless, a prey to all the beasts of the field. And this never happens more than when in persecution the Church is abandoned by the clergy. If any one recognises the Spirit also, he will hear him branding the runaways. But if it does not become the keepers of the flock to flee when the wolves invade it-nay, if that is absolutely unlawful (for He who has declared a shepherd of this sort a bad one has certainly condemned him; and whatever is condemned has, without doubt, become unlawful)-on this ground it will not be the duty of those who have been set over the Church to flee in the time of persecution. But otherwise, if the flock should flee, the overseer of the flock would have no call to hold his ground, as his doing so in that case would be, without good reason, to give to the flock protection, which it would not require in consequence of its liberty, forsooth, to flee.","title":"IX.

Sabellius sweeps away the birth of the Son, and then preaches the unity of God; but he does not doubt that the mighty Nature, which acted in the human Christ, was God. He shuts his eyes to the revealed mystery of the Sonship; the works done seem to him so marvellous that he cannot believe that He who performed them could undergo a true generation. When he hears the words, He that hath, seen Me hath seen the Father also[fn-15-P1527_968964:7-nf] , he jumps to the blasphemous conclusion of an inseparable and indistinguishable identity of nature in Father and Son, because he fails to see that the revelation of the birth is the mode in which Their unity of nature is manifested to. us. For the fact that the Father is seen in the Son is a proof of the Son's Divinity, not a disproof of His birth. Thus our knowledge of Each of Them is conditioned by our knowledge of the Other, for there is no difference of nature between them and, since in this respect they are One, a reverent study of the character of Either will give us a true insight into the nature of Both For, indeed, it is certain that He, Who was in the form of God, must in His self-revelation present Himself to us in the exact aspect of the form of God[fn-15-P1528_969757:8-nf] . Again, this perverse and insane delusion derives a further encouragement from the words, I and the Father are One[fn-15-P1529_969893:9-nf] . From the fact of unity in the same nature they have impiously deduced a confusion of Persons; their interpretation, that the words signify a single Power, contradicts the tenour of the passage.

And now let us See whether the confession of Thomas the Apostle, when he cried, My Lord and My God, corresponds with this assertion of the Evangelist. We see that he speaks of Him, Whom he confesses to be God, as My God. Now Thomas was undoubtedly familiar with those words of the Lord, Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One. How then could the faith of an Apostle become so oblivious of that primary command as to confess Christ as God, when life is conditional upon the confession of the Divine unity? It was because, in the light of the Resurrection, the whole mystery of the faith had become visible to the Apostle. He had often heard such words as, I and the Father are One, and, All things that the Father hath are Mine, and, I in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-15-P1544_982891:17-nf] ; and now he can confess that the name of God expresses the nature of Christ, without peril to the faith. Without breach of loyalty to the One God, the Father, his devotion could now regard the Son of God as God, since he believed that everything contained in the nature of the Son was truly of the same nature with the Father. No longer need he fear that such a confession as his was the proclamation of a second God, a treason against the unity of the Divine nature; for it was not a second God Whom that perfect birth of the Godhead had brought into being. Thus it was with full knowledge of the mystery of the Gospel that Thomas confessed his Lord and his God. It was not a title of honour; it was a confession of nature. He believed that Christ was God in substance and in power. And the Lord, in turn, shews that this act of worship was the expression not of mere reverence, but of faith, when He says, Because than hast seen, thou hast believed; blessed are they which have not seen, and have believed. For Thomas had seen before he believed. But, you ask, What was it that Thomas believed? That, beyond a doubt, which is expressed in his words, My Lord and my God. No nature but that of God could have risen by its own might from death to life; and it is this fact, that Christ is God, which was confessed by Thomas with the confidence of an assured faith. Shall we, then, dream that His name of God is not a substantial reality, when that name has been proclaimed by a faith based upon certain evidence? Surely a Son devoted to His Father, One Who did not His own will but the will of Him that sent Him, Who sought not His own glory but the glory of Him from Whom He came, would have rejected the adoration involved in such a name as destructive of that unity of God which had been the burden of His teaching. Yet, in fact, He confirms this assertion of the mysterious truth, made by the believing Apostle; He accepts as His own the name which belongs to the nature of the Father. And He teaches that they are blessed who, though they have not seen Him rise from the dead, yet have believed, on the assurance of the Resurrection, that He is God.","title":"Book VII","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_111_treatise_i_on_the_unity_of_the_church_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"ANF-05","text":"6.

Sumptuous and splend identertainers give frequent and constant entertainments, alike to display their own wealth, and to show goodwill to their acquaintance. So also the grace of the Spirit, affording us a proof of his own power, and displaying much good-will towards the friends of God, sets before us successively and constantly the tables of the martyrs. Lately, for instance, a maiden quite young, and unmarried, the blessed martyr Pelagia, entertained us, with much joy. To-day again, this blessed and noble martyr Ignatius has succeeded to her feast. The persons are different: The table is one. The wrestlings are varied: The crown is one. The contests are manifold: The prize is the same. For in the case of the heathen contests, since the tasks are bodily, men alone are, with reason, admitted. But here, since the contest is wholly concerning the soul, the lists are open to each sex, for each kind the theatre is arranged. Neither do men alone disrobe, in order that the women may not take refuge in the weakness of their nature, and seem to have a plausible excuse, nor have women only quitted themselves like men, lest the race of men be put to shame; but on this side and on that many are proclaimed conquerors, and are crowned, in order that thou mayest learn by means of the exploits themselves that in Christ Jesus neither male nor female,[fn-7-P775_505088:2-nf] neither sex, nor weakness of body, nor age, nor any such thing could be a hindrance to those who run in the course of religion; if there be a noble readiness, and an eager mind, and a fear of God, fervent and kindling, be established in our souls. On this account both maidens and women, and men, both young and old, and slaves, and freemen, and every rank, and every age, and each sex, disrobe for those contests, and in no respect suffer harm, since they have brought a noble purpose to these wrestlings. The season then already calls us to discourse of the mighty works of this saint. But our reckoning is disturbed and confused, not knowing what to say first, what second, what third, so great a multitude of things calling for eulogy surrounds us, on every side; and we experience the same thing as if any one went into a meadow, and seeing many a rosebush and many a violet, and an abundance of lilies, and other spring flowers manifold and varied, should be in doubt what he should look at first, what second, since each of those he saw invites him to bestow his glances on itself. For we too, coming to this spiritual meadow of the mighty works of Ignatius, and beholding not the flowers of spring, but the manifold and varied fruit of the spirit in the soul of this man, are confused and in perplexity, not knowing to which we are first to give our consideration, as each of the things we see draws us away from its neighbours, and entices the eye of the soul to the sight of its own beauty. For see, he presided over the Church among us nobly, and with such carefulness as Christ desires.

They are one, for the things which are not plucked out of His hand are not plucked out of the hand of the Father[fn-16-P1642_1079301:25-nf] , for, when He is known, the Father is known, for, when He is seen, the Father is seen, for what He speaks the Father speaks as abiding in Him, for in His works the Father works, for He is in the Father and the Father in Him[fn-16-P1643_1079551:26-nf] . This proceeds from no creation but from birth; it is not brought about by will but by power; it is no agreement of mind that speaks, it is nature; because to be created and to be born are not one and the same, any more than to will and to be able; neither is it the same thing to agree and to abide","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_15_book_viii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"28.

Now the Apostle, maintaining the true sense of the Lord's saying, I and the Father are one[fn-16-P1691_1108237:56-nf] , whilst He asserts that Both are One, signifies that Both are One not after the manner of the soleness of a single being, but in the unity of the Spirit; for one God the Father and one Christ the Lord, since Each is both Lord and God, do not yet admit in our creed either two Gods or two Lords. So then Each is one, and though one, neither is sole. We shall not be able to express the mystery of the faith except in the words of the Apostle. For there is one God and one Lord, and the fact that there is one God and one Lord proves that there is at once Lordship in God, and Godhead in the Lord. Thou canst not maintain a trojan of person, so making God single; nor yet canst thou divide the Spirit, so preventing the Two from being One[fn-16-P1692_1108996:57-nf] . Nor in the one God and one Lord wilt thou be able to separate the power, so that He Who is Lord should not also be God, and He Who is God should not also be Lord. For the Apostle in the enunciation of the Names has taken care not to preach either two Gods or two Lords. And for this reason he has employed such a method of teaching as in the one Lord Christ to set forth also one God, and in the one God the Father to set forth also one Lord. And, not to misguide us into the blasphemy that God is solitary, which would destroy the birth of the Only-begotten God, he has confessed both Father and Christ.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":10,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_15_book_viii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"49.

Wherefore the Apostle proclaiming that this is the image of God, says, Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation; for in Him were all things made in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through Him and in Him, and He is before all, and for Him all things consist. And He is the head of the body, the Church, Who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. For it was the good pleasure of the Father that in Him should all the fulness dwell, and through Him all things should be reconciled to Him[fn-17-P1715_1127435:67-nf] . So through the power of these works He is the image of God. For assuredly the Creator of things invisible is not compelled by any necessity inherent in His nature to be the visible image of the invisible God.

For in saying that the Father speaks in His words, and works through His working, and judges through His judgment, and is seen in His manifestation, and reconciles through His reconciliation, and abides in Him, while He in turn abides in the Father,-what more fitting words, I ask, could He have employed in His teaching to suit the faculties of our reason, that we might believe in Their unity, than those by which, through the truth of the birth and the unity of the nature, it is declared that whatever the Son did and said, the Father said and did in the Son? This says nothing of a nature foreign to Himself, or added by creation to God, or born into Godhead by a partition of God, but it betokens the divinity of One Who by a perfect birth is begotten perfect God, Who has so confident an assurance of His nature that He says, I in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-17-P1721_1132723:70-nf] , and again, All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine[fn-17-P1722_1132801:71-nf] .

Who in the works and words and sight of God, Himself worked and spoke and was seen as God. The Church understands this. The Synagogue does not believe, philosophy does not know, that being One of One, Whole of Whole, God and Son, He has neither by His birth deprived the Father of His completeness, nor failed to possess the same completeness in Himself by right of His birth.

Let us hear, then, how Israel, when dying in Egypt, in blessing his sons, prophetically blessed Judah. He says: \"Judah, thy brethren shall praise thee: thy hands shall be on the back of thine enemies; thy father's children shall adore thee. Judah is a lion's whelp: from the sprouting, my son, thou art gone up: lying down, thou hast slept as a lion, and as a lion's whelp; who shall awake him? A prince shall not be lacking out of Judah, and a leader from his thighs, until the things come that are laid up for him; and He shall be the expectation of the nations. Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's foal to the choice vine; he shall wash his robe in wine, and his clothes in the blood of the grape: his eyes are red with wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk.\"[fn-29-P2989_1658398:114-nf] I have expounded these words in disputing against Faustus the Manichaean; and I think it is enough to make the truth of this prophecy shine, to remark that the death of Christ is predicted by the word about his lying down, and not the necessity, but the voluntary character of His death, in the title of lion. That power He Himself proclaims in the gospel, saying, \"I have the power of laying down my life, and I have the power of taking it again. No man taketh it from me; but I lay it down of myself, and take it again.\"[fn-29-P2990_1658946:115-nf] So the lion roared, so He fulfilled what He said. For to this power what is added about the resurrection refers, \"Who shall awake him?\" This means that no man but Himself has raised Him, who also said of His own body, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-29-P2991_1659245:116-nf] And the very nature of His death, that is, the height of the cross, is understood by the single words \"Thou are gone up.\" The evangelist explains what is added, \"Lying down, thou hast slept,\" when he says, \"He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost.\"[fn-29-P2992_1659515:117-nf] Or at least His burial is to be understood, in which He lay down sleeping, and whence no man raised Him, as the prophets did some, and as He Himself did others; but He Himself rose up as if from sleep. As for His robe which He washes in wine, that is, cleanses from sin in His own blood, of which blood those who are baptized know the mystery, so that he adds, \"And his clothes in the blood of the grape,\" what is it but the Church? \"And his eyes are red with wine,\" [these are] His spiritual people drunken with His cup, of which the psalm sings, \"And thy cup that makes drunken, how excellent it is!\" \"And his teeth are whiter than milk,\"[fn-29-P2993_1660178:118-nf] -that is, the nutritive words which, according to the apostle, the babes drink, being as yet unfit for solid food.[fn-29-P2994_1660315:119-nf] And it is He in whom the promises of Judah were laid up, so that until they come, princes, that is, the kings of Israel, shall never be lacking out of Judah. \"And He is the expectation of the nations.\" This is too plain to need exposition.","title":"Book XVI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_15_book_iii_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"170","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"113.

In the last book we treated of the indistinguishable nature of God the Father and God the Son, and demonstrated that the words, I and the Father are One[fn-17-P1735_1138976:1-nf] , go to prove not a solitary God, but a unity of the Godhead unbroken by the birth of the Son: for God can be born only of God, and He that is born God of God must be all that God is. We reviewed, although not exhaustively, yet enough to make our meaning clear, the sayings of our Lord and the Apostles, which teach the inseparable nature and power of the Father and the Son; and we came to the passage in the teaching of the Apostle, where he says, Take heed lest there shall be any one that leadeth you astray through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ; for in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily[fn-17-P1736_1139685:2-nf] . We pointed out that here the words, in Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, prove Him true and perfect God of His Father's nature, neither severing Him from, nor identifying Him with, the Father. On the one hand we are taught that, since the incorporeal God dwelt in Him bodily, the Son as God begotten of God is in natural unity with the Father: and on the other hand, if God dwelt in Christ, this proves the birth of the personal Christ in Whom He dwell[fn-17-P1737_1140176:3-nf] . We have thus, it seems to me, more than answered the irreverence of those who refer to a unity or agreement of will such words of the Lord as, He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-17-P1738_1140738:4-nf] , or, The Father is in Me and I in the Father[fn-17-P1739_1140804:5-nf] , or, I and the Father are One[fn-17-P1740_1140849:6-nf] , or, All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine[fn-17-P1741_1140916:7-nf] . Not daring to deny the words themselves, these false teachers, in the mask of religion, corrupt the sense of the words. For instance, it is true that where the unity of nature is proclaimed the agreement of will cannot be denied; but in order to set aside that unity which follows from the birth, they profess merely a relationship of mutual harmony. But the blessed Apostle, after many indubitable statements of the real truth, cuts short their rash and profane assertions, by saying, in Christ dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, for by the bodily indwelling of the incorporeal God in Christ is taught the strict unity of Their nature. It is, therefore, not a matter of words, but a real truth that the Son was not alone, but the Father abode in Him: and not only abode, but also worked and spoke: not only worked and spoke, but also manifested Himself in Him. Through the Mystery of the birth the Son's power is the power of the Father, His authority the Father's authority, His nature the Father's nature. By His birth the Son possesses the nature of the Father: as the Father's image, He reproduces from the Father all that is in the Father, because He is the reality as well as the image of the Father, for a perfect birth produces a perfect image, and the fulness of the Godhead dwelling bodily in Him indicates the truth of His nature.","title":"Book IX.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":10,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_16_book_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"13","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"12.

No one shall take it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command have I received from the Father[fn-17-P1767_1160735:22-nf] : and again, when asked to shew a sign concerning Himself, that they night believe in Him, He says of the Temple of His body, Detroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up[fn-17-P1768_1160943:23-nf] . By the power to take His soul again and to raise the Temple up, He declares Himself God, and the Resurrection His own work: yet He refers all to the authority of His Father's command. This is not contrary to the meaning of the Apostle, when He proclaims Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God[fn-17-P1769_1161263:24-nf] , thus referring all the magnificence of His work to the glory of the Father: for whatever Christ does, the power and the wisdom of God does: and whatever the power and the wisdom of God does, without doubt God Himself does, Whose power and wisdom Christ is.

For my part, I have read the prophets with the most eager attention, and have found no such prophecies. And surely it shows a weak faith not to believe in Christ without proofs and testimonies. Indeed, you yourselves are accustomed to teach that Christian faith is so simple and absolute as not to admit of laborious investigations. Why, then, should you destroy the simplicity of faith by buttressing it with evidences, and Jewish evidences too? Or if you are changing your opinion about evidences, what more trustworthy witness could you have than God Himself testifying to His own Son when He sent Him on earth,-not by a prophet or an interpreter,-by a voice immediately from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, believe Him?\"[fn-13-P1378_733640:1-nf] And again He testifies of Himself: \"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world;[fn-13-P1379_733752:2-nf] and in many similar passages. When the Jews quarrelled with this testimony, saying \"Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy witness is not true,\" He replied: \"Although I bear witness of myself, my witness is true. It is written in your law, The witness of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me.\"[fn-13-P1380_734128:3-nf] He does not mention the prophets.

All we look for in the prophets is prudence and virtue, and a good example, which, you are well aware, are not to be found in the Jewish prophets. This, no doubt, explains your referring me at once to their predictions as a reason for believing them, without a word about their actions. This may be good policy, but it is not in harmony. with the declaration of Scripture, that it is impossible to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles. This may serve meanwhile as a brief and sufficient reply to the question, why we do not believe the prophets. The fact that they did not prophesy of Christ is abundantly proved in the writings of our fathers.

Then in a cloud spread around Him He was lifted up into heaven, that as a conqueror He might bring to the Father, Man whom He loved, whom He put on, whom He shielded from death; soon to come from heaven for the punishment of the devil and to the judgment of the human race, with the force of an avenger and with the power of a judge; whilst the disciples, scattered over the world, at the bidding of their Master and God gave forth His precepts for salvation, guided men from their wandering in darkness to the way of light, and gave eyes to the blind and ignorant for the acknowledgment of the truth.","title":"Treatise VI.

These are the bones of contention, which you are perpetually gnawing! If God is good, and prescient of the future, and able to avert evil, why did He permit man, the very image and likeness of Himself, and, by the origin of his soul, His own substance too, to be deceived by the devil, and fall from obedience of the law into death? For if He had been good, and so unwilling that such a catastrophe should happen, and prescient, so as not to be ignorant of what was to come to pass, and powerful enough to hinder its occurrence, that issue would never have come about, which should be impossible under these three conditions of the divine greatness. Since, however, it has occurred, the contrary proposition is most certainly true, that God must be deemed neither good, nor prescient, nor powerful. For as no such issue could have happened had God been such as He is reputed-good, and prescient, and mighty-so has this issue actually happened, because He is not such a God. In reply, we must first vindicate those attributes in the Creator which are called in question-namely, His goodness and foreknowledge, and power. But I shall not linger long over this point[fn-43-P4358_1411931:71-nf] for Christ's own definition[fn-43-P4359_1411974:72-nf] comes to our aid at once. From works must proofs be obtained. The Creator's works testify at once to His goodness, since they are good, as we have shown, and to His power, since they are mighty, and spring indeed out of nothing. And even if they were made out of some (previous) matter, as some[fn-43-P4360_1412286:73-nf] will have it, they are even thus out of nothing, because they were not what they are. In short, both they are great because they are good; and[fn-43-P4361_1412488:74-nf] God is likewise mighty, because all things are His own, whence He is almighty. But what shall I say of His prescience, which has for its witnesses as many prophets as it inspired? After all,[fn-43-P4362_1412699:75-nf] what title to prescience do we look for in the Author of the universe, since it was by this very attribute that He foreknew all things when He appointed them their places, and appointed them their places when He fore knew them? There is sin itself. If He had not foreknown this, He would not have proclaimed a caution against it under the penalty of death. Now if there were in God such attributes as must have rendered it both impossible and improper for any evil to have happened to man,[fn-43-P4363_1413204:76-nf] and yet evil did occur, let us consider man's condition also-whether it were not, in fact, rather the cause why that came to pass which could not have happened through God. I find, then, that man was by God constituted free, master of his own will and power; indicating the presence of God's image and likeness in him by nothing so well as by this constitution of his nature. For it was not by his face, and by the lineaments of his body, though they were so varied in his human nature, that he expressed his likeness to the form of God; but he showed his stamp[fn-43-P4364_1413799:77-nf] in that essence which he derived from God Himself (that is, the spiritual,[fn-43-P4365_1413893:78-nf] which answered to the form of God), and in the freedom and power of his will. This his state was confirmed even by the very law which God then imposed upon him. For a law would not be imposed upon one who had it not in his power to render that obedience which is due to law; nor again, would the penalty of death be threatened against sin, if a contempt of the law were impossible to man in the liberty of his will. So in the Creator's subsequent laws also you will find, when He sets before man good and evil, life and death, that the entire course of discipline is arranged in precepts by God's calling men from sin, and threatening and exhorting them; and this on no other ground than[fn-43-P4366_1414594:79-nf] that man is free, with a will either for obedience or resistance.","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_21_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But now let us see what understanding he who has the knowledge of existent things possesses beyond the rest of the world. Let us listen to his arrogant utterance:-\"Surely it would have been idle for the Lord to call Himself `the door,' if there were none to pass through to the understanding and contemplation of the Father, and it would have been idle for Him to call Himself `the way,' if He gave no facility to those who wish to come to the Father. And how could He be a light, without lightening men, without illuminating the eye of their soul to understand both Himself and the transcendent Light?\" Well, if he were here enumerating some arguments from his own head, that evade the understanding of the hearers by their subtlety, there would perhaps be a possibility of being deceived by the ingenuity of the argument, as his underlying thought frequently escapes the reader's notice. But since he alleges the Divine words, of course no one blames those who believe that their inspired teaching is the common property of all. \"Since then,\" he says, \"the Lord was named `a door,' it follows from hence that the essence of God may be comprehended by man.\" But the Gospel does not admit of this meaning. Let us hear the Divine utterance itself. \"I am the door,\" Christ says; \"by Me if any man enter in he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and find pasture[fn-19-P1942_1166647:1-nf] \" Which then of these is the knowledge of the essence? For as several things are here said, and each of them has its own special meaning, it is impossible to refer them all to the idea of the essence, lest the Deity should be thought to be compounded of different elements; and yet it is not easy to find which of the phrases just quoted can most properly be applied to that subject. The Lord is \"the door,\" \"By Me,\" He says, \"if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and shall find pasture.\" Are we to say[fn-19-P1943_1167193:2-nf] \"entrance\" of which he speaks in place of the essence of God, or \"salvation\" of those that enter in, or \"going out,\" or \"pasture,\" or \"finding\"?-for each of these is peculiar in its significance, and does not agree in meaning with the rest. For to get within appears obviously contrary to \"going out,\" and so with the other phrases. For \"pasture,\" in its proper meaning, is one thing, and \"finding\" another thing distinct from it. Which, then, of these is the essence of the Father supposed to be? For assuredly one cannot, by uttering all these phrases that disagree one with another in signification, intend to indicate by incompatible terms that Essence which is simple and uncompounded. And how can the word hold good, \"No man hath seen God at any time[fn-19-P1944_1168015:3-nf] \" and, \"Whom no man hath seen nor can see[fn-19-P1945_1168075:4-nf] \" and, \"There shall no man see the face of the Lord and live[fn-19-P1946_1168154:5-nf] \" if to be inside the door, or outside, or the finding pasture, denote the essence of the Father? For truly He is at the same time a \"door of encompassing[fn-19-P1947_1168334:6-nf] \" and a \"house of defence[fn-19-P1948_1168383:7-nf] \" as David calls Him, and through Himself He receives them that enter, and in Himself He saves those who have come within, and again by Himself He leads them forth to the pasture of virtues, and becomes all things to them that are in the way of salvation, that so He may make Himself that which the needs of each demand,-both way, and guide, and \"door of encompassing,\" and \"house of defence,\" and \"water of comfort[fn-19-P1949_1168815:8-nf] \" and \"green pasture[fn-19-P1950_1168853:9-nf] \" which in the Gospel He calls \"pasture\": but our new divine says that the Lord has been called \"the door\" because of the knowledge of the essence of the Father. Why then does he not force into the same significance the titles, \"Rock,\" and \"Stone,\" and \"Fountain,\" and \"Tree,\" and the rest, that so he might obtain evidence for his own theory by the multitude of strange testimonies, as he is well able to apply to each of these the same account which he has given of the Way, the Door, and the Light? But, as I am so taught by the inspired Scripture, I boldly affirm that He Who is above every name has for us many names, receiving them in accordance with the variety of His gracious dealings with us[fn-19-P1951_1169573:10-nf] \"tower of strength[fn-19-P1952_1169826:11-nf] \" and a \"city of encompassing[fn-19-P1953_1169873:12-nf] ,\" and a fountain, and a rock, and a vine, and a physician, and resurrection, and all the like, with reference to us, imparting Himself under various aspects by virtue of His benefits to us-ward. But those who are keen-sighted beyond human power, who see the incomprehensible, but overlook what may be comprehended, when they use such titles to expound the essences, are positive that they not only see, but measure Him Whom no man hath seen nor can see, but do not with the eye of their soul discern the Faith, which is the only thing within the compass of our observation, valuing before this the knowledge which they obtain from ratiocination. Just so I have heard the sacred record laying blame upon the sons of Benjamin who did not regard the law, but could shoot within a hair's breadth[fn-19-P1954_1170691:13-nf] , wherein, methinks, the word exhibited their eager pursuit of an idle object, that they were far darting and dexterous aimers at things that were useless and unsubstantial, but ignorant and regardless of what was manifestly for their benefit. For after what I have quoted, the history goes on to relate what befel them, how, when they had run madly after the iniquity of Sodom, and the people of Israel had taken up arms against them in full force, they were utterly destroyed. And it seems to me to be a kindly thought to warn young archers not to wish to shoot within a hair's-breadth, while they have no eyes for the door of the faith, but rather to drop their idle labour about the incomprehensible, and not to lose the gain that is ready to their hand, which is found by faith alone.

And, indeed, on this subject of the Father and the Son, learned and spiritual[fn-32-P3259_1501126:77-nf] men have conducted discussions in many books, in which, so far as men could do with men, they have endeavored to introduce an intelligible account as to how the Father was not one personally with the Son, and yet the two were one substantially;[fn-32-P3260_1501447:78-nf] and as to what the Father was individually (proprie), and what the Son: to wit, that the former was the Begetter, the latter the Begotten; the formernot of the Son, the latter of the Father: theformer the Beginning of the latter, whence also He is called the Head of Christ,[fn-32-P3261_1501854:79-nf] although Christ likewise is the Beginning,[fn-32-P3262_1501917:80-nf] but not of the Father; the latter, moreover, the Image[fn-32-P3263_1502149:81-nf] of the former, although in no respect dissimilar, and although absolutely and without difference equal (omnino et indifferenter aequalis). These questions are handled with greater breadth by those who, in less narrow limits than ours are at present, seek to set forth the profession of the Christian faith in its totality. Accordingly, in so far as He is the Son, of the Father received He it that He is, while that other [the Father] received not this of the Son; and in so far as He, in unutterable mercy, in a temporal dispensation took upon Himself the [nature of] man (hominem),-to wit, the changeable creature that was thereby to be changed into something better,-many statements concerning Him are discovered in the Scriptures, which are so expressed as to have given occasion to error in the impious intellects of heretics, with whom the desire to teach takes precedence of that to understand, so that they have supposed Him to be neither equal with the Father nor of the same substance. Such statements [are meant] as the following: \"For the Father is greater than I;\"[fn-32-P3264_1503245:82-nf] and, \"The head of the woman is the man, the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God;\"[fn-32-P3265_1503368:83-nf] and, \"Then shall He Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him;\"[fn-32-P3266_1503467:84-nf] and, \"I go to my Father and your Father, my God and your God,\"[fn-32-P3267_1503550:85-nf] together with some others of like tenor. Now all these have had a place given them, [certainly] not with the object of signifying an inequality of nature and substance; for to take them so would be to falsify a different class of statements, such as, \"I and my Father are one\" (unum);[fn-32-P3268_1503853:86-nf] and, \"He that hath seen me hath seen my Father also;\"[fn-32-P3269_1503923:87-nf] and, \"The Word was God,\"[fn-32-P3270_1503966:88-nf] for He was not made, inasmuch as \"all things were made by Him;\"[fn-32-P3271_1504046:89-nf] and, \"He thought it not robbery to be equal with God:\"[fn-32-P3272_1504117:90-nf] together with all the other passages of a similar order. But these statements have had a place given them, partly with a view to that administration of His assumption of human nature (administrationem suscepti hominis), in accordance with which it is said that \"He emptied Himself:\" not that that Wisdom was changed, since it is absolutely unchangeable; but that it was His will to make Himself known in such humble fashion to men. Partly then, I repeat, it is with a view to this administration that those things have been thus written which the heretics make the ground of their false allegations; and partly it was with a view to the consideration that the Son owes to the Father that which He is,[fn-32-P3273_1504849:91-nf] -thereby also certainly owing this in particular to the Father, to wit, that He is equal to the same Father, or that He is His Peer (eidem Patri aequalis aut par est), whereas the Father owes whatsoever He is to no one.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_22_book_xi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Not even Marcion himself, the patron of your opinions, supports you in this. It is true that in common with you he holds a dualism of gods, and thinks that one is different in nature from the other, but it is the more courteous view to attribute goodness to the God of the Gospel. You however actually separate the Only begotten God from the nature of good, that you may surpass even Marcion in the depravity of your doctrines. However, they claim the Scripture on their side, and say that they are hardly treated when they are accused for using the very words of Scripture. For they say that the Lord Himself has said, \"There is none good but one, that is, God[fn-20-P2020_1217688:5-nf] .\" Accordingly, that misrepresentation may not prevail against the Divine words, we will briefly examine the actual passage in the Gospel. The history regards the rich man to whom the Lord spoke this word as young-the kind of person, I suppose, inclined to enjoy the pleasures of this life-and attached to his possessions; for it says that he was grieved at the advice to part with what he had, and that he did not choose to exchange his property for life eternal. This man, when he heard that a teacher of eternal life was in the neighbourhood, came to him in the expectation of living in perpetual luxury, with life indefinitely extended, flattering the Lord with the title of \"good,\"-flattering, I should rather say, not the Lord as we conceive Him, but as He then appeared in the form of a servant. For his character was not such as to enable him to penetrate the outward veil of flesh, and see through it into the inner shrine of Deity. The Lord, then, Who seeth the hearts, discerned the motive with which the young man approached Him as a suppliant,-that he did so, not with a soul intently fixed upon the Divine, but that it was the man whom he besought, calling Him \"Good Master,\" because he hoped to learn from Him some lore by which the approach of death might be hindered. Accordingly, with good reason did He Who was thus besought by him answer even as He was addressed[fn-20-P2021_1219096:6-nf] . For as the entreaty was not addressed to God the Word, so correspondingly the answer was delivered to the applicant by the Humanity of Christ, thereby impressing on the youth a double lesson. For He teaches him, by one and the same answer, both the duty of reverencing and paying homage to the Divinity, not by flattering speeches but by his life, by keeping the commandments and buying life eternal at the cost of all possessions, and also the truth that humanity, having been sunk in depravity by reason of sin, is debarred from the title of \"Good\": and for this reason He says, \"Why callest Thou Me good?\" suggesting in His answer by the word \"Me\" that human nature which encompassed Him, while by attributing goodness to the Godhead He expressly declared Himself to be good, seeing that He is proclaimed to be God by the Gospel. For had the Only-begotten Son been excluded from the title of God, it would perhaps not have been absurd to think Him alien also from the appellation of \"good.\" But if, as is the case, prophets, evangelists, and Apostles proclaim aloud the Godhead of the Only-begotten, and if the name of goodness is attested by the Lord Himself to belong to God, how is it possible that He Who is partaker of the Godhead should not be partaker of the goodness too? For that both prophets, evangelists, disciples and apostles acknowledge the Lord as God, there is none so uninitiated in Divine mysteries as to need to be expressly told. For who knows not that in the forty-fourth[fn-20-P2022_1220629:7-nf] Psalm the prophet in his word affirms the Christ to be God, anointed by God? And again, who of all that are conversant with prophecy is unaware that Isaiah, among other passages, thus openly proclaims the Godhead of the Son, where he says: \"The Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and shall be servants unto thee: they shall come after thee bound in fetters, and in thee shall they make supplication, because God is in thee, and there is no God beside thee; for thou art God[fn-20-P2023_1221227:8-nf] .\" For what other God there is Who has God in Himself, and is Himself God, except the Only-begotten, let them say who hearken not to the prophecy; but of the interpretation of Emmanuel, and the confession of Thomas after his recognition of the Lord, and the sublime diction of John, as being manifest even to those who are outside the faith, I will say nothing. Nay, I do not even think it necessary to bring forward in detail the utterances of Paul, since they are, as one may say, in all men's mouths, who gives the Lord the appellation not only of \"God,\" but of \"great God\" and \"God over all,\" saying to the Romans, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Who is over all, God blessed for ever[fn-20-P2024_1221999:9-nf] ,\" and writing to his disciple Titus, \"According to the appearing of Jesus Christ the great God and our Saviour[fn-20-P2025_1222127:10-nf] ,\" and to Timothy, proclaims in plain terms, \"God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit[fn-20-P2026_1222403:11-nf] .\" Since then the fact has been demonstrated on every side that the Only-begotten God is God[fn-20-P2027_1222591:12-nf] , how is it that he who says that goodness belongs to God, strives to show that the Godhead of the Son is alien from this ascription, and this though the Lord has actually claimed for Himself the epithet \"good\" in the parable of those who were hired into the vineyard? For there, when those who had laboured before the others were dissatisfied at all receiving the same pay, and deemed the good fortune of the last to be their own loss, the just judge says to one of the murmurers[fn-20-P2028_1223220:13-nf] , \"Friend, I do thee no wrong: did I not agree with thee for a penny a day? Lo, there thou hast that is thine[fn-20-P2029_1223516:14-nf] : I will bestow upon this last even as upon thee. Have I not power to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am good?\" Of course no one will contest the point that to distribute recompense according to desert is the special function of the judge; and all the disciples of the Gospel agree that the Only-begotten God is Judge; \"for the Father,\" He saith, \"judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son[fn-20-P2030_1224039:15-nf] .\" But they do not set themselves in opposition[fn-20-P2031_1224107:16-nf] to the Scriptures. For they say that the word \"one\" absolutely points to the Father. For He saith, \"There is none good but one, that is God.\" Will truth then lack vigour to plead her own cause? Surely there are many means easily to convict of deception this quibble also. For He Who said this concerning the Father spake also to the Father that other word, \"All Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine, and I am glorified in them[fn-20-P2032_1224742:17-nf] .\" Now if He says that all that is the Father's is also the Son's, and goodness is one of the attributes pertaining to the Father, either the Son has not all things if He has not this, and they will be saying that the Truth lies, or if it is impious to suspect the very Truth of being carried away into falsehood, then He Who claimed all that is the Father's as His own, thereby asserted that He was not outside of goodness. For He Who has the Father in Himself, and contains all things that belong to the Father, manifestly has His goodness with \"all things.\" Therefore the Son is Good. But \"there is none good,\" he says, \"but one, that is God.\" This is what is alleged by our adversaries: nor do I myself reject the statement. I do not, however, for this cause deny the Godhead of the Son. But he who confesses that the Lord is God, by that very confession assuredly also asserts of Him goodness. For if goodness is a property of God, and if the Lord is God, then by our premises the Son is shown to be God. \"But,\" says our opponent, \"the word `one' excludes the Son from participation in goodness.\" It is easy, however, to show that not even the word \"one\" separates the Father from the Son. For in all other cases, it is true, the term \"one\" carries with it the signification of not being coupled with anything else, but in the case of the Father and the Son \"one\" does not imply isolation. For He says, \"I and the Father are one[fn-20-P2033_1226200:18-nf] .\" If, then, the good is one, and a particular kind of unity is contemplated in the Father and the Son, it follows that the Lord, in predicating goodness of \"one,\" claimed under the term \"one\" the title of \"good\" also for Himself, Who is one with the Father, and not severed from oneness of nature.","title":"Book XI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":10,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"185","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"I know that Satan has sought to sift you as wheat,[fn-57-P5710_1394375:118-nf] and that the Lord has allowed him so to do that He may shew the wheat, and prove the gold, crown the athletes, and proclaim the victors` names. Nevertheless I fear and tremble, not indeed distressed for the sake of you who are noble champions of the truth, but because I know that it comes to pass that some men are of feebler heart. If among twelve apostles one was found a traitor, there is no doubt that among a number many times as great any one might easily discover many falling short of perfection. Thus reflecting I have been confounded and filled with much discouragement, for, as says the divine Apostle, \"whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it.\"[fn-57-P5711_1395072:119-nf] \"We are members one of another,\"[fn-57-P5712_1395129:120-nf] and form one body, having the Lord Christ for head.[fn-57-P5713_1395201:121-nf] Yet one consolation I have in my anxiety, when I bethink me of your holiness.

For, as the Lord says, \"he that is an hireling\" when he sees \"the wolf coming,\" \"fleeth because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep,\" but \"the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.\"[fn-57-P5714_1395688:122-nf] Just so it is not in peace that the best general shews his inborn valour, but in time of war, by at once stimulating others and himself exposing himself to peril for his men. For it would be preposterous that he should enjoy the dignity of his command, and, in the hour of need, run out of danger's way. Thus the thrice blessed prophets ever acted, making light of the safety of their bodies, and, for the sake of the Jews who hated and rejected them, underwent all kinds of peril and toil. Of them the divine apostle says \"they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain by the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy; they wandered in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.\"[fn-57-P5715_1396536:123-nf] Thus the divine apostles travelled preaching over all the world, without home, bed, bedding, board, or any of the necessaries of life, but scourged, racked, imprisoned, and undergoing countless kinds of death. And all this they underwent, not for the sake of their friends, but voluntarily facing these perils for the sake of the men who were persecuting them. A far stronger claim is made on you now to accept the peril at present assailing you, for the sake of fellow-believers and brothers and children. This affection is shown even by unreasoning animals, for sparrows may be seen fighting with all their force in behalf of their brood, and putting out in their defence all the strength they have; other kinds of birds moreover undergo danger for their young.

For Arius and Eunomius, asserting the only begotten Son of God to be a creature, and made out of the non-existent, and a servant, have ventured to apply to His godhead what is said in lowly and human sense; establishing by such means the difference of substance and the unlikeness. Besides this, to be brief, he argues that the very impassible and immutable Godhead of the Christ suffered, and was crucified, dead, and buried. This goes beyond even the madness of Arius and Eunomius, for this pitch of impiety has not been reached even by them that dare to call the maker and creator of the universe a creature. Furthermore he blasphemes against the Holy Ghost, denying that It proceeds from the Father, in accordance with the word of the Lord, but maintaining that It has Its origin of the Son. Here we have the fruit of the Apollinarian seed; here we come near the evil husbandry of Macedonius. Such are the offspring of the Egyptian, viler children of a vile father. This growth, which men, entrusted with the healing of souls, ought to make abortive while yet in the womb, or destroy as soon as it is born, as dangerous and deadly to mankind, is cherished by these excellent persons, and promoted with great energy, alike to their own ruin and to that of all who will listen to them.We, on the contrary, earnestly desire to keep our heritage untouched; and the faith which we have received, and in which we have been ourselves baptized, and baptize others, we strive to preserve uninjured and undefiled. We confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and body, was begotten of the Father before the ages, as touching the Godhead; and in the last days for us men and our salvation (was born) of the Virgin Mary; that the same Lord is of one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, and of one substance with us as touching the manhood. For there was an union of two natures. Wherefore we acknowledge one Christ, one Son, one Lord; but we do not destroy the union; we believe it to have been made without confusion, in obedience to the word of the Lord to the Jews, \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-65-P6501_1678851:549-nf] If on the contrary there had been mixture and confusion, and one nature was made out of both, He ought to have said \"Destroy me and in three days I shall be raised.\" But now, to show that there is a distinction between God according to His nature, and the temple, and that both are one Christ, His words are \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,\" clearly teaching that it was not God who was undergoing destruction, but the temple. The nature of this latter was susceptible of destructions while the power of the former raised what was being destroyed. Furthermore it is in obedience to the divine Scriptures that we acknowledge the Christ to be God and man. That our Lord Jesus Christ is God is asserted by the blessed evangelist John \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was. God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made that was made.\"[fn-65-P6502_1679824:550-nf] And again, \"That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\"[fn-65-P6503_1679932:551-nf] And the Lord Himself distinctly teaches us, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\"[fn-65-P6504_1680039:552-nf] And \"I and my Father are one\"[fn-65-P6505_1680089:553-nf] and \"I am in the Father and the Father in me,\"[fn-65-P6506_1680155:554-nf] and the blessed Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews says \"Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power\"[fn-65-P6507_1680368:555-nf] and in the epistle to the Philippians \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant.\"[fn-65-P6508_1680634:556-nf] And in the Epistle to the Romans, \"Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever.

For Arius and Eunomius, asserting the only begotten Son of God to be a creature, and made out of the non-existent, and a servant, have ventured to apply to His godhead what is said in lowly and human sense; establishing by such means the difference of substance and the unlikeness. Besides this, to be brief, he argues that the very impassible and immutable Godhead of the Christ suffered, and was crucified, dead, and buried. This goes beyond even the madness of Arius and Eunomius, for this pitch of impiety has not been reached even by them that dare to call the maker and creator of the universe a creature. Furthermore he blasphemes against the Holy Ghost, denying that It proceeds from the Father, in accordance with the word of the Lord, but maintaining that It has Its origin of the Son. Here we have the fruit of the Apollinarian seed; here we come near the evil husbandry of Macedonius. Such are the offspring of the Egyptian, viler children of a vile father. This growth, which men, entrusted with the healing of souls, ought to make abortive while yet in the womb, or destroy as soon as it is born, as dangerous and deadly to mankind, is cherished by these excellent persons, and promoted with great energy, alike to their own ruin and to that of all who will listen to them.We, on the contrary, earnestly desire to keep our heritage untouched; and the faith which we have received, and in which we have been ourselves baptized, and baptize others, we strive to preserve uninjured and undefiled. We confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and body, was begotten of the Father before the ages, as touching the Godhead; and in the last days for us men and our salvation (was born) of the Virgin Mary; that the same Lord is of one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, and of one substance with us as touching the manhood. For there was an union of two natures. Wherefore we acknowledge one Christ, one Son, one Lord; but we do not destroy the union; we believe it to have been made without confusion, in obedience to the word of the Lord to the Jews, \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-65-P6501_1678851:549-nf] If on the contrary there had been mixture and confusion, and one nature was made out of both, He ought to have said \"Destroy me and in three days I shall be raised.\" But now, to show that there is a distinction between God according to His nature, and the temple, and that both are one Christ, His words are \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,\" clearly teaching that it was not God who was undergoing destruction, but the temple. The nature of this latter was susceptible of destructions while the power of the former raised what was being destroyed. Furthermore it is in obedience to the divine Scriptures that we acknowledge the Christ to be God and man. That our Lord Jesus Christ is God is asserted by the blessed evangelist John \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was. God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made that was made.\"[fn-65-P6502_1679824:550-nf] And again, \"That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\"[fn-65-P6503_1679932:551-nf] And the Lord Himself distinctly teaches us, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\"[fn-65-P6504_1680039:552-nf] And \"I and my Father are one\"[fn-65-P6505_1680089:553-nf] and \"I am in the Father and the Father in me,\"[fn-65-P6506_1680155:554-nf] and the blessed Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews says \"Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power\"[fn-65-P6507_1680368:555-nf] and in the epistle to the Philippians \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant.\"[fn-65-P6508_1680634:556-nf] And in the Epistle to the Romans, \"Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever.

Again, as to Mark's mentioning that the Lord said not only \"Father,\" but \"Abba, Father,\" the explanation simply is, that \"Abba\" is in Hebrew exactly what \"Pater\" is in Latin. And perhaps the Lord may have used both words with some kind of symbolical significance, intending to indicate thereby, that in sustaining this sorrow He bore the part of His body, which is the Church, of which He has been made the corner-stone, and which comes to Him [in the person of disciples gathered] partly out of the Hebrews, to whom He refers when He says \"Abba,\" and partly out of the Gentiles, to whom He refers when He says \"Pater\" [Father].[fn-23-P2305_983569:45-nf] The Apostle Paul also makes use of the same significant expression. For he says, \"In whom we cry, Abba, Father;\"[fn-23-P2306_983707:46-nf] and, in another passage, \"God sent His Spirit into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.\"[fn-23-P2307_983814:47-nf] For it was meet that the good Master and true Saviour, by sharing in the sufferings of the more infirm,[fn-23-P2308_983935:48-nf] should in His own person illustrate the truth that His witnesses ought not to despair, although it might perchance happen that, through human frailty, sorrow might steal in upon their hearts at the time of suffering; seeing that they would overcome it if, mindful that God knows what is best for those whose well-being He regards, they gave His will the preference over their own. On this subject, however, as a whole, the present is not the time for entering on any more detailed discussion. For we have to deal simply with the question concerning the harmony of the evangelists, from whose varied modes of narration we gather the wholesome lesson that, in order to get at the truth, the one essential thing to aim at in dealing with the terms is simply the intention which the speaker had in view in using them. For the word \"Father\" means just the same as the phrase \"Abba, Father.\" But with a view to bring out the mystic significance, the expression, \"Abba, Father,\" is the clearer form; while, for indicating the unity, the word \"Father\" is sufficient. And that the Lord did indeed employ this method of address, \"Abba, Father,\" must be accepted as matter of fact. But still His intention would not appear very obvious were there not the means (since others use simply the term \"Father\") to show that under such a form of expression those two Churches, which are constituted, the one out of the Jews, and the other out of the Gentiles, are presented as also really one. In this way, then, [we may suppose that] the phrase, \"Abba, Father,\" was adopted in order to convey the same idea as was indicated by the Lord on another occasion, when He said, \"Other sheep I have which are not of this fold.\"[fn-23-P2309_985712:49-nf] In these words He certainly referred to the Gentiles, since He had sheep also among the people of Israel. But in that passage He goes on immediately to add the declaration, \"Them also I must bring, that there may be one fold and one Shepherd.\" And so we may say that, just as the phrase, \"Abba, Father,\" contains the idea of [the two races,] the Israelites and the Gentiles, the word \"Father,\" used alone, points to the one flock which these two constitute.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_25_answer_to_eunomius_second_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But before we examine what he has written, it may be better to enquire with what purpose it is that he refuses to admit that ungenerate can be predicated of God by way of conception. Now the tenet which has been held in common by all who have received the word of our religion is, that all hope of salvation should be placed in Christ, it being impossible for any to be found among the righteous, unless faith in Christ supply what is desired. And this conviction being firmly established in the souls of the faithful, and all honour and glory and worship being due to the Only-begotten God as the Author of life, Who doeth the works of the Father, as the Lord Himself saith in the Gospel[fn-21-P2176_1342925:10-nf] , and Who falls short of no excellence in all knowledge of that which is good, I know not how they have been so perverted by malignity and jealousy of the Lord's honour, that, as though they judged the worship paid by the faithful to the Only-begotten God to be a detriment to themselves, they oppose His Divine honours, and try to persuade us that nothing that is said of them is true. For with them neither is He very God, though called so, it would seem, by Scripture, nor, though called Son, has He a nature that makes good the appellation, nor has He a community of dignity or of nature with the Father. For, say they, it is not possible for Him that is begotten to be of equal honour with Him Who made Him, either in dignity, or in power, or in nature, because the life of the latter is infinite, and His existence from eternity, while the life of the Son is in a manner circumscribed, the beginning of His being begotten limiting His life at the commencement, and preventing it from being coextensive with the eternity of the Father, so that His life also is to be regarded as defective; and the Father was not always what He now is and is said to be, but, having been something else before, He afterwards determined that He would be a Father, or rather that He would be so called. For not even of the Son was He rightly called Father, but of a creature supposititiously invested with the title of son. And every way, say they, the younger is of necessity inferior to the elder, the finite to the eternal, that which is begotten by the will of the begetter, to the begetter himself, both in power, and dignity, and nature, and precedence due to age, and all other prerogatives of respect. But how can we justly dignify with the honours due to the true God that which is wanting in the perfection of the diviner attributes? Thus they would establish the doctrine that one who is limited in power, and wanting in the perfection of life, and subject to a superior, and doing nothing of himself but what is sanctioned by the authority of the more powerful, is in no divine honour and consideration, but that, while we call him God, we are employing a term empty of all grandeur in its significance. And since such statements as these, when stripped of their plausible dress, move indignation and make the hearer shudder at their strangeness (for who can tolerate an evil counsellor nakedly and unadvisably urging the overthrow of the majesty of Christ?), they therefore try to pervert foolish hearers with these foreign notions by enveloping their malignant and insidious arguments in a number of seductive fallacies.

John remains, between whom and others there is left no comparison to be instituted. For, however the evangelists may each have reported some matters which are not recorded by the others, it will be hard to prove that any question involving real discrepancy arises out of these. Thus, too, it is a clearly admitted position that the first three-namely, Matthew, Mark, and Luke-have occupied themselves chiefly with the humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to which He is both king and priest. And in this way, Mark, who seems to answer to the figure of the man in the well-known mystical symbol of the four living creatures,[fn-28-P2810_1244313:41-nf] either appears to be preferentially the companion of Matthew, as he narrates a larger number of matters in unison with him than with the rest, and therein acts in due harmony with the idea of the kingly character whose wont it is, as I have stated in the first book,[fn-28-P2811_1244601:42-nf] to be not unaccompanied by attendants; or else, in accordance with the more probable account of the matter, he holds a course in conjunction with both [the other Synoptists]. For although he is at one with Matthew in the larger number of passages, he is nevertheless at one rather with Luke in some others. And this very fact shows him to stand related at once to the lion and to the steer, that is to say, to the kingly office which Matthew emphasizes, and to the sacerdotal which Luke introduces, wherein also Christ appears distinctively as man, as the figure which Mark sustains stands related to both these. On the other hand, Christ's divinity, in virtue of which He is equal to the Father, in accordance with which He is the Word, and God with God, and the Word that was made flesh in order to dwell among us,[fn-28-P2812_1245438:43-nf] in accordance with which also. He and the Father are one,[fn-28-P2813_1245516:44-nf] has been taken specially in hand by John with a view to its recommendation to our minds. Like an eagle, he abides among Christ's sayings of the sublimer order, and in no way descends to earth but on rare occasions. In brief, although he declares plainly his own knowledge of the Lord's mother, he nevertheless neither unites with Matthew and Luke in recording His nativity, nor associates himself with all the three in relating His baptism; but all that he does there is simply to present the testimony delivered by John in a lofty and sublime fashion, and then, quitting the company of these others, he proceeds with Him to the marriage in Cana of Galilee. And there, although the evangelist himself mentions His mother by that very name, He nevertheless addresses her thus: \"Woman, what have I to do with thee?\"[fn-28-P2814_1246348:45-nf] In this, however, [it is to be understood that] He does not repel her of whom He received the flesh, but means to convey the conception of His divinity with special fitness at Ibis time, when He is about to change the water into wine; which divinity, likewise, had made that woman, and had not itself been made in her.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_15_book_iv_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"17. Again, how weighty are the things which this evangelist reports Jesus to have spoken, when He came back to the temple from Mount Olivet, and after the forgiveness which He extended to the adulteress, who had been brought before Him by His tempters, as one deserving to be stoned: on which occasion He wrote with His finger upon the ground, as if He would indicate that people of the character of these men would be written on earth, and not in heaven, as He also admonished His disciples to rejoice that their names were written in heaven![fn-28-P2837_1255716:62-nf] Or, it may be that He meant to convey the idea that it was by humbling Himself (which He expressed by bending down His head) that He wrought signs upon the earth; or, that the time was now come when His law should be written, not, as formerly, on the sterile stone, but on a soil which would yield fruit. Accordingly, after these incidents, He affirmed Himself to be the light of the world, and declared that be who followed Him would not walk in darkness, but would have the light of life. He said, also, that He was \"the beginning which also discoursed to them.\"[fn-28-P2838_1256406:63-nf] By which designation He clearly distinguished Himself from the light which He made, and presented Himself as the Light by which all things have been made.

Next, after telling the story of the giving of sight to the man who was blind from his birth, John tarries for a space over the copious discourse to which that incident gave occasion, on the subject of the sheep, and the shepherd, and the door, and the power of laying down His life and taking it again, wherein He gave token of the supreme might of His divinity. Thereafter, he relates how, at the time when the feast of the dedication was being celebrated in Jerusalem, the Jews said to Him, \"How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.\"[fn-28-P2844_1257918:68-nf] And then he reports the sublime words which the Lord uttered when the opportunity thus arose for a discourse.

He adds: \"Because of the angels.\"[fn-75-P7511_2155827:343-nf] What angels? In other words, whose angels? If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,[fn-75-P7512_2155938:344-nf] there is great propriety in his meaning. It is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise and obscured beauty. If, however, the angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is there for them? for not even Marcion's disciples, (to say nothing of his angels, ) have any desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as evil[fn-75-P7513_2156431:345-nf] among \"works of the flesh,\" and that he would have those persons accounted estimable[fn-75-P7514_2156542:346-nf] who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,[fn-75-P7515_2156654:347-nf] we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup[fn-75-P7516_2156753:348-nf] the verity of the Lord's body and blood in opposition to Marcion's phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of \"spiritual gifts,\"[fn-75-P7517_2157084:349-nf] I have to remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower[fn-75-P7518_2157455:350-nf] shall spring up from his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.\" After which he enumerates the special gifts of the same \"The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.[fn-75-P7519_2157733:351-nf] And with the fear of the Lord[fn-75-P7520_2157801:352-nf] shall the Spirit fill Him.\"[fn-75-P7521_2157867:353-nf] In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest, not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;[fn-75-P7522_2158291:354-nf] so that you cannot argue from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says, ) on the contrary, that from the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,[fn-75-P7523_2158731:355-nf] rising from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst them. From Judah were taken away \"the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the counsellor, and the prophet; \"[fn-75-P7524_2159162:356-nf] that so it might prove true that \"the law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-75-P7525_2159266:357-nf] Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: \"He ascended up. on high,\" that is, into heaven; \"He led captivity captive,\" meaning death or slavery of man; \"He gave gifts to the sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7526_2159546:358-nf] that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata. He says specifically \"sons of men,\"[fn-75-P7527_2159690:359-nf] and not men promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children of men truly so called, choice men, apostles. \"For,\" says he, \"I have begotten you through the gospel; \"[fn-75-P7528_2159927:360-nf] and \"Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.\"[fn-75-P7529_2160009:361-nf] Now was absolutely fulfilled that promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel: \"In the last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.\"[fn-75-P7530_2160310:362-nf] Since, then, the Creator promised the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ has in these last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle says, \"When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son; \"[fn-75-P7531_2160624:363-nf] and again, \"This I say, brethren, that the time is short\"[fn-75-P7532_2160701:364-nf] ), it evidently follows in connection with this prediction of the last days, that this gift of the Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters. Now compare the Spirit's specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised by the prophet Isaiah. \"To one is given,\" says he, \"by the Spirit the word of wisdom; \"this we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be \"the spirit of wisdom.\" \"To another, the word of knowledge; \"this will be \"the (prophet's) spirit of understanding and counsel.\" \"To another, faith by the same Spirit; \"this will be \"the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.\" \"To another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles; \"this will be \"the spirit of might.\" \"To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues; \"this will be \"the spirit of knowledge.\"[fn-75-P7533_2161674:365-nf] See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting together of the various gifts of the Spirit,[fn-75-P7534_2162038:366-nf] shows also that there is but one Lord of the human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle's showing, )[fn-75-P7535_2162223:367-nf] meant not[fn-75-P7536_2162301:368-nf] that the service[fn-75-P7537_2162335:369-nf] of these gifts should be in the body,[fn-75-P7538_2162389:370-nf] nor did He place them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love[fn-75-P7539_2162534:371-nf] above all these gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,[fn-75-P7540_2162653:372-nf] just as Christ has shown it to be: \"Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,[fn-75-P7541_2162788:373-nf] with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.\"[fn-75-P7542_2162898:374-nf] When he mentions the fact that \"it is written in the law,\"[fn-75-P7543_2162976:375-nf] how that the Creator would speak with other tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference to the Creator's prediction.[fn-75-P7544_2163475:376-nf] In precisely the same manner,[fn-75-P7545_2163528:377-nf] when enjoining on women silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake[fn-75-P7546_2163627:378-nf] of learning[fn-75-P7547_2163663:379-nf] (although that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown[fn-75-P7548_2163767:380-nf] when he covers the woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should be under obedience.[fn-75-P7549_2163940:381-nf] Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them for his God, and whether it is possible that they are opposed to our side, even if[fn-75-P7550_2164330:382-nf] the Creator promised them for His Christ who is not yet revealed, as being destined only for the Jews, to have their operations in His time, in His Christ, and among His people. Let Marcion then exhibit, as gifts of his god, some prophets, such as have not spoken by human sense, but with the Spirit of God, such as have both predicted things to come, and have made manifest[fn-75-P7551_2164765:383-nf] the secrets of the heart;[fn-75-P7552_2164811:384-nf] let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer[fn-75-P7553_2164878:385-nf] -only let it be by the Spirit,[fn-75-P7554_2164932:386-nf] in an ecstasy, that is, in a rapture,[fn-75-P7555_2165230:387-nf] whenever an interpretation of tongues has occurred to him; let him show to me also, that any woman of boastful tongue[fn-75-P7556_2165364:388-nf] in his community has ever prophesied from amongst those specially holy sisters of his. Now all these signs (of spiritual gifts) are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty, and they agree, too, with the rules, and the dispensations, and the instructions of the Creator; therefore without doubt the Christ, and the Spirit, and the apostle, belong severally[fn-75-P7557_2165747:389-nf] to my God.

For \"who knoweth the things of God, and the things in God, but the Spirit, which is in Him? \"[fn-83-P8384_2368666:165-nf] Now His wisdom is that Spirit.

Indeed, as soon as He perceived It to be necessary for His creation of the world, He immediately creates It, and generates It in Himself. \"The Lord,\" says the Scripture, \"possessed[fn-83-P8393_2370341:174-nf] me, the beginning of His ways for the creation of His works.

For if that, which from its being inherent in the Lord[fn-83-P8395_2370920:176-nf] was of Him and in Him, was yet not without a beginning,-I mean[fn-83-P8396_2371005:177-nf] His wisdom, which was then born and created, when in the thought of God It began to assume motion[fn-83-P8397_2371120:178-nf] for the arrangement of His creative works,-how much more impossible[fn-83-P8398_2371211:179-nf] is it that anything should have been without a beginning which was extrinsic to the Lord![fn-83-P8399_2371331:180-nf] But if this same Wisdom is the Word of God, in the capacity[fn-84-P8400_2371413:181-nf] of Wisdom, and (as being He) without whom nothing was made, just as also (nothing) was set in order without Wisdom, how can it be that anything, except the Father, should be older, and on this account indeed nobler, than the Son of God, the only-begotten and first-begotten Word? Not to say that[fn-84-P8401_2371723:182-nf] what is unbegotten is stronger than that which is born, and what is not made more powerful than that which is made.

Again, He Who says \"thou shalt never worship a strange God[fn-26-P2614_1787302:4-nf] \" forbids us to worship another God; and the strange God is so called in contradistinction to our own God. Who, then, is our own God? Clearly, the true God. And who is the strange God? Surely, he who is alien from the nature of the true God. If, therefore, our own God is the true God, and if, as the heretics say, the Only-begotten God is not of the nature of the true God, He is a strange God, and not our God. But the Gospel says, the sheep \"will not follow a stranger[fn-26-P2615_1787792:5-nf] .\" He that says He is created will make Him alien from the nature of the true God. What then will they do, who say that He is created? Do they worship that same created being as God[fn-26-P2616_1787991:6-nf] , or do they not? For if they do not worship Him, they follow the Jews in denying the worship of Christ: and if they do worship Him, they are idolaters, for they worship one alien from the true God. But surely it is equally impious not to worship the Son, and to worship the strange God. We must then say that the Son is the true Son of the true Father, that we may both worship Him, and avoid condemnation as worshipping a strange God. But to those who quote from the Proverbs the passage, \"the Lord created me[fn-26-P2617_1788562:7-nf] ,\" and think that they hereby produce a strong argument that the Creator and Maker of all things was created, we must answer that the Only-begotten God was made for us many things. For He was the Word, and was made flesh; and He was God, and was made man; and He was without body, and was made a body; and besides, He was made \"sin,\" and \"a curse,\" and \"a stone,\" and \"an axe,\" and \"bread,\" and \"a lamb,\" and \"a way,\" and \"a door,\" and \"a rock,\" and many such things; not being by nature any of these, but being made these things for our sakes, by way of dispensation. As, therefore, being the Word, He was for our sakes made flesh, and as, being God, He was made man, so also, being the Creator, He was made for our sakes a creature; for the flesh is created. As, then, He said by the prophet, \"Thus saith the Lord, He that formed me from the womb to be His servant[fn-26-P2618_1789448:8-nf] ;\" so He said also by Solomon, \"The Lord created me as the beginning of His ways, for His works[fn-26-P2619_1789559:9-nf] .\" For all creation, as the Apostle says, is in servitude[fn-26-P2620_1789637:10-nf] . Therefore both He Who was formed in the Virgin's womb, according to the word of the prophet, is the servant, and not the Lord (that is to say, the man according to the flesh, in whom God was manifested), and also, in the other passage, He Who was created as the beginning of His ways is not God, but the man in whom God was manifested to us for the renewing again of the ruined way of man's salvation. So that, since we recognize two things in Christ, one Divine, the other human (the Divine by nature, but the human in the Incarnation), we accordingly claim for the Godhead that which is eternal, and that which is created we ascribe to His human nature. For as, according to the prophet, He was formed in the womb as a servant, so also, according to Solomon, He was manifested in the flesh by means of this servile creation. But when they say, \"if He was, He was not begotten, and if He was begotten He was not,\" let them learn that it is not fitting to ascribe to His Divine nature the attributes which belong to His fleshly origin[fn-26-P2621_1790745:11-nf] . For bodies which do not exist, are generated, and God makes those things to be which are not, but does not Himself come into being from that which is not. And for this reason also Paul calls Him \"the brightness of glory[fn-26-P2622_1791088:12-nf] ,\" that we may learn that as the light from the lamp is of the nature of that which sheds the brightness, and is united with it (for as soon as the lamp appears the light that comes from it shines out simultaneously), so in this place the Apostle would have us consider both that the Son is of the Father, and that the Father is never without the Son; for it is impossible that glory should be without radiance, as it is impossible that the lamp should be without brightness. But it is clear that as His being brightness is a testimony to His being in relation with the glory (for if the glory did not exist, the brightness shed from it would not exist), so, to say that the brightness \"once was not[fn-26-P2623_1791804:13-nf] \" is a declaration that the glory also was not, when the brightness was not; for it is impossible that the glory should be without the brightness. As therefore it is not possible to say in the case of the brightness, \"If it was, it did not come into being, and if it came into being it was not,\" so it is in vain to say this of the Son, seeing that the Son is the brightness. Let those also who speak of \"less\" and \"greater,\" in the case of the Father and the Son, learn from Paul not to measure things immeasurable. For the Apostle says that the Son is the express image of the Person of the Father[fn-26-P2624_1792464:14-nf] . It is clear then that however great the Person of the Father is, so great also is the express image of that Person; for it is not possible that the express image should be less than the Person contemplated in it. And this the great John also teaches when he says, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God[fn-26-P2625_1792804:15-nf] .\" For in saying that he was \"in the beginning\" and not \"after the beginning,\" he showed that the beginning was never without the Word; and in declaring that \"the Word was with God,\" he signified the absence of defect in the Son in relation to the Father; for the Word is contemplated as a whole together with the whole being of God. For if the Word were deficient in His own greatness so as not to be capable of relation with the whole being of God, we are compelled to suppose that that part of Godwhich extends beyond the Word is without the Word. But in fact the whole magnitude of the Word is contemplated together with the whole magnitude of God: and consequently in statements concerning the Divine nature, it is not admissible to speak of \"greater\" and \"less.\"","title":"On the Faith","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":10,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_19_sermon_ii_lii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"13.

If we look at the things by the names of which the Son of God is called, we shall understand how many good things Jesus is, whom those preach whose feet are beautiful. One good thing is life; but Jesus is the life. Another good thing is the light of the world, when it is true light, and the light of men; and all these things the Son of God is said to be. And another good thing which one may conceive to be in addition to life or light is the truth. And a fourth in addition to time is the way which leads to the truth. And all these things our Saviour teaches that He is, when He says:[fn-61-P6173_952885:47-nf] \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" Ah, is not that good, to shake off earth and mortality, and to rise again, obtaining this boon from the Lord, since He is the resurrection, as He says:[fn-61-P6174_953098:48-nf] \"I am the resurrection.\" But the door also is a good, through which one enters into the highest blessedness. Now Christ says:[fn-61-P6175_953241:49-nf] \"I am the door.\" And what need is there to speak of wisdom, which \"the Lord created[fn-61-P6176_953341:50-nf] the first principle of His ways, for His works,\" in whom the father of her rejoiced. delighting in her manifold intellectual beauty, seen by the eyes of the mind alone, and provoking him to love who discerns her divine and heavenly charm? A good indeed is the wisdom of God, proclaimed along with the other good foresaid by those whose feet are beautiful. And the power of God is the eighth good we enumerate, which is Christ. Nor must we omit to mention the Word, who is God after the Father of all. For this also is a good, less than no other. Happy, then, are those who accept these goods and receive them from those who announce the good tidings of them, those whose feet are beautiful. Indeed even one of the Corinthians to whom Paul declared that he knew nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified, should he learn Him who for our sakes became man, and so receive Him, he would become identified with the beginning of the good things we have spoken of; by the man Jesus he would be made a man of God, and by His death he would die to sin. For \"Christ,[fn-61-P6177_954418:51-nf] in that He died, died unto sin once.\" But from His life, since \"in that He liveth, He liveth unto God,\" every one who is conformed to His resurrection receives that living to God. But who will deny that righteousness, essential righteousness, is a good, and essential sanctification, and essential redemption? And these things those preach who preach Jesus, saying[fn-61-P6178_954801:52-nf] that He is made to be of God righteousness and sanctification and redemption. Hence we shall have writings about Him without number, showing that Jesus is a multitude of goods; for from the things which can scarcely be numbered and which have been written we may make some conjecture of those things which actually exist in Him in whom[fn-61-P6179_955156:53-nf] \"it pleased God that the whole fulness of the Godhead should dwell bodily.\" and which are not contained in writings. Why should I say, \"are not contained in writings\"? For John speaks of the whole world in this connection, and says:[fn-61-P6180_955412:54-nf] \"I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books which would be written.\" Now to say that the Apostles preach the Saviour is to say that they preach these good things. For this is He who received from the good Father that He Himself should be these good things, so that each man receiving from Jesus the thing or things he is capable of receiving may enjoy good things. But the Apostles, whose feet were beautiful, and those imitators of them who sought to preach the good tidings, could not have done so had not Jesus Himself first preached the good tidings to them, as Isaiah says:[fn-61-P6181_956032:55-nf] \"I myself that speak am here, as the opportunity on the mountains, as the feet of one preaching tidings of peace, as one preaching good things; for I will make My salvation to be heard, saying, God shall reign over thee, O Zion!\" For what are the mountains on which the speaker declares that He Himself is present, but those who are less than none of the highest and the greatest of the earth? And these must be sought by the able ministers of the New Covenant, in order that they may observe the injunction which says:[fn-61-P6182_956570:56-nf] Go up into a high mountain, thou that preachest good tidings to Zion; thou that preachest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength!\" Now it is not wonderful if to those who are to preach good tidings Jesus Himself preaches good tidings of good things, which are no other than Himself; for the Son of God preaches the good tidings of Himself to those who cannot come to know Him through others. And He who goes up into the mountains and preaches good things to them, being Himself instructed by His good Father,[fn-61-P6183_957116:57-nf] who \"makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust,\" He does not despise those who are poor in soul. To them He preaches good tidings, as He Himself bears witness to us when He takes Isaiah[fn-61-P6184_957374:58-nf] and reads: \"The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor, He hath sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives, and sight to the blind.

I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but tropically. But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term \"Word.\" I wonder at the stupidity of the general run of Christians in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity. The Son of God says in one passage, \"I am the light of the world,\" and in another, \"I am the resurrection,\" and again, \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" It is also written, \"I am the door,\" and we have the saying, \"I am the good shepherd,\" and when the woman of Samaria says, \"We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,\" Jesus answers, \"I that speak unto thee am He.\" Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared Himself in these words[fn-62-P6254_982473:92-nf] to be their Master and Lord: \"You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.\" He also distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says,[fn-62-P6255_982654:93-nf] \"He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? \"and[fn-62-P6256_982806:94-nf] \"Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.\" We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate's question,[fn-62-P6257_982993:95-nf] \"Art Thou the King of the Jews? \"by saying, \"My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence.\" We have also read the words,[fn-62-P6258_983272:96-nf] \"I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman,\" and again, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" Add to these testimonies also the saying,[fn-62-P6259_983437:97-nf] \"I am the bread of life, that came down from heaven and giveth life to the world.\" These texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son of God. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says,[fn-62-P6260_983747:98-nf] \"I am the first and the last, and the living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.\" And again,[fn-62-P6261_983876:99-nf] \"I am the A and the W, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" The careful student of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as where He calls Himself[fn-62-P6262_984111:100-nf] a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,[fn-62-P6263_984170:101-nf] and a light of the Gentiles.[fn-62-P6264_984225:102-nf] Isaiah also says,[fn-62-P6265_984264:103-nf] \"From my mother's womb hath He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.\" And a little farther on: \"And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of Israel. Behold I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" And in Jeremiah too[fn-62-P6266_984857:104-nf] He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: \"I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.\" These and other similar sayings He applies to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets proclaim in advance His coining advent and announce the things concerning Him under various names. Thus John calls Him the Lamb of God, saying,[fn-62-P6267_985471:105-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world,\" and in these words he declares Him as a man,[fn-62-P6268_985601:106-nf] \"This is He about whom I said, that there cometh after me a man who is there before me; for He was before me.\" And in his Catholic Epistle John says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus:[fn-62-P6269_985836:107-nf] \"And if any one sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,\" and he adds that He is a propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a propitiation:[fn-62-P6270_986050:108-nf] \"Whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast sins, in the forbearance of God.\" According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:[fn-62-P6271_986344:109-nf] \"Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: \"He was made to us of God,\" he says, \"wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\" But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest:[fn-62-P6272_986654:110-nf] \"Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.\" And the prophets have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons[fn-62-P6273_986898:111-nf] says, \"Judah, thy brethren shall extol thee; thy hands are on the necks of thine enemies. A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art thou sprung up; thou hast lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him? \"We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. What may be quoted against this view, viz., \"A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved; \"this can better be cleared up on another occasion . But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel, when he says,[fn-62-P6274_987528:112-nf] \"Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted Him. He shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break. and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope.\" That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says:[fn-62-P6275_988040:113-nf] \"That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry,\" etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God:[fn-62-P6276_988248:114-nf] \"I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd.\" For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower:[fn-62-P6277_988483:115-nf] \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of tits root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel slid of might, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as follows:[fn-62-P6278_988887:116-nf] \"The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the comer. It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.\" And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows:[fn-62-P6279_989155:117-nf] \"Have ye never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.\" And Luke writes in Acts:[fn-62-P6280_989407:118-nf] \"This is the stone, which was set at naught of you the builders, which has become the head of the corner.\" And one of the names applied to the Saviour is that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records;-the Word who was in the beginning with God, God the Word. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and ask, What is the Son of God when called the Word? The passage they employ most is that in the Psalms,[fn-62-P6281_990132:119-nf] \"My heart hath produced a good Word; \"and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are they clear about His essence. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said to be \"Word\" can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an essence of His own. We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it suggests slid apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course. To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have to say on the question, how the Son of God is the Word, we must begin with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him. This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression, but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these matters will clear the way for what is coming. And once we have entered upon the theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what diligence we can and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall necessarily understand more about Him not only in His character as the Word, but in His other characters also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":10,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"129","folder":"ANF-10","text":"As, then, from His activity in enlightening the world whose light He is, Christ is named the Light of the World, and as from His making those who sincerely attach themselves to Him put away their deadness and rise again and put on newness of life, He is called the Resurrection, so from an activity of another kind He is called Shepherd and Teacher, King and Chosen Shaft, and Servant, and in addition to these Paraclete and Atonement and Propitiation. And after the same fashion He is also called the Logos,[fn-64-P6405_1035951:185-nf] because He takes away from us all that is irrational, and makes us truly reasonable, so that we do all things, even to eating and drinking, to the glory of God, and discharge by the Logos to the glory of God both the commoner functions of life and those which belong to a more advanced stage. For if, by having part in Him, we are raised up and enlightened, herded also it may be and ruled over, then it is clear that we become in a divine manner reasonable, when He drives away from us what in us is irrational and dead, since He is the Logos (reason) and the Resurrection.Consider, however, whether all men have in some way part in Him in His character as Logos. On this point tile Apostle teaches us that He is to be sought not outside the seeker, and that those find Him in themselves who set their heart on doing so; \"Say not[fn-64-P6406_1036963:186-nf] in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? That is to bring Christ down; or, Who shall descend into the abyss? That is to bring Christ up from the dead. But what saith the Scripture? The Word is very nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart,\" as if Christ Himself were the same thing as the Word said to be sought after. But when the Lord Himself says[fn-64-P6407_1037336:187-nf] \"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin,\" the only sense we can find in His words is that the Logos Himself says that those are not chargeable with sin to whom He (reason) has not fully come, but that those, if they sin, are guilty who, having had part in Him, act contrary to the ideas by which He declares His full presence in us. Only when thus read is the saying true: \"If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin.\" Should the words be applied, as many are of opinion that they should, to the visible Christ, then how is it true that those had no sin to whom He did not come? In that case all who lived before the advent of the Saviour will be free from sin, since Jesus, as seen in flesh, had not yet come. And more-all those to whom He has never been preached will have no sin, and if they have no sin, then it is clear they are not liable to judgment. But the Logos in man, in which we have said that our whole race had part, is spoken of in two senses; first, in that of the filling up of ideas which takes place, prodigies excepted, in every one who passes beyond the age of boyhood, but secondly, in that of the consummation, which takes place only in the perfect. The words, therefore, \"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin, but now they have no cloak for their sin,\" are to be understood in the former sense; but the words,[fn-64-P6408_1038800:188-nf] \"All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not hear them,\" in the latter. For before the consummation of reason comes, there is nothing in man but what is blameworthy; all is imperfect and defective, and can by no means command the obedience of those irrational elements in us which are tropically spoken of as sheep. And perhaps the former meaning is to be recognized in the words \"The Logos was made flesh,\" but the second in \"The Logos was God.\" We must accordingly look at what there is to be seen in human affairs between the saying, \"The Word (reason) was made flesh\" and \"The Word was God.\" When the Word was made flesh can we say that it was to some extent broken up and thinned out, and can we say that it recovered from that point onward till it became again what it was at first, God the Word, the Word with the Father; the Word whose glory John saw, the verily only-begotten, as from the Father. But the Son may also be the Logos (Word), because He reports the secret things of His Father who is intellect in the same way as the Son who is called the Word. For as with us the word is a messenger of those things which tile mind perceives, so the Word of God, knowing the Father, since no created being can approach Him without a guide, reveals the Father whom He knows. For no one knows the Father save the Son,[fn-64-P6409_1040172:189-nf] and he to whomsoever the Son reveals Him, and inasmuch as He is the Word He is the Messenger of Great Counsel,[fn-64-P6410_1040304:190-nf] who has the government upon His shoulders; for He entered on His kingdom by enduring the cross. In the Apocalypse,[fn-64-P6411_1040441:191-nf] moreover, the Faithful and True (the Word), is said to sit on a white horse, the epithets indicating, I consider, the clearness of the voice with which the Word of truth speaks to us when He sojourns among us. This is scarcely the place to show how the word \"horse\" is often used in passages spoken for our encouragement in sacred learning. I only cite two of these: \"A horse is deceitful for safety,\"[fn-64-P6412_1040859:192-nf] and \"Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will rejoice in the name of the Lord our God.\"[fn-64-P6413_1040984:193-nf] Nor must we leave unnoticed a passage in the forty-fourth Psalm,[fn-64-P6414_1041068:194-nf] frequently quoted by many writers as if they understood it: \"My heart hath belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King.\" Suppose it is God the Father who speaks thus; what is His heart, that the good word should appear in accordance with His heart? If, as these writers suppose, the Word (Logos) needs no interpretation, then the heart is to be taken in the natural sense too. But it is quite absurd to suppose God's heart to be a part of Him as ours is of our body. We must remind such writers that as when the hand of God is spoken of, and His arm and His finger, we do not read the words literally but enquire in what sound sense we may take them so as to be worthy of God, so His heart is to be understood of His rational power, by which He disposes all things, and His word of that which announces what is in this heart of His. But who is it that announces the counsel of the Father to those of His creatures who are worthy and who have risen above themselves, who but the Saviour? That \"belched forth\" is not, perhaps, without significance; a hundred other terms might have been employed; \"My heart has produced a good word,\" it might have been said, or \"My heart has spoken a good word.\" But in belching, some wind that was hidden makes its way out to the world, and so it may be that the Father gives out views of truth not continuously, but as it were after the fashion of belching, and the word has the character of the things thus produced, and is called, therefore, the image of the invisible God. We may enter our agreement, therefore, with the ordinary acceptation of these words, and take them to be spoken by the Father. It is not, however, a matter of course, that it is God Himself who announces these things. Why should it not be a prophet? Filled with the Spirit and unable to contain himself, he brings forth a word about his prophecy concerning Christ: \"My heart hath belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King, my pen is the tongue of a ready writer. Excellent in beauty is He beyond the sons of men.\" Then to the Christ Himself: \"Grace is poured out on Thy lips.\" If the Father were the speaker, how could He go on after the words, \"Grace is poured out on thy lips,\" to say, \"Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever,\" and a little further on, \"Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\" Some of those who wish to make the Father the speaker may appeal to the words, \"Hear, O daughter, and behold and incline thine ear, and forget thy people and thy father.\" The prophet, it may be said, could not address the Church in the words, \"Hear, O daughter.\" It is not difficult, however, to show that changes of person occur frequently in the Psalms, so that these words, \"Hear, O daughter,\" might be from the Father, in this passage, though the Psalm as a whole is not. To our discussion of the Word we may here add the passage,[fn-64-P6415_1044005:195-nf] \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens rounded, and all the power of them by the breath of His mouth.\" Some refer this to the Saviour and the Holy Spirit. The passage, however, does not necessarily imply any more than that the heavens were founded by the reason (logos) of God, as when we say that a house is built by the plan (logos) of the architect, or a ship by the plan (logos) of the shipbuilder. In the same way the heavens were founded (made solid) by the Word of God, for they are[fn-64-P6416_1044520:196-nf] of a more divine substance, which on this account is called solid;[fn-64-P6417_1044615:197-nf] it has little fluidity for the most part, nor is it easily melted like other parts of the world, and specially the lower parts. On account of this difference the heavens are said in a special manner to be constituted by the Word of God.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":10,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_126_oration_on_the_psalms_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"ANF-06","text":"VII. Let us look also at what follows. What says the most divine evangelist? When the Lord had entered into the temple, the blind and the lame came to Him; and He healed them. And when the chief priests and Pharisees saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,[fn-62-P6206_1909102:51-nf] they brooked not this honour that was paid Him, and therefore they came to Him, and thus spake, Hearest Thou not what these say? As if they said, Art Thou not grieved at hearing from these innocents things which befit God, and God alone? Has not God of old made it manifest by the prophet, \"My glory will I not give unto another; \"[fn-62-P6207_1909457:52-nf] and how dost Thou, being a man, make Thyself God?[fn-62-P6208_1909526:53-nf] But what to this answers the long-suffering One, He who is abundant in mercy,[fn-62-P6209_1909621:54-nf] and slow to wrath?[fn-62-P6210_1909658:55-nf] He bears with these frenzied ones; with an apology He keeps their wrath in check; in His turn He calls the Scriptures to their remembrance; He brings forward testimony to what is done, and shrinks not from inquiry. Wherefore He says, Have ye never heard Me saying by the prophet, Then shall ye know that I am He that doth speak?[fn-62-P6211_1910004:56-nf] nor again, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou perfected praise because of Thine enemies, that Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger?

But let us sing, Great is our Lord, and great is His power;[fn-62-P6214_1910887:59-nf] and of His understanding there is no number. For all this was done that the Lamb and Son of God, that taketh away the sins of the world, might, of His own will, and for us, come to His saving Passion, and might be recognised, as it were, in the market and place of selling; and that those who bought Him might for thirty pieces of silver covenant for Him who, with His life-giving blood, was to redeem the world; and that Christ, our passover, might be sacrificed for us, in order that those who were sprinkled with His precious blood, and sealed on their lips, as the posts of the door,[fn-62-P6215_1911495:60-nf] might escape from the darts of the destroyer; and that Christ having thus suffered in the flesh, and having risen again the third day, might, with equal honour and glory with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be by all created things equally adored; for to Him every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth,[fn-62-P6216_1911863:61-nf] sending up glory to Him, for ever and ever.

The fact is, heresy has rather taken it from Truth, in order to mould it into its own counterfeit. Was the Word of God put forth or not? Here take your stand with me, and flinch not. If He was put forth, then acknowledge that the true doctrine has a prolation;[fn-104-P10483_2937443:82-nf] and never mind heresy, when in any point it mimics the truth. The question now is, in what sense each side uses a given thing and the word which expresses it. Valentinus divides and separates his prolations from their Author, and places them at so great a distance from Him, that the ¦on does not know the Father: he longs, indeed, to know Him, but cannot; nay, he is almost swallowed up and dissolved into the rest of matter.[fn-104-P10484_2937885:83-nf] With us, however, the Son alone knows the Father,[fn-104-P10485_2937972:84-nf] and has Himself unfolded \"the Father's bosom.\"[fn-104-P10486_2938038:85-nf] He has also heard and seen all things with the Father; and what He has been commanded by the Father, that also does He speak.[fn-104-P10487_2938181:86-nf] And it is not His own will, but the Father's, which He has accomplished,[fn-104-P10488_2938274:87-nf] which He had known most intimately, even from the beginning. \"For what man knoweth the things which be in God, but the Spirit which is in Him? \"[fn-104-P10489_2938437:88-nf] But the Word was formed by the Spirit, and (if I may so express myself) the Spirit is the body of the Word. The Word, therefore, is both always in the Father, as He says, \"I am in the Father; \"[fn-104-P10490_2938651:89-nf] and is always with God, according to what is written, \"And the Word was with God; \"[fn-104-P10491_2938754:90-nf] and never separate from the Father, or other than the Father, since \"I and the Father are one.\"[fn-104-P10492_2938866:91-nf] This will be the prolation, taught by the truth,[fn-104-P10493_2938932:92-nf] the guardian of the Unity, wherein we declare that the Son is a prolation from the Father, without being separated from Him. For God sent forth the Word, as the Paraclete also declares, just as the root puts forth the tree, and the fountain the river, and the sun the ray.[fn-104-P10494_2939251:93-nf] For these are probolai/, or emanations, of the substances from which they proceed. I should not hesitate, indeed, to call the tree the son or offspring of the root, and the river of the fountain, and the ray of the sun; because every original source is a parent, and everything which issues from the origin is an offspring. Much more is (this true of) the Word of God, who has actually received as His own peculiar designation the name of Son. But still the tree is not severed from the root, nor the river from the fountain, nor the ray from the sun; nor, indeed, is the Word separated from God. Following, therefore, the form of these analogies, I confess that I call God and His Word-the Father and His Son-two. For the root and the tree are distinctly two things, but correlatively joined; the fountain and the river are also two forms, but indivisible; so likewise the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones. Everything which proceeds from something else must needs be second to that from which it proceeds, without being on that account separated: Where, however, there is a second, there must be two; and where there is a third, there must be three. Now the Spirit indeed is third from God and the Son; just as the fruit of the tree is third from the root, or as the stream out of the river is third from the fountain, or as the apex of the ray is third from the sun. Nothing, however, is alien from that original source whence it derives its own properties. In like manner the Trinity, flowing down from the Father through intertwined and connected steps, does not at all disturb the Monarchy,[fn-104-P10495_2940894:94-nf] whilst it at the same time guards the state of the Economy.[fn-104-P10496_2940992:95-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But I must take some further pains to rebut their arguments, when they make selections from the Scriptures in support of their opinion, and refuse to consider the other points, which obviously maintain the rule of faith without any infraction of the unity of the Godhead, and with the full admission[fn-106-P10676_2999607:239-nf] of the Monarchy. For as in the Old Testament Scriptures they lay hold of nothing else than, \"I am God, and beside me there is no God ; \"[fn-106-P10677_2999759:240-nf] so in the Gospel they simply keep in view the Lord's answer to Philip, \"I and my Father are one; \"[fn-106-P10678_2999878:241-nf] and, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me.\"[fn-106-P10679_2999993:242-nf] They would have the entire revelation of both Testaments yield to these three passages, whereas the only proper course is to understand the few statements in the light of the many.

So, when they were in doubt among themselves whether He were the Christ (not as being the Father, of course but as the Son), He says to them \"You are not ignorant whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but He that sent me is true, whom ye know not; but I know Him, because I am from Him.\"[fn-107-P10718_3009482:275-nf] He did not say, Because I myself am He; and, I have sent mine own self: but His words are, \"He hath sent me.\" When, likewise, the Pharisees sent men to apprehend Him, He says: \"Yet a little while am I with you, and (then) I go unto Him that sent me.\"[fn-107-P10719_3009753:276-nf] When, however, He declares that He is not alone, and uses these words, \"but I and the Father that sent me,\"[fn-107-P10720_3009877:277-nf] does He not show that there are Two-Two, and yet inseparable? Indeed, this was the sum: and substance of what He was teaching them, that they were inseparably Two; since, after citing the law when it affirms the truth of two men's testimony,[fn-107-P10721_3010141:278-nf] He adds at once: \"I am one who am bearing witness of myself; and the Father (is another, ) who hath sent me, and beareth witness of me.\"[fn-107-P10722_3010294:279-nf] Now, if He were one-being at once both the Son and the Father-He certainly would not have quoted the sanction of the law, which requires not the testimony of one, but of two. Likewise, when they asked Him where His Father was,[fn-107-P10723_3010537:280-nf] He answered them, that they had known neither Himself nor the Father; and in this answer He plainly told them of Two, whom they were ignorant of. Granted that \"if they had known Him, they would have known the Father also,\"[fn-107-P10724_3010776:281-nf] this certainly does not imply that He was Himself both Father and Son; but that, by reason of the inseparability of the Two, it was impossible for one of them to be either acknowledged or unknown without the other. \"He that sent me,\" says He, \"is true; and I am telling the world those things which I have heard of Him.\"[fn-107-P10725_3011113:282-nf] And the Scripture narrative goes on to explain in an exoteric manner, that \"they understood not that He spake to them concerning the Father,\"[fn-107-P10726_3011277:283-nf] although they ought certainly to have known that the Father's words were uttered in the Son, because they read in Jeremiah, \"And the Lord said to me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth; \"[fn-107-P10727_3011487:284-nf] and again in Isaiah, \"The Lord hath given to me the tongue of learning that I should understand when to speak a word in season.\"[fn-107-P10728_3011634:285-nf] In accordance with which, Christ Himself says: \"Then shall ye know that I am He and that I am saying nothing of my own self; but that, as my Father hath taught me, so I speak, because He that sent me is with me.\"[fn-107-P10729_3011865:286-nf] This also amounts to a proof that they were Two, (although) undivided. Likewise, when upbraiding the Jews in His discussion with them, because they wished to kill Him, He said, \"I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and ye do that which ye have seen with your father; \"[fn-107-P10730_3012170:287-nf] \"but now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God; \"[fn-107-P10731_3012279:288-nf] and again, \"If God were your Father, ye would love me, for I proceeded forth and came from God \"[fn-107-P10732_3012392:289-nf] (still they are not hereby separated, although He declares that He proceeded forth from the Father. Some persons indeed seize the opportunity afforded them in these words to propound their heresy of His separation; but His coming out from God is like the ray's procession from the sun, and the river's from the fountain, and the tree's from the seed); \"I have not a devil, but I honour my Father; \"[fn-107-P10733_3012807:290-nf] again, \"If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say, that He is your God: yet ye have not known Him, but I know Him; and if I should say, I know Him not, I shall be a liar like unto you; but I know Him, and keep His saying.\"[fn-107-P10734_3013096:291-nf] But when He goes on to say, \"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad,\"[fn-107-P10735_3013226:292-nf] He certainly proves that it was not the Father that appeared to Abraham, but the Son. In like manner He declares, in the case of the man born blind, \"that He must do the works of the Father which had sent Him; \"[fn-107-P10736_3013454:293-nf] and after He had given the man sight, He said to him, \"Dost thou believe in the Son of God? \"Then, upon the man's inquiring who He was, He proceeded to reveal Himself to him, as that Son of God whom He had announced to him as the right object of his faith.[fn-107-P10737_3013730:294-nf] In a later passage He declares that He is known by the Father, and the Father by Him;[fn-107-P10738_3013836:295-nf] adding that He was so wholly loved by the Father, that He was laying down His life, because He had received this commandment from the Father.[fn-107-P10739_3013997:296-nf] When He was asked by the Jews if He were the very Christ[fn-107-P10740_3014078:297-nf] (meaning, of course, the Christ of God; for to this day the Jews expect not the Father Himself, but the Christ of God, it being nowhere said that the Father will come as the Christ), He said to them, \"I am telling you, and yet ye do not believe: the works which I am doing, in my Father's name, they actually bear witness of me.\"[fn-107-P10741_3014424:298-nf] Witness of what? Of that very thing, to be sure, of which they were making inquiry-whether He were the Christ of God. Then, again, concerning His sheep, and (the assurance) that no man should pluck them out of His hand,[fn-107-P10742_3014660:299-nf] He says, \"My Father, which gave them to me, is greater than all; \"[fn-107-P10743_3014744:300-nf] adding immediately, \"I am and my Father are one.\"[fn-107-P10744_3014810:301-nf] Here, then, they take their stand, too infatuated, nay, too blind, to see in the first place that there is in this passage an intimation of Two Beings-\"I and my Father; \"then that there is a plural predicate, \"are,\" inapplicable to one person only; and lastly, that (the predicate terminates in an abstract, not a personal noun)-\"we are one thing\" Unum, not \"one person\" Unus. For if He had said \"one Person,\" He might have rendered some assistance to their opinion. Unus, no doubt, indicates the singular number; but (here we have a case where) \"Two\" are still the subject in the masculine gender. He accordingly says Unum, a neuter term, which does not imply singularity of number, but unity of essence, likeness, conjunction, affection on the Father's part, who loves the Son, and submission on the Son's, who obeys the Father's will. When He says, \"I and my Father are one\" in essence-Unum-He shows that there are Two, whom He puts on an equality and unites in one. He therefore adds to this very statement, that He \"had showed them many works from the Father,\" for none of which did He deserve to be stoned.[fn-107-P10745_3015939:302-nf] And to prevent their thinking Him deserving of this fate, as if He had claimed to be considered as God Himself, that is, the Father, by having said, \"I and my Father are One,\" representing Himself as the Father's divine Son, and not as God Himself, He says, \"If it is written in your law, I said, Ye are gods; and if the Scripture cannot be broken, say ye of Him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, that He blasphemeth, because He said, I am the Son of God?

So, when they were in doubt among themselves whether He were the Christ (not as being the Father, of course but as the Son), He says to them \"You are not ignorant whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but He that sent me is true, whom ye know not; but I know Him, because I am from Him.\"[fn-107-P10718_3009482:275-nf] He did not say, Because I myself am He; and, I have sent mine own self: but His words are, \"He hath sent me.\" When, likewise, the Pharisees sent men to apprehend Him, He says: \"Yet a little while am I with you, and (then) I go unto Him that sent me.\"[fn-107-P10719_3009753:276-nf] When, however, He declares that He is not alone, and uses these words, \"but I and the Father that sent me,\"[fn-107-P10720_3009877:277-nf] does He not show that there are Two-Two, and yet inseparable? Indeed, this was the sum: and substance of what He was teaching them, that they were inseparably Two; since, after citing the law when it affirms the truth of two men's testimony,[fn-107-P10721_3010141:278-nf] He adds at once: \"I am one who am bearing witness of myself; and the Father (is another, ) who hath sent me, and beareth witness of me.\"[fn-107-P10722_3010294:279-nf] Now, if He were one-being at once both the Son and the Father-He certainly would not have quoted the sanction of the law, which requires not the testimony of one, but of two. Likewise, when they asked Him where His Father was,[fn-107-P10723_3010537:280-nf] He answered them, that they had known neither Himself nor the Father; and in this answer He plainly told them of Two, whom they were ignorant of. Granted that \"if they had known Him, they would have known the Father also,\"[fn-107-P10724_3010776:281-nf] this certainly does not imply that He was Himself both Father and Son; but that, by reason of the inseparability of the Two, it was impossible for one of them to be either acknowledged or unknown without the other. \"He that sent me,\" says He, \"is true; and I am telling the world those things which I have heard of Him.\"[fn-107-P10725_3011113:282-nf] And the Scripture narrative goes on to explain in an exoteric manner, that \"they understood not that He spake to them concerning the Father,\"[fn-107-P10726_3011277:283-nf] although they ought certainly to have known that the Father's words were uttered in the Son, because they read in Jeremiah, \"And the Lord said to me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth; \"[fn-107-P10727_3011487:284-nf] and again in Isaiah, \"The Lord hath given to me the tongue of learning that I should understand when to speak a word in season.\"[fn-107-P10728_3011634:285-nf] In accordance with which, Christ Himself says: \"Then shall ye know that I am He and that I am saying nothing of my own self; but that, as my Father hath taught me, so I speak, because He that sent me is with me.\"[fn-107-P10729_3011865:286-nf] This also amounts to a proof that they were Two, (although) undivided. Likewise, when upbraiding the Jews in His discussion with them, because they wished to kill Him, He said, \"I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and ye do that which ye have seen with your father; \"[fn-107-P10730_3012170:287-nf] \"but now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God; \"[fn-107-P10731_3012279:288-nf] and again, \"If God were your Father, ye would love me, for I proceeded forth and came from God \"[fn-107-P10732_3012392:289-nf] (still they are not hereby separated, although He declares that He proceeded forth from the Father. Some persons indeed seize the opportunity afforded them in these words to propound their heresy of His separation; but His coming out from God is like the ray's procession from the sun, and the river's from the fountain, and the tree's from the seed); \"I have not a devil, but I honour my Father; \"[fn-107-P10733_3012807:290-nf] again, \"If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say, that He is your God: yet ye have not known Him, but I know Him; and if I should say, I know Him not, I shall be a liar like unto you; but I know Him, and keep His saying.\"[fn-107-P10734_3013096:291-nf] But when He goes on to say, \"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad,\"[fn-107-P10735_3013226:292-nf] He certainly proves that it was not the Father that appeared to Abraham, but the Son. In like manner He declares, in the case of the man born blind, \"that He must do the works of the Father which had sent Him; \"[fn-107-P10736_3013454:293-nf] and after He had given the man sight, He said to him, \"Dost thou believe in the Son of God? \"Then, upon the man's inquiring who He was, He proceeded to reveal Himself to him, as that Son of God whom He had announced to him as the right object of his faith.[fn-107-P10737_3013730:294-nf] In a later passage He declares that He is known by the Father, and the Father by Him;[fn-107-P10738_3013836:295-nf] adding that He was so wholly loved by the Father, that He was laying down His life, because He had received this commandment from the Father.[fn-107-P10739_3013997:296-nf] When He was asked by the Jews if He were the very Christ[fn-107-P10740_3014078:297-nf] (meaning, of course, the Christ of God; for to this day the Jews expect not the Father Himself, but the Christ of God, it being nowhere said that the Father will come as the Christ), He said to them, \"I am telling you, and yet ye do not believe: the works which I am doing, in my Father's name, they actually bear witness of me.\"[fn-107-P10741_3014424:298-nf] Witness of what? Of that very thing, to be sure, of which they were making inquiry-whether He were the Christ of God. Then, again, concerning His sheep, and (the assurance) that no man should pluck them out of His hand,[fn-107-P10742_3014660:299-nf] He says, \"My Father, which gave them to me, is greater than all; \"[fn-107-P10743_3014744:300-nf] adding immediately, \"I am and my Father are one.\"[fn-107-P10744_3014810:301-nf] Here, then, they take their stand, too infatuated, nay, too blind, to see in the first place that there is in this passage an intimation of Two Beings-\"I and my Father; \"then that there is a plural predicate, \"are,\" inapplicable to one person only; and lastly, that (the predicate terminates in an abstract, not a personal noun)-\"we are one thing\" Unum, not \"one person\" Unus. For if He had said \"one Person,\" He might have rendered some assistance to their opinion. Unus, no doubt, indicates the singular number; but (here we have a case where) \"Two\" are still the subject in the masculine gender. He accordingly says Unum, a neuter term, which does not imply singularity of number, but unity of essence, likeness, conjunction, affection on the Father's part, who loves the Son, and submission on the Son's, who obeys the Father's will. When He says, \"I and my Father are one\" in essence-Unum-He shows that there are Two, whom He puts on an equality and unites in one. He therefore adds to this very statement, that He \"had showed them many works from the Father,\" for none of which did He deserve to be stoned.[fn-107-P10745_3015939:302-nf] And to prevent their thinking Him deserving of this fate, as if He had claimed to be considered as God Himself, that is, the Father, by having said, \"I and my Father are One,\" representing Himself as the Father's divine Son, and not as God Himself, He says, \"If it is written in your law, I said, Ye are gods; and if the Scripture cannot be broken, say ye of Him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, that He blasphemeth, because He said, I am the Son of God?

For Thomas, who was so long incredulous, said: \"Lord, we know not whither Thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye would have known the Father also: but henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.\"[fn-107-P10775_3023721:326-nf] And now we come to Philip, who, roused with the expectation of seeing the Father, and not understanding in what sense he was to take \"seeing the Father,\" says: \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\"[fn-107-P10776_3023946:327-nf] Then the Lord answered him: \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? \"[fn-107-P10777_3024067:328-nf] Now whom does He say that they ought to have known?-for this is the sole point of discussion. Was it as the Father that they ought to have known Him, or as the Son? If it was as the Father, Praxeas must tell us how Christ, who had been so long time with them, could have possibly ever been (I will not say understood, but even) supposed to have been the Father. He is clearly defined to us in all Scriptures-in the Old Testament as the Christ of God, in the New Testament as the Son of God. In this character was He anciently predicted, in this was He also declared even by Christ Himself; nay, by the very Father also, who openly confesses Him from heaven as His Son, and as His Son glorifies Him. \"This is my beloved Son; \"\"I have glorified Him, and I will glorify Him.\" In this character, too, was He believed on by His disciples, and rejected by the Jews. It was, moreover, in this character that He wished to be accepted by them whenever He named the Father, and gave preference to the Father, and honoured the Father. This, then, being the case, it was not the Father whom, after His lengthened intercourse with them, they were ignorant of, but it was the Son; and accordingly the Lord, while upbraiding Philip for not knowing Himself who was the object of their ignorance, wished Himself to be acknowledged indeed as that Being whom He had reproached them for being ignorant of after so long a time-in a word, as the Son. And now it may be seen in what sense it was said, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father,\"[fn-107-P10778_3025606:329-nf] -even in the same in which it was said in a previous passage, \"I and my Father are one.\"[fn-107-P10779_3025715:330-nf] Wherefore? Because \"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world\"[fn-107-P10780_3025812:331-nf] and, \"I am the way: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me; \"[fn-107-P10781_3025897:332-nf] and, \"No man can come to me, except the Father draw him; \"[fn-107-P10782_3025976:333-nf] and, \"All things are delivered unto me by the Father; \"[fn-107-P10783_3026052:334-nf] and, \"As the Father quickeneth (the dead), so also doth the Son; \"[fn-107-P10784_3026140:335-nf] and again, \"If ye had known me, ye would have known the Father also.\"[fn-107-P10785_3026229:336-nf] For in all these passages He had shown Himself to be the Father's Commissioner,[fn-107-P10786_3026329:337-nf] through whose agency even the Father could be seen in His works, and heard in His words, and recognised in the Son's administration of the Father's words and deeds. The Father indeed was invisible, as Philip had learnt in the law, and ought at the moment to have remembered: \"No man shall see God, and live.\"[fn-107-P10787_3026655:338-nf] So he is reproved for desiring to see the Father, as if He were a visible Being, and is taught that He only becomes visible in the Son from His mighty works, and not in the manifestation of His person. If, indeed, He meant the Father to be understood as the same with the Son, by saying, \"He who seeth me seeth the Father,\" how is it that He adds immediately afterwards, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? \"[fn-107-P10788_3027118:339-nf] He ought rather to have said: \"Believest thou not that I am the Father? \"With what view else did He so emphatically dwell on this point, if it Were not to clear up that which He wished men to understand-namely, that He was the Son? And then, again, by saying, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me,\"[fn-107-P10789_3027467:340-nf] He laid the greater stress on His question on this very account, that He should not, because He had said, \"He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father,\" be supposed to be the Father; because He had never wished Himself to be so regarded, having always professed Himself to be the Son, and to have come from the Father. And then He also set the conjunction of the two Persons in the clearest light, in order that no wish might be entertained of seeing the Father as if He were separately visible, and that the Son might be regarded as the representative of the Father. And yet He omitted not to explain how the Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. \"The words,\" says He, \"which I speak unto you, are not mine,\"[fn-107-P10790_3028208:341-nf] because indeed they were the Father's words; \"but the Father that dwelleth in me, He doeth the works.\"[fn-107-P10791_3028332:342-nf] It is therefore by His mighty works, and by the words of His doctrine, that the Father who dwells in the Son makes Himself visible-even by those words and works whereby He abides in Him, and also by Him in whom He abides; the special properties of Both the Persons being apparent from this very circumstance, that He says, \"I am in the Father, and the Father is in me.\"[fn-107-P10792_3028719:343-nf] Accordingly He adds: \"Believe-\" What? That I am the Father? I do not find that it is so written, but rather, \"that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for my works' sake; \"[fn-107-P10793_3028934:344-nf] meaning those works by which the Father manifested Himself to be in the Son, not indeed to the sight of man, but to his intelligence.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"ANF-03","text":"What follows Philip's question, and the Lord's whole treatment of it, to the end of John's Gospel, continues to furnish us with statements of the same kind, distinguishing the Father and the Son, with the properties of each.

Now that all the restraint of His humiliation is taken away, He might, if possible, have shown Himself as the Father to so faithful a woman (as Mary Magdalene) when she approached to touch Him, out of love, not from curiosity, nor with Thomas' incredulity. But not so; Jesus saith unto her, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren\" (and even in this He proves Himself to be the Son; for if He had been the Father, He would have called them His children, (instead of His brethren), \"and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.\"[fn-108-P10808_3031793:356-nf] Now, does this mean, I ascend as the Father to the Father, and as God to God?

The Only-begotten of God, therefore, through whom, as the previous course of the discussion has shown, all things were made, visible and invisible, according to the view of Scripture, both made all things, and loves what He made. For since He is Himself the invisible image of the invisible God, He conveyed invisibly a share in Himself to all His rational creatures, so that each one obtained a part of Him exactly proportioned to the amount of affection with which he regarded Him. But since, agreeably to the faculty of free-will, variety and diversity characterized the individual souls, so that one was attached with a warmer love to the Author of its being, and another with a feebler and weaker regard, that soul (anima) regarding which Jesus said, \"No one shall take my life (animam) from me,\"[fn-65-P6587_1318624:82-nf] inhering, from the beginning of the creation, and afterwards, inseparably and indissolubly in Him, as being the Wisdom and Word of God, and the Truth and the true Light, and receiving Him wholly, and passing into His light and splendour, was made with Him in a pre-eminent degree[fn-65-P6588_1319191:83-nf] one spirit, according to the promise of the apostle to those who ought to imitate it, that \"he who is joined in the Lord is one spirit.\"[fn-65-P6589_1319348:84-nf] This substance of a soul, then, being intermediate between God and the flesh-it being impossible for the nature of God to intermingle with a body without an intermediate instrument-the God-man is born, as we have said, that substance being the intermediary to whose nature it was not contrary to assume a body. But neither, on the other hand, was it opposed to the nature of that soul, as a rational existence, to receive God, into whom, as stated above, as into the Word, and the Wisdom, and the Truth, it had already wholly entered. And therefore deservedly is it also called, along with the flesh which it had assumed, the Son of God, and the Power of God, the Christ, and the Wisdom of God, either because it was wholly in the Son of God, or because it received the Son of God wholly into itself. And again, the Son of God, through whom all things were created, is named Jesus Christ and the Son of man. For the Son of God also is said to have died-in reference, viz., to that nature which could admit of death; and He is called the Son of man, who is announced as about to come in the glory of God the Father, with the holy angels. And for this reason, throughout the whole of Scripture, not only is the divine nature spoken of in human words, but the human nature is adorned by appellations of divine dignity. More truly indeed of this than of any other can the statement be affirmed, \"They shall both be in one flesh, and are no longer two, but one flesh.\"[fn-65-P6590_1320832:85-nf] For the Word of God is to be considered as being more in one flesh with the soul than a man with his wife. But to whom is it more becoming to be also one spirit with God, than to this soul which has so joined itself to God by love as that it may justly be said to be one spirit with Him?

Now, if this be the case, it seems to me that this very decay and falling away of the understanding is not the same in all, but that this conversion into a soul is carried to a greater or less degree in different instances, and that certain understandings retain something even of their former vigour, and others again either nothing or a very small amount. Whence some are found from the very commencement of their lives to be of more active intellect, others again of a slower habit of mind, and some are born wholly obtuse, and altogether incapable of instruction. Our statement, however, that the understanding is converted into a soul, or whatever else seems to have such a meaning, the reader must carefully consider and settle for himself, as these views are not be regarded as advanced by us in a dogmatic manner, but simply as opinions, treated in the style of investigation and discussion. Let the reader take this also into consideration, that it is observed with regard to the soul of the Saviour, that of those things which are written in the Gospel, some are ascribed to it under the name of soul, and others under that of spirit.

For we can show that at the third hour the Holy Spirit, who had been of old promised by the prophets, descended in the first instance on the Apostles assembled together for prayer. For when in their astonishment at the speaking with tongues, which proceeded from them throughthe outpouring of the Holy Ghost upon them, the unbelieving people of the Jews mocked and said that they were full of new wine, then Peter, standing up in the midst of them, said: \"Men of Israel, and all ye who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known unto you, and consider my words. For these men are not, as ye imagine, drunk, since it is the third hour of the day; but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel: and it shall come to pass in the last days, saith the Lord, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams. And indeed upon my servants and my handmaids in those days I will pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.\"[fn-21-P2128_916267:5-nf] And all of this was fulfilled at the third hour, when the Holy Spirit, announced before by the prophets, came at that hour and abode upon the Apostles. But at the sixth hour the spotless Sacrifice, our Lord and Saviour, was offered up to the Father, and, ascending the cross for the salvation of the whole world, made atonement for the sins of mankind, and, despoiling principalities and powers, led them away openly; and all of us who were liable to death and bound by the debt of the handwriting that could not be paid, He freed, by taking it away out of the midst and affixing it to His cross for a trophy,[fn-21-P2129_916896:6-nf] At the same hour, too, to Peter,in an ecstasy of mind, there was divinely revealed both the calling of the Gentiles by the letting down of the Gospel vessel from heaven, and also the cleansing of all the living creatures contained in it, when a voice came to him and said to him: \"Rise, Peter; kill and eat; \"[fn-21-P2130_917522:7-nf] which vessel, let down from heaven by the four corners, is plainly seen to signify nothing else than the Gospel. For although, as it is divided by the fourfold narrative of the Evangelists, it seems to have \"four corners\" (or beginnings), yet the body of the Gospel is but one; embracing, as it does, the birth as well as the Godhead, and the miracles as well as the passion of one and the same Christ. Excellently, too, it says not \"of linen\" but \"as if of linen.\" For linen signifies death. Since, then, our Lord's death and passion were not undergone by the law of human nature, but of His own free will, it says \"as if of linen.\" For when dead according to theflesh He was not dead according to the spirit, because \"His soul was not left in hell, neither did His flesh see corruption.\"[fn-21-P2131_918331:8-nf] And again He says: \"No man taketh My life from Mebut I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-21-P2132_918496:9-nf] And so in this vessel of the Gospels let down from heaven, that is written by the Holy Ghost, all the nations which were formerly outside the observance of the law and reckoned as unclean now flow together through belief in the faith that they may to their salvation be turned away from the worship of idols and be serviceable for health-giving food, and are brought to Peter and cleansed by the voice of the Lord. But at the ninth hour, penetrating to hades, He there by the brightness of His splendour extinguished the indescribable darkness of hell, and, bursting its brazen gates and breaking the iron bars brought away with Him to the skies the captive band of saints which was there shut up and detained in the darkness of inexorable hell,[fn-21-P2133_919261:10-nf] and, by taking away the fiery sword, restored to paradise its original inhabitants by his pious confession. At the same hour, too, Cornelius, the centurion, continuing with his customary devotion in his prayers, is made aware through the converse of the angel with him that his prayers and alms are remembered before the Lord, and at the ninth hour the mystery[fn-21-P2134_920046:11-nf] of the calling of the Gentiles is clearly shown to him, which had been revealed to Peter in his ecstasy of mind at the sixth hour. In another passage, too, in the Acts of the Apostles, we are told as follows about the same time: \"But Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.\"[fn-21-P2135_920765:12-nf] And by these notices it is clearly proved that these hours were not without good reason consecrated with religious services by holy and apostolic men, and ought to be observed in like manner by us, who, unless we are compelled, as it were, by some rule to discharge these pious offices at least at stated times,either through sloth or through forgetfulness,or being absorbed in business, spend the wholeday without engaging in prayer. But concerning the evening sacrifices what is to be said,since even in the Old Testament these areordered to be offered continually by the law of Moses? For that the morning whole-burnt offerings and evening sacrifices were offered every day continually in the temple, although with figurative offerings, we can show from that which is sung by David: \"Let my prayer be set forth in Thy sight as the incense, and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice,\"[fn-21-P2136_921687:13-nf] in which place we can understand it in a still higher sense of that true evening sacrifice which was given by the Lord our Saviour in the evening to the Apostles at the Supper, when He instituted the holy mysteries of the Church, and of that evening sacrifice which He Himself, on the following day, in the end of the ages, offered up to the Father by the lifting up of His hands for the salvation of the whole world; which spreading forth of His hands on the Cross is quite correctly called a \"lifting up.\" For when we were all lying in hades He raised us to heaven, according to the word of His own promise when He says: \"When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto Me.\"[fn-21-P2137_922402:14-nf] But concerning Martins, that also teaches us which it is customary every day to sing at it: \"O God, my God, to Thee do I watch at break of day;\" and \"I will meditate on Thee in the morning;\" and \"I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;\" and again, \"Mine eyes to Thee have prevented the morning, that I might meditate on Thy words.\"[fn-21-P2138_922762:15-nf] At these hours too that householder in the Gospel hired labourers into his vineyard. For thus also is he described as having hired them in the early morning, which time denotes the Mattin office; then at the third hour; then at the sixth; after this, at the ninth; and last of all, at the eleventh,[fn-21-P2139_923473:16-nf] by which the hour of the lamps[fn-21-P2140_923526:17-nf] is denoted.[fn-21-P2141_923704:18-nf] ","title":"Book III.

Let no one, however, suppose that by this we affirm that some portion of the divinity of the Son of God was in Christ, and that the remaining portion was elsewhere or everywhere, which may be the opinion of those who are ignorant of the nature of an incorporeal and invisible essence. For it is impossible to speak of the parts of an incorporeal being, or to make any division of them; but He is in all things, and through all things, and above all things, in the manner in which we have spoken above, i.e., in the manner in which He is understood to be either \"wisdom,\" or the \"word,\" or the \"life,\" or the \"truth,\" by which method of understanding all confinement of a local kind is undoubtedly excluded. The Son of God, then, desiring for the salvation of the human race to appear unto men, and to sojourn among them, assumed not only a human body, as some suppose, but also a soul resembling our souls indeed in nature, but in will and power[fn-73-P7372_1691350:33-nf] resembling Himself, and such as might unfailingly accomplish all the desires and arrangements of the \"word\" and \"wisdom.\" Now, that He had a soul,[fn-73-P7373_1691542:34-nf] is most clearly shown by the Saviour in the Gospels, when He said, \"No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-73-P7374_1691753:35-nf] And again, \"My soul is sorrowful even unto death.\"[fn-73-P7375_1691821:36-nf] And again, \"Now is my soul troubled.\"[fn-73-P7376_1691880:37-nf] For the \"Word\" of God is not to be understood to be a \"sorrowful and troubled\" soul, because with the authority of divinity He says, \"I have power to lay down my life.\" Nor yet do we assert that the Son of God was in that soul as he was in the soul of Paul or Peter and the other saints, in whom Christ is believed to speak as He does in Paul. But regarding all these we are to hold, as Scripture declares, \"No one is clean from filthiness, not even if his life lasted but a single day.\"[fn-73-P7377_1692387:38-nf] But this soul which was in Jesus, before it knew the evil, selected the good; and because He loved righteousness, and hated iniquity, therefore God \"anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His fellows.\"[fn-73-P7378_1692615:39-nf] He is anointed, then, with the oil of gladness when He is united to the \"word\" of God in a stainless union, and by this means alone of all souls was incapable of sin, because it was capable of (receiving) well and fully the Son of God; and therefore also it is one with Him, and is named by His titles, and is called Jesus Christ, by whom all things are said to be made. Of which soul, seeing it had received into itself the whole wisdom of God, and the truth, and the life, I think that the apostle also said this: \"Our life is hidden with Christ in God; but when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall we also appear with him in glory.\"[fn-73-P7379_1693282:40-nf] For what other Christ can be here understood, who is said to be hidden in God, and who is afterwards to appear, except Him who is related to have been anointed with the oil of gladness, i.e., to have been filled with God essentially,[fn-73-P7380_1693541:41-nf] in whom he is now said to be hidden? For on this account is Christ proposed as an example to all believers, because as He always, even before he knew evil at all, selected the good, and loved righteousness, and hated iniquity, and therefore God anointed Him with the oil of gladness; so also ought each one, after a lapse or sin, to cleanse himself from his stains, making Him his example, and, taking Him as the guide of his journey, enter upon the steep way of virtue, that so perchance by this means, as far as possible we may, by imitating Him, be made partakers of the divine nature. according to the words of Scripture: \"He that saith that he believeth in Christ, ought so to walk, as He also walked.\"[fn-73-P7381_1694271:42-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_38_letter_of_an_inquirer_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"§5.

For He it is who \"as a bride-groom goeth forth from his bride-chamber; He exulted as a giant to run his way.

And, nevertheless, while the world itself is said to have been founded after Him, it is found to have been created by Him; by that very divinity in Him whereby, the world was made, both His glory and His authority are proved. Moreover, if, whereas it is the property of none but God to know the secrets of the heart, Christ beholds the secrets of the heart; and if, whereas it belongs to none but God to remit sins, the same Christ remits sins; and if, whereas it is the portion of no man to come from heaven, He descended by coming from heaven; and if, whereas this word can be true of no man, \"I and the Father are one,\"[fn-102-P10220_3186818:91-nf] Christ alone declared this word out of the consciousness of His divinity; and if, finally, the Apostle Thomas, instructed in all the proofs and conditions of Christ's divinity, says in reply to Christ, \"My Lord and my God; \"[fn-102-P10221_3187061:92-nf] and if, besides, the Apostle Paul says, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom Christ came according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for evermore,\"[fn-102-P10222_3187236:93-nf] writing in his epistles; and if the same apostle declares that he was ordained \"an apostle not by men, nor of man, but by Jesus Christ; \"[fn-102-P10223_3187392:94-nf] and if the same contends that he learned the Gospel not from men or by man, but received it from Jesus Christ, reasonably Christ is God. Therefore, in this respect, one of two things must needs be established. For since it is evident that all things were made by Christ, He is either before all things, since all things were by Him, and so He is justly God; or because He is man He is subsequent to all things, and justly nothing was made by Him. But we cannot say that nothing was made by Him, when we observe it written that all things were made by Him. He is not therefore subsequent to all things; that is, He is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since God is prior to all things. For He is before all things, because all things are by Him, while if He were only man, nothing would be by Him; or if all things were by Him, He would not be man only, because if He were only man, all things would not be by Him; nay, nothing would be by Him. What, then, do they reply? That nothing is by Him, so that He is man only? How then are all things by Him? Therefore He is not man only, but God also, since all things are by Him; so that we reasonably ought to understand that Christ is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since by Him all things were made.

He came down therefore from whence He came, in the same manner as He goes thither from whence He descended. Whence if Christ were only man, He would not have come thence, and therefore would not depart thither, because He would riot have come thence. Moreover, by coming thence, whence as man He could not have come, He shows Himself to have come as God. For the Jews, ignorant and untaught in the matter of this very descent of His, made these heretics their successors, seeing that to them it is said, \"Ye know not whence I come, and whither I go: ye judge after the flesh.\" As much they as the Jews, holding that the carnal birth of Christ was the only one, believed that Christ was nothing else than man; not considering this point, that as man could not come from heaven, so as that he might return thither, He who descended thence must be God, seeing that man could not come thence.

God forbid! But consider what He says: \"I am not of this world.\" Does He then speak falsely when He says \"of this world,\" if He is only man? Or if He does not speak falsely, He is not of this world; He is therefore not man only, because He is not of this world. But that it should not be a secret who He was, He declared whence He was: \"I,\" said He, \"am from above,\" that is, from heaven, whence man cannot come, for he was not made in heaven. He is God, therefore, who is from above, and therefore He is not of this world; although, moreover, in a certain manner He is of this word: wherefore Christ is not God only, but man also. As reasonably in the way in which He is not of this world according to the divinity of the Word, so He is of this world according to the frailty of the body that He has taken upon Him. For man is joined with God, and God is linked with man. But on that account this Christ here laid more stress on the one aspect of His sole divinity, because the Jewish blindness contemplated in Christ the aspect alone of the flesh; and thence in the present passage He passed over in silence the frailty of the body, which is of the world, and spoke of His divinity alone, which is not of the world: so that in proportion as they had inclined to believe Him to be only man, in that proportion Christ might draw them to consider His divinity, so as to believe Him to be God, desirous to overcome their incredulity concerning His divinity by omitting in the meantime any mention of His human condition, and by setting before them His divinity alone. If Christ is man only, how does He say, \"I proceeded forth and came from God,\"[fn-102-P10240_3196072:105-nf] when it is evident that man was made by God, and did not proceed forth from Him? But in the way in which as man He proceeded not from God, thus the Word of God proceeded, of whom it is said, \"My heart hath uttered forth a good Word; \"[fn-102-P10241_3196330:106-nf] which, because it is from God, is with reason also with God. And this, too, since it was not uttered without effect, reasonably makes all things: \"For all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-102-P10242_3196565:107-nf] But this Word whereby all things were made (is God). \"And God,\" says he, \"was the Word.\"[fn-102-P10243_3196673:108-nf] Therefore God proceeded from God, in that the Word which proceeded is God, who proceeded forth from God. If Christ is only man, how does He say, \"If any man shall keep my word, he shall not see death for ever? \"[fn-102-P10244_3196904:109-nf] Not to see death for ever! what is this but immortality? But immortality is the associate of divinity, because both the divinity is immortal, and immortality is the fruit of divinity. For every man is mortal; and immortality cannot be from that which is mortal. Therefore from Christ, as a mortal man, immortality cannot arise. \"But,\" says He, \"whosoever keepeth my word, shall not see death for ever; \"therefore the word of Christ affords immortality, and by immortality affords divinity. But although it is not possible to maintain that one who is himself mortal can make another immortal, yet this word of Christ not only sets forth, but affords immortality: certainly He is not man only who gives immortality, which if He were only man He could not give; but by giving divinity by immortality, He proves Himself to be God by offering divinity, which if He were not God He could not give. If Christ was only man, how did He say, \"Before Abraham was, I Am? \"[fn-102-P10245_3197889:110-nf] For no man can be before Him from whom he himself is; nor can it be that any one should have been prior to him of whom he himself has taken his origin. And yet Christ, although He is born of Abraham, says that He is before Abraham. Either, therefore, He says what is not true, and deceives, if He was not before Abraham, seeing that He was of Abraham; or He does not deceive, if He is also God, and was before Abraham. And if this were not so, it follows that, being of Abraham, He could not be before Abraham. If Christ was only man, how does He say, \"And I know them, and my sheep follow me; and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish? \"[fn-102-P10246_3198572:111-nf] And yet, since every man is bound by the laws of mortality, and therefore is unable to keep himself for ever, much more will he be unable to keep another for ever. But Christ promises to give salvation for ever, which if He does not give, He is a deceiver; if He gives, He is God. But He does not deceive, for He gives what He promises. Therefore He is God who proffers eternal salvation, which man, being unable to keep himself for ever, cannot be able to give to another. If Christ is only man, what is that which He says, \"I and the Father are one? \"[fn-102-P10247_3199149:112-nf] For how can it be that \"I and the Father are one,\" if He is not both God and the Son?-who may therefore be called one, seeing that He is of Himself, being both His Son, and being born of Him, being declared to have proceeded from Him, by which He is also God; which when the Jews thought to be hateful, and believed to be blasphemous, for that He had shown Himself in these discourses to be God, and therefore rushed at once to stoning, and set to work passionately to hurl stones, He strongly refuted His adversaries by the example and witness of the Scriptures. \"If,\" said He, \"He called them gods to whom the words of God were given, and the Scriptures cannot be broken, ye say of Him whom the Father sanctified, and sent into this world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God.\"[fn-102-P10248_3199967:113-nf] By which words He did not deny Himself to be God, but rather He confirmed the assertion that He was God. For because, undoubtedly, they are said to be gods unto whom the words of God were given, much more is He God who is found to be superior to all these. And nevertheless He refuted the calumny of blasphemy in a fitting manner with lawful tact.[fn-102-P10249_3200338:114-nf] For He wishes that He should be thus understood to be God, as the Son of God, and He would not wish to be understood to be the Father Himself. Thus He said that He was sent, and showed them that He had manifested many good works from the Father; whence He desired that He should not be understood to be the Father, but the Son. And in the latter portion of His defence He made mention of the Son, not the Father, when He said, \"Ye say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God.\" Thus, as far as pertains to the guilt of blasphemy, He calls Himself the Son, not the Father; but as pertaining to His divinity, by saying, \"I and the Father are one,\" He proved that He was the Son of God.

He is God, therefore, but God in such a manner as to be the Son, not the Father.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":35,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"ANF-05","text":"If Christ is only man, how is it that He says, \"Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: because I know whence I came, and whither I go; ye know not whence I came, and whither I go. Ye judge after the flesh? \"[fn-102-P10238_3193126:103-nf] Behold, also He says, that He shall return thither whence He bears witness that He came before, as being sent,-to wit, from heaven. He came down therefore from whence He came, in the same manner as He goes thither from whence He descended. Whence if Christ were only man, He would not have come thence, and therefore would not depart thither, because He would riot have come thence. Moreover, by coming thence, whence as man He could not have come, He shows Himself to have come as God. For the Jews, ignorant and untaught in the matter of this very descent of His, made these heretics their successors, seeing that to them it is said, \"Ye know not whence I come, and whither I go: ye judge after the flesh.\" As much they as the Jews, holding that the carnal birth of Christ was the only one, believed that Christ was nothing else than man; not considering this point, that as man could not come from heaven, so as that he might return thither, He who descended thence must be God, seeing that man could not come thence. If Christ is only man, how does He say, \"Ye are from below, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world? \"[fn-102-P10239_3194298:104-nf] But therefore if every man is of this world, and Christ is for that reason in this world, is He only man? God forbid! But consider what He says: \"I am not of this world.\" Does He then speak falsely when He says \"of this world,\" if He is only man? Or if He does not speak falsely, He is not of this world; He is therefore not man only, because He is not of this world. But that it should not be a secret who He was, He declared whence He was: \"I,\" said He, \"am from above,\" that is, from heaven, whence man cannot come, for he was not made in heaven. He is God, therefore, who is from above, and therefore He is not of this world; although, moreover, in a certain manner He is of this word: wherefore Christ is not God only, but man also. As reasonably in the way in which He is not of this world according to the divinity of the Word, so He is of this world according to the frailty of the body that He has taken upon Him. For man is joined with God, and God is linked with man. But on that account this Christ here laid more stress on the one aspect of His sole divinity, because the Jewish blindness contemplated in Christ the aspect alone of the flesh; and thence in the present passage He passed over in silence the frailty of the body, which is of the world, and spoke of His divinity alone, which is not of the world: so that in proportion as they had inclined to believe Him to be only man, in that proportion Christ might draw them to consider His divinity, so as to believe Him to be God, desirous to overcome their incredulity concerning His divinity by omitting in the meantime any mention of His human condition, and by setting before them His divinity alone. If Christ is man only, how does He say, \"I proceeded forth and came from God,\"[fn-102-P10240_3196072:105-nf] when it is evident that man was made by God, and did not proceed forth from Him? But in the way in which as man He proceeded not from God, thus the Word of God proceeded, of whom it is said, \"My heart hath uttered forth a good Word; \"[fn-102-P10241_3196330:106-nf] which, because it is from God, is with reason also with God. And this, too, since it was not uttered without effect, reasonably makes all things: \"For all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-102-P10242_3196565:107-nf] But this Word whereby all things were made (is God). \"And God,\" says he, \"was the Word.\"[fn-102-P10243_3196673:108-nf] Therefore God proceeded from God, in that the Word which proceeded is God, who proceeded forth from God. If Christ is only man, how does He say, \"If any man shall keep my word, he shall not see death for ever? \"[fn-102-P10244_3196904:109-nf] Not to see death for ever! what is this but immortality? But immortality is the associate of divinity, because both the divinity is immortal, and immortality is the fruit of divinity. For every man is mortal; and immortality cannot be from that which is mortal. Therefore from Christ, as a mortal man, immortality cannot arise. \"But,\" says He, \"whosoever keepeth my word, shall not see death for ever; \"therefore the word of Christ affords immortality, and by immortality affords divinity. But although it is not possible to maintain that one who is himself mortal can make another immortal, yet this word of Christ not only sets forth, but affords immortality: certainly He is not man only who gives immortality, which if He were only man He could not give; but by giving divinity by immortality, He proves Himself to be God by offering divinity, which if He were not God He could not give. If Christ was only man, how did He say, \"Before Abraham was, I Am? \"[fn-102-P10245_3197889:110-nf] For no man can be before Him from whom he himself is; nor can it be that any one should have been prior to him of whom he himself has taken his origin. And yet Christ, although He is born of Abraham, says that He is before Abraham. Either, therefore, He says what is not true, and deceives, if He was not before Abraham, seeing that He was of Abraham; or He does not deceive, if He is also God, and was before Abraham. And if this were not so, it follows that, being of Abraham, He could not be before Abraham. If Christ was only man, how does He say, \"And I know them, and my sheep follow me; and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish? \"[fn-102-P10246_3198572:111-nf] And yet, since every man is bound by the laws of mortality, and therefore is unable to keep himself for ever, much more will he be unable to keep another for ever. But Christ promises to give salvation for ever, which if He does not give, He is a deceiver; if He gives, He is God. But He does not deceive, for He gives what He promises. Therefore He is God who proffers eternal salvation, which man, being unable to keep himself for ever, cannot be able to give to another. If Christ is only man, what is that which He says, \"I and the Father are one? \"[fn-102-P10247_3199149:112-nf] For how can it be that \"I and the Father are one,\" if He is not both God and the Son?-who may therefore be called one, seeing that He is of Himself, being both His Son, and being born of Him, being declared to have proceeded from Him, by which He is also God; which when the Jews thought to be hateful, and believed to be blasphemous, for that He had shown Himself in these discourses to be God, and therefore rushed at once to stoning, and set to work passionately to hurl stones, He strongly refuted His adversaries by the example and witness of the Scriptures. \"If,\" said He, \"He called them gods to whom the words of God were given, and the Scriptures cannot be broken, ye say of Him whom the Father sanctified, and sent into this world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God.\"[fn-102-P10248_3199967:113-nf] By which words He did not deny Himself to be God, but rather He confirmed the assertion that He was God. For because, undoubtedly, they are said to be gods unto whom the words of God were given, much more is He God who is found to be superior to all these. And nevertheless He refuted the calumny of blasphemy in a fitting manner with lawful tact.[fn-102-P10249_3200338:114-nf] For He wishes that He should be thus understood to be God, as the Son of God, and He would not wish to be understood to be the Father Himself. Thus He said that He was sent, and showed them that He had manifested many good works from the Father; whence He desired that He should not be understood to be the Father, but the Son. And in the latter portion of His defence He made mention of the Son, not the Father, when He said, \"Ye say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God.\" Thus, as far as pertains to the guilt of blasphemy, He calls Himself the Son, not the Father; but as pertaining to His divinity, by saying, \"I and the Father are one,\" He proved that He was the Son of God.

Although, however, I must hasten to other matters, I do not think that I must pass over this point, that in the Gospel the Lord declared, by way of signifying His majesty, saying, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will build it up again.\"[fn-103-P10320_3237144:166-nf] Or when, in another passage, and on another subject, He declares, \"I have power to lay down my life, and again to take it up; for this commandment I have received of my Father.\"[fn-103-P10321_3237343:167-nf] Now who is it who says that He can lay down His life, or can Himself recover His life again, because He has received it of His Father? Or who says that He can again resuscitate and rebuild the destroyed temple of His body, except because He is the Word who is from the Father, who is with the Father, \"by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made; \"[fn-103-P10322_3237732:168-nf] the imitator[fn-103-P10323_3237764:169-nf] of His Father's works and powers, \"the image of the invisible God; \"[fn-103-P10324_3238147:170-nf] \"who came down from heaven; \"[fn-103-P10325_3238197:171-nf] who testified what things he had seen and heard; who \"came not to do His own will, but rather to do the will of the Father,\"[fn-103-P10326_3238347:172-nf] by whom He had been sent for this very purpose, that being made the \"Messenger of Great Counsel,\"[fn-103-P10327_3238466:173-nf] He might unfold to us the laws of the heavenly mysteries; and who as the Word made flesh dwelt among us, of us this Christ is proved to be not man only, because He was the son of man, but also God, because He is the Son of God? And if by the apostle Christ is called \"the first-born of every creature,\"[fn-103-P10328_3238789:174-nf] how could He be the first-born of every creature, unless because according to His divinity the Word proceeded from the Father before every creature? And unless the heretics receive it thus, they will be constrained to show that Christ the man was the first-born of every creature; which they will not be able to do. Either, therefore, He is before every creature, that He may be the first-born of every creature, and He is not man only, because man is after every creature; or He is man only, and He is after every creature. And how is He the first-born of every creature, except because being that Word which is before every creature; and therefore, the first-born of every creature, He becomes flesh and dwells in us, that is, assumes that man's nature which is after every creature, and so dwells with him and in him, in us, that neither is humanity taken away from Christ, nor His divinity denied? For if He is only before every creature, humanity is taken away from Him; but if He is only man, the divinity which is before every creature is interfered with. Both of these, therefore, are leagued together in Christ, and both are conjoined, and both are linked with one another. And rightly, as there is in Him something which excels the creature, the agreement of the divinity and the humanity seems to be pledged in Him: for which reason He who is declared as made the \"Mediator between God and man\"[fn-103-P10329_3240515:175-nf] is revealed to have associated in Himself God and man. And if the same apostle says of Christ, that \"having put off the flesh, He spoiled powers, they being openly triumphed over in Himself,\"[fn-103-P10330_3240729:176-nf] he certainly did not without a meaning propound that the flesh was put off, unless because he wished it to be understood that it was again put on also at the resurrection. Who, therefore, is He that thus put off and put on the flesh? Let the heretics seek out. For we know that the Word of God was invested with the substance of flesh, and that He again was divested of the same bodily material, which again He took up in the resurrection and resumed as a garment. And yet Christ could neither have been divested of nor invested with manhood, had He been only man: for man is never either deprived of nor invested with himself. For that must be something else, whatever it may be, which by any other is either taken away or put on. Whence, reasonably, it was the Word of God who put off the flesh, and again in the resurrection put it on, since He put it off because at His birth He had been invested with it. Therefore in Christ it is God who is invested, and moreover must be divested, because He who is invested must also likewise be He who is divested; whereas, as man, He is invested with and divested of, as it were, a certain tunic of the compacted body.[fn-103-P10331_3241913:177-nf] And therefore by consequence He was, as we have said, the Word of God, who is revealed to be at one time invested, at another time divested of the flesh. For this, moreover, He before predicted in blessings: \"He shall wash His garment in wine, and His clothing in the blood of the grape.\"[fn-103-P10332_3242355:178-nf] If the garment in Christ be the flesh, and the clothing itself be the body, let it be asked who is He whose body is clothing, and garment flesh? For to us it is evident that the flesh is the garment, and the body the clothing of the Word; and He washed His bodily substance, and purified the material of the flesh in blood, that is, in wine, by His passion, in the human character that He had undertaken. Whence, if indeed He is washed, He is man, because the garment which is washed is the flesh; but He who washes is the Word of God, who, in order that He might wash the garment, was made the taker-up of the garment. Rightly, from that substance which is taken that it might be washed, He is revealed as a man, even as from the authority of the Word who washed it He is manifested to be God.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":29,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"ANF-05","text":"But since they frequently urge upon us the passage where it is said, \"I and the Father are one,\"[fn-103-P10386_3266951:214-nf] in this also we shall overcome them with equal facility. For if, as the heretics think, Christ were the Father, He ought to have said, \"I and the Father are one.\"[fn-103-P10387_3267158:215-nf] But when He says I, and afterwards introduces the Father by saying, \"I and the Father,\" He severs and distinguishes the peculiarity of His, that is, the Son's person, from the paternal authority, not only in respect of the sound of the name, but moreover in respect of the order of the distribution of power, since He might have said, \"I the Father,\" if He had had it in mind that He Himself was the Father. And since He said \"one\" thing, let the heretics understand that He did not say \"one \"person. For one placed in the neuter, intimates the social concord, not the personal unity. He is said to be one neuter, not one masculine, because the expression is not referred to the number, but it is declared with reference to the association of another. Finally, He adds, and says, \"We are,\" not \"I am,\" so as to show, by the fact of His saying\" I and the Father are,\" that they are two persons. Moreover, that He says one,[fn-103-P10388_3268120:216-nf] has reference to the agreement, and to the identity of judgment, and to the loving association itself, as reasonably the Father and Son are one in agreement, in love, and in affection; and because He is of the Father, whatsoever He is, He is the Son; the distinction however remaining, that He is not the Father who is the Son, because He is not the Son who is the Father. For He would not have added \"We are,\" if He had had it in mind that He, the only and sole Father, had become the Son. In fine, the Apostle Paul also apprehended this agreement of unity, with the distinction of persons notwithstanding: for in writing to the Corinthians he said, \"I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. Therefore neither is he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but God who gives the increase. Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one.\"[fn-103-P10389_3269002:217-nf] And who does not perceive that Apollos is one person and Paul another, and that. Apollos and Paul are not one and the same person? Moreover, also, the offices mentioned of each one of them are different; for one is he who plants, and another he who waters. The Apostle Paul, however, put forward these two not as being one person, but as being\" one; \"so that although Apollos indeed is one, and Paul another, so far as respects the distinction of persons, yet as far as respects their agreement both are \"one.\" For when two persons have one judgment, one truth, one faith, one and the same religion, one fear of God also, they are one even although they are two persons: they are the same, in that they have the same mind.

And as in a dream we fancy that we hear, and that the organs of hearing are actually impressed, and that we see with our eyes-although neither the bodily organs of sight nor hearing are affected, but it is the mind alone which has these sensations-so there is no absurdity in believing that similar things occurred to the prophets, when it is recorded that they witnessed occurrences of a rather wonderful kind, as when they either heard the words of the Lord or beheld the heavens opened. For I do not suppose that the visible heaven was actually opened, and its physical structure divided, in order that Ezekiel might be able to record such an occurrence. Should not, therefore, the same be believed of the Saviour by every intelligent hearer of the Gospels?-although such an occurrence may be a stumbling-block to the simple, who in their simplicity would set the whole world in movement, and split in sunder the compact and mighty body of the whole heavens. But he who examines such matters more profoundly will say, that there being, as the Scripture calls it, a kind of general divine perception which the blessed man alone knows how to discover, according to the saying of Solomon, \"Thou shall find the knowledge of God; \"[fn-78-P7862_1882781:79-nf] and as there are various forms of this perceptive power, such as a faculty of vision which can naturally see things that are better than bodies, among which are ranked the cherubim and seraphim; and a faculty of hearing which can perceive voices which have not their being in the air; and a sense of taste which can make use of living bread that has come down from heaven, and that giveth life unto the world; and so also a sense of smelling, which scents such things as leads Paul to say that he is a sweet savour of Christ unto God;[fn-78-P7863_1883339:80-nf] and a sense of touch, by which John says that he \"handled with his hands of the Word of life; \"[fn-78-P7864_1883459:81-nf] -the blessed prophets having discovered this divine perception, and seeing and hearing in this divine manner, and tasting likewise, and smelling, so to speak, with no sensible organs of perception, and laying hold on the Logos by faith, so that a healing effluence from it comes upon them, saw in this manner what they record as having seen, and heard what they say they heard, and were affected in a similar manner to what they describe when eating the roll of a book that was given them.[fn-78-P7865_1883971:82-nf] And so also Isaac smelled the savour of his son's divine garments,[fn-78-P7866_1884064:83-nf] and added to the spiritual blessing these words: \"See, the savour of my son is as the savour of a full field which the Lord blessed.\"[fn-78-P7867_1884254:84-nf] And similarly to this, and more as a matter to be understood by the mind than to be perceived by the senses, Jesus touched the leper,[fn-78-P7868_1884413:85-nf] to cleanse him, as I think, in a twofold sense,-freeing him not only, as the multitude heard, from the visible leprosy by visible contact, but also from that other leprosy, by His truly divine touch. It is in this way, accordingly, that John testifies when he says, \"I beheld the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon Him. And I knew Him not; but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, Upon whom you will see the Spirit descending, and abiding on Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost And I saw, and bear witness, that this is the Son of God.\"[fn-78-P7869_1885042:86-nf] Now it was to Jesus that the heavens were opened; and on that occasion no one except John is recorded to have seen them opened. But with respect to this opening of the heavens, the Saviour, foretelling to His disciples that it would happen, and that they would see it, says, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heavens opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\"[fn-78-P7870_1885476:87-nf] And so Paul was carried away into the third heaven, having previously seen it opened, since he was a disciple of Jesus. It does not, however, belong to our present object to explain why Paul says, \"Whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not: God knoweth.\"[fn-78-P7871_1885782:88-nf] But I shall add to my argument even those very points which Celsus imagines, viz., that Jesus Himself related the account of the opening of the heavens, and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Him at the Jordan in the form of a dove, although the Scripture does not assert that He said that He saw it. For this great man did not perceive that it was not in keeping with Him who commanded His disciples on the occasion of the vision on the mount, \"Tell what ye have seen to no man, until the Son of man he risen from the dead,\"[fn-78-P7872_1886333:89-nf] to have related to His disciples what was seen and heard by John at the Jordan. For it may be observed as a trait of the character of Jesus, that He on all occasions avoided unnecessary talk about Himself; and on that account said, \"If I speak of Myself, My witness is not true.\"[fn-78-P7873_1886637:90-nf] And since He avoided unnecessary talk about Himself, and preferred to show by acts rather than words that He was the Christ, the Jews for that reason said to Him, \"If Thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.\"[fn-78-P7874_1886860:91-nf] And as it is a Jew who, in the work of Celsus, uses the language to Jesus regarding the appearance of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, \"This is your own testimony, unsupported save by one of those who were sharers of your punishment, whom you adduce,\" it is necessary for us to show him that such a statement is not appropriately placed in the mouth of a Jew. For the Jews do not connect John with Jesus, nor the punishment of John with that of Christ. And by this instance, this man who boasts of universal knowledge is convicted of not knowing what words he ought to ascribe to a Jew engaged in a disputation with Jesus.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":10,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_56_book_ii_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"113","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Exceedingly weak is his assertion, that \"the disciples of Jesus wrote such accounts regarding him, by way of extenuating the charges that told against him: as if,\" he says, \"any one were to say that a certain person was a just man, and yet were to show that he was guilty of injustice; or that he was pious, and yet had committed murder; or that he was immortal, and yet was dead; subjoining to all these statements the remark that he had foretold all these things.\" Now his illustrations are at once seen to be inappropriate; for there is no absurdity in Him who had resolved that He would become a living pattern to men, as to the manner in which they were to regulate their lives, showing also how they ought to die for the sake of their religion, apart altogether from the fact that His death on behalf of men was a benefit to the whole world, as we proved in the preceding book. He imagines, moreover, that the whole of the confession of the Saviour's sufferings confirms his objection instead of weakening it. For he is not acquainted either with the philosophical remarks of Paul,[fn-81-P8101_1994323:55-nf] or the statements of the prophets, on this subject. And it escaped him that certain heretics have declared that Jesus underwent His sufferings in appearance, not in reality. For had he known, he would not have said: \"For ye do not even allege this, that he seemed to wicked men to suffer this punishment, though not undergoing it in reality; but, on the contrary, ye acknowledge that he openly suffered.\" But we do not view His sufferings as having been merely in appearance, in order that His resurrection also may not be a false, but a real event. For he who really died, actually arose, if he did arise; whereas he who appeared only to have died, did not in reality arise. But since the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a subject of mockery to unbelievers, we shall quote the words of Plato,[fn-81-P8102_1995171:56-nf] that Erus the son of Armenius rose from the funeral pile twelve days after he had been laid upon it, and gave an account of what he had seen in Hades; and as we are replying to unbelievers, it will not be altogether useless to refer in this place to what Heraclides[fn-81-P8103_1995473:57-nf] relates respecting the woman who was deprived of life. And many persons are recorded to have risen from their tombs, not only on the day of their burial, but also on the day following. What wonder is it, then, if in the case of One who performed many marvellous things, both beyond the power of man and with such fulness of evidence, that he who could not deny their performance, endeavoured to calumniate them by comparing them to acts of sorcery, should have manifested also in His death some greater display of divine power, so that His soul, if it pleased, might leave its body, and having performed certain offices out of it, might return again at pleasure? And such a declaration is Jesus said to have made in the Gospel of John, when He said: \"No man taketh My life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-81-P8104_1996389:58-nf] And perhaps it was on this account that He hastened His departure from the body, that He might preserve it, and that His legs might not be broken, as were those of the robbers who were crucified with Him. \"For the soldiers brake the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with Him; but when they came to Jesus, and saw that He was dead, they brake not His legs.\"[fn-81-P8105_1996784:59-nf] We have accordingly answered the question,\" How is it credible that Jesus could have predicted these things? \"And with respect to this, \"How could the dead man be immortal? \"let him who wishes to understand know, that it is not the dead man who is immortal, but He who rose from the dead. So far, indeed, was the dead man from being immortal, that even the Jesus before His decease-the compound being, who was to suffer death-was not immortal.[fn-81-P8106_1997251:60-nf] For no one is immortal who is destined to die; but he is immortal when he shall no longer be subject to death. But \"Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more: death hath no more dominion over Him; \"[fn-81-P8107_1997581:61-nf] although those may be unwilling to admit this who cannot understand how such things should be said.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":10,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_57_book_i","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"326","folder":"ANF-02","text":"It is the wise man, therefore, alone whom the philosophers proclaim king, legislator, general, just, holy, God-beloved.

And do not count charity a thing cheap. How, indeed, can it be cheap, when all things that are said to be not cheap are called dear (chara)? Therefore, if what is not cheap is dear, what is dearer than dearness itself (charitas)? The apostle so commends charity to us that he says, \"I show unto you a more excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I know all mysteries and all knowledge, and have prophecy and all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.

For he has not hesitated to say, \"God is love.\" It is also written, \"Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given us.\"[fn-6-P615_294186:11-nf] Who, then, can name the Father and the Son without thereby understanding the love of the Father and Son? Which when one begins to have, he will have the Holy Spirit; which if one has not, he will not have the Holy Spirit. And just as thy body, if it be without spirit, namely thy soul, is dead so likewise thy soul, if it be without the Holy Spirit, that is, without charity, will be reckoned dead. Therefore \"The water-pots contained two Metretae apiece,\" because the Father and the Son are proclaimed in the prophecy of all the periods; but the Holy Spirit is there also, and therefore it is added, \"or three apiece.\" \"I and the Father,\" saith He, \"are one.\"[fn-6-P616_294863:12-nf] But far be it from us to suppose that where we are told, \"I and the Father are one,\" the Holy Spirit is not there. Yet since he named the Father and the Son, let the water-pots contain \"two metretae apiece;\" but attend to this, \"or three apiece.\" \"Go, baptize the nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\" So, therefore, when it says \"two apiece,\" the Trinity is not expressed but understood; but when it says, \"or three,\" the Trinity is expressed also.","title":"Tractate IX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_50_oration_xxxviii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"VII.

As these required a greater aid, so also they obtained a greater. And that was that the Word of God Himself-Who is before all worlds, the Invisible, the Incomprehensible, the Bodiless, Beginning of Beginning,[fn-49-P4916_1616270:29-nf] the Light of Light, the Source of Life and Immortality, the Image of the Archetypal Beauty, the immovable Seal, the unchangeable Image, the Father's Definition[fn-49-P4917_1616868:30-nf] and Word, came to His own Image, and took on Him flesh for the sake of our flesh, and mingled Himself with an intelligent soul for my soul's sake, purifying like by like; and in all points except sin was made man.

And He Who gives riches becomes poor, for He assumes the poverty of my flesh, that I may assume the richness of His Godhead. He that is full empties Himself, for He empties Himself of His glory for a short while, that I may have a share in His Fulness. What is the riches of His Goodness? What is this mystery that is around me? I had a share in the image; I did not keep it; He partakes of my flesh that He may both save the image and make the flesh immortal. He communicates a second Communion far more marvellous than the first, inasmuch as then He imparted the better Nature, whereas now Himself partakes of the worse.

And so too now, when the question between us is, Where is the Church? whilst we quote the words that follow in the same passage of the gospel, where, after His resurrection, He gave His body even to be handled by those who were in doubt, in which He showed the future wide extent of the Church, saying, \"Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem;\"[fn-52-P5235_2534585:211-nf] whereas you will not communicate with all nations, in whom these words have been fulfilled, how are you the sheep of this Shepherd, whose words you not only do not obey when you have heard them, but even fight against them? And so we show to you from this that you are not sheep. But listen further whence we show you that, on the contrary, you are wolves. For necessarily, when it is shown by His own words where the Church is to be found, it is also clear where we must look for the fold of Christ. Whenever, therefore, any sheep separate themselves from this fold, which is expressly pointed out and shown to us by the unmistakeable declaration of the Lord,-and that, I will not say because of charges falsely brought, but on account of charges brought, as no one can deny, with great uncertainty against their fellow-men, and consequently slay those sheep which they have torn and alienated from the life of unity and Christian love-is it not evident that they are ravening wolves? But it will be said that these very men themselves praise and preach the Lord Christ. They are therefore those of whom He says Himself, \"They come unto you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. By their fruits ye shall know them.\"[fn-52-P5236_2535855:212-nf] The sheep's clothing is seen in the praises of Christ; the fruits of their wolfish nature in their slanderous teeth.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_65_book_v_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"276","folder":"ANF-02","text":"I cannot help admiring in every particular that divine utterance: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not in by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.

In fine, then, Xenocrates the Chalcedonian was not quite without hope that the notion of the Divinity existed even in the irrational creatures. And Democritus, though against his will, will make this avowal by the consequences of his dogmas; for he represents the same images as issuing, from the divine essence, on men and on the irrational animals.[fn-76-P7628_2300151:164-nf] Far from destitute of a divine idea is man, who, it is written in Genesis, partook of inspiration, being endowed with a purer essence than the other animate creatures.

The Platonists hold that mind is an effluence of divine dispensation in the soul, and they place the soul in the body.

But perhaps this is demanded of us, whether the fact that the temple was forty and six years in building may not have in it some mystery. There are, indeed, many things that may be said of this matter; but what may briefly be said, and easily understood, that we say meanwhile. Brethren, we have said yesterday, if I mistake not, that Adam was one man, and is yet the whole human race. For thus we said, if you remember. He was broken, as it were, in pieces; and, being scattered, is now being gathered together, and, as it were, conjoined into one by a spiritual fellowship and concord. And \"the poor that groan,\" as one man, is that same Adam, but in Christ he is being renewed: because an Adam is come without sin, to destroy the sin of Adam in His own flesh, and that Adam might renew to himself the image of God. Of Adam then is Christ's flesh: of Adam the temple which the Jews destroyed, and the Lord raised up in three days. For He raised His own flesh: see, that He was thus God equal with the Father. My brethren, the apostle says, \"Who raised Him from the dead.\" Of whom says he this? Of the Father. \"He became,\" saith he, \"obedient unto death, even the death of the cross; wherefore also God raised Him from the dead, and gave Him a name which is above every name.\"[fn-6-P687_331080:26-nf] He who was raised and exalted is the Lord.

And doeth the Father anything without the Word? What doeth the Father without His only One?

If that punishment had not been inflicted, he would not afterwards have been healed by it; and since he had been wont to see nothing with his eyes open, if they had remained unharmed, the Scripture would not tell us that at the imposition of Ananias' hands, in order that their sight might be restored, there fell from them as it had been scales, by which the sight had been obscured.[fn-59-P5965_2884525:51-nf] Where is what the Donatists were wont to cry: Man is at liberty to believe or not believe?

Behold, you have heard that when our Lord Jesus Christ \"was in Jerusalem at the Passover, on the feast day, many believed in His name, seeing the signs which He did.\" \"Many believed in His name;\" and what follows? \"But Jesus did not trust Himself to them.\" Now what does this mean, \"They believed,\" or trusted, \"in His name;\" and yet \"Jesus did not trust Himself to them;\"? Was it, perhaps, that they had not believed on Him, but were feigning to have believed, and that therefore Jesus did not trust Himself to them? But the evangelist would not have said, \"Many believed in His name,\" if he were not giving a true testimony to them. A great thing, then, it is, and a wonderful thing: men believe on Christ, and Christ trusts not Himself to men. Especially is it wonderful, since, being the Son of God, He of course suffered willingly. If He were not willing, He would never have suffered, since, had He not willed it, He had not been born; and if He had willed this only, merely to be born and not to die, He might have done evenwhatever He willed, because He is the almighty Son of the almighty Father Let us prove it by facts. For when they wished to hold Him, He departed from them. The Gospel says, \"And when they would have cast Him headlong from the top of the mountain, He departed from them unhurt.\"[fn-7-P700_337312:1-nf] And when they came to lay hold of Him, after He was sold by Judas the traitor, who imagined that he had it in his power to deliver up his Master and Lord, there also the Lord showed that He suffered of His own will, not of necessity. For when the Jews desired to lay hold of Him, He said to them, \"Whom seek ye? But they said, Jesus of Nazareth. And said He, I am He. On hearing this saying, they went backward, and fell to the ground.\"[fn-7-P701_337765:2-nf] In this, that in answering them He threw them to the ground, He showed His power; that in His being taken by them He might show His will. It was of compassion, then, that He suffered. For \"He was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our justification.\"[fn-7-P702_338047:3-nf] Hear His own words: \"I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again: no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself, that I may take it again.\"[fn-7-P703_338236:4-nf] Since, therefore, He had such power, since He declared it by words, showed it by deeds, what then does it mean that Jesus did not trust Himself to them, as if they would do Him some harm against His will, or would do something to Him against His will, especially seeing that they had already believed in His name? Moreover, of the same persons the evangelist says, \"They believed in His name,\" of whom he says, \"But Jesus did not trust Himself to them.\" Why? \"Because He knew all men, and needed not that any should bear witness of man: for Himself knew what was in man.\" The artificer knew what was in His own work better than the work knew what was in itself. The Creator of man knew what was in man, which the created man himself knew not. Do we not prove this of Peter, that he knew not what was in himself, when he said, \"With Thee, even to death\"? Hear that the Lord knew what was in man: \"Thou with me even to death? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.\"[fn-7-P704_339258:5-nf] The man, then, knew not what was in himself; but the Creator of the man knew what was in the man. Nevertheless, many believed in His name, and yet Jesus did not trust Himself to them. What can we say, brethren? Perhaps the circumstances that follow will indicate to us what the mystery of these words is. That men had believed in Him is manifest, is true; none doubts it, the Gospel says it, the truth-speaking evangelist testifies to it. Again, that Jesus trusted not Himself to them is also manifest, and no Christian doubts it; for the Gospel says this also, and the same truth-speaking evangelist testifies to it. Why, then, is it that they believed in His name, and yet Jesus did not trust Himself to them?

For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of two persons; as it is said: \"If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-49-P4971_1790561:49-nf] You have another in the fulness of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. \"For,\" He says, \"if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4972_1790850:50-nf] You have it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: \"For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.\"[fn-49-P4973_1791154:51-nf] You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for thee in the time of tribulation.\"[fn-49-P4974_1791316:52-nf] You have it in the purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: \"Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;\" and after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, \"then,\" he says, \"thou shall call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.\"[fn-49-P4975_1791669:53-nf] Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: \"When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;\"[fn-49-P4976_1791838:54-nf] and again: \"Afflict not the stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.\"[fn-49-P4977_1791961:55-nf] You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes, surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, \"Ask and ye shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\"[fn-49-P4978_1793384:56-nf] and again: \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4979_1793529:57-nf] And therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty days.[fn-49-P4980_1794179:58-nf] Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's providence delayed, or the angel, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's promise where He says: \"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.\"[fn-49-P4981_1795222:59-nf] For it is well for us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: \"This is,\" he says, \"the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His will, He heareth us.\"[fn-49-P4982_1795789:60-nf] He bids us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's will. And we are also taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord's Prayer, where we say \"Thy will be done,\"-Thine not ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that \"we know not what to pray for as we ought\"[fn-49-P4983_1796228:61-nf] we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for us with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: \"For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-49-P4984_1796840:62-nf] And this feeling even our Lord expressed when He prayed in the character[fn-49-P4985_1796933:63-nf] of man which He had taken, that He might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example; saying thus: \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,\"[fn-49-P4986_1797176:64-nf] though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father's will, \"For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;\"[fn-49-P4987_1797346:65-nf] as He Himself says: \"No man taketh my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-49-P4988_1797507:66-nf] In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: \"To do Thy will: O My God, I am willing.\"[fn-49-P4989_1797727:67-nf] For even if we read of the Father: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,\"[fn-49-P4990_1797852:68-nf] we find none the less of the Son: \"Who gave Himself for our sins.\"[fn-49-P4991_1797935:69-nf] And as it is said of the One: \"Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,\"[fn-49-P4992_1798044:70-nf] so it is written of the other: \"He was offered because He Himself willed it.\"[fn-49-P4993_1798146:71-nf] And it is shown that the will of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the actual mystery of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there was no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares that the Father brought about the resurrection of His body, saying: \"And God the Father, who raised Him from the dead,\"[fn-49-P4994_1798569:72-nf] so also the Son testifies that He Himself will raise again the Temple of His body, saying: \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\"[fn-49-P4995_1798808:73-nf] And therefore we being instructed by all these examples of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to end our supplications also with the same prayer, and always to subjoin this clause to all our petitions: \"Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-49-P4996_1799084:74-nf] But it is clear enough that one who does not[fn-49-P4997_1799204:75-nf] pray with attention of mind cannot observe that threefold reverence[fn-49-P4998_1800699:76-nf] which is usually practised in the assemblies of the brethren at the close of service.","title":"IX.

For these also confess the existence of a good God, so far as the mere name goes, but they are unable to point out any of His works either visible or invisible. But inasmuch as they deny Him who is truly and indeed God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things invisible, they are mere inventors of fables. And this appears to me to be the case with these evil-minded men. They see the works of the true Word who alone is in the Father, and yet they deny Him, and make to themselves another Word[fn-40-P4029_1689991:86-nf] , whose existence they are unable to prove either by His Works or by the testimony of others. Unless it be that they have adopted a fabulous notion of God, that He is a composite being like man, speaking and then changing His words, and as a man exercising understanding and wisdom; not perceiving to what absurdities they are reduced by such an opinion. For if God has a succession of words[fn-40-P4030_1690422:87-nf] , they certainly must consider Him as a man. And if those words proceed from Him and then vanish away, they are guilty of a greater impiety, because they resolve into nothing what proceeds from the self-existent God. If they conceive that God doth at all beget, it were surely better and more religious to say that He is the begetter of One Word, who is the fulness of His Godhead, in whom are hidden the treasures of all knowledge[fn-40-P4031_1690880:88-nf] , and that He is co-existent with His Father, and that all things were made by Him; rather than to suppose God to be the Father of many words which are nowhere to be found, or to represent Him who is simple in His nature as compounded of many[fn-40-P4032_1691156:89-nf] , and as being subject to human passions and variable. Next whereas the Apostle says, `Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God[fn-40-P4033_1691314:90-nf] ,' these men reckon Him but as one among many powers; nay, worse than this, they compare Him, transgressors as they are, with the cankerworm and other irrational creatures which are sent by Him for the punishment of men. Next, whereas the Lord says, `Noone knoweth the Father, save the Son[fn-40-P4034_1691623:91-nf] ;' and again, `Not that any man hath seen the Father save He which is of the Father[fn-40-P4035_1691726:92-nf] ;' are not these indeed enemies of God which say that the Father is neither seen nor known of the Son perfectly? If the Lord says, `As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the Father[fn-40-P4036_1691928:93-nf] ,' and if the Father knows not the Son partially, are they not mad to say idly that the Son knows the Father only partially, and not fully? Next, if the Son has a beginning of existence, and all things likewise have a beginning, let them say, which is prior to the other. But indeed they have nothing to say, neither can they with all their craft prove such a beginning of the Word. For He is the true and proper Offspring of the Father, and `in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-40-P4037_1692467:94-nf] .' For with regard to their assertion, that the Son knows not His own essence, it is superfluous to reply to it, except only so far as to condemn their madness; for how does not the Word know Himself, when He imparts to all men the knowledge of His Father and of Himself, and blames those who know not themselves?

When thou seest me cleansing the lepers, then proclaim me as the framer of nature. When thou seest me make the lame ready runners, then with quickened pace do thou also prepare thy tongue to praise me. When thou seest me cast out demons, then hail my kingdom with adoration.

It becometh me to kindle the torch of my body for those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. It becometh me to ascend in the flesh to that place where I am in my divinity. It becometh me to introduce to the Father the Adam reigning in me. It becometh me to accomplish these things, for on account of these things I have taken my position with the works of my hands. It becometh me to be baptized with this baptism for the present, and afterwards to bestow the baptism of the consubstantial Trinity upon all men. Lend me, therefore, O Baptist, thy right hand for the present economy, even as Mary lent her womb for my birth. Immerse me in the streams of Jordan, even as she who bore me wrapped me m children's swaddling-clothes. Grant me thy baptism even as the Virgin granted me her milk. Lay hold of this head of mine, which the seraphim revere. With thy right hand lay hold of this head, that is related to thyself in kinship. Lay hold of this head, which nature has made to be touched. Lay hold of this head, which for this very purpose has been formed by myself and my Father. Lay hold of this head of mine, which, if one does lay hold of it in piety, will save him from ever suffering shipwreck. Baptize me, who am destined to baptize those who believe on me with water, and with the Spirit, and with fire: with water, capable of washing away the defilement of sins; with the Spirit, capable of making the earthly spiritual; with fire, naturally fitted to consume the thorns of transgressions. On hearing these words, the Baptist directed his mind to the object of the salvation,[fn-12-P1283_349743:21-nf] and comprehended the mystery which he had received, and discharged the divine command; for he was at once pious and ready to obey. And stretching forth slowly his right hand, which seemed both to tremble and to rejoice, he baptized the Lord. Then the Jews who were present, with those in the vicinity and those from a distance, reasoned together, and spake thus with themselves and with each other: Was it, then, without cause that we imagined John to be superior to Jesus? Was it without cause that we considered the former to be greater than the latter? Does not this very baptism attest the Baptist's pre-eminence? Is not he who baptizeth presented as the superior, and he who is baptized as the inferior? But while they, in their ignorance of the mystery of the economy, babbled in such wise with each other, He who alone is Lord, and by nature the Father of the Only-begotten, He who alone knoweth perfectly Him whom He alone in passionless fashion begat, to correct the erroneous imaginations of the Jews, opened the gates of the heavens, and sent down the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, lighting upon the head of Jesus, pointing out thereby the new Noah, yea the maker of Noah, and the good pilot of the nature which is in shipwreck. And He Himself calls with clear voice out of heaven, and says: \"This is my beloved Son,\"[fn-12-P1284_351112:22-nf] -the Jesus there, namely, and not the John; the one baptized, and not the one baptizing; He who was begotten of me before all periods of time and not he who was begotten of Zacharias; He who was born of Mary after the flesh, and not he who was brought forth by Elisabeth beyond all expectation; He who was the fruit of the virginity yet preserved intact, and not he who was the shoot from a sterility removed; He who has had His conversation with you, and not he who was brought up in the wilderness. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: my Son, of the same substance with myself, and not of a different; of one substance with me according to what is unseen, and of one substance with you according to what is seen, yet without sin. This is He who along with me made man. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. This Son of mine and this son of Mary are not two distinct persons; but this is my beloved Son,-this one who is both seen with the eye and apprehended with the mind. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear Him. If He shall say, I and my Father are one,[fn-12-P1285_352272:23-nf] hear Him.

And what are \"the two blind men by the way side,\" but the two people to cure whom Jesus came? Let us show those two people in the Holy Scriptures. It is written in the Gospel, \"Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also must I bring, that there may be one fold and One Shepherd.\"[fn-47-P4701_2017411:22-nf] Who then are the two people? One the people of the Jews, and the other of the Gentiles. \"I am not sent,\" He saith, \"but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-47-P4702_2017593:23-nf] To whom did He say this? To the disciples; when that woman of Canaan who confessed herself to be a dog, cried out that she might be found worthy of the crumbs from the master's[fn-47-P4703_2017789:24-nf] table. And because she was found worthy, now were the two people to whom He had come made manifest: the Jewish people, to wit, of whom He said, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel;\" and the people of the Gentiles, whose type this woman exhibited whom He had first rejected, saying, \"It is not meet to cast the children's bread to the dogs;\" and to whom when she said, \"Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table;\" He answered, \"O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.\"[fn-47-P4704_2018362:25-nf] For of this people also was that centurion of whom the same Lord saith, \"Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.\" Because he had said,\" I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.\"[fn-47-P4705_2018669:26-nf] So then the Lord even before His Passion and Glorification pointed out two people, the one to whom He had come because of the promises to the Fathers; and the other whom for His mercy's sake He did not reject; that it might be fulfilled which had been promised to Abraham, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-47-P4706_2019010:27-nf] Wherefore also the Apostle after the Lord's Resurrection and Ascension, when He was despised by the Jews, went to the Gentiles. Not that he was silent however towards the Churches which consisted of Jewish believers; \"I was unknown,\" he says, \"by face unto the Churches of Judaea which were in Christ. But they heard only that he which persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faithwhich once he destroyed, and they glorified God in me.\"[fn-47-P4707_2019474:28-nf] So again Christ is called the \"Corner Stone who made both one.\"[fn-47-P4708_2019558:29-nf] For a corner joins two walls which come from different sides together. And what was so different as the circumcision and uncircumcision, having one wall from Judaea, the other from the Gentiles? But they are joined together by the corner stone. \"For the stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner.\"[fn-47-P4709_2019913:30-nf] There is no corner in a building, except when two walls coming from different directions meet together, and are joined in a kind of unity.

But the catholic faith has it, that the works of the Father and of the Son are not separable. This is what I wish, if possible, to speak to you, beloved; but, according to those words of the Lord, \"he that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\"[fn-10-P1047_623439:5-nf] But he that is not able to receive its let him not charge it on me, but on his own dullness; and let him turn to Him that opens the heart, that He may pour in what He freely giveth. And, lastly, if any one may not have understood, because I have not declared it as I ought to have declared it, let him excuse the weakness of man, and supplicate the divine goodness. For we have within a Master, Christ. Whatever ye are not able to receive through your ear and my mouth, turn ye in your heart to Him who both teacheth me what to speak, and distributeth to you in what measure He deigns. He who knows what to give, and to whom to give, will help him that seeketh, and open to him that knocketh. And if so be that He give not, let no one call himself forsaken. For it may be that He delays to give something, but He leaves none hungry. If, indeed, He give not at the hour, He is exercising the seeker, He is not Scorning the suitor. Look ye, then, and give heed to what I wish to say, even if I should not be able to say it. The catholic faith, confirmed by the Spirit of God in His saints, has this against all heretical perverseness, that the works of the Father and of the Son are inseparable. What is this that I have said? As the Father and the Son are inseparable, so also the works of the Father and of the Son are inseparable. How are the Father and the Son inseparable, since Himself said, \"I and the Father are one?\"[fn-10-P1048_624881:6-nf] Because the Father and the Son are not two Gods, but one God, the Word and He whose the Word is, One and the Only One, Father and Son bound together by charity, One God, and the Spirit of Charity also one, so that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is made the Trinity. Therefore, not only of the Father and Son, but also of the Holy Spirit; as there is equality and inseparability of persons, so also the works are inseparable. I will tell you yet more plainly what is meant by \"the works are inseparable.\" The catholic faith does not say that God the Father made something, and the Son made some other thing; but what the Father made, that also the Son made, that also the Holy Spirit made. For all things were made by the Word; when \"He spoke and they were done,\" it is by the Word they were done, by Christ they were done. For \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God: all things were made by Him.\" If all things were made by Him, \"God said, Let there be light, and there was light; in the Word He made, by the Word He made.","title":"Tractate XX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_25_tractate_xx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"6.

See by what way thou hast entered. Perhaps thou hast not understood this that I said, See by what way thou hast entered: hear Himself saying, \"I am the door.\"[fn-10-P1055_631098:10-nf] Not without cause, then, art thou seeking how thou mayest get out; and this only thou findest, that thou hast not entered by the door, but fell in over the wall.

Come by Christ, not bringing forward of thy own heart what thou mayest say; but what He shows, that speak. Behold how the catholic faith gets clear of this question. The Son walked upon the sea, planted the feet of flesh on the waves: the flesh walked, and the divinity directed. But when the flesh was walking and the divinity directing, was the Father absent? If absent, how doth the Son Himself say, \"but the Father abiding in me, Himself doeth the works?\"[fn-10-P1056_631887:11-nf] If the Father, abiding in the Son, Himself doeth His works, then that walking upon the sea was made by the Father, and through the Son.

For to the unworthy is it closed up, it is opened to those who are meet for it. It is not with stones, or clubs, or the fist, or the heel, that we knock unto the Lord. It is the life which knocks, it is to the life that it is opened. The seeking is with the heart, the asking is with the heart, the knocking is with the heart, the opening is to the heart. Now that heart which asks rightly, and knocks and seeks rightly, must be godly. Must first love God for His Own sake (for this is godliness); and not propose to itself any reward which it looks for from Him other than God Himself. For than Him is there nothing better. And what precious thing can he ask of God, in whose sight God Himself is lightly esteemed? He giveth earth, and thou rejoicest, thou lover of the earth, who art thyself become earth.

Such thoughts then being evidently unseemly and untrue, we are driven to say that what is from the essence of the Father, and proper to Him, is entirely the Son; for it is all one to say that God is wholly participated, and that He begets; and what does begetting signify but a Son? And thus of the Son Himself, all things partake according to the grace of the Spirit coming from Him[fn-54-P5403_2119314:109-nf] ; and this shews that the Son Himself partakes of nothing, but what is partaken from the Father, is the Son; for, as partaking of the Son Himself, we are said to partake of God; and this is what Peter said `that ye may be partakers in a divine nature[fn-54-P5404_2119586:110-nf] ;' as says too the Apostle, `Know ye not, that ye are a temple of God?' and, `We are the temple of a living God[fn-54-P5405_2119717:111-nf] .' And beholding the Son, we see the Father; for the thought[fn-54-P5406_2119816:112-nf] and comprehension of the Son, is knowledge concerning the Father, because He is His proper offspring from His essence. And since to be partaken no one of us would ever call affection or division of God's essence (for it has been shewn and acknowledged that God is participated, and to be participated is the same thing as to beget); therefore that which is begotten is neither affection nor division of that blessed essence. Hence it is not incredible that God should have a Son, the Offspring of His own essence; nor do we imply affection or division of God's essence, when we speak of `Son' and `Offspring;' but rather, as acknowledging the genuine, and true, and Only-begotten of God, so we believe. If then, as we have stated and are shewing, what is the Offspring of the Father's essence be the Son, we cannot hesitate, rather we must be certain, that the same[fn-54-P5407_2120719:113-nf] is the Wisdom and Word of the Father, in and through whom He creates and makes all things; and His Brightness too, in whom He enlightens all things, and is revealed to whom He will; and His Expression and Image also, in whom He is contemplated and known, wherefore `He and His Father are one[fn-54-P5408_2121035:114-nf] ,' and whoso looketh on Him looketh on the Father; and the Christ, in whom all things are redeemed, and the new creation wrought afresh. And on the other hand, the Son being such Offspring, it is not fitting, rather it is full of peril, to say, that He is a work out of nothing, or that He was not before His generation. For he who thus speaks of that which is proper to the Father's essence, already blasphemes the Father Himself[fn-54-P5409_2121485:115-nf] ; since he really thinks of Him what he falsely imagines of His offspring.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":10,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"84","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"39. Therefore He was not man, and then became God, but He was God, and then became man, and that to deify us[fn-55-P5551_2198681:215-nf] , Since, if when He became man, only then He was called Son and God, but before He became man, God called the ancient people sons, and made Moses a god of Pharaoh (and Scripture says of many, `God standeth in the congregation of Gods[fn-55-P5552_2198948:216-nf] '), it is plain that He is called Son and God later than they.

For of that Church of the Gentiles which was to come, the woman that had the issue of blood was a type: she touched and was not seen; she was not known and yet was healed. It was in reality a figure what the Lord asked: \"Who touched me?\" As if not knowing, He healed her as unknown: so has He done also to the Gentiles. We did not get to know Him in the flesh, yet we have been made worthy to eat His flesh, and to be members in His flesh. In what way? Because He sent to us. Whom? His heralds, His disciples, His servants, His redeemed whom He created, but whom He redeemed, His brethren also. I have said but little of all that they are: His own members, Himself; for He sent to us His own members, and He made us His members. Nevertheless, Christ has not been among us with the bodily form which the Jews saw and despised; because this also was said concerning Him, even as the apostle says: \"Now I say that Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.[fn-14-P1459_917091:20-nf] He owed it to have come to those by whose fathers and to whose fathers He was promised. For this reason He says also Himself: \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-14-P1460_917298:21-nf] But what says the apostle in the following words? \"And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy.\" What, moreover, saith the Lord Himself? \"Other sheep I have which are not of this fold.[fn-14-P1461_917513:22-nf] He who had said, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel,\" how has He other sheep to which He was not sent, except that He intimated that He was not sent to show His bodily presence but to the Jews only, who saw and killed Him? And yet many of them, both before and afterwards, believed. The first harvest was winnowed from the cross, that there might be a seed whence another harvest might spring up. But at this present time, when roused by the fame of the gospel, and by its goodly odor, His faithful ones among all nations believe, He shall be the expectation of the Gentiles, when He shall come who has already come; when He shall be seen by all, He who was then not seen by some, by some was seen; when He shall come to judge who came to be judged; when He shall come to distinguish who came not to be distinguished. For Christ was not discerned by the ungodly, but was condemned with the ungodly; for it was said concerning Him, \"He was accounted among the wicked.\"[fn-14-P1462_918526:23-nf] The robber escaped, Christ was condemned. He who was loaded with criminal accusations received pardon; He who has released from their crimes all who confess Him, was condemned. Nevertheless even the cross itself, if thou considerest it well, was a judgment-seat; for the Judge being set up in the middle, one thief who believed was delivered, the other who reviled was condemned.[fn-14-P1463_918926:24-nf] Already He signified what He is to do with the quick and the dead: some He will set on His right hand and others on His left. That thief was like those that shall be on the left hand, the other like those that shall be on the right. He was undergoing judgment, and He threatened judgment.","title":"Tractate XXXI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":38,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"12. But here they must have the same answer as before, and first be told that the Word is a Son, as has been said above[fn-58-P5880_2347921:64-nf] , and not a work, and that such terms are not to be understood of His Godhead, but the reason and manner of them investigated. To persons who so inquire, the human Economy will plainly present itself, which He undertook for our sake. For Peter, after saying, `He hath made Lord and Christ,' straightway added, `this Jesus whom ye crucified;' which makes it plain to any one, even, if so be, to them, provided they attend to the context, that not the Essence of the Word, but He according to His manhood is said to have been made. For what was crucified but the body? and how could be signified what was bodily in the Word, except by saying `He made?' Especially has that phrase, `He made,' a meaning consistent with orthodoxy; in that he has not said, as I observed before, `He made Him Word,' but `He made Him Lord,' nor that in general terms[fn-58-P5881_2348783:65-nf] , but `towards' us, and `in the midst of' us, as much as to say, `He manifested Him.' And this Peter himself, when he began this primary teaching, carefully[fn-58-P5882_2348952:66-nf] expressed, when he said to them, `Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man manifested of God towards you by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by Him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves know[fn-58-P5883_2349252:67-nf] .' Consequently the term which he uses in the end, `made', this He has explained in the beginning by `manifested,' for by the signs and wonders which the Lord did, He was manifested to be not merely man, but God in a body and Lord also, the Christ. Such also is the passage in the Gospel according to John, `Therefore the more did the Jews persecute Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but said also that God was His own Father, making Himself equal with God[fn-58-P5884_2349738:68-nf] .' For the Lord did not then fashion Himself to be God, nor indeed is a made God conceivable, but He manifested it by the works, saying, `Though ye believe not Me, believe My works, that ye may know that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me[fn-58-P5885_2350012:69-nf] .' Thus then the Father has `made' Him Lord and King in the midst of us, and towards us who were once disobedient; and it is plain that He who is now displayed as Lord and King, does not then begin to be King and Lord, but begins to shew His Lordship, and to extend it even over the disobedient.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":10,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"15. This, at least according to my nothingness, is the meaning of this passage; moreover, a true and a good meaning have these words of Peter as regards the Jews.

Next they suppose Him, not the Word coming in flesh, but a mere man, as were all the kings. The Lord then, admonishing Cleopas and the other, taught them that the Christ must first suffer; and the rest of the Jews that God was come among them, saying, `If He called them gods to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken, say ye of Him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God[fn-59-P5903_2356973:84-nf] ?'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"33. These are the evil sophistries of the heterodox; yet, though we have already shewn their shallowness, the exact sense of these passages themselves and the force of these illustrations will serve to shew the baseless nature of their loathsome tenet. For we see that reason is ever, and is from him and proper to his essence, whose reason it is, and does not admit a before and an after. So again we see that the radiance from the sun is proper to it, and the sun's essence is not divided or impaired; but its essence is whole and its radiance perfect and whole[fn-60-P6062_2414996:213-nf] , yet without impairing the essence of light, but as a true offspring from it. We understand in like manner that the Son is begotten not from without but from the Father, and while the Father remains whole, the Expression of His Subsistence is ever, and preserves the Father's likeness and unvarying Image, so that he who sees Him, sees in Him the Subsistence too, of which He is the Expression. And from the operation of the Expression we understand the true Godhead of the Subsistence, as the Saviour Himself teaches when He says, `The Father who dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works[fn-60-P6063_2416426:214-nf] ' which I do; and `I and the Father are one,' and `I in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-60-P6064_2416535:215-nf] .' Therefore let this Christ-opposing heresy attempt first to divide[fn-60-P6065_2416623:216-nf] the examples found in things originate, and say, `Once the sun was without his radiance,' or, `Radiance is not proper to the essence of light,' or `It is indeed proper, but it is a part of light by division; and then let it divide Reason, and pronounce that it is foreign to mind, or that once it was not, or that it was not proper to its essence, or that it is by division a part of mind.'

For that reason would needs take precedence of Him, without which not even He Himself had come into being. Paul, for instance, `separated an Apostle for the Gospel, which the Lord had promised afore by the Prophets[fn-62-P6227_2485163:351-nf] ,' was thereby made subordinate to the Gospel, of which he was made minister, and John, being chosen to prepare the Lord's way, was made subordinate to the Lord; but the Lord, not being made subordinate to any reason why He should be Word, save only that He is the Father's Offspring and Only-begotten Wisdom, when He becomes man, then assigns the reason why He is about to take flesh. For the need of man preceded His becoming man, apart from which He had not put on flesh[fn-62-P6228_2485666:352-nf] .

For they are one, not[fn-65-P6527_2591364:29-nf] as one thing divided into two parts, and these nothing but one, nor as one thing twice named, so that the Same becomes at one time Father, at another His own Son, for this Sabellius holding was judged an heretic. But They are two, because the Father is Father and is not also Son, and the Son is Son and not also Father[fn-65-P6528_2591708:30-nf] ; but the nature is one; (for the offspring is not unlike[fn-65-P6529_2591781:31-nf] its parent, for it is his image), and all that is the Father's, is the Son's[fn-65-P6530_2591995:32-nf] . Wherefore neither is the Son another God, for He was not procured from without, else were there many, if a godhead be procured foreign from the Father's[fn-65-P6531_2592274:33-nf] ; for if the Son be other, as an Offspring, still He is the Same as God; and He and the Father are one in propriety and peculiarity of nature, and in the identity of the one Godhead, as has been said. For the radiance also is light, not second to the sun, nor a different light, nor from participation of it, but a whole and proper offspring of it. And such an offspring is necessarily one light; and no one would say that they are two lights[fn-65-P6532_2592732:34-nf] , but sun and radiance two, yet one the light from the sun enlightening in its radiance all things. So also the Godhead of the Son is the Father's; whence also it is indivisible; and thus there is one God and none other but He.

Nor is this Form[fn-65-P6550_2598625:50-nf] of the Godhead partial merely, but the fulness of the Father's Godhead is the Being of the Son, and the Son is whole God. Therefore also, being equal to God, He `thought it not a prize to be equal to God;' and again since the Godhead and the Form of the Son is none other's than the Father's[fn-65-P6551_2598950:51-nf] , this is what He says, `I in the Father.' Thus `God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself[fn-65-P6552_2599442:52-nf] ;' for the propriety of the Father's Essence is that Son, in whom the creation was then reconciled with God. Thus what things the Son then wrought are the Father's works, for the Son is the Form of that Godhead of the Father, which wrought the works. And thus he who looks at the Son, sees the Father; for in the Father's Godhead is and is contemplated the Son; and the Father's Form which is in Him shews in Him the Father; and thus the Father is in the Son. And that propriety and Godhead which is from the Father in the Son, shews the Son in the Father, and His inseparability from Him; and whoso hears and beholds that what is said of the Father is also said of the Son, not as accruing to His Essence by grace or participation, but because the very Being of the Son is the proper Offspring of the Father's Essence, will fitly understand the words, as I said before, `I in the Father, and the Father in Me;' and `I and the Father are One[fn-65-P6553_2600403:53-nf] .' For the Son is such as the Father is, because He has all that is the Father's. Wherefore also is He implied together with the Father. For, a son not being, one cannot say father; whereas when we call God a Maker, we do not of necessity intimate the things which have come to be; for a maker is before his works[fn-65-P6554_2600748:54-nf] . But when we call God Father, at once with the Father we signify the Son's existence. Therefore also he who believes in the Son, believes also in the Father: for he believes in what is proper to the Father's Essence; and thus the faith is one in one God. And he who worships and honours the Son, in the Son worships and honours the Father; for one is the Godhead; and therefore one[fn-65-P6555_2601405:55-nf] the honour and one the worship which is paid to the Father in and through the Son. And he who thus worships, worships one God; for there is one God and none other than He. Accordingly when the Father is called the only God, and we read that there is one God[fn-65-P6556_2601781:56-nf] , and `I am,' and `beside Me there is no God,' and `I the first and I the last[fn-65-P6557_2601879:57-nf] ,' this has a fit meaning. For God is One and Only and First; but this is not said to the denial of the Son[fn-65-P6558_2602041:58-nf] , perish the thought; for He is in that One, and First and Only, as being of that One and Only and First the Only Word and Wisdom and Radiance. And He too is the First, as the Fulness of the Godhead of the First and Only, being whole and full God[fn-65-P6559_2602312:59-nf] . This then is not said on His account, but to deny that there is other such as the Father and His Word.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"6.

Therefore also, being equal to God, He `thought it not a prize to be equal to God;' and again since the Godhead and the Form of the Son is none other's than the Father's[fn-65-P6551_2598950:51-nf] , this is what He says, `I in the Father.' Thus `God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself[fn-65-P6552_2599442:52-nf] ;' for the propriety of the Father's Essence is that Son, in whom the creation was then reconciled with God. Thus what things the Son then wrought are the Father's works, for the Son is the Form of that Godhead of the Father, which wrought the works. And thus he who looks at the Son, sees the Father; for in the Father's Godhead is and is contemplated the Son; and the Father's Form which is in Him shews in Him the Father; and thus the Father is in the Son. And that propriety and Godhead which is from the Father in the Son, shews the Son in the Father, and His inseparability from Him; and whoso hears and beholds that what is said of the Father is also said of the Son, not as accruing to His Essence by grace or participation, but because the very Being of the Son is the proper Offspring of the Father's Essence, will fitly understand the words, as I said before, `I in the Father, and the Father in Me;' and `I and the Father are One[fn-65-P6553_2600403:53-nf] .' For the Son is such as the Father is, because He has all that is the Father's. Wherefore also is He implied together with the Father. For, a son not being, one cannot say father; whereas when we call God a Maker, we do not of necessity intimate the things which have come to be; for a maker is before his works[fn-65-P6554_2600748:54-nf] . But when we call God Father, at once with the Father we signify the Son's existence. Therefore also he who believes in the Son, believes also in the Father: for he believes in what is proper to the Father's Essence; and thus the faith is one in one God. And he who worships and honours the Son, in the Son worships and honours the Father; for one is the Godhead; and therefore one[fn-65-P6555_2601405:55-nf] the honour and one the worship which is paid to the Father in and through the Son. And he who thus worships, worships one God; for there is one God and none other than He. Accordingly when the Father is called the only God, and we read that there is one God[fn-65-P6556_2601781:56-nf] , and `I am,' and `beside Me there is no God,' and `I the first and I the last[fn-65-P6557_2601879:57-nf] ,' this has a fit meaning. For God is One and Only and First; but this is not said to the denial of the Son[fn-65-P6558_2602041:58-nf] , perish the thought; for He is in that One, and First and Only, as being of that One and Only and First the Only Word and Wisdom and Radiance. And He too is the First, as the Fulness of the Godhead of the First and Only, being whole and full God[fn-65-P6559_2602312:59-nf] . This then is not said on His account, but to deny that there is other such as the Father and His Word.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"10.

Whence it was that, when the flesh suffered, the Word was not external to it; and therefore is the passion said to be His: and when He did divinely His Father's works, the flesh was not external to Him, but in the body itself did the Lord do them. Hence, when made man, He said[fn-67-P6779_2688185:244-nf] , `If I do not the works of the Father, believe Me not; but if I do, though ye believe not Me, believe the works, that ye may know that the Father is in He and I in Him.' And thus when there was need to raise Peter's wife's mother, who was sick of a fever, He stretched forth His hand humanly, but He stopped the illness divinely. And in the case of the man blind from the birth, human was the spittle which He gave forth from the flesh, but divinely did He open the eyes through the clay. And in the case of Lazarus, He gave forth a human voice as man; but divinely, as God, did He raise Lazarus from the dead[fn-67-P6780_2689107:245-nf] . These things were so done, were so manifested, because He had a body, not in appearance, but in truth[fn-67-P6781_2689687:246-nf] ; and it became the Lord, in putting on human flesh, to put it on whole with the affections proper to it; that, as we say that the body was His own, so also we may say that the affections of the body were proper to Him alone, though they did not touch Him according to His Godhead.

Hence, when made man, He said[fn-67-P6779_2688185:244-nf] , `If I do not the works of the Father, believe Me not; but if I do, though ye believe not Me, believe the works, that ye may know that the Father is in He and I in Him.' And thus when there was need to raise Peter's wife's mother, who was sick of a fever, He stretched forth His hand humanly, but He stopped the illness divinely. And in the case of the man blind from the birth, human was the spittle which He gave forth from the flesh, but divinely did He open the eyes through the clay.

Since were He not essential Wisdom and substantive Word, and Son existing, but simply Wisdom and Word and Son in the Father, then the Father Himself would have a nature compounded of Wisdom and Word. But if so, the forementioned absurdities would follow; and He will be His own Father, and the Son begetting and begotten by Himself; or Word, Wisdom, Son, is a name only, and He does not subsist who owns, or rather who is, these titles. If then He does not subsist, the names are idle and empty, unless we say that God is Very Wisdom[fn-70-P7097_2822520:6-nf] and Very Word. But if so, He is His own Father and Son; Father, when Wise, Son, when Wisdom; but these things are not in God as a certain quality; away with the dishonourable[fn-70-P7098_2822731:7-nf] thought; for it will issue in this, that God is compounded of essence and quality[fn-70-P7099_2822820:8-nf] . For whereas all quality is in essence, it will clearly follow that the Divine Monad, indivisible as it is, must be compound, being severed into essence and accident[fn-71-P7100_2823007:9-nf] . We must ask then these headstrong men; The Son was proclaimed as God's Wisdom and Word; how then is He such? if as a quality, the absurdity has been shewn; but if God is that Very Wisdom, then it is the absurdity of Sabellius; therefore He is so, as an Offspring in a proper sense from the Father Himself, according to the illustration of light. For as there is light from fire, so from God is there a Word, and Wisdom from the Wise, and from the Father a Son. For in this way the Monad remains undivided and entire, and Its Son, Word not unessential, nor not subsisting, but essential truly. For were it not so, all that is said would be said notionally[fn-71-P7101_2823754:10-nf] and verbally[fn-71-P7102_2823790:11-nf] . But if we must avoid that absurdity, then is a true Word essential. For as there is a Father truly, so Wisdom truly. In this respect then they are two; not because, as Sabellius said, Father and Son are the same, but because the Father is Father and the Son Son, and they are one, because He is Son of the Essence of the Father by nature, existing as His own Word. This the Lord said, viz. `I and the Father are One[fn-71-P7103_2824230:12-nf] ;' for neither is the Word separated from the Father, nor was or is the Father ever Wordless; on this account He says, `I in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-71-P7104_2824404:13-nf] .'","title":"Discourse IV","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":10,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_62_discourse_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"6. But in answer to the weak and human notion of the Arians, their supposing that the Lord is in want, when He says, `Is given unto Me,' and `I received,' and if Paul says, `Wherefore He highly exalted Him,' and `He set Him at the right hand[fn-71-P7126_2830911:30-nf] ,' and the like, we must say that our Lord, being Word and Son of God, bore a body, and became Son of Man, that, having become Mediator between God, and men, He might minister the things of God to us, and ours to God. When then He is said to hunger and weep and weary, and to cry Eloi, Eloi, which are our human affections, He receives them from us and offers to the Father[fn-71-P7127_2831345:31-nf] , interceding for us, that in Him they may be annulled[fn-71-P7128_2831432:32-nf] . And when it is said, `All power is given unto Me,' and `I received,' and `Wherefore God highly exalted Him,' these are gifts given from God to us through Him. For the Word was never in want[fn-71-P7129_2831656:33-nf] , nor has come into being[fn-71-P7130_2831698:34-nf] ; nor again were men sufficient to minister these things for themselves, but through the Word they are given to us; therefore, as if given to Him, they are imparted to us. For this was the reason of His becoming man, that, as being given to Him, they might pass on to us[fn-71-P7131_2831997:35-nf] . For of such gifts mere man had not become worthy; and again the mere Word had not needed them[fn-71-P7132_2832113:36-nf] ; the Word then was united to us, and then imparted to us power, and highly exalted us[fn-71-P7133_2832225:37-nf] . For the Word being in man, highly exalted man himself; and, when the Word was in man, man himself received. Since then, the Word being in flesh, man himself was exalted, and received power, therefore these things are referred to the Word, since they were given on His account; for on account of the Word in man were these gifts given. And as `the Word became flesh[fn-71-P7134_2832612:38-nf] ,' so also man himself received the gifts which came through the Word.

But if the Son was ever, He must be the Word; for if the Word be not Son, and this is what a man waxes bold to say, either he holds that Word to be Father or the Son superior to the Word. For the Son being `in the bosom of the Father[fn-71-P7180_2850328:69-nf] ,' of necessity either the Word is not before the Son (for nothing is before Him who is in the Father), or if the Word be other than the Son, the Word must be the Father in whom is the Son.

The Jews answered Him, saying, For a good work we stone Thee not, but for blasphemy, and because that Thou, being a man, makest Thyself God. Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? If he called them gods unto whom the Word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken, say ye of Him, whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not. But if I do, though ye believe not Me, believe the works, that ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.'

For if simply, when made Man, He has become Son, the becoming Man is the cause. And if the Man is cause of His being Son, or both together, then the same absurdities result. Next, if He is first Word and then Son, it will appear that He knew the Father afterwards, not before; for not as being Word does He know Him, but as Son. For `No one knoweth the Father but the Son.' And this too will result, that He has come afterwards to be `in the bosom of the Fathers[fn-72-P7212_2866903:94-nf] ,' and afterwards He and the Father have become One; and afterwards is, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father[fn-72-P7213_2867050:95-nf] .'

How, then, is His judgment true, but because the Son is true? For this He said: \"And if I judge, my judgment is true; because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.\" Just as if He had said, \"My judgment is true,\" because I am the Son of God. How dost Thou prove that Thou art the Son of God? \"Because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.\" Blush, Sabellian; thou hearest the Son, thou hearest the Father. Father is Father, Son is Son. He said not, I am the Father. and I the same am the Son; but He saith, \"I am not alone.\" Why art Thou not alone? Because the Father is with me. \"I am, and the Father that sent me;\" thou hearest, \"I am, and He that sent me.\" Lest thou lose sight of the person, distinguish the persons. Distinguish by understanding, do not separate by faithlessness; lest again, fleeing as it were Charybdis, thou rush Upon Scylla. For the whirlpool of the impiety of the Sabellians was swallowing thee, to say that the Father is the same who is Son: just now thou hast learned, \"I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.\" Thou dost acknowledge that the Father is Father, and that the Son is Son thou dost rightly acknowledge: but do not say the Father is greater, the Son is less; do not say, the Father is gold, the Son is silver. There is one substance, one Godhead, one co-eternity, perfect equality, no unlikeness. For if thou only believe that Christ is another, not the same person that the Father is, but yet imagine that in respect of His nature He is somewhat different from the Father, thou hast indeed escaped Charybdis, but thou hast been wrecked on the rocks of Scylla. Steer the middle course, avoid each of the two perilous sides. Father is Father, Son is Son. Thou sayest now, Father is Father, Son is Son: thou hast fortunately escaped the danger of the absorbing whirl; why wouldst thou go unto the other side to say, the Father is this, the Son that? The Son is another person than the Father is, this thou sayest rightly; but that He is different in nature, thou sayest not rightly. Certainly the Son is another person, because He is not the same who is Father and the Father is another person, because He is not the same who is Son: nevertheless, they are not different in nature, but the selfsame is both Father and Son. What means the self-same? God is one. Thou hast heard, \"Because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me:\" hear how thou mayest believe Father and Son; hear the Son Himself, \"I and the Father are one.\"[fn-15-P1592_1011320:9-nf] He said not, I am the Father; or, I and the Father is one person; but when He says, \"I and the Father are one,\" hear both, both the one, unum, and the are, sumus, and thou shalt be delivered both from Charybdis and from Scylla. In these two words, in that He said one, He delivers thee from Arius; in that He said are, He delivers thee from Sabellius. If one, therefore not diverse; if are, therefore both Father and Son. For He would not say are of one person; but, on the other hand, He would not say one of diverse. Hence the reason why He says, \"my judgment is true,\" is, that thou mayest hear it briefly, because I am the Son of God. But I would have thee in such wise believe that I am the Son of God, that thou mayest understand that the Father is with me: I am not Son in such manner as to have left Him; I am not in such manner here that I should not be with Him; nor is He in such manner there as not to be with me: I have taken to me the form of a servant, yet have I not lost the form of God; therefore He saith, \"I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.\"","title":"Tractate XXXVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":10,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_42_tractate_xxxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"9. Hear, thou fool: \"His hour was not yet come;\" not the hour in which He should be forced to die, but that in which He would deign to be put to death. For Himself knew when He should die: He considered all things that were foretold of Him, and awaited all to be finished that was foretold to be before His suffering; that when all should be fulfilled, then should come His suffering in set order, not by fatal necessity. In short, hear that yon may prove. Among the rest that was prophesied of Him, it is also written: \"They gave me gall for meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.\"[fn-16-P1619_1032093:5-nf] How this happened, we know from the Gospel. First, they gave Him gall; He received it, tasted it, and spat it out. Thereafter, as He hung on the cross, that all that was foretold might be fulfilled, He said, \"I thirst.\" They took a sponge filled with vinegar, bound it to a reed, and put it to His mouth; He received it, and said, \"It is finished.\" What did that mean? All things which were prophesied before my death are completed, then what do I here any longer? In a word, when He said \"It is finished, He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost.\" Did the thieves, who were nailed beside Him, expire when they would? They were held by the bonds of flesh, for they were not the creators of the flesh; fixed by nails, they were a long time tormented, because they had not lordship over their weakness. The Lord, however, when He would, took flesh in a virgin's womb: came forth to men when He would; lived among men so long as He would; and when He would He quilted the flesh. This is the part of power, not of necessity. This hour, then, He awaited; not the fated, but the fitting and voluntary hour; that all might first be fulfilled which behoved to be fulfilled before His decease. How could he have been under necessity of fate, when He said in another place, \"I have power to lay down my life, and I have power lo take it again: no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself and take it again?\"[fn-16-P1620_1033518:6-nf] He showed this power when the Jews sought Him. \"Whom seek ye?\" saith He. \"Jesus,\" said they.

Clearly it was God born of the flesh, God seen in bodily form: who was openly received up in glory just as He was openly manifested in the flesh. This then is the great mystery, of which he says: \"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.\" Who then were the two in one flesh? God and the soul, for in the one flesh of man which is joined to God are present God and the soul, as the Lord Himself says: \"No man can take My life (anima) away from Me. But I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-72-P7260_2654627:41-nf] You see then in this, three; viz., God, the flesh, and the soul.

And therefore he expressly says in the case of the father \"a man shall leave his father,\" butin the case of the mother he does not say \"his,\" but simply says \"mother:\" because she was not so much his mother, as the mother of all believers, i.e., of all of us. And He was joined to his wife, for just as man and wife make but one body, so the glory of Divinity and the flesh of man are united and the two, viz., God and the soul, become one flesh. For just as that flesh had God as an indweller in it, so also had it the soul within it dwelling with God. This then is that great mystery, to search out which our admiration for the Apostle summons us, and God's own exhortation bids us: and it is one not foreign to Christ and His Church, as he says, \"But I am speaking of Christ and the Church.\" Because the flesh of the Church is the flesh of Christ, and in the flesh of Christ there is present God and the soul: and so the same person is present in Christ as in the Church, because the mystery which we believe in the flesh of Christ, is contained also by faith in the Church.","title":"Book V.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":10,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_66_tome_or_synodal_letter_to_the_people_of_antioch","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"These things then being thus confessed, we exhort you not hastily to condemn those who so confess, and so explain the phrases they use, nor to reject them, but rather to accept them as they desire peace and defend themselves, while you check and rebuke, as of suspicious views, those who refuse so to confess and to explain their language.

Let me then speak of it, since it is necessary, and let me put an end to my hesitation. In truth the most difficult of sciences is to know one's self. Not only our eye, from which nothing outside us escapes, cannot see itself; but our mind, so piercing to discover the sins of others, is slow to recognise its own faults.[fn-25-P2530_852196:34-nf] Thus my speech, after eagerly investigating what is external to myself, is slow and hesitating in exploring my own nature.

Where is the Jew who resisted the truth and pretended that God was speaking to Himself? It is He who spoke, it is said, and it is He who made. \"Let there be light and there was light.\" But then their words contain a manifest absurdity. Where is the smith, the carpenter, the shoemaker, who, without help and alone before the instruments of his trade, would say to himself; let us make the sword, let us put together the plough, let us make the boot? Does he not perform the work of his craft in silence? Strange folly, to say that any one has seated himself to command himself, to watch over himself, to constrain himself, to hurry himself, with the tones of a master! But the unhappy creatures are not afraid to calumniate the Lord Himself. What will they not say with a tongue so well practised in lying? Here, however, words stop their mouth; \"And God said let us make man.\" Tell me; is there then only one Person? It isnot written \"Let man be made,\" but, \"Let us make man.\" The preaching of theology remains enveloped in shadow before the appearance of him who was to be instructed, but, now, the creation of man is expected, that faith unveils herself and the dogma of truth appears in all its light. \"Let us make \"O enemy of Christ, man.Oy ofhear God speaking to His Co-operator, to Him by Whom also He made the worlds, Who upholds all things by the word of His power.[fn-25-P2534_854563:38-nf] But He does not leave the voice of true religion without answer. Thus the Jews, race hostile to truth, when they find themselves pressed, act like beasts enraged against man, who roar at the bars of their cage and show the cruelty and the ferocity of their nature, without being able to assuage their fury. God, they say, addresses Himself to several persons; it is to the angels before Him that He says, \"Let us make man.\" Jewish fiction! a fable whose frivolity shows whence it has come. To reject one person, they admit many. To reject the Son, they raise servants to the dignity of counsellors; they make of our fellow slaves the agents in our creation. The perfect man attains the dignity of an angel; but what creature can be like the Creator? Listen to the continuation. \"In our image.\" What have you to reply? Is there one image of God and the angels?

After having enlightened the Jew, it dissipates the error of the Gentiles in putting itself under the shelter of unity, to make you understand that the Son is with the Father, and guarding you from the danger of polytheism. He created him in the image of God. God still shows us His co-operator, because He does not say, in His image, but in the image of God.","title":"Homily IX.-The Creation of Terrestrial Animals.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":10,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_69_to_the_bishops_of_africa","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Such was the corrupt mind of the Arians.

Therefore it is a mystery, a sacrament, a prophecy, a figure; let us therefore understand it. For consider the manner of the struggle too. While he wrestleth, Jacob prevailed against the Angel.

And said to Him, \"I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.\"[fn-58-P5882_2492696:16-nf] When the conqueror was blessed by the Conquered, Christ was figured. So then that Angel, who is understood to be the Lord Jesus, saith to Jacob, \"Thou shall not be any more called Jacob, but Israel shall thy name be,\"[fn-58-P5883_2492935:17-nf] which is by interpretation,\" Seeing God.\" After this He touched the sinew of his thigh, the broad part, that is, of the thigh, and it dried up; and Jacob became lame. Such was He who was conquered. So great power had this Conquered One, as to touch the thigh, and make lame. It was then with His Own will that He was conquered. For He \"had power to lay down\" His strength, \"and He had power to take It up.\"[fn-58-P5884_2493362:18-nf] He is not angry at being conquered, for He is not angry at being crucified. For He even blessed him, saying, \"Thou shall not be called Jacob, but Israel.\" Then the\" supplanter\" was made \"the seer of God.\" And He touched, as I have said, his thigh, and made him lame. Observe in Jacob the people of the Jews, those thousands who followed and went before the Lord's beast, who in concert with the Apostles worshipped the Lord, and cried out, \"Hosanna to the Son of David, Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord.\"[fn-58-P5885_2493901:19-nf] Behold Jacob blessed.

The wicked one is like a lion that sought to steal upon the flock of the good shepherd; and when the shepherd saw this, he dug a huge pit, and took one kid out of the flock and cast it into the pit. Then the lion, hungering to get at it, and bursting with passion to devour it, ran up to the pit and fell in, and discovered no strength sufficient to bring him out again. And thereupon the shepherd seized him and shut him up carefully in a den, and at the same time secured the safety of the kid which had been with him in the pit. And it is in this way that the wicked one has been enfeebled,-the lion, so to speak, possessing no more capacity for doing aught injurious; and so all the race of souls will be saved, and what once perished will yet be restored to its proper flock. Archelaus said: If you compare the wicked one to the lion, and God to the true shepherd, tell us, whereunto shall we liken the sheep and the kid? Manes said: The sheep and the kid seem to me to be of one nature: and they are taken as figures of souls. Archelaus said: Well, then, God gave a soul over to perdition when He set it before the lion in the pit. Manes said: By no means; far from it. But He was moved by a particular disposition,[fn-34-P3468_938917:206-nf] and in the future He will save that other, the soul. Archelaus said: Now, surely it would be an absurd procedure, my hearers, if a shepherd who dreaded the inroad of a lion were to expose to the beast's devouring fury a lamb that he was wont to carry in his bosom, and if it were then to be said that he meant to save the creature hereafter. Is not this something supremely ridiculous? Yea, there is no kind of sense in this. For an the supposition implied in your similitude God thus handed over to Satan a soul that he might seize and ruin. But when did the shepherd ever do anything like that?[fn-34-P3469_939711:207-nf] Did not David deliver a sheep out of the mouth of a lion or of a bear? And we mention this on account of the expression, out of the mouth of the lion; for, on your theory, this would imply that the shepherd can bring forth out of the mouth of the lion, or out of the belly of the same, the very object which it has devoured.[fn-34-P3470_940190:208-nf] But you will perhaps make this answer, that it is of God we speak, and that He is able to do all things. Hear, however, what I have to say to that: Why then do you not rather assert His real capacity, and affirm simply His ability to overcome the lion in His own might, or with the pure power of God, and without the help of any sort of cunning devices, or by consigning a kid or a lamb to a pit?[fn-34-P3471_940715:209-nf] Tell me this, too, if the lion were to be supposed to come upon the shepherd at a time when he has no sheep, what would the consequence be? For he who is here called the shepherd is supposed to be unbegotten, and he who is here the lion is also unbegotten. Wherefore, when man did not yet exist-in other words, before the shepherd had a flock-if the lion had then come upon the shepherd, what would have followed, seeing that there could have been nothing for the lion to eat before the kid was in existence? Manes said: The lion certainly had nothing to devour, but yet he exercised his wickedness on whatever he was able to light upon as he coursed over the peaks of the mountains; and if at any time food was a matter of necessity with him, he seized some of the beasts which were under his own kingdom. Archelaus said: Are these two objects, then, of one substance-the beasts which are under the kingdom of the wicked one, and the kids which are in the kingdom of the good God?[fn-34-P3472_941969:210-nf] Manes said: Far from it; not at all: they have nothing in common either between themselves or between the properties which pertain to them severally. Archelaus said: There is but one and the same use made of the food in the lion'seating. And though he sometimes got that food from the beasts belonging to himself, and sometimes from those belonging to the good God, there is still no difference between them as far as regards the meats furnished; and from this it is apparent that those are of but one substance. On the other hand, if we say that there is a great difference between the two, we do but ascribe ignorance to the shepherd,[fn-34-P3473_942720:211-nf] in so far as he did not present or set before the lion food adapted to his use, but rather alien meats. Or perchance again, in your desire to dissemble your real position, you will say to me that lion ate nothing. Well, supposing that to be the case, did God then in this way challenge that being to devour a soul while he knew not how to devour aught? and was the pit not the only thing which God sought to employ with the view of cheating him?-if indeed it is at all worthy of God to do that sort of thing, or to contrive deceitful schemes. And that would be to act like a king who, when war is made upon him, puts no kind of confidence in his own strength, but gets paralyzed with the fears of his own feebleness, and shuts himself up within the walls of his city, and erects around him a rampart and other fortifications, and gets them all equipped, and trusts nothing to his own hand and prowess; whereas, if he is a brave man, the king so placed will march a great distance from his own territories to meet the enemy there, and will put forth every possible exertion until he conquers and brings his adversary into his power.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":10,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_204_sermon_lxiii_on_the_passion_xii_preached_on_wednesday_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"All therefore that the Son of God did and taught for the world's reconciliation, we not only know as a matter of past history, but appreciate in the power of its present effect.

Nor do we say that the blessed Virgin Mary conceived a Man without Godhead, Who was created by the Holy Ghost and afterwards assumed by the Word, which we deservedly and properly condemned Nestorius for preaching: but we call Christ the Son of God, true God, born of God the Father without any beginning in time, and likewise true Man, born of a human Mother, at the ordained fulness of time, and we say that His Manhood, whereby the Father is the greater, does not in anything lessen that nature whereby He is equal with the Father. But these two natures form one Christ, Who has said most truly both according to His Godhead: \"I and the Father are one[fn-14-P1485_365455:15-nf] ,\" and according to His manhood \"the Father is greater than I[fn-14-P1486_365548:16-nf] .\" This true and indestructible Faith, dearly-beloved, which alone makes us true Christians, and which, as we hear with approval, you are defending with loyal zeal and praiseworthy affection, hold fast and maintain boldly.
