In the second place, that the sacred images themselves, to which most senseless men do service, are destitute of all perception, since they are earth. But who cannot understand that it is unlawful for an upright animal to bend itself that it may adore the earth? which is placed beneath our feet for this purpose, that it may be trodden. upon, and not adored by us, who have been raised from it, and have received an elevated position beyond the other living creatures, that we may not turn ourselves again downward, nor cast this heavenly countenance to the earth, but may direct our eyes to that quarter to which the condition of their nature has directed, and that we may adore and worship nothing except the single deity of our only Creator and Father, who made man of an erect figure, that we may know that we are called forth to high and heavenly things. In the third place, because the spirits which preside over the religious rites themselves, being condemned and cast off by God, wallow[fn-8-P804_321665:243-nf] over the earth, who not only are unable to afford any advantage to their worshippers, since the power of all things is in the hands of one alone, but even destroy them with deadly attractions and errors; since this is their daily business, to involve men in darkness, that the true God may not be sought by them. Therefore they are not to be worshipped, because they lie under the sentence of God. For it is a very great crime to devote[fn-8-P805_322126:244-nf] one's self to the power of those whom, if you follow righteousness, you are able to excel in power, and to drive out and put to flight by adjuration of the divine name. But if it appears that these religious rites are vain in so many ways as I have shown, it is manifest that those who either make prayers to the dead,[fn-8-P806_322595:245-nf] or venerate the earth, or make over[fn-8-P807_322659:246-nf] their souls to unclean spirits, do not act as becomes men, and that they will suffer punishment for their impiety and guilt, who, rebelling against God, the Father of the human race, have undertaken inexpiable rites, and violated every sacred law.","title":"Book II.

All the paternal marks are here, and there are not any more. For if any one, he says, of those (beings) which are here will have strength to perceive that he is a paternal mark transferred hither from above, (and that he is) incarnate-just as by the conception resulting from the rod a something white is produced,-he is of the same substance altogether with the Father in heaven, and returns thither.

In like manner, then, let him understand the incarnation and nativity of the Virgin, wherein the Son is understood as sent, to have been wrought by one and the same operation of the Father and of the Son indivisibly; the Holy Spirit certainly not being thence excluded, of whom it is expressly said, \"She was found with child by the Holy Ghost.\" For perhaps our meaning will be more plainly unfolded, if we ask in what manner God sent His Son. He commanded that He should come, and He, complying with the commandment, came. Did He then request, or did He only suggest? But whichever of these it was, certainly it was done by a word, and the Word of God is the Son of God Himself. Wherefore, since the Father sent Him by a word, His being sent was the work of both the Father and His Word; therefore the same Son was sent by the Father and the Son, because the Son Himself is the Word of the Father. For who would embrace so impious an opinion as to think the Father to have uttered a word in time, in order thatthe eternal Son might thereby be sent and might appear in the flesh in the fullness oftime? But assuredly it was in that Word of God itself which was in the beginning with God and was God, namely, in the wisdom itself of God, apart from time, at what time that wisdom must needs appear in the flesh. Therefore, since without any commencement of time, the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, it was in the Word itself without any time, at what time the Word was to be made flesh and dwell among us.[fn-4-P486_174743:32-nf] And when this fullness of time had come, \"God sent His Son, made of a woman,\"[fn-4-P487_174844:33-nf] that is, made in time, that the Incarnate Word might appear to men; while it was in that Word Himself, apart from time, at what time this was to be done; for the order of times is in the eternal wisdom of God without time. Since, then, that the Son should appear in the flesh was wrought by both the Father and the Son, it is fitly said that He who appeared in that flesh was sent, and that He who did not appear in it, sent Him; because those things which are transacted outwardly before the bodily eyes have their existence from the inward structure (apparatu) of the spiritual nature, and on that account are filly said to be sent. Further, that form of man which He took is the person of the Son, not also of the Father; on which account the invisible Father, together with the Son, who with the Father is invisible, is said to have sent the same Son by making Him visible. But if He became visible in such way as to cease to be invisible with the Father, that is, if the substance of the invisible Word were turned by a change and transition into a visible creature, then the Son would be so understood to be sent by the Father, that He would be found to be only sent; not also, with the Father, sending. But since He so took the form of a servant, as that the unchangeable form of God remained, it is clear that that which became apparent in the Son was done by the Father and the Son not being apparent; that is, that by the invisible Father, with the invisible Son, the same Son Himself was sent so as to be visible. Why, therefore, does He say, \"Neither came I of myself?\" This, we may now say, is said according to the form of a servant, in the same way as it is said, \"I judge no man.\"[fn-4-P488_176558:34-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":47,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_08_concerning_two_souls_against_the_manichaeans_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"They might have cited against me those words of the gospel: \"Ye therefore do not hear, because ye are not of God;\" \"Ye are of your father the devil.\"[fn-7-P760_386713:10-nf] I also should have cited: \"All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made,\"[fn-7-P761_386835:11-nf] and this of the Apostle: \"One God of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things,\"[fn-7-P762_386966:12-nf] and again from the same Apostle: \"Of whom are all things, through whom are all things, in whom are all things, to Him be glory.\"[fn-7-P763_387116:13-nf] I should have exhorted those men (if indeed I had found them men), that we should presume upon nothing as if we had found it out, but should rather inquire of the masters who would demonstrate the agreement and harmony of those passages that seem to be discordant. For when in one and the same Scriptural authority we read: \"All things are of God,\"[fn-7-P764_387483:14-nf] and elsewhere: \"Ye are not of God,\" since it is wrong rashly to condemn books of Scripture, who would not have seen that a skilled teacher should be found who would know a solution of this problem, from whom assuredly if endowed with good intellectual powers, and a \"spiritual man,\" as is said by divine inspiration[fn-7-P765_387819:15-nf] (for he would necessarily have favored the true arguments concerning the intelligible and sensible nature, which, as far as I can, I have conducted and handled, nay he would have disclosed them far better and more convincingly); we should have heard nothing else concerning this problem, except, as might happen, that there is no class of souls but has its existence from God, and that it is yet rightly said to sinners and unbelievers: \"Ye are not of God.\" For we also, perchance, Divine aid having been implored, should have been able easily to see, that it is one thing to live and another to sin, and (although life in sin may be called death in comparison with just life,[fn-7-P766_388516:16-nf] and while in one man it may be found, that he is at the same time alive and a sinner) that so far as he is alive, he is of God, so far as he is a sinner he is not of God. In which division we use that alternative that suits our sentiment; so that when we wish to insist upon the omnipotence of God as Creator, we may say even to sinners that they are of God. For we are speaking to those who are contained in some class, we are speaking to those having animal life, we are speaking to rational beings, we are speaking lastly-and this applies especially to the matter in hand-to living beings, all which things are essentially divine functions. But when our purpose is to convict evil men, we rightly say: \"Ye are not of God.\" For we speak to them as averse to truth, unbelieving, criminal, infamous, and, to sum up all in one term-sinners, all of which things are undoubtedly not of God. Therefore what wonder is it, if Christ says to sinners, convicting them of this very thing that they were sinners and did not believe in Him: \"Ye are not of God;\" and on the other hand, without prejudice to the former statement: \"All things were made through Him,\" and \"All things are of God?\" For if not to believe Christ, to repudiate Christ's advent, not to accept Christ, was a sure mark of souls that are not of God; and so it was said: \"Ye therefore hear not, because ye are not of God;\" how would that saying of the apostle be true that occurs in the memorable beginning of the gospel: \"He came unto his own things, and his own people did not receive him?\"[fn-7-P767_390086:17-nf] Whence his own if they did not receive him; or whence therefore not his own because they did not receive him, unless that sinners by virtue of being men belong to God, but by virtue of being sinners belong to the devil?

I am aware that a talebearer-a class of persons who do a great deal of harm-once told her as a kindness that owing to her great fervour in virtue some people thought her mad and declared that something should be done for her head.

Down to the very day of her death two things were conspicuous in her life, one her great patience and the other the jealousy which was manifested towards her.

For to worship one God is also enjoined upon us. \"Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain\" is also enjoined upon us, which is the second commandment. \"Observe the Sabbath-day\" is enjoined on us more than on them, because it is commanded to be spiritually observed. For the Jews observe the Sabbath in a servile manner, using it for luxuriousness and drunkenness. How much better would their women be employed in spinning wool than in dancing on that day in the balconies? God forbid, brethren, that we should call that an observance of the Sabbath. The Christian observes the Sabbath spiritually, abstaining from servile work. For what is it to abstain from servilework? From sin. And how do we prove it? Ask the Lord. \"Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.\"[fn-3-P335_89940:24-nf] Therefore is the spiritual observance of the Sabbath enjoined upon us. Now all those commandments are more enjoined on us, and are to be observed: \"Thou shall not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not bear false witness.

Since, then, we were not fit to take hold of things eternal, and since the foulness of sins weighed us down, which we had contracted by the love of temporal things, and which were implanted in us as it were naturally, from the root of mortality, it was needful that we should be cleansed. But cleansed we could not be, so as to be tempered together with things eternal, except it were through things temporal, wherewith we were already tempered together and held fast. For health is at the opposite extreme from disease; but the intermediate process of healing does not lead us to perfect health, unless it has some congruity with the disease. Things temporal that are useless merely deceive the sick; things temporal that are useful take up those that need healing, and pass them on healed, to things eternal. And the rational mind, as when cleansed it owes contemplation to things eternal; so, when needing cleansing, owes faith to things temporal. One even of those who were formerly esteemed wise men among the Greeks has said, The truth stands to faith in the same relation in which eternity stands to that which has a beginning. And he is no doubt right in saying so. For what we call temporal, he describes as having had a beginning. And we also ourselves come under this kind, not only in respect to the body, but also in respect to the changeableness of the soul. For that is not properly called eternal which undergoes any degree of change. Therefore, in so far as we are changeable, in so far we stand apart from eternity. But life eternal is promised to us through the truth, from the clear knowledge of which, again, our faith stands as far apart as mortality does from eternity. We then now put faith in things done in time on our account, and by that faith itself we are cleansed; in order that when we have come to sight, as truth follows faith, so eternity may follow upon mortality. And therefore, since our faith will become truth, when we have attained to that which is promised to us who believe: and that which is promised us is eternal life; and the Truth (not that which shall come to be according as our faith shall be, but that truth which is always, because in it is eternity,-the Truth then) has said, \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent:\"[fn-9-P956_372179:91-nf] when our faith by seeing shall come to be truth, then eternity shall possess our now changed mortality. And until this shall take place, and in order that it may take place,-because we adapt the faith of belief to things which have a beginning, as in things eternal we hope for the truth of contemplation, lest the faith of mortal life should be at discord with the truth of eternal life,-the Truth itself, co-eternal with the Father, took a beginning from earth,[fn-9-P957_372662:92-nf] when the Son of God so came as to become the Son of man, and to take to Himself our faith, that He might thereby lead us on to His own truth, who so undertook our mortality, as not to lose His own eternity. For truth stands to faith in the relation in which eternity stands to that which has a beginning. Therefore, we must needs so be cleansed, that we may come to have such a beginning as remains eternal, that we may not have one. beginning in faith, and another in truth. Neither could we pass to things eternal from the condition of having a beginning, unless we were transferred, by union of the eternal to ourselves through our own beginning, to His own eternity. Therefore our faith has, in some measure, now followed thither, whither He in whom we have believed has ascended; born,[fn-9-P958_373473:93-nf] dead, risen again, taken up. Of these four things, we knew the first two in ourselves. For we know that men both have a beginning and die. But the remaining two, that is, to be raised, and to be taken up, we rightly hope will be in us, because we have believed them done in Him. Since, therefore, in Him that, too, which had a beginning has passed over to eternity, in ourselves also it will so pass over, when faith shall have arrived at truth. For to those who thus believe, in order that they might remain in the word of faith, and being thence led on to the truth, and through that to eternity, might be freed from death, He speaks thus: \"If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed.\" And as though they would ask, With what fruit? He proceeds to say, \"And ye shall know the truth.\" And again, as though they would say, Of what good is truth to mortal men? \"And the truth,\" He says, \"shall make you free.\"[fn-9-P959_374411:94-nf] From what, except from death, from corruptions from changeableness?

For He intended to show Himself to be the Creator when He said that He was the Beginning, as the Father also is the beginning of the creature in that all things are from Him.

And so when we say, both that the Father is the Beginning, and that the Son is the Beginning, we do not speak of two beginnings of the creature; since both the Father and the Son together is one beginning in respect to the creature, as one Creator, as one God. But if whatever remains within itself and produces or Works anything is a beginning to that thing which it produces or works; then we cannot deny that the Holy Spirit also is rightly called the Beginning, since we do not separate Him from the appellation of Creator: and it is written of Him that He works; and assuredly, in working, He remains within Himself; for He Himself is not changed and turned into any of the things which He works. And see what it is that He works: \"But the manifestation of the Spirit,\" he says, \"is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will;\" certainly as God-for who can work such great things but God?-but \"it is the same God which worketh all in all.\"[fn-10-P1080_436775:28-nf] For if we are asked point by point concerning the Holy Spirit, we answer most truly that He is God; and with the Father and the Son together He is one God.

Such are their proceedings: and yet instead of blushing at their former clumsy intrigues against us, they even now abuse us for having effected our escape out of their murderous hands; nay, are grievously vexed that they were unable to put us out of the way altogether. In short, they overlook the fact that while they pretend to upbraid us with `cowardice,' they are really criminating themselves: for if it be disgraceful to flee, it is still more so to pursue, since the one is only endeavoring to avoid being murdered, while the other is seeking to commit the deed.

Nevertheless they set no bounds to their malevolence, using every art to entrap us, in the consciousness that the flight of the persecuted is the strongest condemnation of the persecutor: for no one runs away from a mild and beneficent person, but from one who is of a barbarous and cruel disposition.

In short, they overlook the fact that while they pretend to upbraid us with `cowardice,' they are really criminating themselves: for if it be disgraceful to flee, it is still more so to pursue, since the one is only endeavoring to avoid being murdered, while the other is seeking to commit the deed.

They should rather, therefore, be ashamed of their persecution, than reproach us for having sought to escape from it: let them cease to harass, and those who flee will also cease. Nevertheless they set no bounds to their malevolence, using every art to entrap us, in the consciousness that the flight of the persecuted is the strongest condemnation of the persecutor: for no one runs away from a mild and beneficent person, but from one who is of a barbarous and cruel disposition.

And he uses this language while glorifying himself that he is at war at once with Arius and Eunomius and the rest of the heresiarchs. Let then this exact professor of theology tells us how he would confute the blasphemy of the heretics, while applying to God the Word what is uttered humbly and appropriately by the form of the servant. They indeed while thus doing lay down that the Son of God is inferior, a creature, made, and a servant. To whom then are we, holding as we do the opposite opinion to theirs, and confessing the Son to be of one substance and co-eternal with God the Father, Creator of the Universe, Maker, Beautifier, Ruler, and Governor, All-wise, Almighty, or rather Himself, Power, Life and Wisdom, to refer the words \"My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me;\"[fn-8-P877_149828:186-nf] or \"Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me;\"[fn-8-P878_149909:187-nf] or \"Father save me from this hour;\"[fn-8-P879_149968:188-nf] or \"That hour no man knoweth, not even the Son of Man;\"[fn-8-P880_150045:189-nf] and all the other passages spoken and written in lowliness by Him and by the holy apostles about Him? To whom shall we apply the weariness and the sleep? To whom the ignorance and the fear? Who was it who stood in need of angelic succour? If these belong to God the Word, how was wisdom ignorant? How could it be called wisdom when affected by the sense of ignorance? How could He speak the truth in saying that He had all that the Father hath,[fn-8-P881_150595:190-nf] when not having the knowledge of the Father? For He says, \"The Father alone knoweth that day.\"[fn-8-P882_150711:191-nf] How could He be the unchanged image of Him that begat Him if He has not all that the Begetter hath? If then He speaks the truth when saying that He is ignorant, any one might suppose this of Him. But if He knoweth the day, but says that He is ignorant with the wish to hide it, you see in what a blasphemy the conclusion issues. For the truth lies and could not properly be called truth if it has any quality opposed to truth. But if the truth does not lie, neither is God the Word ignorant of the day which He Himself made, and which He Himself fixed, wherein He purposes to judge the world, but has the knowledge of the Father as being unchanged image. Not then to God the Word does the ignorance belong, but to the form of the servant who at that time knew as much as the indwelling Godhead revealed. The same position may be maintained about other similar cases. How for instance could it be reasonable for God the Word to say to the Father, \"Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me, nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt\"?[fn-8-P883_151779:192-nf] The absurdities which necessarily thence follow are not a few. First it follows that the Father and the Son are not of the same mind, and that the Father wishes one thing and the Son another, for He said, \"Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt.\" Secondly we shall have to contemplate great ignorance in the Son, for He will be found ignorant whether the cup can or cannot pass from Him; but to say this of God the Word is utter impiety and blasphemy. For exactly did He know the end of the mystery of the oeconomy Who for this very reason came among us, Who of His own accord took our nature, Who emptied Himself. For this cause too He foretold to the Holy Apostles, \"Behold we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be betrayed ...into the hands of the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and the third day He shall rise again.\"[fn-8-P884_152658:193-nf] How then can He Who foretold these things, and, when Peter deprecated their coming to pass, rebuked him, Himself deprecate their coming to pass, when He clearly knows all that is to be? Is it not absurd that Abraham many generations ago should have seen His day and have been glad,[fn-8-P885_152975:194-nf] and that Isaiah in like manner, and Jeremiah, and Daniel, and Zechariah, and all the fellowship of the prophets, should have foretold His saving passion, and He Himself be ignorant, and beg release from and deprecate it, though it was destined to come to pass for the salvation of the world? Therefore these words are not the words of God the Word, but of the form of the servant, afraid of death because death was not yet destroyed.[fn-8-P886_153431:195-nf] Surely God the Word permitted the utterance of these expressions allowing room for fear, that the nature of Him that had to be born may be plain, and to prevent our supposing the Son of Abraham and David to be an unreality or appearance. The crew of the impious heretics has given birth to this blasphemy through entertaining these sentiments. We shall therefore apply what is divinely spoken and acted to God the Word; on the other hand what is said and done in humility we shall connect with the form of a servant, lest we be tainted with the blasphemy of Arius and Eunomius.","title":"Counter-Statements of Theodoret.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":8,"verse":40,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_08_counter_statements_of_theodoret_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Against XII.-Passion is proper to the passible; the impassible is above passions.

But it is one question, whether he could exist; and another question, whether he does exist.

He whowas in bondage with the barbarians, has been redeemed by his ransomer; and great difference there is between the ransomer and the ransomed; yet haply are they fellow-slaves under the lordship of iniquity.

Hence it is that the Saviour says to the Jews:[fn-67-P6798_2148808:186-nf] \"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do.\" He quotes the parable of the ten virgins, the wise and the foolish, and shows that the five who had no oil remained outside, but that the other five who had gotten for themselves the light of good works went into the marriage with the bridegroom. He goes back to the flood, and tells us that they who were righteous like Noah were saved, but that the sinners perished all together. We are informed that among the men of Sodom and Gomorrha no difference is made except between the two classes of the good and the bad.

That it is so with the angels of light we piously believe; but that the fallen angels, who by their own default lost that light, did not enjoy this blessedness even before they sinned, reason bids us conclude. Yet if their life was of any duration before they fell, we must allow them a blessedness of some kind, though not that which is accompanied with foresight. Or, if it seems hard to believe that, when the angels were created, some were created in ignorance either of their perseverance or their fail, while others were most certainly assured of the eternity of their felicity,-if it is hard to believe that they were not all from the beginning on an equal footing, until these who are now evil did of their own will fall away from the light of goodness, certainly it is much harder to believe that the holy angels are now uncertain of their eternal blessedness, and do not know regarding themselves as much as we have been able to gather regarding them from the Holy Scriptures. For what catholic Christian does not know that no new devil will ever arise among the good angels, as he knows that this present devil will never again return into the fellowship of the good? For the truth in the gospel promises to the saints and the faithful that they will be equal to the angels of God; and it is also promised them that they will \"go away into life eternal.\"[fn-18-P1853_1060359:30-nf] But if we are certain that we shall never lapse from eternal felicity, while they are not certain, then we shall not be their equals, but their superiors. But as the truth never deceives, and as we shall be their equals, they must be certain of their blessedness. And because the evil angels could not be certain of that, since their blessedness was destined to come to an end, it follows either that the angels were unequal, or that, if equal, the good angels were assured of the eternity of their blessedness after the perdition of the others; unless, possibly, some one may say that the words of the Lord about the devil \"He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth,\"[fn-18-P1854_1061071:31-nf] are to be understood as if he was not only a murderer from the beginning of the human race, when man, whom he could kill by his deceit, was made, but also that he did not abide in the truth from the time of his own creation, and was accordingly never blessed with the holy angels, but refused to submit to his Creator, and proudly exulted as if in a private lordship of his own, and was thus deceived and deceiving. For the dominion of the Almighty cannot be eluded; and he who will not piously submit himself to things as they are, proudly feigns, and mocks himself with a state of things that does not exist; so that what the blessed Apostle John says thus becomes intelligible: \"The devil sinneth from the beginning,\"[fn-18-P1855_1061812:32-nf] -that is, from the time he was created he refused righteousness, which none but a will piously subject to God can enjoy. Whoever adopts this opinion at least disagrees with those heretics the Manichees, and with any other pestilential sect that may suppose that the devil has derived from some adverse evil principle a nature proper to himself. These persons are so befooled by error, that, although they acknowledge with ourselves the authority of the gospels, they do not notice that the Lord did not say, \"The devil was naturally a stranger to the truth,\" but \"The devil abode not in the truth,\" by which He meant us to understand that he had fallen from the truth, in which, if he had abode, he would have become a partaker of it, and have remained in blessedness along with the holy angels.[fn-18-P1856_1062628:33-nf] ","title":"Book XI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_17_book_xi","source_chapter":34,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But if some one oppose our opinion, and say that the holy angels are not referred to when it is said, \"Let there be light, and there was light;\" if he suppose or teach that some material light, then first created, was meant, and that the angels were created, not only before the firmament dividing the waters and named \"the heaven,\" but also before the time signified in the words, \"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth;\" if he allege that this phrase, \"In the beginning,\" does not mean that nothing was made before (for the angels were), but that God made all things by His Wisdom or Word, who is named in Scripture \"the Beginning,\" as He Himself, in the gospel, replied to the Jews when they asked Him who He was, that He was the Beginning;[fn-19-P1949_1115378:67-nf] -I will not contest the point, chiefly because it gives me the liveliest satisfaction to find the Trinity celebrated in the very beginning of the book of Genesis.

The course of the Divine narrative is accompanied by a progressive development of doctrine. In the passage which we have discussed God speaks to Abraham. and promises that Sarah shall bear a son. Afterwards three men stand by him; he worships One and acknowledges Him as Lord. After this worship and acknowledgment by Abraham, the One promises that He will return hereafter at the same season, and that then Sarah shall have her son. This One again is seen by Abraham in the guise of a man, and salutes him with the same promise. The change is one of name only; Abraham's acknowledgment in each case is the same. It was a Man whom he saw, yet Abraham worshipped Him as Lord; he beheld, no doubt, in a mystery the coming Incarnation. Faith so strong has not missed its recognition; the Lord says in the Gospel, Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day; and he saw it, and was glade[fn-12-P1266_769647:58-nf] . To continue the history; the Man Whom he saw promised that He would return at the same season. Mark the fulfilment of the promise, remembering meanwhile that it was a Man Who made it. What says the Scripture? And the Lord visited Sarah. So this Man is the Lord, fulfilling His own promise. What follows next? And God did unto Sarah as He had said. The narrative calls His words those of a Man, relates that Sarah was visited by the Lord, proclaims that the result was the work of God. You are sure that it was a Man who spoke, for Abraham not only heard, but saw Him. Can you be less certain that He was God, when the same Scripture, which had called Him Man, confesses Him God? For its words are, And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, and at the set time of which God had spoken to him. But it was the Man who had promised that He would come. Believe that He was nothing more than man; unless, in fact, He Who came was God and Lord. Connect the incidents. It was, confessedly, the Man who promised that He would come that Sarah might con ceive and bear a son. And now accept instruction, and confess the faith; it was the Lord God Who came that she might conceive and bear. The Man made the promise in the power of God; by the same power God fulfilled the promise. Thus God reveals Himself both in word and deed. Next, two of the three men whom Abraham saw depart; He Who remains behind is Lord and God. And not only Lord and God, but also Judge, for Abraham stood before the Lord and said, In no wise shall Thou do this things, to slay the righteous with the wicked, for then the righteous shall be as the wicked. In no wise wilt Thou Who judgest the whole earth, execute this judgment[fn-12-P1267_771383:59-nf] . Thus by all his words Abraham instructs us in that faith, for which he was justified; he recognises the Lord from among the three, he worships Him only, and confesses that He is Lord and Judge.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":8,"verse":49,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_12_lecture_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"5.

He was like us in all things, in that He took upon Him manhood in its entirety with soul and body, so that our salvation was accomplished by means of both:-He, I say, appeared on earth and \"conversed with men[fn-9-P947_518826:1-nf] ,\" that men might no longer have opinions according to their own notions about the Self-existent, formulating into a doctrine the hints that come to them from vague conjectures, but that we might be convinced that God has truly been manifested in the flesh, and believe that to be the only true \"mystery of godliness[fn-9-P948_519160:2-nf] ,\" which was delivered to us by the very Word and God, Who by Himself spake to His Apostles, and that we might receive the teaching concerning the transcendent nature of the Deity which is given to us, as it were, \"through a glass darkly[fn-9-P949_519415:3-nf] \" from the older Scriptures,-from the Law, and the Prophets, and the Sapiential Books, as an evidence of the truth fully revealed to us, reverently accepting the meaning of the things which have been spoken, so as to accord in the faith set forth by the Lord of the whole Scriptures[fn-9-P950_519718:4-nf] , which faith we guard as we received it, word for word, in purity, without falsification, judging even a slight divergence from the words delivered to us an extreme blasphemy and impiety.

Their object in such a malignant perversion of the true doctrine, is to show that the less exalted statements, which our Lord utters in tits humanity, are to be thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show their blasphemy to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual acknowledgment of the Lord. For this reason it is that Eunomius says, \"He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man made up of soul and body.\" But, after searching through all the inspired and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came \"to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-12-P1204_656584:193-nf] .\" Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster of our nature bad its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was twofold, death correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the deprivation of the twofold life that operates in him who is thus mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body into its kindred elements: but \"the soul that sinneth,\" he saith, \"it shall die[fn-12-P1205_657543:194-nf] .\" Now sin is nothing else than alienation from God, Who is the true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived many hundred years after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, \"In the day that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die[fn-12-P1206_657814:195-nf] .\" For by the fact of his alienation from the true life, the sentence of death was ratified against him that self-same day: and after this, at a much later time, there followed also the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this cause that He might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries home on His shoulders the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may make the man of God complete, united to the deity in body and in soul. And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now the soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the result of being ill-advised: and this He sanctifies by union with Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy along with the first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the destruction of the enemies of the Lord, said, \"They are dead which sought the young Child's life[fn-12-P1207_658887:196-nf] ,\" (or \"soul\"): and the Lord says to the Jews, \"Ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth[fn-12-P1208_659073:197-nf] .\" Now by \"Man\" is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is composed of both, soul and body. And again, He says to them, \"Are ye angry at Me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day[fn-12-P1209_659388:198-nf] ?\" And what He meant by \"every whit whole,\" He showed in the other Gospels, when He said to the man who was let down on a couch in the midst, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee,\" which is a healing of the soul, and, \"Arise and walk[fn-12-P1210_659636:199-nf] ,\" which has regard to the body: and in the Gospel of S. John, by liberating the soul also from its own malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, \"Thou art made whole, sin no more[fn-12-P1211_659932:200-nf] ,\" thou, that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul and in body. For so too does S. Paul speak, \"for to make in Himself of twain one new man[fn-12-P1212_660105:201-nf] .\" And so too He foretells that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul from His body, saying, \"No man taketh\" my soul \"from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again[fn-12-P1213_660370:202-nf] .\" Yea, the prophet David also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with foresight of Him, \"Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption[fn-12-P1214_660678:203-nf] ,\" while the Apostle Peter thus expounds the saying, that \"His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption.\" For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh and in the flesh and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at all times what It was by nature, and so continuing for ever. But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter said, \"This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ[fn-12-P1215_661720:204-nf] ;\" and we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them through His body. But it would be superfluous to encumber our argument by entering into every detail.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":8,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_19_book_xi_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"10.

If it is by the necessity of nature, he is blameless; if by the freedom of choice, then the question arises, from whom he has received this freedom of choice. No doubt, from God. Well, but that which God bestows is certainly good. This cannot be gainsaid. On what principle, then, is a thing proved to be good, if it is more prone to evil than to good? For it is more prone to evil than to good if by means of it man can be with sin and cannot be without sin.\" The answer is this: It came by the freedom of choice that man was with sin; but a penal corruption closely followed thereon, and out of the liberty produced necessity. Hence the cry of faith to God, \"Lead Thou me out of my necessities.\"[fn-24-P2445_994561:19-nf] With these necessities upon us, we are either unable to understand what we want, or else (while having the wish) we are not strong enough to accomplish what we have come to understand.

Hence another scripture says, \"For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.\"[fn-24-P2447_995121:21-nf] Since therefore \"the whole need not the physician, but only they that be sick;\"[fn-24-P2448_995221:22-nf] so likewise it is not the free that need the Deliverer, but only the enslaved.

But because the will has sinned, the hard necessity of having sin has pursued the sinner; until his infirmity be wholly healed, and such freedom be regained, that there must needs be, on the one hand, a permanent will to live happily, and, on the other hand, a voluntary and happy necessity of living virtuously, and never sinning.","title":"Concerning Man's Perfection in Righteousness","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_107_sermon_xc_cxl_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1.

They are blankly ignorant who separate the Divine name from the Divine nature; ignorant, and content to be ignorant. But let them listen to the reproof which the Son inflicts upon unbelievers for their want of this knowledge, when the Jews said that God was their Father:-If God were your Father, ye would surely love Me; for I went forth from God, and am come; neither am I come of Myself, but He sent Me[fn-14-P1449_915342:31-nf] . The Son of God has here no word of blame for the devout confidence of those who combine the confession that He is true God, the Son of God, with their own claim to be God's sons. What He is blaming is the insolence of the Jews in daring to claim God as their Father, when meanwhile they did not love Him, the Son:-If God were your Father, ye would surely love Me; for I went forth from God. All, who have God for their Father through faith, have Him for Father through that same faith whereby we confess that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. But to confess that He is the Son in a sense which covers the whole company of saints; to say, in effect, that He is one of the sons of God;-what faith is there in that? Are not all the rest, feeble created beings though they be, in that sense sons? In what does the eminence of a faith, which has confessed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, consist, if He, as one of a multitude of sons, have the name only, and not the nature, of the Son? This unbelief has no love for Christ; it is a mockery of the faith for these perverters of the truth to claim God as their Father. If He were their Father, they would love Christ because He had gone forth from God. And now I must enquire the meaning of this going forth from God. His going forth is obviously different from His coming, for the two are mentioned side by side in this passage, I went forth from God and am come. In order to elucidate the separate meanings of I went forth from God and I am come, He immediately subjoins, Neither am I come of Myself, but He sent Me. He tells us that He is not the source of His own existence in the words, Neither am I come of Myself. In them He tells us that He has proceeded forth a second time from God[fn-14-P1450_917107:32-nf] , and has been sent by Him. But when He tells us that they who call God their Father must love Himself because He has gone forth from God, He makes His birth the reason for their love. Went forth carries back our thoughts to the incorporeal birth, for it is by love of Christ, Who was born from Him, that we must gain the right of devoutly claiming God for our Father. For when the Son says, He that hateth Me hateth My Father also[fn-14-P1451_917569:33-nf] , this My is the assertion of a relation to the Father which is shared by none. On the other hand, He condemns the man who claims God as his Father, and loves not the Son, as using a wrongful liberty with the Father's name; since he who hates Him, the Son, must hate the Father also, and none can be devoted to the Father save those who love the Son. For the one and only reason which He gives for loving the Son is His origin from the Father. The Son, therefore, is from the Father, not by His Advent, but by His birth[fn-14-P1452_918111:34-nf] ; and love for the Father is only possible to those who believe that the Son is from Him.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":8,"verse":56,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_13_book_i_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"4.

He does nothing of Himself, because the Father abides in Him; can you reconcile with this the fact that the Father does not leave Him, because He does the things which are pleasing to Him? Your interpretation, heretic, sets up a contradiction between these two statements, that He does nothing of Himself, unless taught of the Father abiding in Him, and that the Father abides in Him, because He does always the things which are pleasing to Him. For if the Father's abiding in Him means that He does nothing of Himself, how could He have deserved that the Father should abide in Him, by doing always the things which are pleasing to the Father. It is no merit, not to do of oneself what one does. Conversely, how are the Son's deeds pleasing to the Father, if the Father Himself, abiding in the Son, be their Author? Impiety, thou art in a sore strait; the well-armed piety of the faith hath hemmed thee in. The Son is either an Agent, or He is not. If He is not an Agent, how does He please by his acts?

Again I say, God forbid. For it was by the evil use of his free-will that man destroyed both it and himself. For, as a man who kills himself must, of course, be alive when he kills himself, but after he has killed himself ceases to live, and cannot restore himself to life; so, when man by his own free-will sinned, then sin being victorious over him, the freedom of his will was lost. \"For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.\"[fn-23-P2317_1148791:38-nf] This is the judgment of the Apostle Peter.

Hence not even the nature of the devil himself is evil, in so far as it is nature, but it was made evil by being perverted. Thus he did not abide in the truth,[fn-36-P3684_2022793:24-nf] but could not escape the judgment of the Truth; he did not abide in the tranquillity of order, but did not therefore escape the power of the Ordainer. The good imparted by God to his nature did not screen him from the justice of God by which order was preserved in his punishment; neither did God punish the good which He had created, but the evil which the devil had committed. God did not take back all He had imparted to his nature, but something He took and something He left, that there might remain enough to be sensible of the loss of what was taken. And this very sensibility to pain is evidence of the good which has been taken away and the good which has been left. For, were nothing good left, there could be no pain on account of the good which had been lost. For he who sins is still worse if he rejoices in his loss of righteousness. But he who is in pain, if he derives no benefit from it, mourns at least the loss of health. And as righteousness and health are both good things, and as the loss of any good thing is matter of grief, not of joy,-if, at least, there is no compensation, as spiritual righteousness may compensate for the loss of bodily health,-certainly it is more suitable for a wicked man to grieve in punishment than to rejoice in his fault. As, then, the joy of a sinner who has abandoned what is good is evidence of a bad will, so his grief for the good he has lost when he is punished is evidence of a good nature. For he who laments the peace his nature has lost is stirred to do so by some relics of peace which make his nature friendly to itself. And it is very just that in the final punishment the wicked and godless should in anguish bewail the loss of the natural advantages they enjoyed, and should perceive that they were most justly taken from them by that God whose benign liberality they had despised. God, then, the most wise Creator and most just Ordainer of all natures, who placed the human race upon earth as its greatest ornament, imparted to men some good things adapted to this life, to wit, temporal peace, such as we can enjoy in this life from health and safety and human fellowship, and all things needful for the preservation and recovery of this peace, such as the objects which are accommodated to our outward senses, light, night, the air, and waters suitable for us, and everything the body requires to sustain, shelter, heal, or beautify it: and all under this most equitable condition. that every man who made a good use of these advantages suited to the peace of this mortal condition, should receive ampler and better blessings, namely, the peace of immortality, accompanied by glory and honor in an endless life made fit for the enjoyment of God and of one another in God; but that he who used the present blessings badly should both lose them and should not receive the others.","title":"Book XIX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_25_book_xix","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"71","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"This is prescribed by the order of nature: it is thus that God has created man. For \"let them,\" He says, \"have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every creeping thing which creepeth on the earth.\"[fn-36-P3692_2030216:26-nf] He did not intend that His rational creature, who was made in His image, should have dominion over anything but the irrational creation,-not man over man, but man over the beasts. And hence the righteous men in primitive times were made shepherds of cattle rather than kings of men, God intending thus to teach us what the relative position of the creatures is, and what the desert of sin; for it is with justice, we believe, that the condition of slavery is the result of sin. And this is why we do not find the word \"slave\" in any part of Scripture until righteous Noah branded the sin of his son with this name. It is a name, therefore, introduced by sin and not by nature. The origin of the Latin word for slave is supposed to be found in the circumstance that those who by the law of war were liable to be killed were sometimes preserved by their victors, and were hence called servants.[fn-36-P3693_2031126:27-nf] And these circumstances could never have arisen save through sin. For even when we wage a just war, our adversaries must be sinning; and every victory, even though gained by wicked men, is a result of the first judgment of God, who humbles the vanquished either for the sake of removing or of punishing their sins. Witness that man of God, Daniel, who, when he was in captivity, confessed to God his own sins and the sins of his people, and declares with pious grief that these were the cause of the captivity.[fn-36-P3694_2031690:28-nf] The prime cause, then, of slavery is sin, which brings man under the dominion of his fellow,-that which does not happen save by the judgment of God, with whom is no unrighteousness, and who knows how to award fit punishments to every variety of offence. But our Master in heaven says, \"Every one who doeth sin is the servant of sin.\"[fn-36-P3695_2032038:29-nf] And thus there are many wicked masters who have religious men as their slaves, and who are yet themselves in bondage; \"for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.\"[fn-36-P3696_2032247:30-nf] And beyond question it is a happier thing to be the slave of a man than of a lust; for even this very lust of ruling, to mention no others, lays waste men's hearts with the most ruthless dominion. Moreover, when men are subjected to one another in a peaceful order, the lowly position does as much good to the servant as the proud position does harm to the master. But by nature, as God first created us, no one is the slave either of man or of sin. This servitude is, however, penal, and is appointed by that law which enjoins the preservation of the natural order and forbids its disturbance; for if nothing had been done in violation of that law, there would have been nothing to restrain by penal servitude. And therefore the apostle admonishes slaves to be subject to their masters, and to serve them heartily and with good-will, so that, if they cannot be freed by their masters, they may themselves make their slavery in some sort free, by serving not in crafty fear, but in faithful love, until all unrighteousness pass away, and all principality and every human power be brought to nothing, and God be all in all.","title":"Book XIX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":48,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_23_homily_xvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And besides, He was for a while practising His moral doctrine only, being minded from this first, and from His miracles, to convince the hearers that He was the Son of God.

Faustus said: Why do I not believe the prophets? Rather why do you believe them? On account, you will reply, of their prophecies about Christ. For my part, I have read the prophets with the most eager attention, and have found no such prophecies. And surely it shows a weak faith not to believe in Christ without proofs and testimonies. Indeed, you yourselves are accustomed to teach that Christian faith is so simple and absolute as not to admit of laborious investigations. Why, then, should you destroy the simplicity of faith by buttressing it with evidences, and Jewish evidences too? Or if you are changing your opinion about evidences, what more trustworthy witness could you have than God Himself testifying to His own Son when He sent Him on earth,-not by a prophet or an interpreter,-by a voice immediately from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, believe Him?\"[fn-13-P1378_733640:1-nf] And again He testifies of Himself: \"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world;[fn-13-P1379_733752:2-nf] and in many similar passages. When the Jews quarrelled with this testimony, saying \"Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy witness is not true,\" He replied: \"Although I bear witness of myself, my witness is true. It is written in your law, The witness of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me.\"[fn-13-P1380_734128:3-nf] He does not mention the prophets. Again He appeals to the testimony of His own works, saying, \"If ye believe not me, believe the works;\"[fn-13-P1381_734286:4-nf] not, \"If ye believe not me, believe the prophets.\" Accordingly we require no testimonies concerning our Saviour. All we look for in the prophets is prudence and virtue, and a good example, which, you are well aware, are not to be found in the Jewish prophets. This, no doubt, explains your referring me at once to their predictions as a reason for believing them, without a word about their actions. This may be good policy, but it is not in harmony. with the declaration of Scripture, that it is impossible to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles. This may serve meanwhile as a brief and sufficient reply to the question, why we do not believe the prophets. The fact that they did not prophesy of Christ is abundantly proved in the writings of our fathers. I shall only add this, that if the Hebrew prophets knew and preached Christ, and yet lived such vicious lives, what Paul says of the wise men among the Gentiles might be applied to them: \"Though they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, nor were thankful; but they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\"[fn-13-P1382_735414:5-nf] You see the knowledge of great things is worth little, unless the life corresponds.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":3436,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_25_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"9. As Cain's sacrifice of the fruit of the ground is rejected, while Abel's sacrifice of his sheep and the fat thereof is accepted. so the faith of the New Testament praising God in the harmless service of grace is preferred to the earthly observances of the Old Testament. For though the Jews were right in practising these things, they were guilty of unbelief in not distinguishing the time of the New Testament when Christ came, from the time of the Old Testament. God said to Cain, \"If thou offerest well, yet if thou dividest not well, thou hast sinned.\"[fn-14-P1409_748774:24-nf] If Cain had obeyed God when He said, \"Be content, for to thee shall be its reference, and thou shalt rule over it,\" he would have referred his sin to himself, by taking the blame of it, and confessing it to God; and so assisted by supplies of grace, he would have ruled over his sin, instead of acting as the servant of sin in killing his innocent brother. So also the Jews, of whom all these things are a figure, if they had been content, instead of being turbulent, and had acknowledged the time of salvation through the pardon of sins by grace, and heard Christ saying, \"They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance;\"[fn-14-P1410_749487:25-nf] and, \"Every one that committeth sin is the servant of sin;\" and, \"If the Son make you free, ye shall be free indeed,\"[fn-14-P1411_749628:26-nf] -they would in confession have referred their sin to themselves, saying to the Physician, as it is written in the Psalm, \"I said, Lord, be merciful to me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.\"[fn-14-P1412_749852:27-nf] And being made free by the hope of grace, they would have ruled over sin as long as it continued in their mortal body. But now, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and wishing to establish a righteousness of their own, proud of the works of the law, instead of being humbled on account of their sins, they have not been content; and in subjection to sin reigning in their mortal body, so as to make them obey it in the lusts thereof, they have stumbled on the stone of stumbling, and have been inflamed with hatred against him whose works they grieved to see accepted by God. The man who was born blind, and had been made to see, said to them, \"We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man serve Him, and do His will, him He heareth;\"[fn-14-P1413_750615:28-nf] as if he had said, God regardeth not the sacrifice of Cain, but he regards the sacrifice of Abel.

These questions are handled with greater breadth by those who, in less narrow limits than ours are at present, seek to set forth the profession of the Christian faith in its totality. Accordingly, in so far as He is the Son, of the Father received He it that He is, while that other [the Father] received not this of the Son; and in so far as He, in unutterable mercy, in a temporal dispensation took upon Himself the [nature of] man (hominem),-to wit, the changeable creature that was thereby to be changed into something better,-many statements concerning Him are discovered in the Scriptures, which are so expressed as to have given occasion to error in the impious intellects of heretics, with whom the desire to teach takes precedence of that to understand, so that they have supposed Him to be neither equal with the Father nor of the same substance. Such statements [are meant] as the following: \"For the Father is greater than I;\"[fn-32-P3264_1503245:82-nf] and, \"The head of the woman is the man, the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God;\"[fn-32-P3265_1503368:83-nf] and, \"Then shall He Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him;\"[fn-32-P3266_1503467:84-nf] and, \"I go to my Father and your Father, my God and your God,\"[fn-32-P3267_1503550:85-nf] together with some others of like tenor. Now all these have had a place given them, [certainly] not with the object of signifying an inequality of nature and substance; for to take them so would be to falsify a different class of statements, such as, \"I and my Father are one\" (unum);[fn-32-P3268_1503853:86-nf] and, \"He that hath seen me hath seen my Father also;\"[fn-32-P3269_1503923:87-nf] and, \"The Word was God,\"[fn-32-P3270_1503966:88-nf] for He was not made, inasmuch as \"all things were made by Him;\"[fn-32-P3271_1504046:89-nf] and, \"He thought it not robbery to be equal with God:\"[fn-32-P3272_1504117:90-nf] together with all the other passages of a similar order.

But that hope and faith may attain to their result, there is need of patience.

There is a certain discourse of the Lord which is given by the evangelist John, and which may help us more readily to understand the statement I thus make. It is to this effect: \"Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on Him, If ye continue in my word, then ye shall be my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. And they answered Him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be free?[fn-21-P2124_883069:502-nf] Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but the Son abideth for ever. If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.\"[fn-21-P2125_883440:503-nf] Now surely it is not to be supposed that He spake these words, \"Ye seek to kill me\" to those persons who had already believed on Him, and to whom He had said, \"If ye abide in my word, then shall ye be my disciples indeed.\" But inasmuch as He had spoken in these latter terms to the men who had already believed on Him, and as, moreover, there was present on that occasion a multitude of people, among whom there were many who were hostile to Him, even although the evangelist does not tell us explicitly who those parties were who made the reply referred to, the very nature of the answer which they gave, and the tenor of the words which thereupon were rightly directed to them by Him, make it sufficiently clear what specific persons were then addressed, and what words were spoken to them in particular. Precisely, therefore, as in the multitude thus alluded to by John there were some whohad already believed on Jesus, and also some who sought to kill Him, in that other concourse which we are discussing at present there were some who had craftily questioned the Lord onthe subject of the authority by which He did these things; and there were also others who had hailed Him, not in deceit, but in faith, with the acclaim, \"Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.\" And thus, too, there were persons present who could say, \"He will destroy those men, and will give his vineyard to others.\" This saying, furthermore, may be rightly understood to have been the voice of the Lord Himself, either in virtue of that Truth which in His own Person He is Himself, or on the ground of the unity which subsists between the members of His body and the head. There were also certain individuals present who, when these other parties gave that kind of answer, said to them, \"God forbid,\" because they understood the parable to be directed against themselves.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"2. Since you have proved that Christ declared that Moses wrote of him, I should be very grateful if you would show me what he has written. I have searched the Scriptures, as we are told to do, and have found no prophecies of Christ, either because there are none, or because I could not understand them. The only escape from this perplexity was in one or other of two conclusions. Either this verse must be spurious, or Jesus a liar. As it is not consistent with piety to suppose God a liar, I preferred to attribute falsehood to the writers, rather than to the Author, of truth. Moreover, He Himself tells that those who came before him were thieves and robbers, which applies first of all to Moses. And when, on the occasion of His speaking of His own majesty, and calling Himself the light of the world, the Jews angrily rejoined, \"Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy witness is not true,\" I do not find that He appealed to the prophecies of Moses, as might have been expected. Instead of this, as having no connection with the Jews, and receiving no testimony from their fathers, He replied: \"It is written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. I am one who bear witness of myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me.\"[fn-16-P1657_921737:1-nf] He referred to the voice from heaven which all had heard: \"This is my beloved Son, believe Him.\" I think it likely that if Christ had said that Moses wrote of Him, the ingenious hostility of the Jews would have led them at once to ask what He supposed Moses to have written.

In the passage where we read of the Jews saying to Christ, Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy witness is not true, you do not see that Christ replies by saying that Moses wrote of Him, simply because you have not got the eye of piety to see with. The answer of Christ is this: \"It is written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true; I am one who bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me heareth witness of me.\"[fn-16-P1683_939011:15-nf] What does this mean, if rightly understood, but that this number of witnesses required by the law was fixed upon and consecrated in the spirit of prophecy, that even thus might be prefigured the future revelation of the Father and Son, whose spirit is the Holy Spirit of the inseparable Trinity? So it is written: \"In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.\"[fn-16-P1684_939423:16-nf] As a matter of fact, one witness generally speaks the truth, while a number tell lies. And the world, in its conversion to Christianity, believed one apostle preaching the gospel rather than the mistaken multitude who persecuted him. There was a special reason for requiring this number of witnesses, and in His answer the Lord implied that Moses prophesied of Him. Do you carp at His saying your law instead of the law of God? But, as every one knows, this is the common expression in Scripture. Your law means the law given to you. So the apostle speaks of his gospel, while at the same time he declares that he received it not from man,but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. You might as well say that Christ denies God to be His Father, when He uses the words your Father instead of our Father. Again, you should refuse to believe the voice which you allude to as having come from heaven, This is my beloved Son, believe Him, because you did not hear it. But if you believe this because you find it in the sacred Scriptures, you will also find there what you deny, that Moses wrote of Christ, besides many other things that you do not acknowledge as true. Do you not see that your own mischievous argument may be used to prove that this voice never came from heaven? To your own destruction, and to the detriment of the welfare of mankind, you try to weaken the authority of the gospel, by arguing that it cannot be true that Christ said that Moses wrote of Him; because if He had said this, the ingenious hostility of the Jews would have led them at once to ask what He supposed Moses to have written of Him. In the same way, it might be impiously argued that if that voice had really come from heaven, all the Jews who heard it would have believed. Why are you so unreasonable as not to consider that, as it was possible for the Jews to remain hardened in unbelief after hearing the voice from heaven, so it was possible for them, when Christ said that Moses wrote of Him, to refrain from asking what Moses wrote, because in their ingenious hostility they were afraid of being proved to be in the wrong?","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":42,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_23_book_i_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"163","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"107.

But some one will say to me that it is one thing to live after man, another thing to live after the flesh; because man forsooth is a rational creature, and there is in him a rational soul, whereby he differs from the beast: but the flesh is the lowest and earthly part of man, and thus to live after it is faulty: and for this reason, he who lives after man, assuredly lives not after the flesh, but rather after that part of man, whereby he is man, that is, after the spirit of the mind whereby he excels the beasts. But this discussion is perhaps of some force in the schools of philosophers: but we, in order to understand the Apostle of Christ, ought to observe in what manner the Christian books are used to speak; at any rate it is the belief of all of us, to whom to live is Christ, that Man was taken unto Himself by the Word of God, not surely without a rational soul, as certain heretics will have it; and yet we read, \"The Word was made flesh.\"[fn-36-P3617_1708524:33-nf] What is to be here understood by \"flesh,\" but Man? \"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\"[fn-36-P3618_1708640:34-nf] What can be understood, but all men? \"Unto Thee shall all flesh come.\"[fn-36-P3619_1708728:35-nf] What is it, but all men? \"Thou hast given unto Him power over all flesh.\"[fn-36-P3620_1708819:36-nf] What is it, but all men? \"Of the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.\"[fn-36-P3621_1708918:37-nf] What is it, but no man shall be justified? And this the same Apostle in another place confessing more plainly saith, \"Man shall not be justified of the works of the Law.\"[fn-36-P3622_1709108:38-nf] The Corinthians also he rebukes, saying, \"Are ye not carnal, and walk after man?\"[fn-36-P3623_1709208:39-nf] After he had called them carnal, he saith not, ye walk after the flesh, but after man, forasmuch as by this also what would he have understood, but after the flesh? For surely if to walk, that is, to live, after the flesh deserved blame, but after man deserved praise, he would not say by way of rebuke, \"ye walk after man.\" Let man recognize the reproach; let him change his purpose, let him shun destruction. Hear thou man: walk not thou after man, but after Him Who made man. Fall not thou away from Him Who made thee, even unto thyself. For a man said, who yet lived not after man, \"Not that we are sufficient to think any thing from ourselves, as though of ourselves: but our sufficiency is of God.\"[fn-36-P3624_1709933:40-nf] Consider if he lived after man, who spake these things with truth. Therefore the Apostle, admonishing man not to live after man, restores man to God. But whoso liveth not after man, but after God, assuredly liveth not even after himself, because himself also is a man. But he is therefore said also to live after the flesh, when he so lives; because also when the flesh alone hath been named, man is understood, as we have already shown: just as when the soul alone hath been named, man is understood: whence it is said, \"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers,\"[fn-36-P3625_1710526:41-nf] that is, every man; and, \"Seventy-five souls went down into Egypt with Jacob,\"[fn-36-P3626_1710624:42-nf] that is, seventy-five men. Therefore live thou not after thyself, O man: thou hadst thence perished, but thou wast sought. Live not then, I say, after thyself, O man; thou hadst thence perished, but thou wast found. Accuse not thou the nature of the flesh, when you hear it said, \"If ye shall live after the flesh, ye shall die.\"[fn-36-P3627_1710974:43-nf] For thus could it be said, and most truly could it, If ye shall live after yourselves ye shall die.

And those who hold this opinion are not only in error, but also seem to dispute and act in opposition to the power of the keys committed to the Church, whereof it is said: \"Whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.\"[fn-90-P9016_2928722:14-nf] And in short, this opinion either is not the Lord's, or it is true. But be that as it may, we believe without hesitation, that both the priests of the Lord and other believers may return to their honours after a proper satisfaction for their error, as the Lord Himself testifies by His prophet: \"Shall he who falls not also rise again? and shall he who turns away not return? \"[fn-90-P9017_2929122:15-nf] And in another passage the Lord says: \"I desire not the death of the sinner, but that he may turn, and live.\"[fn-90-P9018_2929251:16-nf] And the prophet David, on his repentance, said: \"Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and uphold me with Thy free Spirit.\"[fn-90-P9019_2929416:17-nf] And he indeed, after his repentance, taught others also, and offered sacrifice to God, giving thereby an example to the teachers of the holy Church, that if they have fallen, and thereafter have exhibited a right repentance to God, they may do both things in like manner. For he taught when he said: \"I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto Thee.\"[fn-90-P9020_2929814:18-nf] And he offered sacrifice for himself, while he said: \"The sacrifice for God is a broken spirit.\"[fn-90-P9021_2929928:19-nf] For the prophet, seeing his own transgressions purged by repentance, had no doubt as to healing those of others by preaching, and by making offering to God. Thus the shedding of tears moves the mind's feeling (passionem). And when the satisfaction is made good, the mind is turned aside from anger. For how does that man think that mercy will be shown to himself, who does not forgive his neighbour? If offences abound, then, let mercy also abound; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption.[fn-90-P9022_2930467:20-nf] In the Lord's hand there is abundance of all things, because He is the Lord of powers (virtutum) and the King of glory.[fn-90-P9023_2930605:21-nf] For the apostle says: \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, `I say, 'at this time His righteousness, that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.\"[fn-90-P9024_2931088:22-nf] And David says: \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.\"[fn-90-P9025_2931204:23-nf] Man, therefore, is cleansed of his sin, and rises again by the grace of God though he has fallen, and abides in his first position, according to the above-cited authorities. Let him see to it that he sin no more, that the sentence of the Gospel may abide in him: \"Go, and sin no more.\"[fn-90-P9026_2931509:24-nf] Whence the apostle says: \"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof: neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. What then? shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin; but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. I speak after the manner of men.\"[fn-90-P9027_2932427:25-nf] For greater is the sin of him who judgeth, than of him who is judged. \"Thinkest thou,\" says the apostle, \"O man, that judgest them that do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? or despisest thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering? Dost thou not know that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But, after thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek: but glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good.\"[fn-90-P9028_2933421:26-nf] My brethren, shun not only the holding, but even the hearing, of the judgment that bans mercy; for better is mercy than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.[fn-90-P9029_2933604:27-nf] We have replied to your interrogations shortly, because your letter found us burdened overmuch, and preoccupied with other judgments.

Those who find fault with the prophets, accusing them of adultery for instance, in actions which are above their comprehension, are like those Pagans who profanely charge Christ with folly or madness because He looked for fruit from a tree out of the season;[fn-20-P2093_1240941:50-nf] or with childishness, because He stooped down and wrote on the ground, and, after answering the people who were questioning Him, began writing again.[fn-20-P2094_1241111:51-nf] Such critics are incapable of understanding that certain virtues in great minds resemble closely the vices of little minds, not in reality, but in appearance. Such criticism of the great is like that of boys at school, whose learning consists in the important rule, that if the nominative is in the singular, the verb must also be in the singular; and so they find fault with the best Latin author, because he says, Pars in frusta secant.[fn-20-P2095_1241572:52-nf] He should have written, say they, secat.

Why, moreover, should it be born, not of corruptible [seed], but of incorruptible? Why, again, since His flesh has both risen and returned to heaven, is not ours, being like His, also taken up at once? Or else, why does not His flesh, since it is like ours, return in like manner to the ground, and suffer dissolution? Such objections even the heathen used constantly to bandy about.[fn-95-P9507_2609313:222-nf] Was the Son of God reduced to such a depth of degradation Again, if He rose again as a precedent for our hope, how is it that nothing like it has been thought desirable (to happen) to ourselves?[fn-95-P9508_2609551:223-nf] Such views are not improper for heathens and they are fit and natural for the heretics too. For, indeed, what difference is there between them, except it be that the heathen, in not believing, do believe; while the heretics, in believing, do not believe? Then, again, they read: \"Thou madest Him a little less than angels; \"[fn-95-P9509_2609971:224-nf] and they deny the lower nature of that Christ who declares Himself to be, \"not a man, but a worm; \"[fn-95-P9510_2610097:225-nf] who also had \"no form nor comeliness, but His form was ignoble, despised more than all men, a man in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of weakness.\"[fn-95-P9511_2610275:226-nf] Here they discover a human being mingled with a divine one and so they deny the manhood.

The master of a private dwelling will not allow any untidiness or unseemliness to be seen in the house, such as a couch upset, or the table littered with rubbish, or vessels of price thrown away into dirty corners, while those which serve ignobler uses are thrust forward for entering guests to see. He has everything arranged neatly and in the proper place, where it stands to most advantage; and then he can welcome his guests, without any misgivings that he need be ashamed of opening the interior of his house to receive them. The same duty, I take it, is incumbent on that master of our \"tabernacle,\" the mind; it has to arrange everything within us, and to put each particular faculty of the soul, which the Creator has fashioned to be our implement or our vessel, to fitting and noble uses. We will now mention in detail the way in which any one might manage his life, with its present advantages, to his improvement, hoping that no one will accuse us of trifling[fn-28-P2818_1909802:117-nf] , or over-minuteness. We advise, then, that love's passion be placed in the soul's purest shrine, as a thing chosen to be the first fruits of all our gifts, and devoted[fn-28-P2819_1910017:118-nf] entirely to God; and when once this has been done, to keep it untouched and unsullied by any secular defilement. Then indignation, and anger, and hatred must be as watch-dogs to be roused only against attacking sins; they must follow their natural impulse only against the thief and the enemy who is creeping in to plunder the divine treasure-chamber, and who comes only for that, that he may steal, and mangle, and destroy. Courage and confidence are to be weapons in our hands to baffle any sudden surprise and attack of the wicked who advance. Hope and patience are to be the staffs to lean upon, whenever we are weary with the trials of the world. As for sorrow, we must have a stock of it ready to apply, if need should happen to arise for it, in the hour of repentance for our sins; believing at the same time that it is never useful, except to minister to that. Righteousness will be our rule of straightforwardness, guarding us from stumbling either in word or deed, and guiding us in the disposal of the faculties of our soul, as well as in the due consideration for every one we meet. The love of gain, which is a large, incalculably large, element in every soul, when once applied to the desire for God, will bless the man who has it; for he will be violent[fn-28-P2820_1911376:119-nf] where it is right to be violent. Wisdom and prudence will be our advisers as to our best interests; they will order our lives so as never to suffer from any thoughtless folly. But suppose a man does not apply the aforesaid faculties of the soul to their proper use, but reverses their intended purpose; suppose he wastes his love upon the basest objects, and stores up his hatred only for his own kinsmen; suppose he welcomes iniquity, plays the man only against his parents, is bold only in absurdities, fixes his hopes on emptiness, chases prudence and wisdom from his company, takes gluttony and folly for his mistresses, and uses all his other opportunities in the same fashion, he would indeed be a strange and unnatural character to a degree beyond any one's power to express. If we could imagine any one putting his armour on all the wrong way, reversing the helmet so as to cover his face while the plume nodded backward, putting his feet into the cuirass, and fitting the greaves on to his breast, changing to the right side all that ought to go on the left and vice versa, and how such a hoplite would be likely to fare in battle, then we should have an idea of the fate in life which is sure to await him whose confused judgment makes him reverse the proper uses of his soul's faculties. We must therefore provide this balance in all feeling; the true sobriety of mind is naturally able to supply it; and if one had to find an exact definition of this sobriety, one might declare absolutely, that it amounts to our ordered control, by dint of wisdom and prudence, over every emotion of the soul. Moreover, such a condition in the soul will be no longer in need of any laborious method to attain to the high and heavenly realities; it will accomplish with the greatest ease that which erewhile seemed so unattainable; it will grasp the object of its search as a natural consequence of rejecting the opposite attractions. A man who comes out of darkness is necessarily in the light; a man who is not dead is necessarily alive. Indeed, if a man is not to have received his soul to no purpose[fn-28-P2821_1913528:120-nf] , he will certainly be upon the path of truth; the prudence and the science employed to guard against error will be itself a sure guidance along the right road. Slaves who have been freed and cease to serve their former masters, the very moment they become their own masters, direct all their thoughts towards themselves so, I take it, the soul which has been freed from ministering to the body becomes at once cognizant of its own inherent energy. But this liberty consists, as we learn from the Apostle[fn-28-P2822_1914149:121-nf] , in not again being held in the yoke of slavery, and in not being bound again, like a runaway or a criminal, with the fetters of marriage. But I must return here to what I said at first; that the perfection of this liberty does not consist only in that one point of abstaining from marriage. Let no one suppose that the prize of virginity is so insignificant and so easily won as that; as if one little observance of the flesh could settle so vital a matter. But we have seen that every man who doeth a sin is the servant of sin[fn-28-P2823_1914697:122-nf] ; so that a declension towards vice in any act, or in any practice whatever, makes a slave, and still more, a branded slave, of the man, covering him through sin's lashes with bruises and seared spots. Therefore it behoves the man who grasps at the transcendent aim of all virginity to be true to himself in h every respect, and to manifest his purity equally in every relation of his life. If any of the inspired words are required to aid our pleading, the Truth[fn-28-P2824_1915186:123-nf] Itself will be sufficient to corroborate the truth when It inculcates this very kind of teaching in the veiled meaning of a Gospel Parable: the good and eatable fish are separated by the fishers' skill from the bad and poisonous fish, so that the enjoyment of the good should not be spoilt by any of the bad getting into the \"vessels\" with them. The work of true sobriety is the same; from all pursuits and habits to choose that which is pure and improving, rejecting in every case that which does not seem likely to be useful, and letting it go back into the universal and secular life, called \"the sea[fn-28-P2825_1915813:124-nf] ,\" in the imagery of the Parable. The Psalmist[fn-28-P2826_1915902:125-nf] also, when expounding the doctrine of a full confession[fn-28-P2827_1915978:126-nf] , calls this restless suffering tumultuous life, \"waters coming in even unto the soul,\" \"depths of waters,\" and a \"hurricane\"; in which sea indeed every rebellious thought sinks, as the Egyptian did, with a stone's weight into the deeps[fn-28-P2828_1916261:127-nf] . But all in us that is dear to God, and has a piercing insight into the truth (called \"Israel\" in the narrative), passes, but that alone, over that sea as if it were dry land, and is never reached by the bitterness and the brine of life's billows. Thus, typically, under the leadership of the Law (for Moses was a type of the Law that was coming) Israel passes unwetted over that sea, while the Egyptian who crosses in her track is overwhelmed. Each fares according to the disposition which he carries with him; one walks lightly enough, the other is dragged into the deep water. For virtue is a light and buoyant thing, and all who live in her way \"fly like clouds[fn-28-P2829_1916948:128-nf] ,\" as Isaiah says, \"and as doves with their young ones\"; but sin is a heavy affair, \"sitting,\" as another of the prophets says, \"upon a talent of lead[fn-28-P2830_1917155:129-nf] .\" If, however, this reading of the history appears to any forced and inapplicable, and the miracle at the Red Sea does not present itself to him as written for our profit, let him listen to the Apostle: \"Now all these things happened unto them for types, and they are written for our admonition[fn-28-P2831_1917684:130-nf] .\"","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":8,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But besides other things the action of Miriam the prophetess also gives rise to these surmisings of ours. Directly the sea was crossed she took in her hand a dry and sounding timbrel and conducted the women's dance[fn-28-P2835_1917946:131-nf] . By this timbrel the story may mean to imply virginity, as first perfected by Miriam; whom indeed I would believe to be a type of Mary the mother of God[fn-28-P2836_1918122:132-nf] . Just as the timbrel emits a loud sound because it is devoid of all moisture and reduced to the highest degree of dryness, so has virginity a clear and ringing report amongst men because it repels from itself the vital sap of merely physical life. Thus, Miriam's timbrel being a dead thing, and virginity being a deadening of the bodily passions, it is perhaps not very far removed from the bounds of probability[fn-28-P2837_1918838:133-nf] that Miriam was a virgin. However, we can but guess and surmise, we cannot clearly prove, that this was so, and that Miriam the prophetess led a dance of virgins, even though many of the learned have affirmed distinctly that she was unmarried, from the fact that the history makes no mention either of her marriage or of her being a mother; and surely she would have been named and known, not as \"the sister of Aaron[fn-28-P2838_1919290:134-nf] ,\" but from her husband, if she had had one; since the head of the woman is not the brother but the husband. But if, amongst a people with whom motherhood was sought after and classed as a blessing and, regarded as a public duty, the grace of virginity, nevertheless came to be regarded as a precious thing, how does it behove us to feel towards it, who do not \"judge\" of the Divine blessings[fn-28-P2839_1919704:135-nf] \"according to the flesh\"? Indeed it has been revealed in the oracles of God, on what occasion to conceive and to bring forth is a good thing, and what species of fecundity was desired by God's saints; for both the Prophet Isaiah and the divine Apostle have made this clear and certain. The one cries, \"From fear of Thee, O Lord, have I conceived[fn-28-P2840_1920198:136-nf] ;\" the other boasts that he is the parent of the largest family of any, bringing to the birth whole cities and nations; not the Corinthians and Galatians only whom by his travailings he moulded for the Lord, but all in the wide circuit from Jerusalem to Illyricum; his children filled the world, \"begotten\" by him in Christ through the Gospel[fn-28-P2841_1920668:137-nf] . In the same strain the womb of the Holy Virgin, which ministered to an Immaculate Birth, is pronounced blessed in the Gospel[fn-28-P2842_1920830:138-nf] ; for that birth did not annul the Virginity, nor did the Virginity impede so great a birth. When the \"spirit of salvation[fn-28-P2843_1920976:139-nf] ,\" as Isaiah names it, is being born, the willings of the flesh are useless. There is also a particular teaching of the Apostle, which harmonizes with this; viz. each man of us is a double man[fn-28-P2844_1921309:140-nf] ; one the outwardly visible, whose natural fate it is to decay; the other perceptible only in the secret of the heart, yet capable of renovation. If this teaching is true,-and it must be true[fn-28-P2845_1921523:141-nf] because Wisdom is speaking there,-then there is no absurdity in supposing a double marriage also which answers in every detail to either man; and, maybe, if one was to assert boldly that the body's virginity was the co-operator and the agent of the inward marriage, this assertion would not be much beside the probable fact.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":8,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_36_book_i_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But in defending free will they hasten to confide rather in it for doing righteousness than in God's aid, and to glory every one in himself, and not in the Lord.[fn-50-P5042_1990525:2-nf] But who of us will say that by the sin of the first man free will perished from the human race?

Then they say: If Moses is believed on account of his word and his works, and has no need of any witnesses to announce him beforehand, and if the prophets were received, every one of them, by these people, as messengers from God, how should not one who is much greater than Moses and the prophets accomplish His mission and benefit the human race, without prophets to bear witness about Him? They regard it as superfluous that He should have been foretold by the prophets, since the prophets were concerned, as these opponents would say, that those who believed in Christ should not receive Him as a new God, and therefore did what they could to bring them to that same God whom Moses and the prophets taught before Jesus. To this we must say that as there are many causes which may lead men to believe, since men who are not moved by one argument may be by another, so God is able to provide for men a number of occasions, any of which may cause their minds to open to the truth that God, who is over all, has taken on Himself human nature. It is manifest to all, how some are brought by the prophetic writings to the admiration of Christ. They are astounded at the voices of so many prophets before Him, which establish the place of His birth, the country of His upbringing, the power of His teaching, His working of wonderful works, and His human passion brought to a close by His resurrection. We must notice, too, that Christ's stupendous acts of power were able to bring to the faith those of Christ's own time, but that they lost their demonstrative force with the lapse of years and began to be regarded as mythical. Greater evidential value than that of the miracles then performed attaches to the comparison which we now make between these miracles and the prophecy of them; this makes it impossible for the student to cast any doubt on the former. The prophetic testimonies do not declare merely the advent of the Messiah; it is by no means the case that they teach this and nothing else. They teach a great deal of theology. The relation of the Father to the Son and of the Son to the Father may be learned not less from what the prophets announce about Christ, than from the Apostles narrating the splendours of the Son of God. A parallel case, which we may venture to adduce, is that of the martyrs, who were honoured by the witness they bore Him, and by no means conferred any favour on Him by their witnessing for the Son of God. And how is it if, as many of Christ's true disciples were honoured by having thus to witness for Him, so the prophets received from God as their special gift that of understanding about Christ and announcing Him before, and that they taught not only those living after Christ's advent how they should regard the Son of God, but those also who lived in the generations before Him? As he who in these times does not know the Son has not the Father either,[fn-66-P6610_1148110:104-nf] so also we are to understand it was in these earlier times. Hence \"Abraham rejoiced to see the day of Christ, and he saw it and was glad.\"[fn-66-P6611_1148271:105-nf] He, therefore, who declares that they are not to testify about Christ is seeking to deprive the chorus of the prophets of the greatest gift they have; for what office of equal importance would be left to prophecy, inspired as it is by the Holy Spirit, if all connection with the economy of our Lord and Master were taken away from it? For as these have their faith well ordered who approach the God of the universe through Mediator and High-Priest and Paraclete, and as his religion is a halting one who does not go in through the door to the Father, so also in the case of men of old time. Their religion was sanctified and made acceptable to God by their knowledge and faith and expectation of Christ. For we have observed that God declares Himself to be a witness and exhorts them all to declare the same about Christ, and to be imitators of Him, bearing witness of Him to all who require it. For he says,[fn-66-P6612_1149202:106-nf] \"Be witnesses for Me, and I am witness, saith the Lord God, and My servant whom I have chosen.\" Now every one who bears witness to the truth, whether he support it by words or deeds, or in whatever way, may properly be called a witness (martyr); but it has come to be the custom of the brotherhood, since they are struck with admiration of those who have contended to the death for truth and valour, to keep the name of martyr more properly for those who have borne witness to the mystery of godliness by shedding their blood for it. The Saviour gives the name of martyr to every one who bears witness to the truth He declares; thus at the Ascension He says to His disciples:[fn-66-P6613_1149901:107-nf] \"You shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judaea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.\" The leper who was cleansed[fn-66-P6614_1150059:108-nf] had still to bring the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony to those who did not believe in the Christ. In the same way the martyrs bear witness for a testimony to the unbelieving, and so do all the saints whose deeds shine before men. They spend their life rejoicing in the cross of Christ and bearing witness to the true light.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":8,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_37_book_ii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The Manicheans say that the good God is not the Creator of all natures; the Pelagians that God is not the Purifier, the Saviour, the Deliverer of all ages among men.

The first begins with \"This was He of whom I said, He that cometh after me,\" and goes down to \"The only-begotten Son of God who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared him.\" Heracleon supposes the words, \"No one has seen God at any time,\" etc., to have been spoken, not by the Baptist, but by the disciple. But in this he is not sound. He himself allows the words, \"Of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace; for the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,\" to have been spoken by the Baptist. And does it not follow that the person who received of the fulness of Christ, and a second grace in addition to that he had before, and who declared the law to have been given by Moses, but grace and truth to have come through Jesus Christ, is it not clear that this is the person who understood, from what he received from the fulness of Christ, how \"no one hath seen God at any time,\" and how \"the only-begotten who is in the bosom of the Father\" had delivered the declaration about God to him and to all those who had received of His fulness? He was not declaring here for the first time Him that is in the bosom of the Father, as if there had never before been any one fit to receive what he told His Apostles. Does he not teach us that he was before Abraham, and that Abraham rejoiced and was glad to see his day? The words \"Of his fulness all we received,\" and \"Grace for grace,\" show, as we have already made clear, that the prophets also received their gift from the fulness of Christ and received a second grace in place of that they had before; for they also, led by the Spirit, advanced from the introduction they had in types to the vision of truth. Hence not all the prophets, but many of them,[fn-67-P6703_1183785:7-nf] desired to see the things, which the Apostles saw. For if there was a difference among the prophets, those who were perfect and more distinguished of them did not desire to see what the Apostles saw, but actually beheld them, while those who rose less fully than these to the height of the Word were filled with longing for the things which the Apostles knew through Christ. The word \"saw\" we have not taken in a physical sense, and the word \"heard\" we have taken to refer to a spiritual communication; only he who has ears is prepared to hear the words of Jesus-a thing which does not happen too frequently. There is the further point, that the saints before the bodily advent of Jesus had an advantage over most believers in their insight into the mysteries of divinity, since the Word of God was their teacher before He became flesh, for He was always working , in imitation of His Father, of whom He says, \"My father worketh hitherto.\" On this point we may adduce the words He addresses to the Sadducees, who do not believe the doctrine of the resurrection. \"Have you not read,\" He says,[fn-67-P6704_1184897:8-nf] \"what is said by God at the Bush, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\" If, then, God is not ashamed to be called the God of these men, and if they are counted by Christ among the living, and if all believers are sons of Abraham,[fn-67-P6705_1185225:9-nf] since all the Gentiles are blessed with faithful Abraham, who is appointed by God to be a father of the Gentiles, can we hesitate to admit that those living persons made acquaintance with the learning of living men, and were taught by Christ who was born before the daystar,[fn-67-P6706_1185517:10-nf] before He became flesh? And for this cause they lived, because they had part in Him who said, \"I am the life,\" and as the heirs of so great promises received the vision, not only of angels, but of God in Christ. For they saw, it may be, the image of the invisible God,[fn-67-P6707_1185802:11-nf] since he who hath seen the Son hath seen the Father, and so they are recorded to have known God, and to have heard God's words worthily, and, therefore, to have seen God and heard Him. Now, I consider that those who are fully and really sons of Abraham are sons of his actions, spiritually understood, and of the knowledge which was made manifest to him. What he knew and what he did appears again in those who are his sons, as the Scripture teaches those who have ears to hear,[fn-67-P6708_1186315:12-nf] \"If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham.\" And if it is a true proverb[fn-67-P6709_1186435:13-nf] which says, \"A wise man will understand that which proceeds from his own mouth, and on his lips he will bear prudence,\" then we must at once repudiate some things which have been said about the prophets, as if they were not wise men, and did not understand what proceeded from their own mouths. We must believe what is good and true about the prophets, that they were sages, that they did understand what proceeded from their mouths, and that they bore prudence on their lips. It is clear indeed that Moses understood in his mind the truth (real meaning) of the law, and the higher interpretations of the stories recorded in his books. Joshua, too, understood the meaning of the allotment of the land after the destruction of the nine and twenty kings, and could see better than we can the realities of which his achievements were the shadows. It is clear, too, that Isaiah saw the mystery of Him who sat upon the throne, and of the two seraphim, and of the veiling of their faces and their feet, and of their wings, and of the altar and of the tongs. Ezekiel, too, understood the true significance of the cherubim and of their goings, and of the firmament that was above them, and of Him that sat on the throne, than all which what could be loftier or more splendid? I need not enter into more particulars; the point I aim at establishing is clear enough already, namely, that those who were made perfect in earlier generations knew not less than the Apostles did of what Christ revealed to them, since the same teacher was with them as He who revealed to the Apostles the unspeakable mysteries of godliness. I will add but a few points, and then leave it to the reader to judge and to form what views he pleases on this subject. Paul says in his Epistle to the Romans,[fn-67-P6710_1188226:14-nf] \"Now, to him who is able to establish you according to my Gospel, according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal, but is now made manifest by the prophetic Scriptures and the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" For if the mystery concealed of old is made manifest to the Apostles through the prophetic writings, and if the prophets, being wise men, understood what proceeded from their own mouths, then the prophets knew what was made manifest to the Apostles. But to many it was not revealed, as Paul says,[fn-67-P6711_1188800:15-nf] \"In other generations it was not made known to the sons of men as it hath now been revealed unto His holy Apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs and members of the same body.\" Here an objection may be raised by those who do not share the view we have propounded; and it becomes of importance to define what is meant by the word \"revealed.\" It is capable of two meanings: firstly, that the thing in question is understood, but secondly, if a prophecy is spoken of, that it is accomplished. Now, the fact that the Gentiles were to be fellow-heirs and members of the same body, and partakers of the promise, was known to the prophets to this extent, that they knew the Gentiles were to fellow-heirs and members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ. When this should be, and why, and what Gentiles were spoken of, and how, though strangers from the covenants. and aliens to the promises, they were yet to be members of one body and sharers of the blessings; all this was known to the prophets, being revealed to them. But the things prophesied belong to the future, and are not revealed to those who know them, but do not witness their fulfilment, as they are to those who have the event before their eyes. And this was the position of the Apostles. Thus, I conceive. they knew the events no more than the fathers and the prophets did; and yet it is truly said of them that \"what to other generations was not revealed was now revealed to the Apostles and prophets, that the Gentiles were fellow-heirs and members of the same body, and partakers in the promise of Christ.\" For, in addition to knowing these mysteries, they saw the power at work in the accomplished fact. The passage, \"Many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things ye see and did not see them; and to hear the things ye hear and did not hear them,\" may be interpreted in the same way. They also desired to see the mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God, and of His coming down to carry out the design of His suffering for the salvation of many, actually put in operation. This may be illustrated from another quarter. Suppose one of the Apostles to have understood the \"unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,\"[fn-67-P6712_1191085:16-nf] but not to witness the glorious bodily appearing of Jesus to the faithful. which is promised, although He desired to see it and suppose another had not only not[fn-67-P6713_1191266:17-nf] marked and seen what that Apostle marked and saw, but had a much feebler grasp of the divine hope, and yet is present at the second coming of our Saviour, which the Apostle, as in the parallel above, had desired, but had not seen. We shall not err from the truth if we say that both of these have seen what the Apostle, or indeed the Apostles, desired to see, and yet that they are not on that account to be deemed wiser or more blessed than the Apostles. In the same way, also, the Apostles are not to be deemed wiser than the fathers, or than Moses and the prophets, than those in fact who, for their virtue, were found worthy of epiphanies and ofdivine manifestations and of revelations of mysteries.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":8,"verse":44,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In various ways has the devil rivalled and resisted the truth. Sometimes his aim has been to destroy the truth by defending it. He maintains that there is one only Lord, the Almighty Creator of the world, in order that out of this doctrine of the unity he may fabricate a heresy. He says that the Father Himself came down into the Virgin, was Himself born of her, Himself suffered, indeed was Himself Jesus Christ. Here the old serpent has fallen out with himself, since, when he tempted Christ after John's baptism, he approached Him as \"the Son of God; \"surely intimating that God had a Son, even on the testimony of the very Scriptures, out of which he was at the moment forging his temptation: \"If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\"[fn-103-P10383_2908627:3-nf] Again: \"If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence;[fn-103-P10384_2908708:4-nf] for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning thee\"-referring no doubt, to the Father-\"and in their hands they shall bear thee up, that thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.\"[fn-103-P10385_2908912:5-nf] Or perhaps, after all, he was only reproaching the Gospels with a lie, saying in fact: \"Away with Matthew; away with Luke!

If, on the contrary, it had been only the Son of God, most likely I should never have condescended to deal with Him.\" However, he is himself a liar from the beginning,[fn-103-P10386_2909442:6-nf] and whatever man he instigates in his own way; as, for instance, Praxeas. For he was the first to import into Rome from Asia this kind of heretical pravity, a man in other respects of restless disposition, and above all inflated with the pride of confessorship simply and solely because he had to bear for a short time the annoyance of a prison; on which occasion, even \"if he had given his body to be burned, it would have profiled him nothing,\" not having the love of God,[fn-103-P10387_2909935:7-nf] whose very gifts he has resisted and destroyed. For after the Bishop of Rome[fn-103-P10388_2910031:8-nf] had acknowledged the prophetic gifts of Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla, and, in consequence of the acknowledgment, had bestowed his peace[fn-103-P10389_2910208:9-nf] on the churches of Asia and Phrygia, he, by importunately urging false accusations against the prophets themselves and their churches, and insisting on the authority of the bishop's predecessors in the see, compelled him to recall the pacific letter which he had issued, as well as to desist from his purpose of acknowledging the said gifts. By this Praxeas did a twofold service for the devil at Rome: he drove away prophecy, and he brought in heresy; he put to flight the Paraclete, and he crucified the Father. Praxeas' tares had been moreover sown, and had produced their fruit here also,[fn-103-P10390_2910837:10-nf] while many were asleep in their simplicity of doctrine; but these tares actually seemed to have been plucked up, having been discovered and exposed by him whose agency God was pleased to employ. Indeed, Praxeas had deliberately resumed his old (true) faith, teaching it after his renunciation of error; and there is his own handwriting in evidence remaining among the carnally-minded,[fn-103-P10391_2911565:11-nf] in whose society the transaction then took place; afterwards nothing was heard of him. We indeed, on our part, subsequently withdrew from the carnally-minded on our acknowledgment and maintenance of the Paraclete.[fn-103-P10392_2911857:12-nf] But the tares of Praxeas had then everywhere shaken out their seed, which having lain hid for some while, with its vitality concealed under a mask, has now broken out with fresh life. But again shall it be rooted up, if the Lord will, even now; but if not now, in the day when all bundles of tares shall be gathered together, and along with every other stumbling-block shall be burnt up with unquenchable fire.[fn-103-P10393_2912610:13-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If any man from this shall think that I am introducing some probolh/-that is to say, some prolation[fn-104-P10482_2936418:81-nf] of one thing out of another, as Valentinus does when he sets forth ¦on from ¦on, one after another-then this is my first reply to you: Truth must not therefore refrain from the use of such a term, and its reality and meaning, because heresy also employs it. The fact is, heresy has rather taken it from Truth, in order to mould it into its own counterfeit. Was the Word of God put forth or not? Here take your stand with me, and flinch not. If He was put forth, then acknowledge that the true doctrine has a prolation;[fn-104-P10483_2937443:82-nf] and never mind heresy, when in any point it mimics the truth. The question now is, in what sense each side uses a given thing and the word which expresses it. Valentinus divides and separates his prolations from their Author, and places them at so great a distance from Him, that the ¦on does not know the Father: he longs, indeed, to know Him, but cannot; nay, he is almost swallowed up and dissolved into the rest of matter.[fn-104-P10484_2937885:83-nf] With us, however, the Son alone knows the Father,[fn-104-P10485_2937972:84-nf] and has Himself unfolded \"the Father's bosom.\"[fn-104-P10486_2938038:85-nf] He has also heard and seen all things with the Father; and what He has been commanded by the Father, that also does He speak.[fn-104-P10487_2938181:86-nf] And it is not His own will, but the Father's, which He has accomplished,[fn-104-P10488_2938274:87-nf] which He had known most intimately, even from the beginning. \"For what man knoweth the things which be in God, but the Spirit which is in Him? \"[fn-104-P10489_2938437:88-nf] But the Word was formed by the Spirit, and (if I may so express myself) the Spirit is the body of the Word. The Word, therefore, is both always in the Father, as He says, \"I am in the Father; \"[fn-104-P10490_2938651:89-nf] and is always with God, according to what is written, \"And the Word was with God; \"[fn-104-P10491_2938754:90-nf] and never separate from the Father, or other than the Father, since \"I and the Father are one.\"[fn-104-P10492_2938866:91-nf] This will be the prolation, taught by the truth,[fn-104-P10493_2938932:92-nf] the guardian of the Unity, wherein we declare that the Son is a prolation from the Father, without being separated from Him. For God sent forth the Word, as the Paraclete also declares, just as the root puts forth the tree, and the fountain the river, and the sun the ray.[fn-104-P10494_2939251:93-nf] For these are probolai/, or emanations, of the substances from which they proceed. I should not hesitate, indeed, to call the tree the son or offspring of the root, and the river of the fountain, and the ray of the sun; because every original source is a parent, and everything which issues from the origin is an offspring. Much more is (this true of) the Word of God, who has actually received as His own peculiar designation the name of Son. But still the tree is not severed from the root, nor the river from the fountain, nor the ray from the sun; nor, indeed, is the Word separated from God. Following, therefore, the form of these analogies, I confess that I call God and His Word-the Father and His Son-two. For the root and the tree are distinctly two things, but correlatively joined; the fountain and the river are also two forms, but indivisible; so likewise the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones. Everything which proceeds from something else must needs be second to that from which it proceeds, without being on that account separated: Where, however, there is a second, there must be two; and where there is a third, there must be three. Now the Spirit indeed is third from God and the Son; just as the fruit of the tree is third from the root, or as the stream out of the river is third from the fountain, or as the apex of the ray is third from the sun. Nothing, however, is alien from that original source whence it derives its own properties. In like manner the Trinity, flowing down from the Father through intertwined and connected steps, does not at all disturb the Monarchy,[fn-104-P10495_2940894:94-nf] whilst it at the same time guards the state of the Economy.[fn-104-P10496_2940992:95-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Again, whose doctrine does He announce, at which all were astonished?[fn-107-P10717_3009129:274-nf] Was it His own or the Father's? So, when they were in doubt among themselves whether He were the Christ (not as being the Father, of course but as the Son), He says to them \"You are not ignorant whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but He that sent me is true, whom ye know not; but I know Him, because I am from Him.\"[fn-107-P10718_3009482:275-nf] He did not say, Because I myself am He; and, I have sent mine own self: but His words are, \"He hath sent me.\" When, likewise, the Pharisees sent men to apprehend Him, He says: \"Yet a little while am I with you, and (then) I go unto Him that sent me.\"[fn-107-P10719_3009753:276-nf] When, however, He declares that He is not alone, and uses these words, \"but I and the Father that sent me,\"[fn-107-P10720_3009877:277-nf] does He not show that there are Two-Two, and yet inseparable? Indeed, this was the sum: and substance of what He was teaching them, that they were inseparably Two; since, after citing the law when it affirms the truth of two men's testimony,[fn-107-P10721_3010141:278-nf] He adds at once: \"I am one who am bearing witness of myself; and the Father (is another, ) who hath sent me, and beareth witness of me.\"[fn-107-P10722_3010294:279-nf] Now, if He were one-being at once both the Son and the Father-He certainly would not have quoted the sanction of the law, which requires not the testimony of one, but of two. Likewise, when they asked Him where His Father was,[fn-107-P10723_3010537:280-nf] He answered them, that they had known neither Himself nor the Father; and in this answer He plainly told them of Two, whom they were ignorant of. Granted that \"if they had known Him, they would have known the Father also,\"[fn-107-P10724_3010776:281-nf] this certainly does not imply that He was Himself both Father and Son; but that, by reason of the inseparability of the Two, it was impossible for one of them to be either acknowledged or unknown without the other. \"He that sent me,\" says He, \"is true; and I am telling the world those things which I have heard of Him.\"[fn-107-P10725_3011113:282-nf] And the Scripture narrative goes on to explain in an exoteric manner, that \"they understood not that He spake to them concerning the Father,\"[fn-107-P10726_3011277:283-nf] although they ought certainly to have known that the Father's words were uttered in the Son, because they read in Jeremiah, \"And the Lord said to me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth; \"[fn-107-P10727_3011487:284-nf] and again in Isaiah, \"The Lord hath given to me the tongue of learning that I should understand when to speak a word in season.\"[fn-107-P10728_3011634:285-nf] In accordance with which, Christ Himself says: \"Then shall ye know that I am He and that I am saying nothing of my own self; but that, as my Father hath taught me, so I speak, because He that sent me is with me.\"[fn-107-P10729_3011865:286-nf] This also amounts to a proof that they were Two, (although) undivided.

Likewise, when upbraiding the Jews in His discussion with them, because they wished to kill Him, He said, \"I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and ye do that which ye have seen with your father; \"[fn-107-P10730_3012170:287-nf] \"but now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God; \"[fn-107-P10731_3012279:288-nf] and again, \"If God were your Father, ye would love me, for I proceeded forth and came from God \"[fn-107-P10732_3012392:289-nf] (still they are not hereby separated, although He declares that He proceeded forth from the Father. Some persons indeed seize the opportunity afforded them in these words to propound their heresy of His separation; but His coming out from God is like the ray's procession from the sun, and the river's from the fountain, and the tree's from the seed); \"I have not a devil, but I honour my Father; \"[fn-107-P10733_3012807:290-nf] again, \"If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say, that He is your God: yet ye have not known Him, but I know Him; and if I should say, I know Him not, I shall be a liar like unto you; but I know Him, and keep His saying.\"[fn-107-P10734_3013096:291-nf] But when He goes on to say, \"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad,\"[fn-107-P10735_3013226:292-nf] He certainly proves that it was not the Father that appeared to Abraham, but the Son. In like manner He declares, in the case of the man born blind, \"that He must do the works of the Father which had sent Him; \"[fn-107-P10736_3013454:293-nf] and after He had given the man sight, He said to him, \"Dost thou believe in the Son of God? \"Then, upon the man's inquiring who He was, He proceeded to reveal Himself to him, as that Son of God whom He had announced to him as the right object of his faith.[fn-107-P10737_3013730:294-nf] In a later passage He declares that He is known by the Father, and the Father by Him;[fn-107-P10738_3013836:295-nf] adding that He was so wholly loved by the Father, that He was laying down His life, because He had received this commandment from the Father.[fn-107-P10739_3013997:296-nf] When He was asked by the Jews if He were the very Christ[fn-107-P10740_3014078:297-nf] (meaning, of course, the Christ of God; for to this day the Jews expect not the Father Himself, but the Christ of God, it being nowhere said that the Father will come as the Christ), He said to them, \"I am telling you, and yet ye do not believe: the works which I am doing, in my Father's name, they actually bear witness of me.\"[fn-107-P10741_3014424:298-nf] Witness of what? Of that very thing, to be sure, of which they were making inquiry-whether He were the Christ of God. Then, again, concerning His sheep, and (the assurance) that no man should pluck them out of His hand,[fn-107-P10742_3014660:299-nf] He says, \"My Father, which gave them to me, is greater than all; \"[fn-107-P10743_3014744:300-nf] adding immediately, \"I am and my Father are one.\"[fn-107-P10744_3014810:301-nf] Here, then, they take their stand, too infatuated, nay, too blind, to see in the first place that there is in this passage an intimation of Two Beings-\"I and my Father; \"then that there is a plural predicate, \"are,\" inapplicable to one person only; and lastly, that (the predicate terminates in an abstract, not a personal noun)-\"we are one thing\" Unum, not \"one person\" Unus. For if He had said \"one Person,\" He might have rendered some assistance to their opinion. Unus, no doubt, indicates the singular number; but (here we have a case where) \"Two\" are still the subject in the masculine gender. He accordingly says Unum, a neuter term, which does not imply singularity of number, but unity of essence, likeness, conjunction, affection on the Father's part, who loves the Son, and submission on the Son's, who obeys the Father's will. When He says, \"I and my Father are one\" in essence-Unum-He shows that there are Two, whom He puts on an equality and unites in one. He therefore adds to this very statement, that He \"had showed them many works from the Father,\" for none of which did He deserve to be stoned.[fn-107-P10745_3015939:302-nf] And to prevent their thinking Him deserving of this fate, as if He had claimed to be considered as God Himself, that is, the Father, by having said, \"I and my Father are One,\" representing Himself as the Father's divine Son, and not as God Himself, He says, \"If it is written in your law, I said, Ye are gods; and if the Scripture cannot be broken, say ye of Him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, that He blasphemeth, because He said, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; but if I do, even if ye will not believe me, still believe the works; and know that I am in the Father, and the Father in me.\"[fn-107-P10746_3016616:303-nf] It must therefore be by the works that the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father; and so it is by the works that we understand that the Father is one with the Son. All along did He therefore strenuously aim at this conclusion, that while they were of one power and essence, they should still be believed to be Two; for otherwise, unless they were believed to be Two, the Son could not possibly be believed to have any existence at all.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_120_letter_cxx_to_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus_on_perseverance_in_the_faith_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Exult therefore, beloved brother, yes, exult triumphantly in the only-begotten Son of God.

The robber is laid low, and there is restored to our age the mystery of the Divine Incarnation which the enemy of mankind was obscuring with his chicaneries, because the facts would not let him actually destroy it. Nay, the immortal mystery had perished from the hearts of unbelievers, because so great salvation is of no avail to unbelievers, as the Very Truth said to His disciples: \"he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be condemned[fn-21-P2103_496021:3-nf] .\" The rays of the Sun of Righteousness which were obscured throughout the East by the clouds of Nestorius and Eutyches, have shone out brightly from the West, where it has reached its zenith in the Apostles and teachers of the Church. And yet not even in the East is it to be believed that it was ever eclipsed where noble confessors[fn-21-P2104_496376:4-nf] have been found among your ranks: so that, when the old enemy was trying afresh, through the impenitent heart of a modern Pharaoh[fn-21-P2105_496560:5-nf] , to blot out the seed of faithful Abraham and the sons of promise, he grew weary, through God's mercy, and could harm no one save himself. And in regard to him the Almighty has worked this wonder also, in that He has not overwhelmed with the founder of the tyranny those who were associated with him in the slaughter of the people of Israel, but has gathered them into His own people; and as the Source of all mercy knew to be worthy of Himself and possible for Himself alone, He has made them conquerors with us who were conquered by us. For whilst the spirit of falsehood is the only true enemy of the human race, it is undoubted that all whom the Truth has won over to His side share in His triumph over that enemy. Assuredly it now is clear how divinely authorized are these words of our Redeemer, which are so applicable to the enemies of the Faith that one may not doubt they were said of them: \"You,\" He says, \"are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to fulfil.

In this, too, their sheer madness betrayed its origin, because, as far as it could, it attempted to injure everybody. For he, who afflicted you with his persecutions, led others wrong by driving them to consent to his wickedness. Yea, even us too, although he had wounded us in each one of the brethren (for they are our members), even us he did not exempt from special vexation in attempting to inflict an injury upon his Head with strange and unheard of and incredible effrontery[fn-21-P2111_499077:8-nf] . But would that he had recovered his senses even after all these enormities, and had not saddened us by his death and eternal damnation. There was no measure of wickedness that he did not reach: it was not enough for him that, sparing neither living nor dead, and forswearing truth and allying himself with falsehood, he imbrued his hands, that had been already long polluted, in the blood of a guiltless, catholic priest[fn-21-P2112_499721:9-nf] .

Did He then wish them when they were already discharging the function of Apostles to proclaim that He was the Christ? For, if He wished it, it is fitting to inquire why He now at all commands the disciples that they should not say that He was the Christ? Or if He did not wish it, how can the things concerning the apostleship be safely maintained? And these things also one may inquire at this place,-whether, when He sent away the Twelve, He did not send them away with the understanding that He was the Christ? But if the Twelve had such understanding, manifestly Peter had it also; how, then, is he now pronounced blessed? For the expression here plainly indicates that now for the first time Peter confessed that Christ was the Son of the living God, Matthew then, according to some of the manuscripts, has written, \"Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no man that He was the Christ,\" but[fn-79-P7963_1697047:111-nf] Mark says, \"He charged them that they should tell no man of Him; \"[fn-79-P7964_1697136:112-nf] and Luke, \"He charged them and commanded them to tell this to no man.\"[fn-79-P7965_1697229:113-nf] But what is the \"this\"? Was it that also according to him, Peter answered and said to the question, \"Who say ye that I am.\"-\"The Christ, the Son of the living God? \"[fn-79-P7966_1697415:114-nf] You must know, however, that some manuscripts of the Gospel according to Matthew have, \"He charged.\"[fn-79-P7967_1697542:115-nf] The difficulty thus started seems to me a very real difficulty; but let a solution which cannot be impugned be sought out, and let the finder of it bring it forward before all, if it be more credible than that which shall be advanced by us as a fairly temperate view.[fn-79-P7968_1697832:116-nf] Consider, then, if you can say, that the belief that Jesus is the Christ is inferior to the knowledge of that which is believed. And perhaps also there is a difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as every one who knows does not know Him alike. From the words in John, \"If ye abide in My word, ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,\"[fn-79-P7969_1698243:117-nf] it is plain that belief without knowledge is inferior to knowing; but that there is a difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as all who know Him do not know Him equally, is a fact self-evident to any one who gives even a very little consideration to the matter. For who would not acknowledge, for example, that Timothy, though he knew that Jesus was the Christ, had not been enlightened to such an extent in the knowledge of Him as the Apostle had been enlightened? And who would not also admit this-that though many, speaking the truth, say about God, \"He has given to me a true knowledge of things that are,\" yet they will not say this with equal insight and apprehension of the things known, nor as knowing the same number of things? But it is not only in respect of the difference of knowing that those who know do not know alike, bat also according to that which is the source of the knowledge; so that according to this he who knows the Son by the revelation of the Father,[fn-79-P7970_1699263:118-nf] as Peter is testified to have known, has the highest beatitude. Now, if these views of ours are sound, you will consider whether the Twelve formerly believed but did not know; but, after believing, they gained also the rudiments of knowledge and knew a few things about Him; and afterwards they continued to advance in knowledge so that they were able to receive the knowledge from the Father who reveals the Son; in which position Peter was, when he was pronounced blessed; for also he is pronounced blessed not merely because he said, \"Thou art the Christ,\" but with the addition, \"the Son of the living God.\" Accordingly Mark and Luke who have recorded that Peter answered and said, \"Thou art the Christ,\" but have not given the addition found in Matthew, have not recorded that he was declared blessed for what had been said, nor the blessing which followed the declaration of blessedness, \"Thou art Peter,\"[fn-79-P7971_1700197:119-nf] etc.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":8,"verse":44,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"ANF-10","text":"But let us next see what was the thought of Peter when he answered and said to Jesus, \"Lord, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, \"[fn-81-P8166_1753216:239-nf] etc. And on this account these words call for very special examination, because Mark, in his own person, has added, \"For he wist not what to answer,\"[fn-81-P8167_1753413:240-nf] but Luke, \"not knowing,\" he says, \"what he spake.\"[fn-81-P8168_1753483:241-nf] You will consider, therefore, if he spake these things as in a trance, being filled with the spirit which moved him to say these things, which could not be a Holy Spirit; for John taught in the Gospel that, before the resurrection of the Saviour, no one had the Holy Spirit, saying, \"For the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\"[fn-81-P8169_1753853:242-nf] But if the Spirit was not yet, and he, not knowing what he said, spoke under the influence of some spirit, the spirit which caused these things to be said was some one of the spirits which had not yet been triumphed over in the cross, nor made a show of along with them, about whom it is written, \"Having put off from Himself the principalities and the powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in the cross.[fn-81-P8170_1754301:243-nf] \" But this spirit was perhaps that which is called a stumbling-block by Jesus, and which is spoken of as Satan in the passage, \"Get thee behind Me, Satan; thou art a stumbling-block unto me.'[fn-81-P8171_1754513:244-nf] But I know well that such things will offend many who meet with them, because they think thai it is opposed to sound reason that he should be spoken ill of who a little before had been pronounced blessed by Jesus, on the ground that the Father in heaven had revealed to him the things concerning the Saviour, to-wit, that He was verily Jesus, and the Christ, and the Son of the living God. But let such an one attend more exactly to the statements about Peter and the rest of the Apostles, how even they made requests as if they were yet alien from Him who was to redeem them from the enemy and purchase them with His own precious blood; or let them also, who will have it that even before the passion of Jesus the Apostles were perfect, tell us whence it came about that \"Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep.\"[fn-81-P8172_1755366:245-nf] But to anticipate something else of what follows and apply it to the subject in hand, I would raise in turn these questions,-whether it is possible for any one to find occasion of stumbling in Jesus apart from the working of the devil who caused him to stumble; and whether it is possible for any one to deny Jesus, and that in presence of a little maid and a doorkeeper and men most worthless, unless a spirit had been with him in his denial hostile to the Spirit which is given and the wisdom, (which is given) to those who are assisted by God to make confession, according to a certain desert of theirs. But he who has learned to refer the roots of sin to the father of sin, the devil, will not say that apart from him either the Apostles were caused to stumble, or that Peter denied Christ thrice before that well-known cock-crowing. But if this be so, consider whether perhaps with a view to make Jesus stumble, so far as was in his power, and to turn Him aside from the dispensation whose characteristic was suffering that brought salvation to men, which He undertook with great willingness, seeking to effect these things which seemed to contribute to this end, he himself also here wishes as it were, by deceit, to draw away Jesus, as if calling upon Him no longer to condescend to men, and come to them, and undergo death for them, but to abide on the high mountain with Moses and Elijah. But he promised also to build three tabernacles, one apart for Jesus, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, as if one tabernacle would not have sufficed for the three, if it had been necessary for them to be in tabernacles and in the high mountain. And perhaps also in this he acted with evil intent, when he incited him \"who did not know what he said,\" not desiring that Jesus and Moses and Elijah should be together, but desiring to separate them from one another, under pretext of the three tabernacles.\" And likewise it was a lie, \"It is good for us to be here; \"[fn-81-P8173_1757353:246-nf] for if it had been a good thing they would also have remained there. But if it were a lie, you will seek to know who caused the lie to be spoken; and especially since according to John, \"When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar and the father thereof; \"[fn-81-P8174_1757653:247-nf] and as there is no truth apart from the working of Him who says, \"I am the Truth,\"[fn-81-P8175_1757758:248-nf] so there is no lie apart from him who is the enemy of truth. These contrary qualities, accordingly, were still in Peter truth and falsehood; and from truth he said, \"Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God,\"[fn-81-P8176_1757993:249-nf] but from falsehood he said, \"May God be propitious to Thee, Lord, this shall not be unto Thee,\"[fn-81-P8177_1758111:250-nf] and also, \"It is good for us to be here.\"[fn-81-P8178_1758175:251-nf] But if any one will not admit that Peter spoke these things from any evil inspiration, but that his words were of his own mere choice, and it is demanded of him how he will interpret, \"not knowing what he said,\" and,[fn-81-P8179_1758414:252-nf] \"for he did not know what to answer,\"[fn-81-P8180_1758472:253-nf] he will say, that in the former case Peter held it to be a shameful thing and unworthy of Jesus to admit that the Son of the living God, the Christ, whom already the Father had revealed to him, should be killed; and in the: present case that, as having seen the two forms of Jesus and the one at the transfiguration which was much more excellent, being well pleased with that, he said that it was good to make their sojourning in that mountain, in order that he himself and those with him might rejoice as they beheld the transfiguration of Jesus and His face shining as the sun. and His garments white as the light, and, in addition to these things, might always behold in glory those whom they had once seen in glory, Moses and Elijah; and that they might rejoice at the things which they might hear, as they talked and held intercourse with each other, Moses and Elijah with Jesus, and Jesus with them.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":8,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_41_treatise_on_rebuke_and_grace","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now the Lord Himself not only shows us what evil we should shun, and what good we should do, which is all that the letter of the law is able to effect; but He moreover helps us that we may shun evil and do good,[fn-63-P6330_2429534:4-nf] which none can do without the Spirit of grace; and if this be wanting, the law comes in merely to make us guilty and to slay us.

Then when the apostle says, \"Now we pray to God that ye do no evil,\"[fn-63-P6390_2446483:40-nf] beyond a doubt he prays to God on their behalf for perseverance. For certainly he does not \"do no evil\" who forsakes good, and, not persevering in good, turns to the evil, from which he ought to turn aside.[fn-63-P6391_2446711:41-nf] In that place, moreover, where he says, \"I thank my God in every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making quest with joy for your fellowship[fn-63-P6392_2447232:42-nf] in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-63-P6393_2447438:43-nf] -what else does he promise to them from the mercy of God than perseverance in good to the end? And again where he says, \"Epaphras saluteth you, who is one of you, a servant ofChrist Jesus, always striving for you in prayer, that you may stand perfect and fulfilled in all the will of God,\"[fn-63-P6394_2447753:44-nf] -what is \"that you may stand\" but \"that you may persevere\"? Whence it was said of the devil, \"He stood not in the truth;\"[fn-63-P6395_2447893:45-nf] because he was there, but he did not continue. For assuredly those were already standing in the faith. And when we pray that he who stands may stand, we do not pray for anything else than that he may persevere. Jude the apostle, again, when he says, \"Now unto Him that is able to keep you without offence, and to establish you before the presence of His glory, immaculate in joy,\"[fn-63-P6396_2448294:46-nf] does he not most manifestly show that perseverance in good unto the end is God's gift? For what but a good perseverance does He give who preserves without offence that He may place before the presence of His glory immaculate in joy? What is it, moreover, that we read in the Acts of the Apostles: \"And when the Gentiles heard, they rejoiced and received the word of the Lord; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed\"?[fn-63-P6397_2448741:47-nf] Who could be ordained to eternal life save by the gift of perseverance? And when we read, \"He that shall persevere unto the end shall be saved;\"[fn-63-P6398_2448906:48-nf] with what salvation but eternal? And when, in the Lord's Prayer, we say to God the Father, \"Hallowed be Thy name,\"[fn-63-P6399_2449039:49-nf] what do we ask but that His name may be hallowed in us? And as this is already accomplished by means of the laver of regeneration, why is it daily asked by believers, except that we may persevere in that which is already done in us? For the blessed Cyprian also understands this in this manner, inasmuch as, in his exposition of the same prayer, he says: \"We say, 'Hallowed be Thy name,' not that we wish for God that He may be hallowed by our prayers, but that we ask of God that His name may be hallowed in us. But by whom is God hallowed; since He Himself hallows? Well, because He said, 'Be ye holy, since I also am holy;'[fn-64-P6400_2449684:50-nf] we ask and entreat that we who have been hallowed in baptism may persevere in that which we have begun to be.\"[fn-64-P6401_2449838:51-nf] Behold the most glorious martyr is of this opinion, that what in these words Christ's faithful people are daily asking is, that they may persevere in that which they have begun to be. And no one need doubt, but that whosoever prays from the Lord that he may persevere in good, confesses thereby that such perseverance is His gift.","title":"Treatise on Rebuke and Grace","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_41_treatise_on_rebuke_and_grace","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"100","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Finally, the Saviour Himself says, \"If ye continue in my word, ye are indeed my disciples.\"[fn-64-P6470_2472622:84-nf] ] Is Judas, then, to be reckoned among them, since he did not continue in His word?

In fine, he [Adam], not only with nobody to make him afraid, but, moreover, in spite of the authority of God's fear, using free will, did not stand in such a state of happiness, in such a facility[fn-65-P6549_2502969:124-nf] of [not] sinning. But these [the saints], I say, not trader the fear of the world, but in spite of the rage of the world lest they should stand, stood firm in the faith; while he could see the good things present which he was going to forsake, they could not see the good things future which they were going to receive. Whence is this, save by the gift of Him from whom they obtained mercy to be faithful; from whom they received the spirit, not of fear, whereby they would yield to the persecutors, but of power, and of love, and of continence, in which they could overcome allthreatenings, all seductions, all torments? To him, therefore, without any sin, was given the free will with which he was created; and he made it to serve sin. But although the will of these had been the servant of sin, it was delivered by Him who said, \"If the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed.\"[fn-65-P6550_2504026:125-nf] And by that grace they receive so great a freedom, that although as long as they live here they are fighting against sinful lusts, and some sins creep upon them unawares, on account of which they daily say, \"Forgive us our debts,\"[fn-65-P6551_2504279:126-nf] yet they do not any more obey the sin which is unto death, of which the Apostle John says, \"There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.\"[fn-65-P6552_2504460:127-nf] Concerning which sin (since it is not expressed) many and different notions may be entertained. I, however, say, that sin is to forsake even unto death the faith which worketh by love. This sin they no longer serve who are not in the first condition, as Adam, free; but are freed by the grace of God through the second Adam, and by that deliverance have that free will which enables them to serve God, not that by which they may be made captive by the devil. From being made free from sin they have become the servants of righteousness,[fn-65-P6553_2505018:128-nf] in which they will stand till the end, by the gift to them of perseverance from Him who foreknew them, and predestinated them, and called them according to His purpose, and justified them, and glorified them, since He has even already formed those things that are to come which He promised concerning them. And when He promised, \"Abraham believed Him, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.\"[fn-65-P6554_2505438:129-nf] For \"he gave glory to God, most fully believing,\" as it is written, \"that what He has promised He is able also to perform.\"[fn-65-P6555_2505593:130-nf] ","title":"Treatise on Rebuke and Grace","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":46,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"ANF-04","text":"4.

Let no man corrupt this your faith, if you desire to preserve a chaste virginity for the Bridegroom.

By this piety he will learn to understand also why Jesus answered thus, if by praying he knock at the door of truth, and do not approach it with wrangling. Only this much, while he fancies himself to know, or is ashamed because he does not know, why Jesus answered thus, let him beware lest he be constrained to believe either that the evangelist lied when he said, \"The mother of Jesus was there,\" or that Jesus Himself suffered for our sins by a counterfeit death and for our justification showed counterfeit scars; and that He spoke falsely in saying, \"If ye continue in my word, ye are my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.[fn-5-P577_266454:7-nf] For if He had a false mother, false flesh, false death, false wounds in His death, false scars in His, resurrection, then it will not be the truth, but rather falsehood, that shall make free those that believe on Him. Nay, on the contrary, let falsehood yield to truth, and let all be confounded who would have themselves be accounted truthspeaking, because they endeavor to prove Christ a deceiver, and will not have it said to them, We do not believe you because you lie, when they affirm that truth itself has lied. Nevertheless, if we ask them, Whence know you that Christ said, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee?\" they answer that they believe the Gospel. Then why do they not believe the Gospel when it says, \"The mother of Jesus was there,\" and, \"His mother said unto Him\"? Or if the Gospel lies here, how are we to believe it there, that Jesus said this, \"Woman, what have I to do with thee?\" Why do not those miserable men rather faithfully believe that the Lord did so answer, not to a stranger, but to His mother; and also piously seek to know why He did so answer? There is a great difference between him who says, I would know why Christ made this answer to His mother, and him who says, I know that it was not to His mother that Christ made this answer. It is one thing to be willing to understand what is shut up, another thing to be unwilling to believe what is open. He who says, I would know why Christ thus made answer to His mother, wishes the Gospel, in which he believes, opened up to him; but he who says, I know that it was not to His mother that Christ made this answer, accuses of falsehood the very Gospel, wherein he believed that Christ did so answer.","title":"Tractate VIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_13_tractate_viii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"8. Now then, if it seem good, brethren, those men being repulsed, and ever wandering in their own blindness, unless in humility they be healed, let us inquire why our Lord answered His mother in such a manner. He was in an extraordinary manner begotten of the Father without a mother, born of a mother without a father; without a mother He was God, without a father He was man; without a mother before all time, without a father in the end of times.

Let us first reply to those whom we proposed, to whom, indeed, we have already replied in great measure.

But can a man do penance, and accuse others, and judge and condemn them, all in the same moment? That would be as if a harlot who had abstained from her harlotry for a night or two, should feel called upon to begin writing laws in favour of chastity, and not only to enact these laws, but to proceed to throw down the monuments of all the women who have died, because she suspected that they had led lives like her own. You do penance for having formerly been a heretic, and you do right. But what has that to do with me who never was a heretic at all? You are right in doing penance for your error: but the true way of doing penance is, not by accusing others but by crying for mercy, not by condemning but by weeping. For what sincerity can there be in penitence when the penitent makes a decree of indulgence for himself? He who repents of what be has spoken ill does not cure his wound by speaking ill again, but by keeping silence. For thus it is written:[fn-86-P8689_2198022:45-nf] \"Thou hast sinned, be at peace.\" But now you first bring yourself in a criminal, then you absolve yourself from your crime, and forthwith change yourself from a criminal into a judge.

Besides, who will ever mend his ways on account of your penitence, when that very document, in which you are at once the penitent, the accuser and the judge, sends your readers back to those same doctrines as those which they are to read and to hold. Lastly, even if these things were not so, yet you yourself, after your penitence, have stopped up every avenue of forgiveness. You say that Origen himself repented of these doctrines, and that he sent a document to that effect to Fabian who was at that time Bishop of the city of Rome; and yet after this repentance of his, and after he has been dead a hundred and fifty years, you drag him into court and call for his condemnation. How is it possible then that you should receive forgiveness, even though you repent, since he who before was penitent for emitting those doctrines gains no forgiveness? He wrote just as you have written: he repented as you have repented.

Now, we should be the last to grudge to any human being that God should have compassion on him, and bring him out of perdition to salvation. At the same time, we should acknowledge in such a case the clemency shown in this act of compassion, and not the merit of the person whose life is undeniably blameworthy. Thus, in the case of the Jewish fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, who are mentioned by Christ in this verse, supposing it to be genuine, although they led wicked lives, as we may learn from their descendant Moses, or whoever was the author of the history called Genesis, which describes their conduct as having been most shocking and detestable we are ready to allow that they may, after all, be in the kingdom of heaven, in the place which they neither believed in, nor hoped for, as is plain enough from their books. But then it must be kept in mind that, as you yourselves confess, if they did attain to what is spoken of in this verse, it was something very different from the nether dungeons of woe to which their own deserts consigned them, and that their deliverance was the work of our Lord Christ, and the result of His mystic passion.

Still, it does not follow that, because Jesus pardoned a thief, we must approve of the habits and practices of thieves; any more than of the publicans and harlots, whose faults Jesus pardoned, declaring that they would go into the kingdom of heaven before those who behaved proudly.[fn-25-P2541_1536014:3-nf] For, when He acquitted the woman accused by the Jews as sinful, and as having been caught in adultery, He told her to sin no more.[fn-25-P2542_1536163:4-nf] If, then, He has done something of the same kind in the case of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, all the praise is His; for such actions towards souls are becoming in Him who maketh His sun to rise upon the evil and upon the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.[fn-25-P2543_1536459:5-nf] One thing perplexes me in your doctrine: why you limit your statements to the fathers of the Jews, and are not of opinion that the Gentile patriarchs had also a share in this grace of our Redeemer; especially as the Christian Church consists of their children more than of the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You will say that the Gentiles worshipped idols, and the Jews the Almighty God, and that therefore Jesus had regard only to the Jews. It would seem from this that the worship of the Almighty God is the sure way to hell, and that the Son must come to the aid of the worshipper of the Father. That is as you please.

If the latter, there is some addition He requires yet to make. But for Him to make any addition to His knowledge is absurd, since He is God. For none can be superior to the Word, or the teacher of the only Teacher. Will they not then own, though reluctant, that the perfect Word born of the perfect Father was begotten in perfection, according to oeconomic fore-ordination?

Well, I assert, simultaneously with His baptism by John, He becomes perfect? Manifestly. He did not then learn anything more from him? Certainly not.

For it were truly monstrous that that which is not complete should be called a gift (or act) of God's grace. Being perfect, He consequently bestows perfect gifts.

He came down therefore from whence He came, in the same manner as He goes thither from whence He descended. Whence if Christ were only man, He would not have come thence, and therefore would not depart thither, because He would riot have come thence. Moreover, by coming thence, whence as man He could not have come, He shows Himself to have come as God. For the Jews, ignorant and untaught in the matter of this very descent of His, made these heretics their successors, seeing that to them it is said, \"Ye know not whence I come, and whither I go: ye judge after the flesh.\" As much they as the Jews, holding that the carnal birth of Christ was the only one, believed that Christ was nothing else than man; not considering this point, that as man could not come from heaven, so as that he might return thither, He who descended thence must be God, seeing that man could not come thence. If Christ is only man, how does He say, \"Ye are from below, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world? \"[fn-102-P10239_3194298:104-nf] But therefore if every man is of this world, and Christ is for that reason in this world, is He only man? God forbid! But consider what He says: \"I am not of this world.\" Does He then speak falsely when He says \"of this world,\" if He is only man? Or if He does not speak falsely, He is not of this world; He is therefore not man only, because He is not of this world. But that it should not be a secret who He was, He declared whence He was: \"I,\" said He, \"am from above,\" that is, from heaven, whence man cannot come, for he was not made in heaven. He is God, therefore, who is from above, and therefore He is not of this world; although, moreover, in a certain manner He is of this word: wherefore Christ is not God only, but man also. As reasonably in the way in which He is not of this world according to the divinity of the Word, so He is of this world according to the frailty of the body that He has taken upon Him. For man is joined with God, and God is linked with man. But on that account this Christ here laid more stress on the one aspect of His sole divinity, because the Jewish blindness contemplated in Christ the aspect alone of the flesh; and thence in the present passage He passed over in silence the frailty of the body, which is of the world, and spoke of His divinity alone, which is not of the world: so that in proportion as they had inclined to believe Him to be only man, in that proportion Christ might draw them to consider His divinity, so as to believe Him to be God, desirous to overcome their incredulity concerning His divinity by omitting in the meantime any mention of His human condition, and by setting before them His divinity alone. If Christ is man only, how does He say, \"I proceeded forth and came from God,\"[fn-102-P10240_3196072:105-nf] when it is evident that man was made by God, and did not proceed forth from Him? But in the way in which as man He proceeded not from God, thus the Word of God proceeded, of whom it is said, \"My heart hath uttered forth a good Word; \"[fn-102-P10241_3196330:106-nf] which, because it is from God, is with reason also with God. And this, too, since it was not uttered without effect, reasonably makes all things: \"For all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-102-P10242_3196565:107-nf] But this Word whereby all things were made (is God). \"And God,\" says he, \"was the Word.\"[fn-102-P10243_3196673:108-nf] Therefore God proceeded from God, in that the Word which proceeded is God, who proceeded forth from God. If Christ is only man, how does He say, \"If any man shall keep my word, he shall not see death for ever? \"[fn-102-P10244_3196904:109-nf] Not to see death for ever! what is this but immortality? But immortality is the associate of divinity, because both the divinity is immortal, and immortality is the fruit of divinity. For every man is mortal; and immortality cannot be from that which is mortal. Therefore from Christ, as a mortal man, immortality cannot arise. \"But,\" says He, \"whosoever keepeth my word, shall not see death for ever; \"therefore the word of Christ affords immortality, and by immortality affords divinity. But although it is not possible to maintain that one who is himself mortal can make another immortal, yet this word of Christ not only sets forth, but affords immortality: certainly He is not man only who gives immortality, which if He were only man He could not give; but by giving divinity by immortality, He proves Himself to be God by offering divinity, which if He were not God He could not give. If Christ was only man, how did He say, \"Before Abraham was, I Am? \"[fn-102-P10245_3197889:110-nf] For no man can be before Him from whom he himself is; nor can it be that any one should have been prior to him of whom he himself has taken his origin. And yet Christ, although He is born of Abraham, says that He is before Abraham. Either, therefore, He says what is not true, and deceives, if He was not before Abraham, seeing that He was of Abraham; or He does not deceive, if He is also God, and was before Abraham. And if this were not so, it follows that, being of Abraham, He could not be before Abraham. If Christ was only man, how does He say, \"And I know them, and my sheep follow me; and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish? \"[fn-102-P10246_3198572:111-nf] And yet, since every man is bound by the laws of mortality, and therefore is unable to keep himself for ever, much more will he be unable to keep another for ever. But Christ promises to give salvation for ever, which if He does not give, He is a deceiver; if He gives, He is God. But He does not deceive, for He gives what He promises. Therefore He is God who proffers eternal salvation, which man, being unable to keep himself for ever, cannot be able to give to another. If Christ is only man, what is that which He says, \"I and the Father are one? \"[fn-102-P10247_3199149:112-nf] For how can it be that \"I and the Father are one,\" if He is not both God and the Son?-who may therefore be called one, seeing that He is of Himself, being both His Son, and being born of Him, being declared to have proceeded from Him, by which He is also God; which when the Jews thought to be hateful, and believed to be blasphemous, for that He had shown Himself in these discourses to be God, and therefore rushed at once to stoning, and set to work passionately to hurl stones, He strongly refuted His adversaries by the example and witness of the Scriptures. \"If,\" said He, \"He called them gods to whom the words of God were given, and the Scriptures cannot be broken, ye say of Him whom the Father sanctified, and sent into this world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God.\"[fn-102-P10248_3199967:113-nf] By which words He did not deny Himself to be God, but rather He confirmed the assertion that He was God. For because, undoubtedly, they are said to be gods unto whom the words of God were given, much more is He God who is found to be superior to all these. And nevertheless He refuted the calumny of blasphemy in a fitting manner with lawful tact.[fn-102-P10249_3200338:114-nf] For He wishes that He should be thus understood to be God, as the Son of God, and He would not wish to be understood to be the Father Himself. Thus He said that He was sent, and showed them that He had manifested many good works from the Father; whence He desired that He should not be understood to be the Father, but the Son. And in the latter portion of His defence He made mention of the Son, not the Father, when He said, \"Ye say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God.\" Thus, as far as pertains to the guilt of blasphemy, He calls Himself the Son, not the Father; but as pertaining to His divinity, by saying, \"I and the Father are one,\" He proved that He was the Son of God. He is God, therefore, but God in such a manner as to be the Son, not the Father.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":23,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"ANF-05","text":"If Christ is only man, how is it that He says, \"Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: because I know whence I came, and whither I go; ye know not whence I came, and whither I go.

But Christ promises to give salvation for ever, which if He does not give, He is a deceiver; if He gives, He is God. But He does not deceive, for He gives what He promises. Therefore He is God who proffers eternal salvation, which man, being unable to keep himself for ever, cannot be able to give to another.

For because, undoubtedly, they are said to be gods unto whom the words of God were given, much more is He God who is found to be superior to all these. And nevertheless He refuted the calumny of blasphemy in a fitting manner with lawful tact.[fn-102-P10249_3200338:114-nf] For He wishes that He should be thus understood to be God, as the Son of God, and He would not wish to be understood to be the Father Himself.

Moreover, by coming thence, whence as man He could not have come, He shows Himself to have come as God. For the Jews, ignorant and untaught in the matter of this very descent of His, made these heretics their successors, seeing that to them it is said, \"Ye know not whence I come, and whither I go: ye judge after the flesh.\" As much they as the Jews, holding that the carnal birth of Christ was the only one, believed that Christ was nothing else than man; not considering this point, that as man could not come from heaven, so as that he might return thither, He who descended thence must be God, seeing that man could not come thence.

Or if He does not speak falsely, He is not of this world; He is therefore not man only, because He is not of this world. But that it should not be a secret who He was, He declared whence He was: \"I,\" said He, \"am from above,\" that is, from heaven, whence man cannot come, for he was not made in heaven. He is God, therefore, who is from above, and therefore He is not of this world; although, moreover, in a certain manner He is of this word: wherefore Christ is not God only, but man also. As reasonably in the way in which He is not of this world according to the divinity of the Word, so He is of this world according to the frailty of the body that He has taken upon Him. For man is joined with God, and God is linked with man. But on that account this Christ here laid more stress on the one aspect of His sole divinity, because the Jewish blindness contemplated in Christ the aspect alone of the flesh; and thence in the present passage He passed over in silence the frailty of the body, which is of the world, and spoke of His divinity alone, which is not of the world: so that in proportion as they had inclined to believe Him to be only man, in that proportion Christ might draw them to consider His divinity, so as to believe Him to be God, desirous to overcome their incredulity concerning His divinity by omitting in the meantime any mention of His human condition, and by setting before them His divinity alone.

But immortality is the associate of divinity, because both the divinity is immortal, and immortality is the fruit of divinity. For every man is mortal; and immortality cannot be from that which is mortal. Therefore from Christ, as a mortal man, immortality cannot arise. \"But,\" says He, \"whosoever keepeth my word, shall not see death for ever; \"therefore the word of Christ affords immortality, and by immortality affords divinity. But although it is not possible to maintain that one who is himself mortal can make another immortal, yet this word of Christ not only sets forth, but affords immortality: certainly He is not man only who gives immortality, which if He were only man He could not give; but by giving divinity by immortality, He proves Himself to be God by offering divinity, which if He were not God He could not give.

But let us distinguish God's different ways of hearing prayer. For we find some not heard for their wish, heard for salvation: and again some we find heard for their wish, not heard for salvation. Mark this difference, hold fast this example of a man not heard for his wish but heard for salvation. Hear the apostle Paul; for what is the hearing of prayer unto salvation, God Himself showed him: \"Sufficient for thee,\" saith He, \"is my grace; for strength is perfected in weakness.\" Thou hast besought, hast cried, hast thrice cried: the very cry thou didst raise once for all I heard, I turned not away mine ears from thee; I know what I should do: thou wouldest have it taken away, the healing thing by which thou art burned; I know the infirmity by which thou art burdened. Well then: here is a man who was heard for salvation, while as to his will he was not heard. Where find we persons heard for their will, not heard for salvation? Do we find, think we, some wicked, some impious man, heard of God for his will, not heard for salvation? If I put to you the instance of some man, perchance thou wilt say to me, \"It is thou that callest him wicked, for he was righteous; had he not been righteous, his prayer would not have been heard by God.\"The instance I am about to allege is of one, of whose iniquity and impiety none can doubt. The devil himself: he asked for Job, and received.[fn-43-P4379_2369045:27-nf] Have ye not here also heard concerning the devil, that \"he that committeth sin is of the devil\"?[fn-43-P4380_2369163:28-nf] Not that the devil created, but that the sinner imitates. Is it not said of him, \"He stood not in the truth\"?[fn-43-P4381_2369296:29-nf] Is not even he \"that old serpent,\" who, through the woman pledged the first man in the drink of poison?[fn-43-P4382_2369420:30-nf] Who even in the case of Job, kept for him his wife, that by her the husband might be, not comforted, but tempted? The devil asked for a holy man, to tempt him; and he received: the apostle asked that the thorn in the flesh might be taken from him, and he received not. But the apostle was more heard than the devil. For the apostle was heard for salvation, though not for his wish: the devil was heard for his wish, but for damnation. For that Job was yielded up to him to be tempted, was in order that by his standing the proof the devil should be tormented. But this, my brethren, we find not only in the Old Testament books, but also in the Gospel. The demons besought the Lord, when He expelled them from the man, that they might be permitted to go into the swine. Should the Lord not have power to tell them not to approach even those creatures? For, had it not been His will to permit this, they were not about to rebel against the King of heaven and earth. But with a view to a certain mystery, with a certain[fn-43-P4383_2370457:31-nf] ulterior meaning, He let the demons go into the swine: to show that the devil hath dominion in them that lead the life of swine.[fn-43-P4384_2370612:32-nf] Demons then were heard in their request; was the apostle not heard?

Was it to escape being murdered?

And was not the great God, who had already sent two angels on your account, able to keep you, His only Son, there in safety? \"From these words Celsus seems to think that there was no element of divinity in the human body and soul of Jesus, but that His body was not even such as is described in the fables of Homer; and with a taunt also at the blood of Jesus which was shed upon the cross, he adds that it was not\"Ichor, such as flows in the veins of the blessed gods.\"[fn-79-P7967_1932480:130-nf] We now, believing Jesus Himself, when He says respecting His divinity, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life,\"[fn-79-P7968_1932622:131-nf] and employs other terms of similar import; and when He says respecting His being clothed with a human body, \"And now ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth,\"[fn-79-P7969_1932816:132-nf] conclude that He was a kind of compound being. And so it became Him who was making provision for His sojourning in the world as a human being, not to expose Himself unseasonably to the danger of death. And in like manner it was necessary that He should be taken away by His parents, acting under the instructions of an angel from heaven, who communicated to them the divine will, saying on the first occasion, \"Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost; \"[fn-79-P7970_1933381:133-nf] and on the second, \"Arise, and take the young Child, and His mother, and flee into Egypt; and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.\"[fn-79-P7971_1933591:134-nf] Now, what is recorded in these words appears to me to be not at all marvellous. For in either passage of Scripture it is stated that it was in a dream that the angel spoke these words; and that in a dream certain persons may have certain things pointed out to them to do, is an event of frequent occurrence to many individuals,-the impression on the mind being produced either by an angel or by some other thing. Where, then, is the absurdity in believing that He who had once become incarnate, should be led also by human guidance to keep out of the way of dangers? Not indeed from any impossibility that it should be otherwise, but from the moral fitness that ways and means should be made use of to ensure the safety of Jesus. And it was certainly better that the Child Jesus should escape the snare of Herod, and should reside with His parents in Egypt until the death of the conspirator, than that Divine Providence should hinder the free-will of Herod in his wish to put the Child to death, or that the fabled poetic helmet of Hades should have been employed, or anything of a similar kind done with respect to Jesus, or that they who came to destroy Him should have been smitten with blindness like the people of Sodom. For the sending of help to Him in a very miraculous and unnecessarily public manner, would not have been of any service to Him who, wished to show that as a man, to whom witness was borne by God, He possessed within that form which was seen by the eyes of men some higher element of divinity,-that which was properly the Son of God-God the Word-the power of God, and the wisdom of God-He who is called the Christ. But this is not a suitable occasion for discussing the composite nature of the incarnate Jesus; the investigation into such a subject being for believers, so to speak, a sort of private question.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":8,"verse":55,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_46_book_xii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"And so God, the Creator and Healer of all, knowing that pride is the cause and fountain head of evils, has been careful to heal opposites with opposites, that those things which were ruined by pride might be restored by humility.

For he that protects with a shield is the cause of him whom he protects not being wounded; preventing him, as he does, from being wounded. For the demon of Socrates was a cause, not by not preventing, but by exhorting, even if (strictly speaking) he did not exhort. And neither praises nor censures, neither rewards nor punishments, are right, when the soul has not the power of inclination and disinclination, but evil is involuntary. Whence he who prevents is a cause; while he who prevents not judges justly the soul's choice. So in no respect is God the author of evil. But since free choice and inclination originate sins, and a mistaken judgment sometimes prevails, from which, since it is ignorance and stupidity, we do not take pains to recede, punishments are rightly inflicted. For to take fever is involuntary; but when one takes fever through his own fault, from excess, we blame him. In as much, then, as evil is involuntary,-for no one prefers evil as evil; but induced by the pleasure that is in it, and imagining it good, considers it desirable;-such being the case, to free ourselves from ignorance, and from evil and voluptuous choice, and above all, to withhold our assent from those delusive phantasies, depends on ourselves.

For these are mystical expressions,[fn-46-P4693_2522612:56-nf] in which the point always to be considered is, not what the actual things are, but what they denote as signs: since they are signs of things, and what they are in their essence is one thing, what they are in their signification another. If then we understand the things signified, we do find these things to be of one substance. Thus, if we should say, the rock and the water are one, meaning by the Rock, Christ; by the water, the Holy Ghost: who doubts that rock and water are two different substances? yet because Christ and the Holy Spirit are of one and the same nature, therefore when one says, the rock and the water are one, this can be rightly taken in this behalf, that these two things of which the nature is diverse, are signs of other things of which the nature is one. Three things then we know to have issued from the Body of the Lord when He hung upon the tree: first, the spirit: of which it is written, \"And He bowed the head and gave up the spirit:\"[fn-46-P4694_2523863:57-nf] then, as His side was pierced by the spear, \"blood and water.\" Which three things if we look at as they are in themselves, they are in substance several land distinct, and therefore they are not one. But if we will inquire into the things signified I by these, there not unreasonably comes into our thoughts the Trinity itself, which is the One, Only, True, Supreme God, Father and Son and Holy Ghost, of whom it could most truly be said, \"There are Three Witnesses, and the Three are One:\" so that by the term Spirit we should understand God the Father to be signified; as indeed it was concerning the worshipping of Him that the Lord was speaking, when He said, \"God is a Spirit:\"[fn-46-P4695_2524563:58-nf] by the term, blood, the Son; because \"the Word was made flesh:\"[fn-46-P4696_2524650:59-nf] and by the term water, the Holy Ghost; as, when Jesus spake of the water which He would give to them that thirst, the evangelist saith, \"But this said He of the Spirit which they that believed on Him were to receive.\"[fn-46-P4697_2524886:60-nf] Moreover, that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are \"Witnesses,\" who that believes the Gospel can doubt, when the Son saith, \"I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me, He beareth witness of me.\"[fn-46-P4698_2525122:61-nf] Where, though the Holy Ghost is not mentioned, yet He is not to be thought separated from them. Howbeit neither concerning the Spirit hath He kept silence elsewhere, and that He too is a witness hath been sufficiently and openly shown. For in promising Him He said, \"He shall bear witness of me.\"[fn-46-P4699_2525438:62-nf] These are the \"Three Witnesses, and the Three are One, because of one substance. But whereas, the signs by which they were signified came forth from the Body of the Lord, herein they figured the Church preaching the Trinity, that it hath one and the same nature: since these Three in threefold manner signified are One, and the Church that preacheth them is the Body of Christ. In this manner then the three things by which they are signified came out from the Body: of the Lord: like as from the Body of the Lord sounded forth the command to \"baptize the nations in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-47-P4700_2526088:63-nf] \"In the name:\" not, In the names: for \"these Three are One,\" and One God is these Three. And if in any other way this depth of mystery which we read in John's epistle can be expounded and understood agreeably with the Catholic faith, which neither confounds nor divides the Trinity, neither believes the substances diverse nor denies that the persons are three, it is on no account to be rejected. For whenever in Holy Scriptures in order to exercise the minds of the faithful any thing is put darkly, it is to be joyfully welcomed if it can be in many ways but not unwisely expounded.","title":"Homily X.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_51_iii_conference_of_abbot_paphnutius_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"Wherefore it Will not be of much advantage to us that we have made our first renunciation with the utmost devotion and faith, if we do not complete the second with the same zeal and ardour.

And of this no one can understand the truth and force, except one who has made trial of what has been said, under the teaching of experience; viz., one, the eyes of whose soul the Lord has turned away from all things present, so that he no longer considers them as things that will soon pass away, but as things that are already done with, and sees them vanish into nothing, like misty smoke; and like Enoch, \"walking with God,\" and \"translated\" from human life and fashions, not \"be found\" amid the vanities of this life: And that this actually happened corporeally in the case of Enoch the book of Genesis thus tells us. \"And Enoch walked with God, and was not found, for God translated him.\" And the Apostle also says: \"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death,\" the death namely of which the Lord says in the gospel: \"He that liveth and believeth in me shall not die eternally.\"[fn-38-P3840_1431450:22-nf] Wherefore, if we are anxious to attain true perfection, we ought to look to it that as we have outwardly with the body made light of parents, home, the riches and pleasures of the world, we may also inwardly with the heart forsake all these things and never be drawn back by any desires to those things which we have forsaken, as those who were led up by Moses, though they did not literally go back, are yet said to have returned in heart to Egypt; viz., by forsaking God who had led them forth with such mighty signs, and by worshipping the idols of Egypt of which they had thought scorn, as Scripture says: \"And in their hearts they turned back into Egypt, saying to Aaron: Make us gods to go before us,\"[fn-38-P3841_1432211:23-nf] for we should fall into like condemnation with those who, while dwelling in the wilderness, after they had tasted manna from heaven, lusted after the filthy food of sins, and of mean baseness, and should seem together with them to murmur in the same way: \"It was well with us in Egypt, when we sat over the flesh pots and ate the onions, and garlic, and cucumbers, and melons:\"[fn-38-P3842_1432612:24-nf] A form of speech, which, although it referred primarily to that people, we yet see fulfilled today in our own case and mode of life: for everyone who after renouncing this world turns back to his old desires, and reverts to his former likings asserts in heart and act the very same thing that they did, and says \"It was well with me in Egypt,\" and I am afraid that the number of these will be as large as that of the multitudes of backsliders of whom we read under Moses, for though they were reckoned as six hundred and three thousand armed men who came out of Egypt, of this number not more than two entered the land of promise. Wherefore we should be careful to take examples of goodness from those who are few and far between, because according to that figure of which we have spoken in the gospel \"Many are called but few\" are said to be \"chosen.\"[fn-38-P3843_1433511:25-nf] A renunciation then in body alone, and a mere change of place from Egypt will not do us any good, if we do not succeed in achieving that renunciation in heart, which is far higher and more valuable. For of that mere bodily renunciation of which we have spoken the apostle declares as follows: \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-38-P3844_1433955:26-nf] And the blessed Apostle would never have said this had it not been that he foresaw by the spirit that some who had given all their goods to feed the poor would not be able to attain to evangelical perfection and the lofty heights of charity, because while pride or impatience ruled over their hearts they were not careful to purify themselves from their former sins, and unrestrained habits, and on that account could never attain to that love of God which never faileth, and these, as they fall short in this second stage of renunciation, can still less reach that third stage which is most certainly far higher. But consider too in your minds with great care the fact that he did not simply say \"If I bestow my goods.\" For it might perhaps be thought that he spoke of one who had not fulfilled the command of the gospel, but had kept back something for himself, as some half-hearted persons do. But he says \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,\" i.e., even if my renunciation of those earthly riches be perfect. And to this renunciation he adds something still greater: \"And though I give my body to be burned, but have not charity, I am nothing:\" As if he had said in other words, though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor in accordance with that command in the gospel, where we are told \"If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,\"[fn-38-P3845_1435398:27-nf] renouncing them so as to keep back nothing at all for myself, and though to this distribution (of my goods) I should by the burning of my flesh add martyrdom so as to give up my body for Christ, and yet be impatient, or passionate or envious or proud, or excited by wrongs done by others, or seek what is mine, or indulge in evil thoughts, or not be ready and patient in bearing all that can be inflicted on me, this renunciation and the burning of the outer man will profit me nothing, while the inner man is still involved in the former sins, because, while in the fervour of the early days of my conversion I made light of the mere worldly substance, which is said to be not good or evil in itself but indifferent, I took no care to cast out in like manner the injurious powers of a bad heart, or to attain to that love of the Lord which is patient, which is \"kind, which envieth not, is not puffed up, is not soon angry, dealeth not perversely, seeketh not her own, thinketh no evil,\" which \"beareth all things, endureth all things,\"[fn-38-P3846_1436459:28-nf] and which lastly never suffers him who follows after it to fall by the deceitfulness of sin.","title":"III.

But according to the cycle and progress of the days, after which one is termed first, another second, and another third, if anybody seeks diligently to learn upon what day out of the seven it was that Adam died, he will find it by examining the dispensation of the Lord. For by summing up in Himself the whole human race from the beginning to the end, He has also summed up its death. From this it is clear that the Lord suffered death, in obedience to His Father, upon that day on which Adam died while he disobeyed God. Now he died on the same day in which he did eat. For God said, \"In that day on which ye shall eat of it, ye shall die by death.\" The Lord, therefore, recapitulating in Himself this day, underwent His sufferings upon the day preceding the Sabbath, that is, the sixth day of the creation, on which day man was created; thus granting him a second creation by means of His passion, which is that [creation] out of death.

And therefore in the case of those who sinned before the law and even before the flood we see that God visited them with a righteous judgment, because they deserved to be punished without any excuse, for having transgressed the law of nature; nor should we fall into the blasphemous slanders of those who are ignorant of this reason, and so depreciate the God of the Old Testament, and run down our faith, and say with a sneer: Why then did it please your God to will to promulgate the law after so many thousand years, While He suffered such long ages to pass without any law? But if He afterwards discovered something better, then it appears that at the beginning of the world His wisdom was inferior and poorer, and that afterwards as if taught by experience He began to provide for something better, and to amend and improve His original arrangements. Athing which certainly cannot happen to the infinite foreknowledge of God, nor can these assertions be made about Him by the mad folly of heretics without grievous blasphemy, as Ecclesiastes says: \"I have learnt that all the words which God hath made from the beginning shall continue forever: nothing can be added to them, and nothing can be taken away from them,\"[fn-47-P4763_1731280:53-nf] and therefore \"the law is not made for the righteous, but for the unrighteous, and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the wicked and profane.\"[fn-47-P4764_1731459:54-nf] For as they had the sound and complete system of natural laws implanted in them they had no need of this external law in addition, and one committed to writing, and what was given as an aid to that natural law. From which we infer by the clearest of reasonings that that law committed to writing need not have been given at the beginning (for it was unnecessary for this to be done while the natural law still remained, and was not utterly violated) nor could evangelical perfection have been granted before the law had been kept. For they could not have listened to this saying: \"If a man strikes thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also,\"[fn-47-P4765_1732129:55-nf] who were not content to avenge wrongs done to them with the even justice of the lex talionis, but repaid a very slight touch with deadly kicks and wounds with weapons, and for a single truth sought to take the life of those who had struck them.

For as we said a little while ago spirit does not beget spirit just as soul cannot procreate soul, though we do not doubt that the compacting of flesh is formed from man's seed, as the Apostle clearly distinguishes in the case of both substances; viz., flesh and spirit, what should be ascribed to whom as its author, and says: \"Moreover we have had fathers of our flesh for instructors, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? \"[fn-47-P4772_1733535:58-nf] What could show more clearly than this distinction, that he laid down that men were the fathers of our flesh, but always taught that God alone was the Father of souls. Although even in the actual compacting of this body a ministerial office alone must be attributed to men, but the chief part of its formation to God the Creator of all, as David says: \"Thy hands have made me and fashioned me:\"[fn-47-P4773_1733949:59-nf] And the blessed Job: \"Hast thou not milked me as milk, and curdled me as cheese? Thou hast put me together with bones and sinews;\"[fn-47-P4774_1734098:60-nf] and the Lord to Jeremiah: \"Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee.\"[fn-47-P4775_1734196:61-nf] But Ecclesiastes very clearly and accurately gathers the nature of either substance, and its beginning, by an examination of the rise and commencement, from which each originated, and by a consideration of the end to which each is tending, and decides also of the division of this body and soul, and discourses as follows: \"Before the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns unto God who gave it.\"[fn-47-P4776_1734632:62-nf] But what could be said with greater plainness than that he declares that the matter of the flesh which he styled dust, because it springs from the seed of man, and seems to be sown by his ministration, mush as it was taken from the earth, again return to the earth, while he points out that the spirit which is not begotten by intercourse between the sexes, but belongs to God alone in a special way, returns to its creator? And this also is clearly implied in that breathing by God, through which Adam in the first instance received his life. And so from these passages we clearly infer that no one can be called the Father of spirits but God alone, who makes them out of nothing whenever He pleases, while men can only be termed the fathers of our flesh. So then the devil also in as much as he was created a spirit or an angel and good, had no one as his Father but God his Maker. But when he had become puffed up by pride and had said in his heart: \"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High,\"[fn-47-P4777_1735685:63-nf] he became a liar, and \"abode not in the truth;\"[fn-47-P4778_1735773:64-nf] but brought forth a lie from his own storehouse of wickedness and so became not only a liar, but also the father of the actual lie, by which when he promised Divinity to man and said \"Ye shall be as gods,\"[fn-47-P4779_1736259:65-nf] he abode not in the truth, but from the beginning became a murderer, both by bringing Adam into a state of mortality, and by slaying Abel by the hand of his brother at his suggestion. But already the approach of dawn is bringing to a close our discussion, which has occupied nearly two whole nights, and our brief and simple words have drawn our bark of this Conference from the deep sea of questions to a safe harbour of silence, in which deep indeed, as the breath of the Divine Spirit drives us further in, so is there ever opened out a wider and boundless space reaching beyond the sight of our eye, and, as Solomon says, \"It will become much further from us than it was, and a great depth; who shall find it out?\"[fn-47-P4780_1737004:66-nf] Wherefore let us pray the Lord that both His fear and His love, which cannot fail, may continue steadfast in us, and make us wise in all things, and ever shield us unharmed, from the darts of the devil. For with these guards it is impossible for anyone to fall into the snares of death. But there is this difference between the perfect and imperfect, that in the case of the former love is steadfast, and so to speak riper and lasts more abidingly and so makes them persevere in holiness more steadfastly and more easily, while in the case of the latter its position is weaker and it more easily grows cold, and so quickly and more frequently allows them to be entangled in the snares of sin. And when we heard this, the words of this Conference so fired us that when we went away from the old man's cell we longed with a keener ardour of soul than when we first came, for the fulfilment of his teaching.","title":"VIII.

'Already in passing I have spoken on these things, and now I must not shrink from speaking on them at greater length, for to put you in remembrance will be a source of safety. Since the Lord visited earth[fn-37-P3733_1547987:66-nf] , the enemy is fallen and his powers weakened. Wherefore although he could do nothing, still like a tyrant, he did not bear his fall quietly, but threatened, though his threats were words only. And let each one of you consider this, and he will be able to despise the demons. Now if they were hampered with such bodies as we are, it would be possible for them to say, \"Men when they are hidden we cannot find, but whenever we do find them we do them hurt.\" And we also by lying in concealment could escape them, shutting the doors against them. But if they are not of such a nature as this, but are able to enter in, though the doors be shut, and haunt all the air, both they and their leader the devil, and are wishful for evil and ready to injure; and, as the Saviour said, \"From the beginning the devil is a manslayer and a father of vice[fn-37-P3734_1548855:67-nf] ;\" while we, though this is so, are alive, and spend our lives all the more in opposing him; it is plain they are powerless. For place is no hindrance to their plots, nor do they look on us as friends that they should spare us; nor are they lovers of good that they should amend. But on the contrary they are evil, and nothing is so much sought after by them as wounding them that love virtue and fear God. But since they have no power to effect anything, they do nought but threaten. But if they could, they would not hesitate, but forthwith work evil (for all their desire is set on this), and especially against us. Behold now we are gathered together and speak against them, and they know when we advance they grow weak. If therefore they had power they would permit none of us Christians to live, for godliness is an abomination to a sinner[fn-37-P3735_1549722:68-nf] . But since they can do nothing they inflict the greater wounds on themselves; for they can fulfil none of their threats. Next this ought to be considered, that we may be in no fear of them: that if they had the power they would not come in crowds, nor fashion displays, nor with change of form would they frame deceits. But it would suffice that one only should come and accomplish that which he wasboth able and willing to do: especially as every one who has the power neither slays with display nor strikes fear with tumult, but forthwith makes full use of his authority as he wishes. But the demons as they have no power are like actors on the stage changing their shape and frightening children with tumultuous apparition and various forms: from which they ought rather to be despised as shewing their weakness. At least the true angel of the Lord sent against the Assyrian had no need for tumults nor displays from without, nor noises nor rattlings, but in quiet he used his power and forthwith destroyed a hundred and eighty-five thousand. But demons like these, who have no power, try to terrify at least by their displays[fn-37-P3736_1550880:69-nf] .","title":"Life of Antony","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":8,"verse":56,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_38_life_of_antony","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"36. `But the inroad and the display of the evil spirits is fraught with confusion, with din, with sounds and cryings such as the disturbance of boorish youths or robbers would occasion.

For the New Testament arose out of the Old, and bears witness to the Old; if then they reject this, how can they receive what proceeds from it? Thus Paul was an Apostle of the Gospel, `which God promised afore by His prophets in the holy Scriptures[fn-39-P3939_1655212:21-nf] :' and our Lord Himself said, `ye search the Scriptures, for they are they which testify of Me[fn-39-P3940_1655323:22-nf] .' How then shall they confess the Lord unless they first search the Scriptures which are written concerning Him? And the disciples say that they have found Him, `of whom Moses and the Prophets did write[fn-39-P3941_1655544:23-nf] .' And what is the Law to the Sadducees if they receive not the Prophets[fn-39-P3942_1655634:24-nf] ? For God who gave the Law, Himself promised in the Law that He would raise up Prophets also, so that the same is Lord both of the Law and of the Prophets, and he that denies the one must of necessity deny the other also. And again, what is the Old Testament to the Jews, unless they acknowledge the Lord whose coming was expected according to it? For had they believed the writings of Moses, they would have believed the words of the Lord; for He said, `He wrote of Me[fn-39-P3943_1656165:25-nf] .' Moreover, what are the Scriptures to him[fn-39-P3944_1656226:26-nf] of Samosata, who denies the Word of God and His incarnate Presence[fn-39-P3945_1656330:27-nf] , which is signified and declared both in the Old and New Testament? And of what use are the Scriptures to the Arians also, and why do they bring them forward, men who say that the Word of God is a creature, and like the Gentiles `serve the creature more than' God `the Creator[fn-39-P3946_1656629:28-nf] ?' Thus each of these heresies, in respect of the peculiar impiety of its invention, has nothing in common with the Scriptures. And their advocates are aware of this, that the Scriptures are very much, or rather altogether, opposed to the doctrines of every one of them; but for the sake of deceiving the more simple sort (such as are those of whom it is written in the Proverbs, `The simple believeth every word[fn-39-P3947_1657059:29-nf] ),' they pretend like their `father the devil[fn-39-P3948_1657125:30-nf] ' to study and to quote the language of Scripture, in order that they may appear by their words to have a right belief, and so may persuade their wretched followers to believe what is contrary to the Scriptures. Assuredly in every one of these heresies the devil has thus disguised himself, and has suggested to them words full of craftiness. The Lord spake concerning them, that `there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, so that they shall deceive many[fn-39-P3949_1657610:31-nf] .' Accordingly the devil has come, speaking by each and saying, `I am Christ, and the truth is with me;' and he has made them, one and all, to be liars like himself. And strange it is, that while all heresies are at variance with one another concerning the mischievous inventions which each has framed, they are united together only by the common purpose of lying[fn-39-P3950_1657995:32-nf] . For they have one and the same father that has sown in them all the seeds, of falsehood. Wherefore the faithful Christian and true disciple of the Gospel, having grace to discern spiritual things, and having built the house of his faith upon a rock, stands continually firm and secure from their deceits. But the simple person, as I said before, that is not thoroughly grounded in knowledge, such an one, considering only the words that are spoken and not perceiving their meaning, is immediately drawn away by their wiles. Wherefore it is good and needful for us to pray that we may receive the gift of discerning spirits, so that every one may know, according to the precept of John, whom he ought to reject, and whom to receive as friends and of the same faith. Now one might write at great length concerning these things, if one desired to go rate details respecting them; for the impiety and perverseness of heresies will appear to be manifold and various, and the craft of the deceivers to be very terrible. But since holy Scripture is of all things most sufficient[fn-39-P3951_1659094:33-nf] for us, therefore recommending to those who desire to know more of these matters, to read the Divine word, I now hasten to set before you that which most claims attention, and for the sake of which principally I have written these things.","title":"To the Bishops of Egypt","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":8,"verse":43,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_40_to_the_bishops_of_egypt","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"But when they proceed from those who are hired to advocate the cause of heresy, and since, according to the divine proverb, `The words of the wicked are to lie in wait,' and `The mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things,' and `The counsels of the wicked are deceit[fn-39-P3984_1670430:57-nf] :' it becomes us to watch and be sober, brethren, as the Lord has said, lest any deception arise from subtlety of speech and craftiness; lest any one come and pretend to say, `I preach Christ,' and after a little while he be found to be Antichrist.

The apostle convicts them, and says of them, \"Because that which is known of God is manifest to them; for God has showed it unto them.\" Hear ye what he says of certain unthankful, ungodly men: \"For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are seen, being understood by the things that are made, His eternal power likewise, and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.\" Why without excuse? \"Because, knowing God\" (he said not, \"because they knew Him not \"), \"they glorified Him not as God, nor were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened: professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.\"[fn-8-P821_436605:1-nf] If they had known God, they had known at the same time that God, and none other, had made them wise; and they would not then attribute to themselves that which they did not have from themselves, but to Him from whom they had received it. But by their unthankfulness they became fools. Therefore, what God gave freely, He took from the unthankful. John would not be this; he would be thankful: he confessed to have received, and declared that he rejoiced for the Bridegroom's voice, saying, \"Therefore this my joy is fulfilled.\"","title":"Tractate XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":8,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_44_defence_of_his_flight","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"I Hear that Leontius[fn-43-P4334_1804779:1-nf] , now at Antioch, and Narcissus[fn-43-P4335_1804878:2-nf] of the city of Nero, and George[fn-43-P4336_1804925:3-nf] , now at Laodicea, and the Arians who are with them, are spreading abroad many slanderous reports concerning me, charging me with cowardice, because forsooth, when I myself was sought by them, I did not surrender myself into their hands.

In this way there was creeping in upon our mine a carnal conception, as if the Father did what the Son did not; but that the Son was looking on while the Father showed what He was doing. Then, as the Father was doing what the Son did not, just now we see the Son doing what the Father doeth not. How He turns us about, and keeps our mind busy! He leads us hither and thither, will not allow us to remain in one place of the flesh, that by changing He may exercise us, by exercising He may cleanse us, by cleansing He may render us capable of receiving, and may fill us when made capable. What have these words to do with us? What was He speaking? What is He speaking? A little before, He said that the Father showeth to the Son whatever He doeth. I did see, as it were, the Father doing. the Son waiting to see; presently again, I see the Son doing, the Father idle: \"For the Father judgeth not any man, but all judgment hath He given to the Son.\" When, therefore, the Son is about to judge, will the Father be idle, and not judge? What is this? What am I to understand? What dost Thou say, O Lord? Thou art God the Word, I am a man. Dost Thou say that \"the Father judgeth not any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son\"? I read in another place that Thou sayest, \"I judge not any man; there is one who seeketh and judgeth.\"[fn-10-P1099_671270:14-nf] Of whom sayest Thou, \"There is one who seeketh and judgeth,\" unless it be of the Father? He maketh inquisition for thy wrongs, and judgeth for them. How is it to be understood here that \"the Father judgeth not any man, but all judgment hath He given to the Son\"? Let us ask Peter; let us hear him speaking in his epistle: \"Christ suffered for us,\" saith he, \"leaving us an example that we should follow His steps; who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth; who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered wrong, He threatened not, but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously.\"[fn-11-P1100_671902:15-nf] How is it true that \"the Father judgeth not any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son\"? We are here in perplexity, and being perplexed let us exert ourselves, that by exertion we may be purified. Let us endeavor as best we may, by His own gift, to penetrate the deep secrets of these words. It may be that we are acting rashly, in that we wish to discuss and to scrutinize the words of God. Yet why were they spoken, but to be known? Why did they sound forth, but to be heard? Why were they heard, but to be understood? Let Him greatly strengthen us, then, and bestow somewhat on us so far as He may deem worthy; and if we do not yet penetrate to the fountain, let us drink of the brook. Behold, John himself has flowed forth to us like a brook, conveyed to us the word from on high.

Thus, if Isaiah says, `The Everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth[fn-53-P5362_2102940:75-nf] ;' and Susanna said, `O Everlasting God[fn-53-P5363_2102997:76-nf] ;' and Baruch wrote, `I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days,' and shortly after, `My hope is in the Everlasting, that He will save you, and joy is come unto me from the Holy One[fn-53-P5364_2103200:77-nf] ;' yet forasmuch as the Apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says, `Who being the radiance of His glory and the Expression of His Person[fn-53-P5365_2103355:78-nf] ;' and David too in the eighty-ninth Psalm, `And the brightness of the Lord be upon us,' and, `In Thy Light shall we see Light[fn-53-P5366_2103498:79-nf] ,' who has so little sense as to doubt of the eternity of the Son[fn-53-P5367_2103595:80-nf] ? for when did man see light without the brightness of its radiance, that he may say of the Son, `There was once, when He was not,' or `Before His generation He was not.' And the words addressed to the Son in the hundred and forty-fourth Psalm, `Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages[fn-53-P5368_2103900:81-nf] ,' forbid any one to imagine any interval at all in which the Word did not exist. For if every interval in the ages is measured, and of all the ages the Word is King and Maker, therefore, whereas no interval at all exists prior to Him[fn-53-P5369_2104154:82-nf] , it were madness to say, `There was once when the Everlasting was not,' and `From nothing is the Son.' And whereas the Lord Himself says, `I am the Truth[fn-53-P5370_2104791:83-nf] ,' not `I became the Truth;' but always, `I am,-I am the Shepherd,-I am the Light,'-and again, `Call ye Me not, Lord and Master? and ye call Me well, for so I am,' who, hearing such language from God, and the Wisdom, and Word of the Father, speaking of Himself, will any longer hesitate about the truth, and not forthwith believe that in the phrase `I am,' is signified that the Son is eternal and without beginning?","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":8,"verse":58,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"13. It is plain then from the above that the Scriptures declare the Son's eternity; it is equally plain from what follows that the Arian phrases `He was not,' and `before' and `when,' are in the same Scriptures predicated of creatures. Moses, for instance, in his account of the generation of our system, says, `And every plant of the field, before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground[fn-53-P5372_2105783:84-nf] .' And in Deuteronomy, `When the Most High divided to the nations[fn-53-P5373_2105866:85-nf] .' And the Lord said in His own Person, `If ye loved Me, ye would rejoice because I said, I go unto the Father, for My Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it come to pass, that when it is come to pass, ye might believe[fn-53-P5374_2106128:86-nf] .' And concerning the creation He says by Solomon, `Or ever the earth was, when there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills. was I brought forth[fn-53-P5375_2106408:87-nf] .' And, `Before Abraham was, I am[fn-53-P5376_2106463:88-nf] .' And concerning Jeremiah He says,`Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee[fn-53-P5377_2106565:89-nf] .' And David in the Psalm says, `Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were made, Thou art, God from everlasting and world without end[fn-53-P5378_2106751:90-nf] .' And in Daniel, `Susanna cried out with a loud voice and said, O everlasting God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest all things before they be[fn-53-P5379_2106915:91-nf] .' Thus it appears that the phrases `once was not,' and `before it came to be,' and `when,' and the like, belong to things originate and creatures, which come out of nothing, but are alien to the Word. But if such terms are used in Scripture of things originate, but `ever' of the Word, it follows, O ye enemies of God, that the Son did not come out of nothing, nor is in the number of originated things at all, but is the Father's Image and Word eternal, never having not been, but being ever, as the, eternal Radiance[fn-53-P5380_2107455:92-nf] of a Light which is eternal. Why imagine then times before the Son? or wherefore blaspheme the Word as after times, by whom even the ages were made? for how did time or age at all subsist when the Word, as you say, had not appeared, `through' whom `all things have been made and without' whom `not one thing was made[fn-53-P5381_2107798:93-nf] ?' Or why, when you mean time, do you not plainly say, `a time was when the Word was not?' But while you drop the word `time' to deceive the simple, you do not at all conceal your own feeling, nor, even if you did, could you escape discovery. For you still simply mean times, when you say, `There was when He was not,' and `He was not before His generation.'","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":8,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_68_sermon_li_ci_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"4.

Accordingly, though He thus speaks, yet He taught also that He Himself existed before this, when He said, `Before Abraham came to be, I am[fn-62-P6215_2482154:340-nf] ;' and `when He prepared the heavens, I was present with Him;' and `I was with Him disposing things[fn-62-P6216_2482276:341-nf] .' And as He Himself was before Abraham came to be, and Israel had come into being after Abraham, and plainly He exists first and is formed afterwards, and His forming signifies not His beginning of being but His taking manhood, wherein also He collects together the tribes of Israel; so, as `being always with the Father,' He Himself is Framer of the creation, and His works are evidently later than Himself, and `He created' signifies, not His beginning of being, but the Economy which took place for the works, which He effected in the flesh. For it became Him, being other than the works, nay rather their Framer, to take upon Himself their renovation[fn-62-P6217_2482976:342-nf] , that, whereas He is created for us, all things may be now created in Him. For when He said `He created,' He forthwith added the reason, naming `the works,' that His creation for the works might signify His becoming man for their renovation. And this is usual with divine Scripture[fn-62-P6218_2483282:343-nf] ; for when it signifies the fleshly origination of the Son, it adds also the cause[fn-62-P6219_2483464:344-nf] for which He became man; but when he speaks or His servants declare anything of His Godhead, all is said in simple diction, and with an absolute sense, and without reason being added. For He is the Father's Radiance; and as the Father is, but not for any reason, neither must we seek the reason of that Radiance. Thus it is written, `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-62-P6220_2483907:345-nf] ;' and the wherefore it assigns not[fn-62-P6221_2483961:346-nf] ; but when `the Word was made flesh[fn-62-P6222_2484015:347-nf] ,' then it adds the reason why, saying, `And dwelt among us.' And again the Apostle saying, `Who being in the form of God,' has not introduced the reason, till `He took on Him the form of a servant;' for then he continues, `He humbled Himself unto death, even the death of the cross[fn-62-P6223_2484317:348-nf] ;' for it was for this that He both became flesh and took the form of a servant.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":8,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"54.

When then received He the works to perfect, O God's enemies? for from this also `He created' will be understood. If ye say, `At the beginning when He brought them into being out of what was not,' it is an untruth; for they were not yet made; whereas He appears to speak as taking what was already in being. Nor is it pious to refer to the time which preceded the Word's becoming flesh, lest His coming should thereupon seem superfluous, since for the sake of these works that coming took place. Therefore it remains for us to say that when He has become man, then He took the works. For then He perfected them, by healing our wounds and vouchsafing to us the resurrection from the dead. But if, when the Word became flesh, then were given to Him the works, plainly when He became man, then also is He created for the works. Not of His essence then is `He created' indicative, as has many times been said, but of His bodily generation. For then, because the works were become imperfect and mutilated from the transgression, He is said in respect to the body to be created; that by perfecting them and making them whole, He might present the Church unto the Father, as the Apostle says, `not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and without blemish[fn-63-P6350_2530954:458-nf] .' Mankind then is perfected in Him and restored, as it was made at the beginning, nay, with greater grace. For, on rising from the dead, we shall no longer fear death, but shall ever reign in Christ in the heavens. And this has been done, since the own Word of God Himself, who is from the Father, has put on the flesh, and become man. For if, being a creature, He had become man, man had remained just what he was, not joined to God; for how had a work been joined to the Creator by a work[fn-63-P6351_2531465:459-nf] ? or what succour had come from like to like, when one as well as other needed it[fn-63-P6352_2531621:460-nf] ? And how, were the Word a creature, had He power to undo God's sentence, and to remit sin, whereas it is written in the Prophets, that this is God's doing? For `who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by transgression[fn-63-P6353_2532179:461-nf] ?' For whereas God has said, `Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return[fn-63-P6354_2532277:462-nf] ,' men have become mortal; how then could things originate undo sin? but the Lord is He who has undone it, as He says Himself, `Unless the Son shall make you free[fn-63-P6355_2532461:463-nf] ;' and the Son, who made free, has shewn in truth that He is no creature, nor one of things originate, but the proper Word and Image of the Father's Essence, who at the beginning sentenced, and alone remitteth sins. For since it is said in the Word, `Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return,' suitably through the Word Himself and in Him the freedom and the undoing of the condemnation has come to pass.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":8,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"102","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"72.

But They are two, because the Father is Father and is not also Son, and the Son is Son and not also Father[fn-65-P6528_2591708:30-nf] ; but the nature is one; (for the offspring is not unlike[fn-65-P6529_2591781:31-nf] its parent, for it is his image), and all that is the Father's, is the Son's[fn-65-P6530_2591995:32-nf] . Wherefore neither is the Son another God, for He was not procured from without, else were there many, if a godhead be procured foreign from the Father's[fn-65-P6531_2592274:33-nf] ; for if the Son be other, as an Offspring, still He is the Same as God; and He and the Father are one in propriety and peculiarity of nature, and in the identity of the one Godhead, as has been said. For the radiance also is light, not second to the sun, nor a different light, nor from participation of it, but a whole and proper offspring of it. And such an offspring is necessarily one light; and no one would say that they are two lights[fn-65-P6532_2592732:34-nf] , but sun and radiance two, yet one the light from the sun enlightening in its radiance all things. So also the Godhead of the Son is the Father's; whence also it is indivisible; and thus there is one God and none other but He. And so, since they are one, and the Godhead itself one, the same things are said of the Son, which are said of the Father, except His being said to be Father[fn-65-P6533_2593166:35-nf] :-for instance[fn-65-P6534_2593200:36-nf] , that He is God, `And the Word was God[fn-65-P6535_2593269:37-nf] ;' Almighty, `Thus saith He which was and is and is to come, the Almighty[fn-65-P6536_2593359:38-nf] ;' Lord, `One Lord Jesus Christ[fn-65-P6537_2593407:39-nf] ;' that He is Light, `I am the Light[fn-65-P6538_2593465:40-nf] ;' that He wipes out sins, `that ye may know,' He says, `that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins[fn-65-P6539_2593600:41-nf] ;' and so with other attributes.

And they will be compelled to say that through the Man Himself the world came into being, and that the Man was He who came not to judge the world but to save it; and that He it was who was in being before Abraham came to be. For, says Scripture, Jesus said to them, `Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am[fn-71-P7199_2860314:84-nf] .' And is it not absurd to say, as they do, that one who came of the seed of Abraham after two and forty generations[fn-72-P7200_2860451:85-nf] , should exist before Abraham came to be? is it not absurd, if the flesh, which the Word bore, itself is the Son, to say that the flesh from Mary is that by which the world was made? and how will they retain `He was in the world?' for the Evangelist, by way of signifying the Son's antecedence to the birth according to the flesh, goes on to say, `He was in the world.' And how, if not the Word but the Man is the Son, can He save the world, being Himself one of the world? And if this does not shame them, where shall be the Word, the Man being in the Father? And where will the Word stand to the Father, the Man and the Father being One? But if the Man be Only-begotten, what will be the place of the Word? Either one must say that He comes second, or, if He be above the Only-begotten, He must be the Father Himself. For as the Father is One, so also the Only-begotten from Him is One; and what has the Word above the Man, if the Word is not the Son? For, while Scripture says that through the Son and the Word the world was brought to be, and it is common to the Word and to the Son to frame the world, yet Scripture proceeds to place the sight of the Father, not in the Word but in the Son, and to attribute the saving of the world, not to the Word, but to the Only-begotten Son. For, saith it, Jesus said, `Have I been so long while with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father.' Nor does Scripture say that the Word knows the Father, but the Son; and that not the Word sees the Father, but the Only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father.","title":"Discourse IV","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":8,"verse":42,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_62_discourse_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"36.

For I the Word am the chrism, and that which has the chrism from Me is the Man[fn-73-P7300_2894894:167-nf] ; not then without Me could He be called Christ, but being with Me and I in Him. Therefore the mention of the mission of the Word shews the uniting which took place with Jesus, born of Mary, Whose Name means Saviour, not by reason of anything else, but from the Man's being made one with God the Word. This passage has the same meaning as `the Father that sent Me,' and `I came not of Myself, but the Father sent Me[fn-73-P7301_2895335:168-nf] .'

Because it was the same Person, who was recently born in human nature, who was God before the rise of all things. And so the name of Christ includes everything that the name of God does; for so close is the union between Christ and God that no one, when he uses the name of Christ can help speaking of God un- der the name of Christ, nor, when he speaks of God, can he help speaking of Christ under the name of God. And as through the glory of His holy nativity the mystery of each substance is joined together in Him, whatever was in existence-I mean both human and Divine-all is regarded as God. And hence the Apostle Paul seeing with unveiled eyes of faith the whole mystery of the ineffable glory in Christ, spoke as follows, in inviting the peoples who were ignorant of God's goodness to give thanksgiving to God: \"Giving thanks to the Father, who hath made us worthy to be partakers of the lot of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the remission of sins; who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature: for in Him were all things created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominations, or powers: all things were created by Him and in Him. And He is before all, and by Him all things consist. And He is the head of the body the Church, who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead; that in all things He may hold the primacy. Because it pleased the Father that in Him should all fulness dwell; and through Him to reconcile all things unto Himself, making peace through the blood of His cross, both as to the things on earth, and the things that are in heaven.\"[fn-72-P7223_2634221:24-nf] Surely this does not need the aid of any further explanation, as it is so fully and clearly expressed that in itself it contains not merely the substance of the faith, but a clear exposition of it. For he bids us give thanks to the Father: and adds a weighty reason for thus giving thanks; viz., because He hath made us worthy to be partakers with the saints, and hath delivered us from the power of darkness, hath translated us unto the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption and remission of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature; for in Him and through Him were all things created; of which He is both the Creator and the ruler: and what follows after this? \"He is\" he says, \"the head of the body the Church: who is the beginning, the first-born from the dead.\"Scripture speaks of the resurrection as a birth: because as birth is the beginning of life, so resurrection gives birth unto life. Whence also the resurrection is actually spoken of as regeneration, according to the words of the Lord: \"Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\"[fn-72-P7224_2635515:25-nf] Therefore he calls Him the first-born from the dead, whom he had previously declared to be the invisible Son and image of God. But who is the image of the invisible God, except the only-begotten, the Word of God? And how can we say that He rose from the dead, who is termed the image and word of the invisible God? And what is it that follows afterwards? \"That in all things He may hold the primacy: for it pleased the Father that in Him should all fulness dwell, and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, making peace through the blood of His cross, both as to things on earth and the things that are in heaven.\" Surely the Creator of all things has no need of the primacy in all things? Nor He who made them, of the primacy of those things which were made by Him? And how can we say of the Word, that it pleased God that all fulness should dwell in Him who was the first-born from the dead, when He was Himself the only-begotten Son of God and the Word of God, before the origin of all things, and had within Him the invisible Father, and so first had within Him all fulness, that He might Himself be the fulness of all things? And what next? \"Bringing all things to peace through the blood of His cross, both things on earth, and the things which are in heaven.\" Certainly he has made it as clear as possible of whom he was speaking, when he called Him the first-born from the dead. For are all things reconciled and brought into peace through the blood of the Word or Spirit? Most certainly not. For no sort of passion can happen to nature that is impassible, nor can the blood of any but a man be shed, nor any but a man die: and yet the same Person who is spoken of in the following verses as dead, was above called the image of the invisible God. How then can this be? Because the apostles took every possible precaution that it might not be thought that there was any division in Christ, or that the Son of God being joined to a Son of man, might come by wild interpretations to be made into two Persons, and thus He who is in Himself but one might by wrongful and wicked notions of ours, be made into a double Person in one nature. And so most excellently and admirably does the apostle's preaching pass from the only begotten Son of God to the Son of man united to the Son of God, that the exposition of the doctrine might follow the actual course of the things that happened. And so he continues with an unbroken connexion, and makes as it were a sort of bridge, that without any gap or separation you might find at the end of time Him whom we read of as in the beginning of the world; and that you might not by admitting. some division and erroneous separation imagine that the Son of God was one person in the flesh and another in the Spirit; When the teaching of the apostle had so linked together God and man through the mystery of His birth in the body, so as to show that it was the same Person reconciling to Himself all things on the Cross, who had been proclaimed the image of the invisible God before the foundation of the world.","title":"Book V.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":58,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_84_book_vi_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"But let us look at the remainder which follows. As then the Creed says: \"The Lord Jesus Christ, Very God of Very God, Being of one substance with the Father; By whom both the worlds were framed, and all things were made,\" it immediately subjoins in closest connexion the following, and says: \"Who for us came and was born of the Virgin Mary.\" He then, who is Very God, who is of one substance with the Father, who is the Maker of all things, He, I repeat, came into the world and was born of the Virgin Mary; as the Apostle Paul says: \"But when the fulness of the times was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the law.\"[fn-73-P7329_2687018:8-nf] You see how the mysteries of the Creed correspond with the Holy Scriptures. The Apostle declares that the Son of God was \"sent from the Father:\" The Creed affirms that He \"came.\" For it certainly follows that our faith should confess that He has \"come,\" whom the Apostle had taught us to be sent. Then the Apostle says: \"Made of a woman:\" The Creed, \"born of Mary.\" And so you see that there speaks through the Creed the Scripture itself, from which the Creed acknowledges that it is itself derived. But when the Apostle says, \"made of a woman,\" he rightly enough uses \"made\" for \"born,\" after the manner of Holy Scripture in which \"made\" stands for \"born:\" as in this passage: \"Instead of thy fathers there are made to thee sons:\"[fn-73-P7330_2687774:9-nf] or this: \"Before Abraham was made, I am;\"[fn-73-P7331_2687839:10-nf] where we certainly see clearly that He meant \"Before he was born, I am:\" alluding to the fact of his birth under the term \"was made,\" because whatever does not need to be made has the very reality of creation. \"Who,\" it then says, \"for us came and was born of the Virgin Mary.\" If a mere man was born of Mary, how can it be said that He \"came\"? For no one \"comes\" but He who has it in Him to be able to come. But in the case of one who had not yet received His existence, how could He have it in Him to come. You see then how by the word \"coming\" it is shown that He who came was already in existence: for He only had the power to come, to whom there could be the opportunity of coming, from the fact that He was already existing. But a mere man was certainly not in existence before he was conceived, and so had not in himself the power to come. It is clear then that it was God who came: to whom it belongs in each case both to be, and to come. For certainly He came because He was, and He ever was, because He could ever come.","title":"Book VI.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":58,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_66_tome_or_synodal_letter_to_the_people_of_antioch","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"But since also certain seemed to be contending together concerning the fleshly Economy of the Saviour, we enquired of both parties.

My brethren, I indeed am a disciple of Christ, and, moreover, an apostle of Jesus; and it is owing to the exceeding kindness of Marcellus that I have hastened hither, with the view of showing him clearly in what manner he ought to keep the system of divine religion, so that the said Marcellus verily, who at present has put himself, like one who has surrendered himself prisoner, under the doctrine of Archclaus, may not, like the dumb animals, which are destitute of intellect and understand not what they do, be fatally smitten to the ruin of his soul, in consequence of any failure in the possession of further facilities for setting about the right observance of divine worship. I know, furthermore, and am certain, that if Marcellus is once set right,[fn-33-P3347_874919:97-nf] it will be quite possible that all of you may also have your salvation effected; for your city hangs suspended upon his judgment. If vain presumption is rejected by every one of you, and if those things which are to be declared by me be heard with a real love for the truth, ye will receive the inheritance of the age to come, and the kingdom of heaven. I, in sooth, am the Paraclete, whose mission was announced of old time by Jesus, and who was to come to \"convince the world of sin and unrighteousness.\"[fn-33-P3348_875483:98-nf] And even as Paul, who was sent before me, said of himself, that \"he knew in part, and prophesied in part,\"[fn-33-P3349_875929:99-nf] so I reserve the perfect for myself, in order that I may do away with that which is in part. Therefore receive ye this third testimony, that I am an elect apostle of Christ; and if ye choose to accept my words, ye will find salvation; but if ye refuse them, eternal fire will have you to consume you. For as Hymenaeus and Alexander were\" delivered unto Satan, that they might learn not to blaspheme,\"[fn-33-P3350_876352:100-nf] so will all ye also be delivered unto the prince of punishments, because ye have done injury to the Father of Christ, in so far as ye declare Him to be the cause of all evils, and the founder of unrighteousness, and the creator of all iniquity. By such doctrine ye do, indeed, bring forth from the same fountain both sweet water and bitter,-a thing which can in no possible way be either done or apprehended. For who ought to be believed? Should it be those masters of yours whose enjoyment is in the flesh, and who pamper themselves with the richest delights; or our Saviour Jesus Christ, who says, as it is written in the book of the Gospels, \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,\"[fn-33-P3351_877114:101-nf] and who in another place assures us that the \"father of the devil[fn-33-P3352_877202:102-nf] is a liar and a murderer from the beginning,\"[fn-33-P3353_877271:103-nf] and tells us again that men's desire was for the darkness,[fn-33-P3354_877352:104-nf] so that they would not follow that Word that had been sent forth in the beginning from the light,[fn-33-P3355_877491:105-nf] and (once more shows us) the man who is the enemy of the same, the sower of tares,[fn-33-P3356_877871:106-nf] and the god and prince of the age of this world, who blinds the minds of men that they may not be obedient to the truth in the Gospel of Christ?[fn-33-P3357_878039:107-nf] Is that God good who has no wish that the men who are his own should be saved? And, not to go over a multitude of other matters, and waste much time, I may defer[fn-33-P3358_878235:108-nf] till another opportunity the exposition of the true doctrine; and taking it for granted that I have said enough on this subject for the present, I may revert to the matter immediately before me, and endeavour satisfactorily to demonstrate the absurdity of these men's teaching, and show that none of these things can be attributed to the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour, but that we must take Satan to be the cause of all our ills. To him, certainly, these must be carried back, for all ills of this kind are generated by him. But those things also which are written in the prophets and the law are none the less to be ascribed to him; for he it is who spake then in the prophets, introducing into their minds very many ignorant notions of God, as well as temptations and passions. They, too, set forth that devourer of blood and flesh; and to that Satan and to his prophets all these things properly pertain which he wished to transfer[fn-33-P3359_879243:109-nf] to the Father of Christ, prepared as he was to write a few things in the way of truth, that by means of these he might also gain credence for those other statements of his which are false. Hence it is well for us to receive nothing at all of all those things which have been written of old even down to John, and indeed to embrace only the kingdom of heaven, which has been preached in the Gospel since his days; for they verily but made a mockery of themselves, introducing as they did things ridiculous and ludicrous, keeping some small words given in obscure outline in the law, but not understanding that, if good things are mixed up with evil, the result is, that by the corruption of these evil things, even those others which are good are destroyed. And if, indeed, there is any one who may prove himself able to demonstrate that the law upholds the right, that law ought to be kept; but if we can show it to be evil, then it ought to be done away with and rejected, inasmuch as it contains the ministration of death, which was graven,[fn-33-P3360_880308:110-nf] which also covered and destroyed the glory on the countenance of Moses.[fn-33-P3361_880399:111-nf] It is a thing not without peril, therefore, for any one of you to teach the New Testament along with the law and the prophets, as if they were of one and the same origin; for the knowledge of our Saviour renews the one from day to day, while the other grows old and infirm, and passes almost into utter destruction.[fn-33-P3362_880737:112-nf] And this is a fact manifest to those who are capable of exercising discernment. For just as, when the branches of a tree become aged, or when the trunk ceases to bear fruit any more, they are cut down; and just as, when the members of the body suffer mortification, they are amputated, for the poison of the mortification diffuses itself from these members through the whole body, and unless some remedy be found for the disease by the skill of the physician, the whole body will be vitiated; so, too, if ye receive the law without understanding its origin, ye will ruin your souls, and lose your salvation. For \"the law and the prophets were until John; \"[fn-33-P3363_881420:113-nf] but since John the law of truth, the law of the promises, the law of heaven, the new law, is made known to the race of man. And, in sooth, as long as there was no one to exhibit to you this most true knowledge of our Lord Jesus, ye had not sin. Now, however, ye both see and hear, and yet ye desire to walk in ignorance,[fn-33-P3364_881762:114-nf] in order that ye may keep[fn-33-P3365_882007:115-nf] that law which has been destroyed and abandoned. And Paul, too, who is held to be the most approved apostle with us, expresses himself to the same effect in one of his epistles, when he says: \"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.\"[fn-33-P3366_882339:116-nf] And in saying this he pronounces on them as Gentiles, because they were under the elements of the world,[fn-33-P3367_882507:117-nf] before the fulness of faith came, believing then as they did in the law and the prophets.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":8,"verse":44,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-06","text":"29.

For \"from Adam\" is the word of Scripture, and not \"before Adam.\" Manes said: But tell me, I ask you in turn, how it obtained its kingdom over both the righteous and the sinful. Archelaus said: When you have first admitted that it has had that kingdom from a determinate time and not from eternity, I shall tell you that. Manes said: It is written, that \"death reigned from Adam to Moses.\" Archelaus said: And consequently it has an end, because it has had a beginning in time.[fn-35-P3527_965497:261-nf] And this saying is also true, that \"death is swallowed up in victory.\"[fn-35-P3528_965635:262-nf] It is apparent, then, that death cannot be unbegotten, seeing that it is shown to have both a beginning and an end. Manes said: But in that way it would also follow that God was its maker. Archelaus said: By no means; away with such a supposition! \"For God made not death; neither hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living.\"[fn-35-P3529_965990:263-nf] Manes said: God made it not; nevertheless it was made, as you admit.Tell us, therefore, from whom it received its empire, or by whom it was created.

Now let us select some instance from among those statements which you allege to be on your side; so that if these be once found to have been properly dealt with, other questions may also be held to rank with them; and if the case goes otherwise, I shall come under the condemnation of the judges, that is to say, I shall have to bear the shame of defeat.[fn-35-P3523_964227:257-nf] You say, then, that the law is a ministration of death, and you admit that \"death, the prince of this world, reigned from Adam even to Moses; \"[fn-35-P3524_964516:258-nf] for the word of Scripture is this: \"even over them that did not sin.\"[fn-35-P3525_964605:259-nf] Manes said: Without doubt death did reign thus, for there is a duality, and these two antagonistic powers were nothing else than both unbegotten.[fn-35-P3526_964770:260-nf] Archelaus said: Tell me this then,-how can an unbegotten death take a beginning at a certain time? For \"from Adam\" is the word of Scripture, and not \"before Adam.\" Manes said: But tell me, I ask you in turn, how it obtained its kingdom over both the righteous and the sinful. Archelaus said: When you have first admitted that it has had that kingdom from a determinate time and not from eternity, I shall tell you that. Manes said: It is written, that \"death reigned from Adam to Moses.\" Archelaus said: And consequently it has an end, because it has had a beginning in time.[fn-35-P3527_965497:261-nf] And this saying is also true, that \"death is swallowed up in victory.\"[fn-35-P3528_965635:262-nf] It is apparent, then, that death cannot be unbegotten, seeing that it is shown to have both a beginning and an end. Manes said: But in that way it would also follow that God was its maker. Archelaus said: By no means; away with such a supposition! \"For God made not death; neither hath He pleasure in the destruction of the living.\"[fn-35-P3529_965990:263-nf] Manes said: God made it not; nevertheless it was made, as you admit.Tell us, therefore, from whom it received its empire, or by whom it was created. Archelaus said: If I give the most ample proof of the fact that death cannot have the substance of an unbegotten nature, will you not confess that there is but one God, and that an unbegotten God? Manes said: Continue your discourse, for your aim is to speak[fn-35-P3530_966418:264-nf] with subtlety. Archelaus said: Nay, but you have put forward those allegations in such a manner, as if they were to serve you for a demonstration of an unbegotten root. Nevertheless the positions which we have discussed above may suffice us, for by these we have shown most fully that it is impossible for the substances of two unbegotten natures to exist together.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":8,"verse":44,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"ANF-06","text":"32. Moreover, as to this word which is written in the Gospel, \"Ye are of your father the devil,\"[fn-35-P3558_979737:288-nf] and so forth, we say in brief that there is a devil working in us, whose aim it has been, in the strength of his own will, to make us like himself. For all the creatures that God made, He made very good; and He gave to every individual the sense of free-will, in accordance with which standard He also instituted the law of judgment. To sin is ours, and that we sin not is God's gift, as our will is constituted to choose either to sin or not to sin. And this you doubtless understand well enough yourself, Manes; for you know that, although you were to bring together all your disciples and admonish[fn-35-P3559_980360:289-nf] them not to commit any transgression or do any unrighteousness, every one of them might still pass by the law of judgment. And certainly whosoever will, may keep the commandments; and whosoever shall despise them, and turn aside to what is contrary to them, shall yet without doubt have to face this law of judgment. Hence also certain of the angels, refusing to submit themselves to the commandment of God, resisted His will; and one of them indeed fell like a flash of lightning[fn-35-P3560_980914:290-nf] upon the earth, while others,[fn-35-P3561_980963:291-nf] harassed by the dragon, sought their felicity in intercourse with the daughters of men,[fn-35-P3562_981523:292-nf] and thus brought on themselves the merited award of the punishment of eternal fire. And that angel who was cast down to earth, finding no further admittance into any of the regions of heaven, now flaunts about among men, deceiving them, and luring them to become transgressors like himself, and even to this day he is an adversary to the commandments of God. The example of his fall and ruin, however, will not be followed by all, inasmuch as to each is given liberty of will. For this reason also has he obtained the name of devil, because he has passed over from the heavenly places, and appeared on earth as the disparager of God's commandment.[fn-35-P3563_982581:293-nf] But because it was God who first gave the commandment, the Lord Jesus Himself said to the devil, \"Get thee behind me, Satan; \"[fn-35-P3564_982917:294-nf] and, without doubt, to go behind God is the sign of being His servant. And again He says, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-35-P3565_983098:295-nf] Wherefore, as certain men were inclined to yield obedience to his wishes, they were addressed in these terms by the Saviour: \"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts. of your father ye will do.\"[fn-35-P3566_983321:296-nf] And, in fine, when they are found to be actually doing his will, they are thus addressed: \"O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.\"[fn-35-P3567_983561:297-nf] From all this, then, you ought to see how weighty a matter it is for man to have freedom of will, However, let my antagonist here say whether there is a judgment for the godly and the ungodly, or not. Manes said: There is a judgment. Archelaus said: I think that what we[fn-35-P3568_983855:298-nf] have said concerning the devil contains no small measure of reason as well as of piety. For every creature, moreover, has its own order; and there is one order for the human race, and another for animals, and another for angels. Furthermore, there is but one only inconvertible substance, the divine substance, eternal and invisible, as is known to all, and as is also borne out by this scripture: \"No man hath seen God at any time, save the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father.\"[fn-35-P3569_984407:299-nf] All the other creatures, consequently, are of necessity visible,-such as heaven, earth, sea, men, angels, archangels. But if God has not been seen by any man at any time, what consubstantiality can there be between Him and those creatures? Hence we hold that all things whatsoever have, in their several positions, their own proper substances, according to their proper order. You, on the other band, allege that every living thing which moves is made of one,[fn-35-P3570_984886:300-nf] and you say that every object has received like substance from God, and that this substance is capable of sinning and of being brought under the judgment; and you are unwilling to accept the word which declares that the devil was an angel, and that he fell in transgression, and that he is not of the same substance with God.

If you prove to me that his father is a liar, and yet show me that for all that you ascribe no such (evil) notion to God, then credit will be given you on all points. Archelaus said: Surely when a full account of the devil has once been presented, and the dispensation set forth, any one now, with an ordinarily vigorous understanding, might simply, by turning the matter carefully over in his own mind, get an idea of who this is that is here called the father of the devil. But though you give yourself out to be the Paraclete, you come very far short of the ordinary sagacity of men. Wherefore, as you have betrayed your ignorance, I shall tell you what is meant by this expression, the \"father of the devil.\" Manes said: I say so[fn-35-P3580_990206:309-nf] ...; and he added: Every one who is the founder or maker of anything may be called the father, parent, of that which he has made. Archelaus said: Well, I am verily astonished that you have made so correct an admission in reply to what I have said, and have not concealed either your intelligent apprehension of the affirmation, or the real nature of the same. Now, from this learn who is this father of the devil. When he fell from the kingdom of heaven, he came to dwell upon earth, and there he remained, ever watching and seeking out some one to whom he might attach himself, and whom, through an alliance with himself, he might also make a partner in his own wickedness. Now as long, indeed, as man was not yet existent, the devil was never called either a murderer or a liar together with his father. But subsequently, when man had once been made, and when further he had been deceived by the devil's lies and craftiness, and when the devil had also introduced himself into the body of the serpent, which was the most sagacious of all the beasts, then from that time the devil was called a liar together with his father, and then[fn-35-P3581_991595:310-nf] also the curse was made to rest not only on himself, but also on his father. Accordingly, when the serpent had received him, and had indeed admitted him wholly into its own being, it was, as it were, rendered pregnant, for it bore the burden of the devil's vast wickedness; and it was like one with child, and under the strain of parturition, as it sought to eject the agitations[fn-35-P3582_992036:311-nf] of his malignant suggestions. For the serpent, grudging the glory of the first man, made its way into paradise; and harbouring these pains of parturition in itself,[fn-35-P3583_992266:312-nf] it began to produce mendacious addresses, and to generate death for the men who had been fashioned by God, and who had received the gift of life. The devil, however, was not able to manifest himself completely through the serpent; but he reserved his perfection for a time, in order that he might demonstrate it through Cain, by whom he was generated completely. And thus through the serpent, on the one hand, he displayed his hypocrisies and deceits to Eve; while through Cain, on the other hand, he effected the beginning of murder, introducing himself into the firstlings of the \"fruits,\" which that man administered so badly. From this the devil has been called a murderer from the beginning, and also a liar, because he deceived the parties to whom he said, \"Ye shall be as gods; \"[fn-35-P3584_993087:313-nf] for those very persons whom he falsely declared destined to be gods were afterwards cast out of paradise. Wherefore the serpent which conceived him in its womb, and bore him, and brought him forth to the light of day, is constituted the devil's first father; and Cain is made his second father, who through the conception of iniquities produced pains and parricide: for truly the taking of life was the perpetrating of iniquity, unrighteousness, and impiety all together. Furthermore, all who receive him, and do his lusts, are constituted his brothers. Pharaoh is his father in perfection. Every impious man is made his father. Judas became his father, since he conceived him indeed, though he miscarried: for he did not present a perfect parturition there, since it was really a greater person who was assailed through Judas; and consequently, as I say, it proved an abortion. For just as the woman receives the man's seed, and thereby also becomes sensible of a daily growth within her, so also did Judas make daily advances in evil, the occasions for that being furnished him like seed by the wicked one. And the first seed of evil in him, indeed, was the lust of money; and its increment was theft, for he purloined the moneys which were deposited in the bag. Its offspring, moreover, consisted of less vexations, and compacts with the Pharisees, and the scandalous bargain for a price; yet it was the abortion, and not the birth, that was witnessed in the horrid noose by which he met his death. And exactly in the same way shall it stand also with you: if you bring the wicked one to light in your own deeds, and do his lusts, you have conceived him, and will be called his father; but, on the other hand, if you cherish penitence, and deliver yourself of your burden, you will be like one that brings to the birth.[fn-35-P3585_994931:314-nf] For, as in school exercises, if one gets the subject-matter from the master, and then creates and produces the whole body of an oration by himself, he is said to be the author of the compositions to which he has thus given birth;[fn-35-P3586_995345:315-nf] so he who has taken in any little leaven of evil from the prime evil, is of necessity called the father and pro-creator of that wicked one, who from the beginning has resisted the truth. The case may be the same, indeed, with those who devote themselves to virtue; for I have heard the most valiant men say to God, \"For Thy fear, O Lord, we have conceived in the womb, and we have been in pain, and have brought forth the spirit of salvation.\"[fn-35-P3587_995852:316-nf] And so those, too, who conceive in respect of the fear of the wicked one, and bring forth the spirit of iniquity, must needs be called the fathers of the same. Thus, on the one hand, they are called sons of that wicked one, so long as they are still yielding obedience to his service; but, on the other hand, they are called fathers if they have attained to the perfeCtion of iniquity. For it is with this view that our Lord says to the Pharisees, \"Ye are of your father the devil,\"[fn-35-P3588_996405:317-nf] thereby making them his sons, as long as they appeared still to be perturbed[fn-35-P3589_996504:318-nf] by him, and meditated in their hearts evil for good toward the righteous. Accordingly, while they deliberated in such a spirit with their own hearts, and while their wicked devices were made chargeable upon[fn-35-P3590_996730:319-nf] themselves, Judas, as the head of all the evil, and as the person who carried out their iniquitous counsels to their consummation, was constituted the father of the crime, having received at their hands the recompense of thirty pieces of silver for his impious cruelty. For \"after the sop Satan entered into him\"[fn-35-P3591_997068:320-nf] completely. But, as we have said, when his womb was enlarged, and the time of his travail came on, he delivered himself only of an abortive burden in the conception of unrighteousness, and consequently he could not be called the father in perfection, except only at that very time when the conception was still in the womb; and afterwards, when he betook himself to the hangman's rope, he showed that he had not brought it to a complete birth, because remorse[fn-35-P3592_997550:321-nf] followed.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":8,"verse":44,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"ANF-06","text":"33.

And exactly in the same way shall it stand also with you: if you bring the wicked one to light in your own deeds, and do his lusts, you have conceived him, and will be called his father; but, on the other hand, if you cherish penitence, and deliver yourself of your burden, you will be like one that brings to the birth.[fn-35-P3585_994931:314-nf] For, as in school exercises, if one gets the subject-matter from the master, and then creates and produces the whole body of an oration by himself, he is said to be the author of the compositions to which he has thus given birth;[fn-35-P3586_995345:315-nf] so he who has taken in any little leaven of evil from the prime evil, is of necessity called the father and pro-creator of that wicked one, who from the beginning has resisted the truth. The case may be the same, indeed, with those who devote themselves to virtue; for I have heard the most valiant men say to God, \"For Thy fear, O Lord, we have conceived in the womb, and we have been in pain, and have brought forth the spirit of salvation.\"[fn-35-P3587_995852:316-nf] And so those, too, who conceive in respect of the fear of the wicked one, and bring forth the spirit of iniquity, must needs be called the fathers of the same. Thus, on the one hand, they are called sons of that wicked one, so long as they are still yielding obedience to his service; but, on the other hand, they are called fathers if they have attained to the perfeCtion of iniquity. For it is with this view that our Lord says to the Pharisees, \"Ye are of your father the devil,\"[fn-35-P3588_996405:317-nf] thereby making them his sons, as long as they appeared still to be perturbed[fn-35-P3589_996504:318-nf] by him, and meditated in their hearts evil for good toward the righteous. Accordingly, while they deliberated in such a spirit with their own hearts, and while their wicked devices were made chargeable upon[fn-35-P3590_996730:319-nf] themselves, Judas, as the head of all the evil, and as the person who carried out their iniquitous counsels to their consummation, was constituted the father of the crime, having received at their hands the recompense of thirty pieces of silver for his impious cruelty.

But, as we have said, when his womb was enlarged, and the time of his travail came on, he delivered himself only of an abortive burden in the conception of unrighteousness, and consequently he could not be called the father in perfection, except only at that very time when the conception was still in the womb; and afterwards, when he betook himself to the hangman's rope, he showed that he had not brought it to a complete birth, because remorse[fn-35-P3592_997550:321-nf] followed.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":8,"verse":44,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"ANF-06","text":"33. The judges said: He has given demonstration enough of the origin of the devil. And as both sides admit that there will be a judgment, it is necessarily involved in that admission that every individual is shown to have free-will; and since this is brought clearly out, there can be no doubt that every individual, in the exercise of his own proper power of will, may shape his course in whatever direction he pleases.[fn-35-P3577_987923:306-nf] Manes said: If (only) the good is from (your) God, as you allege, then you make Jesus Himself a liar.[fn-35-P3578_988369:307-nf] Archelaus said: In the first place, admit that the account of what we have adduced is true, and then I will give you proof about the \"father of him.\"[fn-35-P3579_988777:308-nf] Manes said.' If you prove to me that his father is a liar, and yet show me that for all that you ascribe no such (evil) notion to God, then credit will be given you on all points. Archelaus said: Surely when a full account of the devil has once been presented, and the dispensation set forth, any one now, with an ordinarily vigorous understanding, might simply, by turning the matter carefully over in his own mind, get an idea of who this is that is here called the father of the devil. But though you give yourself out to be the Paraclete, you come very far short of the ordinary sagacity of men. Wherefore, as you have betrayed your ignorance, I shall tell you what is meant by this expression, the \"father of the devil.\" Manes said: I say so[fn-35-P3580_990206:309-nf] ...; and he added: Every one who is the founder or maker of anything may be called the father, parent, of that which he has made. Archelaus said: Well, I am verily astonished that you have made so correct an admission in reply to what I have said, and have not concealed either your intelligent apprehension of the affirmation, or the real nature of the same. Now, from this learn who is this father of the devil. When he fell from the kingdom of heaven, he came to dwell upon earth, and there he remained, ever watching and seeking out some one to whom he might attach himself, and whom, through an alliance with himself, he might also make a partner in his own wickedness. Now as long, indeed, as man was not yet existent, the devil was never called either a murderer or a liar together with his father. But subsequently, when man had once been made, and when further he had been deceived by the devil's lies and craftiness, and when the devil had also introduced himself into the body of the serpent, which was the most sagacious of all the beasts, then from that time the devil was called a liar together with his father, and then[fn-35-P3581_991595:310-nf] also the curse was made to rest not only on himself, but also on his father. Accordingly, when the serpent had received him, and had indeed admitted him wholly into its own being, it was, as it were, rendered pregnant, for it bore the burden of the devil's vast wickedness; and it was like one with child, and under the strain of parturition, as it sought to eject the agitations[fn-35-P3582_992036:311-nf] of his malignant suggestions. For the serpent, grudging the glory of the first man, made its way into paradise; and harbouring these pains of parturition in itself,[fn-35-P3583_992266:312-nf] it began to produce mendacious addresses, and to generate death for the men who had been fashioned by God, and who had received the gift of life. The devil, however, was not able to manifest himself completely through the serpent; but he reserved his perfection for a time, in order that he might demonstrate it through Cain, by whom he was generated completely. And thus through the serpent, on the one hand, he displayed his hypocrisies and deceits to Eve; while through Cain, on the other hand, he effected the beginning of murder, introducing himself into the firstlings of the \"fruits,\" which that man administered so badly. From this the devil has been called a murderer from the beginning, and also a liar, because he deceived the parties to whom he said, \"Ye shall be as gods; \"[fn-35-P3584_993087:313-nf] for those very persons whom he falsely declared destined to be gods were afterwards cast out of paradise. Wherefore the serpent which conceived him in its womb, and bore him, and brought him forth to the light of day, is constituted the devil's first father; and Cain is made his second father, who through the conception of iniquities produced pains and parricide: for truly the taking of life was the perpetrating of iniquity, unrighteousness, and impiety all together. Furthermore, all who receive him, and do his lusts, are constituted his brothers. Pharaoh is his father in perfection. Every impious man is made his father. Judas became his father, since he conceived him indeed, though he miscarried: for he did not present a perfect parturition there, since it was really a greater person who was assailed through Judas; and consequently, as I say, it proved an abortion. For just as the woman receives the man's seed, and thereby also becomes sensible of a daily growth within her, so also did Judas make daily advances in evil, the occasions for that being furnished him like seed by the wicked one. And the first seed of evil in him, indeed, was the lust of money; and its increment was theft, for he purloined the moneys which were deposited in the bag. Its offspring, moreover, consisted of less vexations, and compacts with the Pharisees, and the scandalous bargain for a price; yet it was the abortion, and not the birth, that was witnessed in the horrid noose by which he met his death. And exactly in the same way shall it stand also with you: if you bring the wicked one to light in your own deeds, and do his lusts, you have conceived him, and will be called his father; but, on the other hand, if you cherish penitence, and deliver yourself of your burden, you will be like one that brings to the birth.[fn-35-P3585_994931:314-nf] For, as in school exercises, if one gets the subject-matter from the master, and then creates and produces the whole body of an oration by himself, he is said to be the author of the compositions to which he has thus given birth;[fn-35-P3586_995345:315-nf] so he who has taken in any little leaven of evil from the prime evil, is of necessity called the father and pro-creator of that wicked one, who from the beginning has resisted the truth.

To neglect these things any further, and to persevere in the former error, what is it else than to fall under the Lord's rebuke, who in the l psalm reproveth, and says, \"What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant into thy mouth, seeing thou hatest instruction and castest my words behind thee? When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.\"[fn-60-P6011_1895305:41-nf] For to declare the righteousness and the covenant of the Lord, and not to do the same that the Lord did, what else is it than to cast away His words and to despise the Lord's instruction, to commit not earthly, but spiritual thefts and adulteries? While any one is stealing from evangelical truth the words and doings of our Lord, he is corrupting and adulterating the divine precepts, as it is written in Jeremiah. He says, \"What is the chaff to the wheat? Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the Lord, who steal my words every one froth his neighbour, and cause my people to err by their lies and by their lightness.\"[fn-60-P6012_1895959:42-nf] Also in the same prophet, in another place, He says, \"She committed adultery with stocks and stones, and yet for all this she turned not unto me.\"[fn-60-P6013_1896135:43-nf] That this theft and adultery may not fall unto us also, we ought to be anxiously careful, and fearfully and religiously to watch. For if we are priests of God and of Christ, I do not know any one whom we ought rather to follow than God and Christ, since He Himself emphatically says in the Gospel, \"I am the light of the world; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\"[fn-60-P6014_1896568:44-nf] Lest therefore we should walk in darkness, we ought to follow Christ, and to observe his precepts, because He Himself told His apostles in another place, as He sent them forth, \"All power is given unto me in heaven and earth. Go, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.\"[fn-60-P6015_1897003:45-nf] Wherefore, if we wish to walk in the light of Christ, let us not depart from His precepts and monitions, giving thanks that, while He instructs for the future what we ought to do, He pardons for the past wherein we in our simplicity have erred. And because already His second coming draws near to us, His benign and liberal condescension is more and more illuminating our hearts with the light of truth.[fn-60-P6016_1897433:46-nf] ","title":"Epistle LXII.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":8,"verse":56,"source_code":"anf_08_anf08_68_the_gospel_of_pseudo_matthew","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"128","folder":"ANF-08","text":"Now a certain Jewish schoolmaster named Zachyas[fn-61-P6142_1809429:57-nf] heard Jesus thus speaking; and seeing that He could not be overcome, from knowing the power that was in Him,[fn-61-P6143_1809611:58-nf] he became angry, and began rudely and foolishly, and without fear, to speak against Joseph. And he said: Dost thou not wish to entrust me with thy son, that he may be instructed in human learning and in reverence? But I see that Mary and thyself have more regard for your son than for what the elders of the people of Israel say against him. You should have given more honour to us, the elders of the whole church of Israel, both that he might be on terms of mutual affection with the children, and that among us he might be instructed in Jewish learning. Joseph, on the other hand, said to him: And is there any one who can keep this child, and teach him? But if thou canst keep him and teach him, we by no means hinder him from being taught by thee those things which are learned by all. And Jesus, having heard what Zachyas had said, answered and said unto him: The precepts of the law which thou hast just spoken of, and all the things that thou hast named, must be kept by those who are instructed in human learning; but I am a stranger to your law-courts, because I have no father after the flesh. Thou who readest the law, and art learned in it, abidest in the law; but I was before the law, But since thou thinkest that no one is equal to thee in learning, thou shalt be taught by me, that no other can teach anything but those things which thou hast named. But he alone can who is worthy.[fn-61-P6144_1811084:59-nf] For when I shall be exalted on earth, I will cause to cease all mention of your genealogy. For thou knowest not when thou wast born: I alone know when you were born, and how long your life on earth will be. Then all who heard these words were struck with astonishment, and cried out: Oh! oh! oh! this marvellously great and wonderful mystery. Never have we heard the like! Never has it been heard from any one else, nor has it been said or at any time heard by the prophets, or the Pharisees, or the scribes. We know whence he is sprung, and he is scarcely five years old; and whence does he speak these words? The Pharisees answered: We have never heard such words spoken by any other child so young. And Jesus answered and said unto them: At this do ye wonder, that such things are said by a child? Why, then, do ye not believe me in those things which I have said to you? And you all wonder because I said to you that I know when you were born. I will tell you greater things, that you may wonder more. I have seen Abraham, whom you call your father, and have spoken with him; and he has seen me.[fn-61-P6145_1812449:60-nf] And when they heard this they held their tongues, nor did any of them dare to speak. And Jesus said to them: I have been among you with children, and you have not known me; I have spoken to you as to wise men, and you have not understood my words; because you are younger than I am,[fn-61-P6146_1812761:61-nf] and of little faith.","title":"The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew","author":"Apocrypha of the New Testament"}]
