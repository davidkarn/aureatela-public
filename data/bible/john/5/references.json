But from the time in which Zechariah lived, until the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, in which Christ was crucified, nearly five hundred years are reckoned; since he flourished in the time of Darius and Alexander,[fn-13-P1339_575189:157-nf] who lived not long after the banishment of Tarquinius Superbus. But they were again misled and deceived in the same manner, in supposing that these things were spoken concerning Jesus[fn-13-P1340_575442:158-nf] the son of Nave, who was the successor of Moses, or concerning Jesus the high priest the son of Josedech; to whom none of those things which the prophet related was suited. For they were never clothed in filthy garments, since one of them was a most powerful prince, and the other high priest; or suffered any adversity, so that they should be regarded as a brand plucked from the fire: not did they ever stand in the presence of God and the angels; nor did the prophet speak of the past so much as of the future. He spoke, therefore, of Jesus the Son of God, to show that He would first come in humility and in the flesh. For this is the filthy garment, that He might prepare a temple for God, and might be scorched[fn-13-P1341_576253:159-nf] as a brand with fire-that is, might endure tortures from men, and at last be extinguished. For a haft-burnt brand drawn forth from the hearth and extinguished, is commonly so called,[fn-13-P1342_576689:160-nf] But in what manner and with what commands He was sent by God to the earth, the Spirit of God declared through the prophet, teaching us that when He had faithfully and uniformly fulfilled the will of His supreme Father, He should receive judgment[fn-13-P1343_576993:161-nf] and an everlasting dominion. If, He says, Thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my precepts, then Thou shalt judge my house. What these ways of God were, and what His precepts, is neither doubtful nor obscure. For God, when He saw that wickedness and the worship of false gods had so prevailed throughout the world, that His name had now also been taken away from the memory of men (since even the Jews, who alone had been entrusted with the secret of God, had deserted the living God, and, ensared by the deceits of demons, had gone astray, and turned aside to the worship of images, and when rebuked by the prophets did not choose to return to God), He sent His Son[fn-13-P1344_577723:162-nf] as an ambassador to men, that He might turn them from their impious and vain worship to the knowledge and worship of the true God; and also that He might turn their minds from foolishness to wisdom, and from wickedness to deeds of righteousness. These are the ways of God, in which He enjoined Him to walk. These are the precepts which He ordered to be observed. But He exhibited faith towards God. For He taught that there is but one God, and that He alone ought to be worshipped. Nor did He at any time say that He Himself was God; for He would not have maintained His faithfulness, if, when sent to abolish the false gods, and to assert the existence of the one God, He had introduced another besides that one. This would have been not to proclaim one God, nor to do the work of Him who sent Him, but to discharge a peculiar office for Himself, and to separate Himself from Him whom He came to reveal. On which account, because He was so faithful, because He arrogated nothing at all to Himself, that He might fulfil the commands of Him who sent Him, He received the dignity of everlasting Priest, and the honour of supreme King, and the authority of Judge, and the name of God.","title":"Book IV.

For I ask again, in what manner this is said, \"If any man hear not my words, I will not judge him?\"[fn-3-P375_127865:155-nf] For perhaps He has said here, \"I will not judge him,\" in the same sense as there, \"It is not mine to give.\" But what follows here? \"I came not,\" He says, \"to judge the world, but to save the world;\" and then He adds,\" He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him.\" Now here we should understand the Father, unless He had added, \"The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.\" Well, then, will neither the Son judge, because He says, \"I will not judge him,\" nor the Father, but the word which the Son hath spoken? Nay, but hear what yet follows: \"For I,\" He says, \"have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, He gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak; and I know that His commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.\" If therefore the Son judges not, but \"the word which the Son hath spoken;\" and the word which the Son hath spoken therefore judges, because the Son \"hath not spoken of Himself, but the Father who sent Him gave Him a commandment what He should say, and what He should speak:\" then the Father assuredly judges, whose word it is which the Son hath spoken; and the same Son Himself is the very Word of the Father. For the commandment of the Father is not one thing, and the word of the Father another; for He hath called it both a word and a commandment. Let us see, therefore, whether perchance, when He says, \"I have not spoken of myself,\" He meant to be understood thus,-I am not born of myself. For if He speaks the word of the Father, then He speaks Himself,[fn-3-P376_129526:156-nf] because He is Himself the Word of the Father. For ordinarily He says, \"The Father gave to me;\" by which He means it to be understood that the Father begat Him: not that He gave anything to Him, already existing and not possessing it; but that the very meaning of, To have given that He might have, is, To have begotten that He might be. For it is not, as with the creature so with the Son of God before the incarnation and before He took upon Him our flesh, the Only-begotten by whom all things were made; that He is one thing, and has another: but He is in such way as to be what He has. And this is said more plainly, if any one is fit to receive it, in that place where He says: \"For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself.\"[fn-3-P377_130328:157-nf] For He did not give to Him, already existing and not having life, that He should have life in Himself; inasmuch as, in that He is, He is life. Therefore \"He gave to the Son to have life in Himself\" means, He begat the Son to be unchangeable life, which is life eternal.

Therefore both ways of speaking may be used; the Son of man will judge, and, the Son of man will not judge: since the Son of man will judge, that the text may be true which says, \"When the Son of man shall come, then before Him shall be gathered all nations;\" and the Son of man will not judge, that the text may be true which says, \"I will not judge him;\"\"[fn-3-P398_138887:173-nf] and, \"I seek not mine own glory: there is One that seeketh and judgeth.\"[fn-3-P399_138981:174-nf] For in respect to this, that in the judgment, not the form of God, but the form of the Son of man will appear, the Father Himself will not judge; for according to this it is said, \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.\" Whether this is said after that mode of speech which we have mentioned above, where it is said, \"So hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself,\"[fn-4-P400_139414:175-nf] that it should signify that so He begat the Son; or, whether after that of which the apostle speaks, saying, \"Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every name:\"-(For this is said of the Son of man, in respect to whom the Son of God was raised from the dead; since He, being in the form of God equal to the Father, wherefrom He \"emptied\" Himself by taking the form of a servant, both acts and suffers, and receives, in that same form of a servant, what the apostle goes on to mention: \"He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross; wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, in the Glory of God the Father:\"[fn-4-P401_140353:176-nf] -whether then the words, \"He hath committed all judgment unto the Son,\" are said according to this or that mode of speech; it sufficiently appears from this place, that if they were said according to that sense in which it is said, \"He hath given to the Son to have life in Himself,\" it certainly would not be said, \"The Father judgeth no man.\" For in respect to this, that the Father hath begotten the Son equal to Himself, He judges with Him. Therefore it is in respect to this that it is said, that in the judgment, not the form of God, but the form of the Son of man will appear. Not that He will not judge, who hath committed all judgment unto the Son, since the Son saith of Him, \"There is One that seeketh and judgeth:\" but it is so said, \"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son;\" as if it were said, No one will see the Father in the judgment of the quick and the dead, but all will see the Son: because He is also the Son of man, so that He can be seen even by the ungodly, since they too shall see Him whom they have pierced.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"30.

Let us rather say: \"Thou art my glorying,\"[fn-8-P836_168633:550-nf] and \"He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord,\"[fn-8-P837_168704:551-nf] and \"If I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ,\"[fn-8-P838_168791:552-nf] and \"Far be it from me to glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world hath been crucified unto me and I unto the world;\"[fn-8-P839_168960:553-nf] and once more: \"In God we boast all the day long; my soul shall make her boast in the Lord.\"[fn-8-P840_169084:554-nf] When you do alms, let God alone see you. When you fast, be of a cheerful countenance.[fn-8-P841_169206:555-nf] Let your dress be neither too neat nor too slovenly; neither let it be so remarkable as to draw the attention of passers-by, and to make men point their fingers at you. Is a brother dead? Has the body of a sister to be carried to its burial? Take care lest in too often performing such offices you die yourself. Do not wish to seem very devout nor more humble than need be, lest you seek glory by shunning it. For many, who screen from all men's sight their poverty, charity, and fasting, desire to excite admiration by their very disdain of it, and strangely seek for praise while they profess to keep out of its way. From the other disturbing influences which make men rejoice, despond, hope, and fear I find many free; but this is a defect which few are without, and he is best whose character, like a fair skin, is disfigured by the fewest blemishes. I do not think it necessary to warn you against boasting of your riches, or against priding yourself on your birth, or against setting yourself up as superior to others. I know your humility; I know that you can say with sincerity: \"Lord, my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty;\"[fn-8-P842_170383:556-nf] I know that in your breast as in that of your mother the pride through which the devil fell has no place. It would be time wasted to write to you about it; for there is no greater folly than to teach a pupil what he knows already. But now that you have despised the boastfulness of the world, do not let the fact inspire you with new boastfulness. Harbor not the secret thought that having ceased to court attention in garments of gold you may begin to do so in mean attire. And when you come into a room full of brothers and sisters, do not sit in too low a place or plead that you are unworthy of a footstool. Do not deliberately lower your voice as though worn out with fasting; nor, leaning on the shoulder of another, mimic the tottering gait of one who is faint. Some women, it is true, disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast.[fn-8-P843_171260:557-nf] As soon as they catch sight of any one they groan, they look down; they cover up their faces, all but one eye, which they keep free to see with. Their dress is sombre, their girdles are of sackcloth, their hands and feet are dirty; only their stomachs-which cannot be seen-are hot with food. Of these the psalm is sung daily: \"The Lord will scatter the bones of them that please themselves.\"[fn-8-P844_171673:558-nf] Others change their garb and assume the mien of men, being ashamed of being what they were born to be-women.

What else is this but to say that Christ has died in vain? He has indeed died in vain if there are any whom He cannot make alive. When John the Baptist points to Christ and says: \"Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sins[fn-28-P2837_744819:2015-nf] of the world\"[fn-28-P2838_744855:2016-nf] he utters a falsehood if after all there are persons living whose sins Christ has not taken away. For either it must be shewn that they are not of the world whom the grace of Christ thus ignores: or, if it be admitted that they are of the world, we have to choose between the horns of a dilemma. Either they have been delivered from their sins, in which case the power of Christ to save all men is proved; or they remain undelivered and as it were still under the charge of misdoing, in which case Christ is proved to be powerless. But far be it from us to believe of the Almighty that He is powerless in aught. For \"what things soever the Father doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.\"[fn-28-P2839_745566:2017-nf] To ascribe weakness to the Son is to ascribe it to the Father also. The shepherd carries the whole sheep and not only this or that part of it: all the epistles of the apostle[fn-28-P2840_745762:2018-nf] speak continually of the grace of Christ. And, lest a single announcement of this grace might seem a little thing, Peter says: \"Grace unto you and peace be multiplied.\"[fn-28-P2841_745951:2019-nf] The Scripture promises abundance; yet we affirm scarcity.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1356","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1.

You ask whether it has fallen from heaven, as Pythagoras, all Platonists, and Origen suppose; or whether it is part of God's essence as the Stoics, Manes, and the Spanish Priscillianists hint. Whether souls created long since are kept in God's storehouse as some ecclesiastical writers[fn-49-P4917_1348767:3511-nf] foolishly imagine; or whether they are formed by God and introduced into bodies day by day according to that saying in the Gospel: \"my Father worketh hitherto and I work;\"[fn-49-P4918_1348999:3512-nf] or whether, lastly, they are transmitted by propagation. This is the view of Tertullian, Apollinaris, and most western writers who hold that soul is derived from soul as body is from body and that the conditions of life are the same for men and brutes. I have given my opinion on the matter in my reply to the treatise which Rufinus presented to Anastasius, bishop of Rome, of holy memory. He strives in this by an evasive and crafty but sufficiently foolish confession to play with the simplicity of his hearers, but only succeeds in playing with his own faith or rather want of it. My book,[fn-49-P4919_1349613:3513-nf] which has been published a good while, contains an answer to the calumnies which in his various writings Rufinus has directed against me.

But why do we delay any longer to stop their mouths by another most clear and most weighty proof, where not an angel in the singular nor men in the plural are spoken of, but simply angels; by whom not any particular word was wrought, but the Law itself is most distinctly declared to be given; which certainly none of the faithful doubts that God gave to Moses for the control of the children of Israel, or yet, that it was given by angels. So Stephen speaks: \"Ye stiff-necked,\" he says, \"and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: who have received the Law by the disposition of angels,[fn-7-P787_304747:79-nf] and have not kept it.\"[fn-7-P788_304797:80-nf] What is more evident than this? What more strong than such an authority? The Law, indeed, was given to that people by the disposition of angels; but the advent of our Lord Jesus Christ was by it prepared and pre-announced; and He Himself, as the Word of God, was in some wonderful and unspeakable manner in the angels, by whose disposition the Law itself was given. And hence He said in the Gospel, \"For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.\"[fn-7-P789_305294:81-nf] Therefore then the Lord was speaking by the angels; and the son of God, who was to be the Mediator of God and men, from the seed of Abraham, was preparing His own advent by the angels, that He might find some by whom He would be received, confessing themselves guilty, whom the Law unfulfilled had made transgressors. And hence the apostle also says to the Galatians, \"Wherefore then serveth the Law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made, which [seed] was ordered[fn-7-P790_305833:82-nf] through angels in the hand of a mediator;\"[fn-7-P791_305893:83-nf] that is, ordered through angels in His own hand. For He was not born in limitation, but in power.

These he adjusts to his own system of thought, and presents for acceptance, not on authority, hut on their own merits. For Scripture, however, he has an unbounded reverence. Everything that he believes, save the fundamental truth of Theism, of which man has an innate consciousness, being unable to gaze upon the heavens without the conviction that God exists and has His home there[fn-3-P314_265618:147-nf] , is directly derived from Holy Scripture. Scripture for Hilary means the Septuagint for the Old Testament, the Latin for the New. He was, as we saw, no Hebrew Scholar, and had small respect either for the versions which competed with the Septuagint or for the Latin rendering of the old Testament, but there is little evidence[fn-3-P315_265975:148-nf] that he was dissatisfied with the Latin of the New; in fact, in one instance, whether through habitual contentment with his Latin or through momentary carelessness in verifying the sense, he bases an argument on a thoroughly false interpretation[fn-3-P316_266250:149-nf] .

For aiming at ecclesiastical harmony, he summoned to the council Acesius also, a bishop of the sect of Novatians. Now, when the declaration of faith had been written out and subscribed by the Synod, the emperor asked Acesius whether he would also agree to this creed to the settlement of the day on which Easter should be observed. He replied, `The Synod has determined nothing new, my prince: for thus heretofore, even from the beginning, from the times of the apostles, I traditionally received the definition of the faith, and the time of the celebration of Easter.' When, therefore, the emperor further asked him, `For what reason then do you separate yourself from communion with the rest of the Church?' he related what had taken place during the persecution under Decius; and referred to the rigidness of that austere canon which declares, that it is not right persons who after baptism have committed a sin, which the sacred Scriptures denominate `a sin unto death'[fn-3-P345_131735:83-nf] to be considered worthy of participation in the sacraments:[fn-3-P346_131812:84-nf] that they should indeed be exhorted to repentance, but were not to expect remission from the priest, but from God, who is able and has authority to forgive sins.[fn-3-P347_131996:85-nf] When Acesius had thus spoken, the emperor said to him, `Place a ladder, Acesius, and climb alone into heaven.'[fn-3-P348_132124:86-nf] Neither Eusebius Pamphilus nor any other has ever mentioned these things: but I heard them from a man by no means prone to falsehood, who was very old, and simply stated what had taken place in the council in the course of a narrative.

Then again they asked to have it now: He said He had it not; and He did not frighten them now, but after having shown[fn-2-P246_89471:7-nf] [the empty hands], He has done this, and gives them a plausible reason:[fn-2-P247_89732:8-nf] \"Which the Father,\" Hesays, \"hath put in his own power.\" What? Thou not know the things of the Father! Thou knowest Him, and not what belongs to Him! And yet Thou hast said, \"None knoweth the Father but the Son\" (Luke x. 25); and, \"The Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God\" (1 Cor. ii. 10); and Thou not know this! But they feared to ask Him again, test they should hear Him say, \"Are ye also without understanding?\" (Matt. xv. 26.) For they feared Him now much more than before. \"But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.\" As in the former instance He had not answered their question (for it is the part of a teacher to teach not what the disciple chooses, but what is expedient for him to learn), so in this, He tells them beforehand, for this reason, what they ought to know, that they may not be troubled. In truth, they were yet weak. But to inspire them with confidence, He raised up their souls, and concealed what was grievous. Since he was about to leave them very shortly, therefore in this discourse He says nothing painful. But how? He extols as great the things which would be painful: all but saying,\" `Fear not': for ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria.\" For since he had said, \"Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not\" (Matt. x. 5), what there He left unsaid, He here adds \"And to the uttermost part of the earth;\" and having spoken this, which was more fearful than all the rest, then that they may not again question Him, He held His peace. \"And having this said, while they beheld, He was taken up; and a cloud received Him out of their sight\" (v. 9). Seest thou that they did preach and fulfil the Gospel? For great was the gift He had bestowed on them. In the very place, He says, where ye are afraid, that is, in Jerusalem, there preach ye first, and afterwards unto the uttermost part of the earth. Then for assurance of what He had said, \"While they beheld, He was taken up.\" Not \"while they beheld\" did He rise from the dead, but \"while they beheld, He was taken up.\" Inasmuch, however, as the sight of their eyes even here was not all-sufficient; for in the Resurrection they saw the end, but not the beginning, and in the Ascension they saw the beginning, but not the end: because in the former it had been superfluous to have seen the beginning, the Lord Himself Who spake these things being present, and the sepulchre showing clearly that He is not there; but in the latter, they needed to be informed of the sequel by word of others: inasmuch then as their eyes do not suffice to show them the height above, nor to inform them whether He is actually gone up into heaven, or only seemingly into heaven, see then what follows. That it was Jesus Himself they knew from the fact that He had been conversing with them (for had they seen only from a distance, they could not have recognized Him by sight),[fn-2-P248_94047:9-nf] but that He is taken up into Heaven the Angels themselves inform them. Observe how it is ordered, that not all is done by the Spirit, but the eyes also do their part. But why did \"a cloud receive Him?\" This too was a sure sign that He went up to Heaven. Not fire, as in the case of Elijah, nor fiery chariot but \"a cloud received Him;\" which was a symbol of Heaven, as the Prophet says;[fn-2-P249_94763:10-nf] \"Who maketh the clouds His chariot\" (Ps. civ. 3); it is of the Father Himself that this is said. Therefore he says, \"on a cloud;\" in the symbol, he would say, of the Divine power, for no other Power is seen to appear on a cloud. For hear again what another Prophet says: \"The Lord sitteth upon a light cloud\" (Is. xix. 1). For[fn-2-P250_95193:11-nf] it was while they were listening with great attention to what He was saying, and this in answer to a very interesting question, and with their minds fully aroused and quite awake, that this thing took place. Also on the mount [Sinai] the cloud was because of Him: since Moses also entered into the darkness, but the cloud there was not because of Moses. And He did not merely say, \"I go,\" lest they should again grieve, but He said, \"I send the Spirit\" John xvi. 5, John xvi. 7); and that He was going away into heaven they saw with their eyes. O what a sight they were granted! \"And while they looked stedfastly,\" it is said, \"toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is g taken up from you into heaven\"-they used the expression \"This\" demonstratively, saying, \"this Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall thus\"-demonstratively, \"in this way\"-\"come in like manner as ye have seen Him going into heaven.\" (v. 10, 11.) Again, the outward appearance is cheering [\"in white apparel\"]. They were Angels, in the form of men. And they say, \"Ye men of Galilee:\" they showed themselves to be trusted by the disciples, by saying, \"Ye men of Galilee.\" For this was the meaning: else, what needed they to be told of their country, who knew it well enough? By their appearance also they attracted their regard, and shewed that they were from heaven. But wherefore does not Christ Himself tell them these things, instead of the Angels? He had beforehand told them all things; [\"What if ye shall see the Son of Man] going up where He was before?\" (John vi. 62).","title":"Homily II.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":5,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_100_sermon_lxxxiii_cxxxiii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"6.

Yea rather, seeing that I have no doubt that Christ did not speak falsely, I will either thoroughly examine this passage and understand it, or, not understanding it, I will defer it. Yet that Christ spoke falsely will I never say. Grant that I have not understood it; I will depart in my ignorance. For better is it with piety to be ignorant, than with madness to pronounce judgment. Notwithstanding we are trying to examine, if so be by His assistance, who is the Truth, we may find something, and be found something ourselves, and this something will not be in the Truth a lie.

Do not be so eager; speak more composedly, more tranquilly. See, it is the Gospel I have in my hands; and what is there in it?

I marvel exceedingly how thou shouldest say that Christ lieth, anti the Gospel doth not lie. But test haply when I speak of the Gospel, thou shouldest think of the book itself, and imagine the parchment and ink to be the Gospel, see what the Greek word means; Gospel is \"a good messenger,\" or \"a good message.\" The messenger then doth not lie, and doth He who sent him, lie? This messenger, the Evangelist to wit, to give his name also, this John who wrote this, did he lie concerning Christ, or say the truth? Choose which you will, I am ready to hear you on either side.

Christ: let John be the stream. The stream comes to me, and you say to me, \"Drink securely;\" yea, whereas you alarm me as to the Fountain Himself, whereas you tell me there is falsehood in the Fountain, you say to me, \"Drink securely.\" What do I drink?

I have read in the Gospel plainly, \"John lay on the Lord's Breast;\"[fn-63-P6369_2692106:22-nf] but I conclude that he drank in truth. What saw he as he lay on the Lord's Breast?

Therefore, beloved brethren, in declaring that the Son is like in all things to the Father, we declare nothing else than that He is equal. Likeness means perfect equality, and this fact we may gather from the Holy Scriptures, And Adam lived two hundred and thirty years, and begat a son according to his own image and according to his own likeness; and called his name Seth[fn-8-P877_540853:42-nf] . I ask what was the nature of his likeness and image which Adam begot in Seth? Remove bodily infirmities, remove the first stage of conception, remove birth-pangs, and every kind of human need. I ask whether this likeness which exists in Seth differs in nature from the author of his being, or whether there was in each an essence of a different kind, so that Seth had not at his birth the natural essence of Adam? Nay, he had a likeness to Adam, even though we deny it, for his nature was not different. This likeness of nature in Seth was not due to a nature of a different kind, since Seth was begotten from only one father, so we see that a likeness of nature renders things equal because this likeness betokens an exactly similar essence. Therefore every son by virtue of his natural birth is the equal of his father, in that he has a natural likeness to him. And with regard to the nature of the Father and the Son the blessed John teaches the very likeness which Moses says existed between Seth and Adam, a likeness which is this equality of nature. He says, Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because He not only had broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was His father, making Himself equal with God[fn-8-P878_542097:43-nf] . Why do we allow minds that are dulled with the weight of sin to interfere with the doctrines and sayings of such holy men, and impiously match our rash though sluggish senses against their impregnable assertions? According to Moses, Seth is the likeness of Adam, according to John, the Son is equal to the Father, yet we seek to find a third impossible something between the Father and the Son.

Not that He ever was without the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as He was born in the flesh through the Holy Ghost; but in order to prove that to be the true baptism by which the Holy Ghost comes. So then if an Arian cannot give the Holy Spirit, he cannot even baptize, because there is no baptism of the Church without the Holy Spirit. And you, when you receive a person baptized by an Arian and afterwards invoke the Holy Ghost, ought either to baptize him, because without the Holy Ghost he could not be baptized, or, if he was baptized in the Spirit, you must not invoke the Holy Ghost for your convert who received Him at the time of baptism.","title":"The Dialogue Against the Luciferians","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_09_book_iv_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"116","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"32 And he, with his hands behind him, and bound like a noble ram taken from a great flock, an acceptable burnt-offering unto God omnipotent, said, `Father of thy beloved and blessed Son[fn-24-P2406_1137999:79-nf] Jesus Christ, through whom we have received the knowledge of thee, the God of angels and of powers and of the whole creation and of the entire race of the righteous who live in thy presence, I bless thee that thou hast deemed me worthy of this day and hour, that I might receive a portion in the number of the martyrs, in the cup of Christ, unto resurrection of eternal life,[fn-24-P2407_1138618:80-nf] both of soul and of body, in the immortality of the Holy Spirit.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Eusebius Pamphilus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_13_book_vii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"4. Why, then, is scarcely anything ever said in the Scriptures of wisdom, unless to show that it is begotten or created of God?-begotten in the case of that Wisdom by which all things are made; but created or made, as in men, when they are converted to that Wisdom which is not created anti made but begotten, and are so enlightened; for in these men themselves there comes to be something which may be called their wisdom: even as the Scriptures foretell or narrate, that \"the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;\"[fn-11-P1182_499909:4-nf] for in this way Christ was made wisdom, because He was made man. Is it on this account that wisdom does not speak in these books, nor is anything spoken of it, except to declare that it is born of God, or made by Him (although the Father is Himself wisdom), namely, because wisdom ought to be commended and imitated by us, by the imitation of which we are fashioned [rightly]? For the Father speaks it, that it may be His Word: yet not as a word producing a sound proceeds from the mouth, or is thought before it is pronounced. For this word is completed in certain spaces of time, but that is eternal, and speaks to us by enlightening us, what ought to be spoken to men, both of itself and of the Father. And therefore He says, \"No man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father. save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him:\"[fn-11-P1183_500791:5-nf] since the Father reveals by the Son, that is, by His Word. For if that word which we utter, and which is temporal and transitory, declares both itself, and that of which we speak, how much more the Word of God, by which all things are made? For this Word so declares the Father as He is the Father; because both itself so is, and is that which is the Father, in so far as it is wisdom and essence. For in so far as it is the Word. it is not what the Father is: because the Word is not the Father, and Word is spoken relatively, as is also Son, which assuredly is not the Father. And therefore Christ is the power and wisdom of God, because He Himself, being also power and wisdom, is from the Father, who is power and wisdom; as He is light of the Father, who is light, and the fountain of life with God the Father, who is Himself assuredly the fountain of life. For \"with Thee,\" He says, \"is the fountain of life, and in Thy light shall we see light.\"[fn-11-P1184_501762:6-nf] Because, \"as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself:\"[fn-11-P1185_501880:7-nf] and, \"He was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world:\" and this light, \"the Word,\" was \"with God;\" but \"the Word also was God;\"[fn-11-P1186_502050:8-nf] and \"God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all:\"[fn-11-P1187_502121:9-nf] but a light that is not corporeal, but spiritual; yet not in such way spiritual, that it was wrought by illumination, as it was said to the apostles, \"Ye are the light of the world,\"[fn-11-P1188_502321:10-nf] but \"the light which lighteth every man,\" that very supreme wisdom itself who is God, of whom we now treat. The Son therefore is Wisdom of wisdom, namely the Father, as He is Light of light, and God of God; so that both the Father singly is light, and the Son singly is light; and the Father singly is God, and the Son singly is God: therefore the Father also singly is wisdom, and the Son singly is wisdom. And as both together are one light and one God, so both are one wisdom.

How this happened I shall state, after first explaining the reason of the strict discipline which is maintained in their church, even to the present day, in the provinces of Phrygia and Paphlagonia. Novatus,[fn-14-P1444_632794:82-nf] a presbyter of the Roman Church, separated from it, because Cornelius the bishop received into communion believers who had sacrificed during the persecution which the Emperor Decius[fn-14-P1445_633223:83-nf] had raised against the Church. Having seceded on this account, on being afterwards elevated to the episcopacy by such bishops as entertained similar sentiments, he wrote to all the churches[fn-14-P1446_633859:84-nf] that `they should not admit to the sacred mysteries those who had sacrificed; but exhorting them to repentance, leave the pardoning of their offense to God, who has the power to forgive all sin.' Receiving such letters, the parties in the various provinces, to whom they were addressed, acted according to their several dispositions and judgments. As he asked that they should not receive to the sacraments those who after baptism had committed any deadly sin[fn-14-P1447_634335:85-nf] this appeared to some a cruel and merciless course: but others received the rule as just and conducive to the maintenance of discipline, and the promotion of greater devotedness of life. In the midst of the agitation of this question, letters arrived from Cornelius the bishop, promising indulgence to delinquents after baptism. Thus as these two persons wrote contrary to one another, and each confirmed his own procedure by the testimony of the Divine word, as it usually happens, every one identified himself with that view which favored his previous habits and inclinations. Those who had pleasure in sin, encouraged by the license then granted them, took occasion from it to revel in every species of criminality. Now the Phrygians appear to be more temperate than other nations, and are seldom guilty of swearing. The Scythians, on the other hand, and the Thracians, are naturally of a very irritable disposition: while the inhabitants of the East are addicted to sensual pleasures. But the Paphlagonians and Phrygians are prone to neither of these vices; nor are the sports of the circus and theatrical exhibitions in much estimation among them even to the present day. And for this reason, it seems to me, these people, as well as others of the same character, so readily assented to the letters then written by Novatus. Fornication and adultery are regarded among them as the grossest enormities: and it is well known that there is no race of men on the face of the earth who more rigidly govern their passions in this respect than the Phrygians and Paphlagonians. The same reason I think had force with those who dwelt in the West and followed Novatus. Yet although for the sake of stricter discipline Novatus became a separatist, he made no change in the time of keeping Easter,[fn-14-P1448_636159:86-nf] but invariably observed the practice that obtained in the Western churches. For they celebrate this feast after the equinox, according to the usage which had of old been delivered to them when first they embraced Christianity. He himself indeed afterwards suffered martyrdom in the reign of Valerian,[fn-14-P1449_636484:87-nf] during the persecution which was then raised against the Christians. But those in Phrygia[fn-14-P1450_637050:88-nf] who are named after him Novatians, about this period changed the day of celebrating Easter, being averse to communion with other Christians even on this occasion. This was effected by means of a few obscure bishops of that sect convening a Synod at the village of Pazum, which is situated near the sources of the river Sangarius; for there they framed a canon appointing its observance on the same day as that on which the Jews annually keep the feast of Unleavened Bread. An aged man, who was the son of a presbyter, and had been present with his father at this Synod, gave us our information on this matter. But both Agelius, bishop of the Novatians at Constantinople, and Maximus of Nicaea, as also the bishops of Nicomedia and Cotyaeum, were absent, although the ecclesiastical affairs of the Novatians were for the most part under the control of these bishops. How the church of the Novatians soon after was divided into two parties in consequence of this Synod, shall be related in its proper course:[fn-14-P1451_638167:89-nf] but we must now notice what took place about the same time in the Western parts.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_17_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_magnesians","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"ANF-01","text":"As therefore the Lord does nothing without the Father, for says He, \"I can of mine own self do nothing,\"[fn-14-P1490_262158:43-nf] so do ye, neither presbyter, nor deacon, nor layman, do anything without the bishop.

For, because Jesus Christ was to introduce the second people (which is composed of us nations, lingering deserted in the world[fn-22-P2287_757601:164-nf] aforetime) into the land of promise, \"flowing with milk and honey\"[fn-22-P2288_757983:165-nf] (that is, into the possession of eternal life, than which nought is sweeter); and this had to come about, not through Moses (that is, not through the Law's discipline), but through Joshua (that is, through the new law's grace), after our circumcision with \"a knife of rock\"[fn-22-P2289_758306:166-nf] (that is, with Christ's precepts, for Christ is in many ways and figures predicted as a rock[fn-22-P2290_758584:167-nf] ); therefore the man who was being prepared to act as images of this sacrament was inaugurated under the figure of the Lord's name, even so as to be named Jesus.[fn-22-P2291_758781:168-nf] For He who ever spake to Moses was the Son of God Himself; who, too, was always seen.[fn-22-P2292_758888:169-nf] For God the Father none ever saw, and lived.[fn-22-P2293_758961:170-nf] And accordingly it is agreed that the Son of God Himself spake to Moses, and said to the people, \"Behold, I send mine angel before thy\"-that is, the people's-\"face, to guard thee on the march, and to introduce thee into the land which I have prepared thee: attend to him, and be not disobedient to him; for he hath not escaped[fn-22-P2294_759360:171-nf] thy notice, since my name is upon him.\"[fn-22-P2295_759553:172-nf] For Joshua was to introduce the people into the land of promise, not Moses. Now He called him an \"angel,\" on account of the magnitude of the mighty deeds which he was to achieve (which mighty deeds Joshua the son of Nun did, and you yourselves read), and on account of his office of prophet announcing (to wit) the divine will; just as withal the Spirit, speaking in the person of the Father, calls the forerunner of Christ, John, a future \"angel,\" through the prophet: \"Behold, I send mine angel before Thy\"-that is, Christ's-\"face, who shall prepare Thy way before Thee.\"[fn-22-P2296_760153:173-nf] Nor is it a novel practice to the Holy Spirit to call those \"angels\" whom God has appointed as ministers of His power.

Our Lord, for instance, raised Lazarus; He unquestionably was able to do so. But inasmuch as He did not raise up Judas[fn-19-P1937_826060:23-nf] must we therefore contend that He was unable to do so? He certainly was able, but He would not. For if He had been willing, He could have effected this too.

Among the many passages in which he treats of this subject, occurs the following: \"I once more repeat my position: I say that it is possible for a man to be without sin. What do you say? That it is impossible for a man to be without sin? But I do not say,\" he adds, \"that there is a man without sin; nor do you say, that there is not a man without sin. Our contention is about what is possible, and not possible; not about what is, and is not.\" He then enumerates certain passages of Scripture,[fn-19-P1939_827437:25-nf] which are usually alleged in opposition to them, and insists that they have nothing to do with the question, which is really in dispute, as to the possibility or impossibility of a man's being without sin. This is what he says: \"No man indeed is clean from pollution; and, There is no man that sinneth not; and, There is not a just man upon the earth; and, There is none that doeth good. There are these and similar passages in Scripture,\" says he, \"but they testify to the point of not being, not of not being able; for by testimonies of this sort it is shown what kind of persons certain men were at such and such a time, not that they were unable to be something else.

Again the phrase, \"not having lot in his power,\" we should rather pass by as un-meaning than confute as ungodly. For what sense is attached to the term \"having lot\" is not easy to discover from the common use of the word. Those cast lots, as the Scripture tells us, for the Lord's vesture, who were unwilling to rend His garment, but disposed to make it over to that one of their number in whose favour the lot should decide[fn-10-P1026_552554:57-nf] . They then who thus cast lots among themselves for the \"coat\" may be said, perhaps, to \"have had lot\" in it. But here in the case of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as Their power resides in Their nature (for the Holy Spirit breathes \"where He listeth[fn-10-P1027_552865:58-nf] ,\" and \"worketh all in all as He will[fn-10-P1028_552924:59-nf] ,\" and the Son, by Whom all things were made, visible and invisible, in heaven and in earth, \"did all things whatsoever He pleased[fn-10-P1029_553098:60-nf] ,\" and \"quickeneth whom He will[fn-10-P1030_553149:61-nf] ,\" and the Father put \"the times in His own powers[fn-10-P1031_553220:62-nf] ,\" while from the mention of \"times\" we conclude that all things done in time are subject to the power I of the Father), if, I say, it has been demonstrated that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit alike are in a position of power to do what They will, it is impossible to see what sense there can be in the phrase \"having lot in His power.\" For the heir of all things, the maker of the ages[fn-10-P1032_553633:63-nf] , He Who shines with the Father's glory and expresses in Himself the Father's person, has all things that the Father Himself has, and is possessor of all His power, not that the right is transferred from the Father to the Son, but that it at once remains in the Father and resides in the Son. For He Who is in the Father is manifestly in the Father with all His own might, and He Who has the Father in Himself includes all the power and might of the Father. For He has in Himself all the Father, and not merely a part of Him: and He Who has Him entirely assuredly has His power as well. With what meaning, then, Eunomius asserts that the Father has \"none who has lot in His power,\" those perhaps can tell who are disciples of his folly one who knows how to appreciate language confesses that he cannot understand phrases divorced from meaning. The Father, he says, \"has none Who has lot in His power.\" Why, who is there that says that the Father and Son contend together for power and cast lots to decide the matter? But the holy Eunomius comes as mediator between them and by a friendly agreement without lot assigns to the Father the superiority in power.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Why should I pursue this part of the subject in more detail?

For the very glory that was bestowed on the lawgiver was the glory of none other but of God Himself, which glory the Lord in the Gospel bids all to seek, when He blames those who value human glory highly and seek not the glory that cometh from God only[fn-11-P1136_615427:142-nf] . For by the fact that He commanded them to seek the glory that cometh from the only God, He declared the possibility of their obtaining what they sought.

How then are we to dispose of the utterances of the Truth,-one which tells us that He shall be seen in the glory of the Father[fn-11-P1138_616252:144-nf] , and another which says, \"All things that the Father hath are Mine[fn-11-P1139_616345:145-nf] \"?

Now among the \"all things,\" glory surely is included. Yet Eunomius says that the glory of the Almighty is incommunicable. This view Joel does not attest, nor yet the mighty Peter, who adopted, in his speech to the Jews, the language of the prophet. For both the prophet and the apostle say, in the person of God,-\"I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh[fn-11-P1141_617017:147-nf] .\" He then Who did not grudge the partaking in His own Spirit to all flesh,-how can it be that He does not impart His own glory to the only-begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, Who has all things that the Father has? Perhaps one should say that Eunomius is here speaking the truth, though not intending it. For the term \"impart\" is strictly used in the case of one who has not his glory from within, whose possession of it is an accession from without, and not part of his own nature: but where one and the same nature is observed in both Persons, He Who is as regards nature all that the Father is believed to be stands in no need of one to impart to Him each several attribute. This it will be well to explain more clearly and precisely.

For the Churchman and the heretic alike affirm that \"the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son[fn-12-P1202_655059:192-nf] ,\" but to this assertion they severally attach different meanings.

Their object in such a malignant perversion of the true doctrine, is to show that the less exalted statements, which our Lord utters in tits humanity, are to be thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show their blasphemy to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual acknowledgment of the Lord. For this reason it is that Eunomius says, \"He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man made up of soul and body.\" But, after searching through all the inspired and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came \"to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-12-P1204_656584:193-nf] .\" Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster of our nature bad its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was twofold, death correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the deprivation of the twofold life that operates in him who is thus mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body into its kindred elements: but \"the soul that sinneth,\" he saith, \"it shall die[fn-12-P1205_657543:194-nf] .\" Now sin is nothing else than alienation from God, Who is the true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived many hundred years after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, \"In the day that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die[fn-12-P1206_657814:195-nf] .\" For by the fact of his alienation from the true life, the sentence of death was ratified against him that self-same day: and after this, at a much later time, there followed also the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this cause that He might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries home on His shoulders the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may make the man of God complete, united to the deity in body and in soul. And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now the soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the result of being ill-advised: and this He sanctifies by union with Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy along with the first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the destruction of the enemies of the Lord, said, \"They are dead which sought the young Child's life[fn-12-P1207_658887:196-nf] ,\" (or \"soul\"): and the Lord says to the Jews, \"Ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth[fn-12-P1208_659073:197-nf] .\" Now by \"Man\" is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is composed of both, soul and body. And again, He says to them, \"Are ye angry at Me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day[fn-12-P1209_659388:198-nf] ?\" And what He meant by \"every whit whole,\" He showed in the other Gospels, when He said to the man who was let down on a couch in the midst, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee,\" which is a healing of the soul, and, \"Arise and walk[fn-12-P1210_659636:199-nf] ,\" which has regard to the body: and in the Gospel of S. John, by liberating the soul also from its own malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, \"Thou art made whole, sin no more[fn-12-P1211_659932:200-nf] ,\" thou, that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul and in body. For so too does S. Paul speak, \"for to make in Himself of twain one new man[fn-12-P1212_660105:201-nf] .\" And so too He foretells that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul from His body, saying, \"No man taketh\" my soul \"from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again[fn-12-P1213_660370:202-nf] .\" Yea, the prophet David also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with foresight of Him, \"Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption[fn-12-P1214_660678:203-nf] ,\" while the Apostle Peter thus expounds the saying, that \"His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption.\" For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh and in the flesh and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at all times what It was by nature, and so continuing for ever. But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter said, \"This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ[fn-12-P1215_661720:204-nf] ;\" and we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them through His body. But it would be superfluous to encumber our argument by entering into every detail.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"79","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Why then is the majesty of the Spirit curtailed by such arguments as these? For there is nothing which can be the cause of producing in him deviation by excess or defect from conceptions such as befit the Godhead, nor, since all these are by Holy Scripture predicated equally of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, can he inform us wherein he discerns inequality to exist. But he launches his blasphemy against the Holy Ghost in its naked form, ill-prepared and unsupported by any consecutive argument. \"Nor yet ranked,\" he says, \"with any other: for He has gone above[fn-12-P1267_685876:246-nf] all the creatures that came into being by the instrumentality of the Son in mode of being, and nature, and glory, and knowledge, as the first and noblest work of the Only-begotten, the greatest and most glorious.\" I will leave, however, to others the task of ridiculing the bad taste and surplusage of his style, thinking as I do that it is unseemly for the gray baits of age, when dealing with the argument before us, to make vulgarity of expression an objection against one who is guilty of impiety. I will just add to my investigation this remark. If the Spirit has \"gone above\" all the creations of the Son, (for I will use his own ungrammatical and senseless phrase, or rather, to make things clearer, I will present his idea in my own language) if he transcends all things wrought by the Son, the Holy Spirit cannot be ranked with the rest of the creation; and if, as Eunomius says, he surpasses them by virtue of priority of birth, he must needs confess, in the case of the rest of creation, that the objects which are first in order of production are more to be esteemed than those which come after them. Now the creation of the irrational animals was prior to that of man. Accordingly he will of course declare that the irrational nature is more honourable than rational existence. So too, according to the argument of Eunomius, Cain will be proved superior to Abel, in that he was before him in time of birth, and so the stars will be shown to be lower and of less excellence than all the things that grow out of the earth; for these last sprang from the earth on the third day, and all the stars are recorded by Moses to have been created on the fourth. Well, surely no one is such a simpleton as to infer that the grass of the earth is more to be esteemed than the marvels of thesky, on the ground of its precedence in time, or to award the meed to Cain over Abel, or to place below the irrational animals man who came into being later than they. So there is no sense in our author's contention that the nature of the Holy Spirit is superior to that of the creatures that came into being subsequently, on the ground that He came into being before they did. And now let us see what he who separates Him from fellowship with the Son is prepared to concede to the glory of the Spirit: \"For he too,\" he says, \"being one, and first and alone, and surpassing all the creations of the Son in essence and dignity of nature, accomplishing every operation and all teaching according to the good pleasure of the Son, being sent by Him, and receiving from Him, and declaring to those who are instructed, and guiding into truth.\" He speaks of the Holy Ghost as \"accomplishing every operation and all teaching.\" What operation? Does he mean that which the Father and the Son execute, according to the word of the Lord Himself Who \"hitherto worketh[fn-12-P1268_688880:247-nf] \" man's salvation, or does he mean some other? For if His work is that named, He has assuredly the same power and nature as Him Who works it, and in such an one difference of kind from Deity can have no place. For just as, if anything should perform the functions of fire, shining and warming in precisely the same way, it is itself certainly fire, so if the Spirit does the works of the Father, He must assuredly be acknowledged to be of the same nature with Him. If on the other hand He operates something else than our salvation, and displays His operation in a contrary direction, He will thereby be proved to be of a different nature and essence. But Eunomius' statement itself bears witness that the Spirit quickeneth in like manner with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, from the identity of operations it results assuredly that the Spirit is not alien from the nature of the Father and the Son. And to the statement that the Spirit accomplishes the operation and teaching of the Father according to the good pleasure of the Son we assent. For the community of nature gives us warrant that the will of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is one, and thus, if the Holy Spirit wills that which seems good to the Son, the community of will clearly points to unity of essence. But he goes on, \"being sent by Him, and receiving from Him, and declaring to those who are instructed, and guiding into truth.\" If he had not previously said what he has concerning the Spirit, the reader would surely have supposed that these words applied to some human teacher. For to receive a mission is the same thing as to be sent, and to have nothing of one's own, but to receive of the free favour of him who gives the mission, and to minister his words to those who are under instruction, and to be a guide into truth for those that are astray. All these things, which Eunomius is good enough to allow to the Holy Spirit, belong to the present pastors and teachers of the Church, -to be sent, to receive, to announce, to teach, to suggest the truth. Now, as he had said above \"He is one, and first, and alone, and surpassing all,\" had be but stopped there, he would have appeared as a defender of the doctrines of truth. For He Who is indivisibly contemplated in the One is most truly One, and first Who is in the First, and alone Who is in the Only One. For as the spirit of man that is in him, and the man himself, are but one man, so also the Spirit of God which is in Him, and God Himself, would properly be termed One God, and First and Only, being incapable of separation from Him in Whom He is. But as things are, with his addition of his profane phrase, \"surpassing all the creatures of the Son,\" he produces turbid confusion by assigning to Him Who \"breatheth where He willeth[fn-12-P1269_691690:248-nf] ,\" and \"worketh all in all[fn-12-P1270_691740:249-nf] ,\" a mere superiority in comparison with the rest of created things.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_19_book_xi_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"4.

Nay more: if you believed Moses, you would believe also in God, the Son of God; unless perchance you deny that it was of Him that Moses spoke. If you propose to deny that, you must listen to the words of God:-For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed Me also, far he wrote of Me[fn-13-P1350_830210:15-nf] . Moses, indeed, will refute you with the whole volume of the Law, ordained through angels, which he received by the hand of the Mediator. Enquire whether He, Who gave the Law, were not true God; for the Mediator was the Giver. And was it not to meet God that Moses led out the people to the Mount? Was it not God Who came down into the Mount? Or was it, perhaps, only by a fiction or an adoption, and not by right of nature, that He, Who did all this, bore the name of God? Mark the blare of the trumpets, the flashing of the torches, the clouds of smoke, as from a furnace, rolling over the mountain, the terror of conscious impotence on the part of man in the presence of God, the confession of the people, when they prayed Moses to be their spokesman, that at the voice of God they would die. Is He, in your judgment, not true God, when simple dread lest He should speak filled Israel with the fear of death? He Whose voice could not be borne by human weakness? In your eyes is He not God, because He addressed you through the weak faculties of a man, that you might hear, and live[fn-13-P1351_831317:16-nf] ? Moses entered the Mount; in forty days and nights he gained the knowledge of the mysteries of heaven, and set it all in order according to the vision of the truth which was revealed to him there. From intercourse with God, Who spoke with him, he received the reflected splendour of that glory on which none may gaze? his corruptible countenance was transfigured into the likeness of the unapproachable light of Him, with Whom he was dwelling. Of this God he bears witness, of this God he speaks; he summons the angels of God to come and worship Him amid the gladness of the Gentiles, and prays that the blessings which please Him may descend upon the head of Joseph. In face of such evidence as this, dare any man say that He has nothing but the name of God, and deny His true Divinity?","title":"Book V","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_13_to_pammachius_against_john_of_jerusalem","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"22. But suppose the fact to be that you merely omit this, and that your simplicity does not mean something you are shrewd enough to conceal. Having once begun to speak of the soul, and to deduce arguments on such an important topic from man's first creation, why do you leave the discussion in mid-air, and suddenly pass to the angels, and the conditions under which the body of our Lord existed? Why do you pass by such a vast slough of difficulty, and leave us to stick in the mire? If the inbreathing of God (a view for which you have no liking, and a point which you now leave unsettled) is the creating of the human soul; whence had Eve her soul, seeing that God did not breathe into her face? But I will not dwell upon Eve, since she, as a type of the Church, was made out of one of her husband's ribs, and ought not, after so many ages, to be subjected to the calumnies of her descendants. I ask whence Cain and Abel, who were the firstborn of our first parents, had their souls? And the whole human race downwards, what, are we to think, was the origin of their souls? Did they come by propagation, like brute beasts? So that, as body springs from body, so soul from soul. Or is it the case that rational creatures, longing for bodily existence, sink by degrees to earth, and at last are tied even to human bodies? Surely (as the Church teaches in accordance with the Saviour's words,[fn-70-P7070_2316039:48-nf] \"My Father worketh hitherto and I work\"; and the passage in Isaiah,[fn-70-P7071_2316124:49-nf] \"Who maketh the spirit of man in him\"; and in the Psalms,[fn-70-P7072_2316214:50-nf] \"Who fashioneth one by one the hearts of them\") God is daily making souls-He, with whom to will is to do, and who never ceases to be a Creator. I know what you are accustomed to say in opposition to this, and how you confront us with adultery and incest. But the dispute about these is a tedious one, and would exceed the narrow limits of the time at our disposal. The same argument may be retorted upon you, and whatever seems unworthy in the Creator of the present dispensation is again not unworthy, since it is His gift. Birth from adultery imputes no blame to the child, but to the father. As in the case of seeds, the earth which cherishes does not sin, nor the seed which is thrown into the furrows, nor the heat and moisture, under whose influence the grain bursts into bud, but some man, as for example, the thief and robber, who, by fraud and violence, plucks up the seed: so in the begetting of men, the womb, which corresponds to the earth, receives its own, and nourishes what it has received, and then gives a body to that which it nourishes, and divides into the several members the body it has formed. And among those secret recesses of the belly the hand of God is always working, and there is the same Creator of body and soul. Do not despise the goodness of your Maker, who fashioned you and made you as He chose. He Himself is the virtue of God and the wisdom of God, who, in the womb of the Virgin, built a house for Himself. Jephthah, who is reckoned by the Apostle among the saints, is the son of a harlot. But listen: Esau, born of Rebecca had Isaac, a \"hairy man,\" both in mind and body, like good wheat, degenerates into darnel and wild oats; because the cause of vice and virtue does not lie in the seed, but in the will of him who is born. If it is an offence to be born with a human body, how is it that Isaac, Samson, John Baptist, are the children of promise? You see, I trust, what it is to have the courage of one's convictions. Suppose I am wrong, I openly say what I think. Do you, then, likewise either freely profess our opinions, or firmly maintain your own. Do not set yourself in my line of battle, so that, by feigning simplicity, you may be safe, and may be able, when you choose, to stab your opponent in the back. It is impossible for me, at the present moment, to write a book against the opinions of Origen. If Christ gives us life, we will devote another work to them.

For the dew which God gives is[fn-71-P7118_2350528:85-nf] healing to their bones. Then shall be fulfilled what God says by the prophet,[fn-71-P7119_2350669:86-nf] \"Go, my people, into thy closets for a little while, until mine anger pass.\" The closets signify the graves, out of which that, of course, is brought forth which had been laid therein.

As many of us, therefore, as have this hope, as we have yielded our members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto iniquity, so let us yield them servants to righteousness unto holiness, that[fn-71-P7122_2351757:89-nf] we may rise from the dead and walk in newness of life.

Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin.'[fn-27-P2708_1059261:194-nf] Also elsewhere: `Whosoever is born of God sinneth not; because his being born of God preserveth him, and the evil one toucheth him not.'[fn-27-P2709_1059420:195-nf] And again in another passage, when speaking of the Saviour, he says: `Since He was manifested to take away sins, whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him.'[fn-27-P2710_1059649:196-nf] And yet again: `Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope towards Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.'\"[fn-27-P2711_1059952:197-nf] And yet, notwithstanding the truth of all these passages, that also is true which he has adduced, without, however, offering any explanation of it: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-27-P2712_1060208:198-nf] Now it follows from the whole of this, that in so far as we are born of God we abide in Him who appeared to take away sins, that is, in Christ, and sin not,-which is simply that \"the inward man is renewed day by day;\"[fn-27-P2713_1060446:199-nf] but in so far as we are born of that man \"through whom sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men\"[fn-27-P2714_1060603:200-nf] we are not without sin, because we are not as yet free from his infirmity, until, by that renewal which takes place from day to day (for it is in accordance with this that we were born of God), that infirmity shall be wholly repaired, wherein we were born from the first than, and in which we are not without sin. While the remains of this infirmity abide in our inward man, however much they may be daily lessened in those who are advancing, \"we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us, if we say that we have no sin.\" Now, however true it is that \"whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, nor known Him\"[fn-27-P2715_1061231:201-nf] since with that vision and knowledge, which shall be realized in actual sight, no one can in this life see and know Him; yet with that vision and knowledge which come of faith, there may be many who commit sin,-even apostates themselves,-who still have believed in Him some time or other; so that of none of these could it be said, according to the vision and knowledge which as yet come of faith, that he has neither seen Him nor known Him. But I suppose it ought to be understood that it is the renewal which awaits perfection that sees and knows Him; whereas the infirmity which is destined to waste and ruin neither sees nor knows Him.

God the Only-begotten proves His Sonship by an appeal not only to the name, but to the power; the works which He does are evidence that He has been sent by the Father. What, I ask, is the fact which these works prove? That He was sent. That He was sent, is used as a proof of His sonlike obedience and of His Father's authority: for the works which He does could not possibly be done by any other than Him Who is sent by the Father. Yet the evidence of His works fails to convince the unbelieving that the Father sent Him. For He proceeds, And the Father Himself which hath sent Me hath borne witness of Me; and ye have neither heard His voice nor seen His shape[fn-14-P1443_908846:28-nf] .

Read us other of the attestations given by the Father beside those which we have heard already; This is My beloved Son, in Whom I am well pleased, and Thou art My Son. John, who heard these words, needed them not, for He knew the truth already. It was for our instruction that the Father spoke. But this is not all. John in the wilderness was honoured with this revelation; the Apostles were not to be denied the same assurance. It came to them in the very same words, but with an addition which John did not receive. He had been a prophet from the womb, and needed not the commandment, Hear Him. Yes; I will hear Him, and will hear none but Him and His Apostle, who heard for my instruction. Even though the books contained no further witness, borne by the Father to the Son, than that He is the Son, I have, for confirmation of the truth, the evidence of His Father's works which He does. What is this modern slander that His name is a gift by adoption, His Godhead a lie, His titles a pretence? We have the Father's witness to His Sonship; by works, equal to the Father's, the Son bears witness to His own equality with the Father. Why such blindness to His obvious possession of the true Sonship which He both claims and displays. It is not through condescending kindness on the part of God the Father that Christ bears the name of Son; not by holiness that He has earned the title, as many have won it by enduring hardness in confession of the faith. Such sonship is not of right; it is by a favour, worthy of Himself, that God bestows the title. But that which is indicated by This, and My, and Hear Him, is different in kind from the other.

Who, then, dishonours the generation of the Son by human notions? He who sets far from the Divine generation what belongs to passion and to man, and joins the Son impassibly to Him that begat Him? or he who places Him Who brought all things into being on a common level with the lower creation? Such an idea, however, as it seems,-that of associating the Son in the majesty of the Father,-this new wisdom seems to regard as dishonouring; while it considers as great and sublime the act of bringing Him down to equality with the creation that is in bondage with us. Empty complaints! Basil is slandered as dishonouring the Son, who honours Him even as he honours the Father[fn-15-P1564_900534:80-nf] , and Eunomius is the champion of the Only-begotten, who severs Him from the good nature of the Father!

Is Eunomius not ashamed of the form of such honour, if one were to say that he himself is not akin in nature to his father, but has community with something of another kind? If he who brings the Lord of the creation into community with the creation declares that he honours Him by so doing, let him also himself be honoured by having community assigned him with what is brute and senseless: but, if he finds community with an inferior nature hard and insolent treatment, how is it honour for Him Who, as the prophet saith, \"ruleth with His power for ever[fn-15-P1567_902061:83-nf] ,\" to be ranked with that nature which is in subjection and bondage?

This passage is unlike most others in not giving us the words spoken by the Jews, but the Apostle's explanation of their motive in wishing to kill the Lord. We see that no plea of misapprehension can excuse the wickedness of these blasphemers; for we have the Apostle's evidence that the true nature of Christ was fully revealed to them. They could speak of His birth:-He said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God. Was not His clearly a birth of nature from nature, when He published the equality of His nature by speaking of God, by name, as His own Father? Now it is manifest that equality consists in the absence of difference between those who are equal. Is it not also manifest that the result of birth must be a nature in which there is an absence of difference between Son and Father? And this is the only possible origin of true equality; birth can only bring into existence a nature equal to its origin. But again, we can no more hold that there is equality where there is confusion, than we can where there is difference.

And now, although we have found the sense of Scripture, as we understand it, in harmony with the conclusions of ordinary reason, the two agreeing that equality is incompatible either with diversity or with isolation, yet we must seek a fresh support for Our contention from actual words of our Lord. For only so can we check that licence of arbitrary interpretation whereby these bold traducers of the faith would even venture to cavil at the Lord's solemn self-revelation. His answer to the Jews was this:-The Son can do nothing of Himself but what He seeth the Father do; for what things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth Him all things that Himself doeth; and He will shew Him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath given all judgment to the Son, that all may honour the Son even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent Him[fn-15-P1552_991872:21-nf] . The course of our argument, as I had shaped it in my mind, required that each several point of the debate should be handled singly; that, since we had been taught that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God in name, in birth, in nature, in power, in self-revelation, our demonstration of the faith should establish each successive point in that order. But His birth is a barrier to such a treatment of the question; for a consideration of it includes a consideration of His name and nature and power and self-revelation. For His birth involves all these, and they are His by the fact that He is born.

The Father then, and the Son know mutually; but the one by begetting, the other by being born. And each of them sees simultaneously all things that are in their knowledge, in their wisdom, in their essence: not by parts or singly, as though by alternately looking from this side to that, and from that side to this, and again from this or that object to this or that object, so as not to be able to see some things without at the same time not seeing others; but, as I said, sees all things simultaneously, whereof there is not one that He does not always see.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"110","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"47. Are we therefore able to ask whether the Holy Spirit had already proceeded from the Father when the Son was born, or had not yet proceeded; and when He was born, proceeded from both, wherein there is no such thing as distinct times: just as we have been able to ask, in a case where we do find times, that the will proceeds from the human mind first, in order that that may be sought which, when found, may be called offspring; which offspring being already brought forth or born, that will is made perfect, resting in this end, so that what had been its desire when seeking, is its love when enjoying; which love now proceeds from both, i.e. from the mind that begets, and from the notion that is begotten, as if from parent and offspring? These things it is absolutely impossible to ask in this case, where nothing is begun in time, so as to be perfected in a time following. Wherefore let him who can understand the generation of the Son from the Father without time, understand also the procession of the Holy Spirit from both without time. And let him who can understand, in that which the Son says, \"As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself,\"[fn-21-P2135_1078279:131-nf] not that the Father gave life to the Son already existing without life, but that He so begat Him apart from time, that the life which the Father gave to the Son by begetting Him is co-eternal with the life of the Father who gave it:[fn-21-P2136_1078532:132-nf] let him, I say, understand, that as the Father has in Himself that the Holy Spirit should proceed from Him, so has He given to the Son that the same Holy Spirit should proceed fromHim, and be both apart from time: and that the Holy Spirit is so said to proceed from the Father as that it be understood that His proceeding also from the Son, is a property derived by the Son from the Father. For if the Son has of the Father whatever He has, then certainly He has of the Father, that the Holy Spirit proceeds also from Him. But let no one think of any times therein which imply a sooner and a later; because these things are not there at all. How, then, would it not bemost absurd to call Him the Son of both: when, just as generation from the Father, without any changeableness of nature, gives to the Son essence, without beginning of time; so procession from both, without any changeableness of nature, gives to the Holy Spirit essence without beginning of time? For while we do not say that the Holy Spirit is begotten, yet we do not therefore dare to say that He is unbegotten, lest any one suspect in this word either two Fathers in that Trinity, or two who are not from another. For the Father alone is not from another, and therefore He alone is called unbegotten, not indeed in the Scriptures,[fn-21-P2137_1080150:133-nf] but in the usage of disputants, who employ such language as they can on so great a subject. And the Son is born of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father principally, the Father giving the procession without any interval of time, yet in common from both [Father and Son].[fn-21-P2138_1080698:134-nf] But He would be called the Son of the Father and of the Son, if-a thing abhorrent to the feeling of all sound minds-both had begotten Him.

Therefore it was to Israel that he spake when He said, \"I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-32-P3247_1155765:95-nf] Not yet had He \"cast to the dogs the children's bread; \"[fn-32-P3248_1155841:96-nf] not yet did He charge them to \"go into the way of the Gentiles.\"[fn-32-P3249_1155920:97-nf] It is only at the last that He instructs them to \"go and teach all nations, and baptize them,\"[fn-32-P3250_1156032:98-nf] when they were so soon to receive \"the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, who should guide them into all the truth.\"[fn-32-P3251_1156164:99-nf] And this, too, makes towards the the same conclusion.

For the mutual concurrence of heterogeneous elements in the formation of our body is a kind of a combination harmoniously conjoined out of several dissimilar elements; but when, at the due time, the tie is loosed which bound together this concurrence of the elements, the combined nature is once more dissolved into the elements of which it was composed. This then is rather a work than a passion of the nature[fn-17-P1709_981623:39-nf] . For we give the name of \"passion\" only to that which is opposed to the virtuous unimpassioned state and of this we believe that He Who granted us salvation was at all times devoid, Who \"was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin[fn-17-P1710_982335:40-nf] .\" Of that, at least, which is truly passion, which is a diseased condition of the will, He was not a partaker; for it says \"He did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth[fn-17-P1711_982530:41-nf] \"; but the peculiar attributes of our nature, which, by a kind of customary abuse of terms, are called by the same name of \"passion,\" -of these, we confess, the Lord did partake,-of birth, nourishment, growth, of sleep and toil,and all those natural dispositions which the, soul is wont to experience with regard to bodily inconveniences,-the desire of that which is lacking, when the longing passes from the body to the soul, the sense of pain, the dread of death, and all the like, save only such as, if followed, lead to sin. As, then, when we perceive His power extending through all things in heaven, and air, and earth, and sea, whatever there is in heaven, whatever there is beneath the earth, we believe that He is universally present, and yet do not say that He is any of those things in which He is (for He is not the Heaven, Who has marked it out with His enfolding span, nor is He the earth, Who upholds the circle of the earth, nor yet is He the water, Who encompasses the liquid nature), so neither do we say that in passing through those sufferings of the flesh of which we speak He was \"subject to passion,\" but, as we say that He is the cause of all things that are, that He holds the universe in His grasp, that He directs all that is in motion and keeps upon a settled foundation all that is stationary, by the unspeakable power of His own majesty, so we say that He was born among us for the cure of the disease of sin, adapting the exercise of His healing power in a manner corresponding to the suffering, applying the healing in that way which He knew to be for the good of that part of the creation which He knew to be in infirmity. And as it was expedient that He should heal the sufferings by touch, we say that He so healed it; yet is He not, because He is the Healer of our infirmity, to be deemed on this account to have been Himself passible. For even in the case of men, ordinary use does not allow us to affirm such a thing. We do not say that one who touches a sick man to heal him is himself partaker of the infirmity, but we say that he does give the sick man the boon of a return to health, and does not partake of the infirmity: for the suffering does not touch him, it is he who touches the disease. Now if he who by his art works any good in men's bodies is not called dull or feeble, but is called a lover of men and a benefactor and the like, why do they slander the dispensation to usward as being mean and inglorious, and use it to maintain that the essence of the Son is \"divergent by way of inferiority,\" on the ground that the Nature of the Father is superior to sufferings, while that of the Son is not pure from passion? Why, if the aim of the dispensation of the Incarnation was not that the Son should be subject to suffering, but that He should be manifested as a lover of men, while the Father also is undoubtedly a lover of men, it follows that if one will but regard the aim, the Son is in the same case with the Father. But if it was not the Father Who wrought the destruction of death, marvel not,-for all judgment also He hath committed unto the Son, Himself judging no man[fn-17-P1712_985680:42-nf] ; not doing all things by the Son for the reason that He is unable either to save the lost or judge the sinner, but because He does these things too by His own Power, by which He works all things. Then they who were saved by the Son were saved by the Power of the Father, and they who are judged by Him undergo judgment by the Righteousness of God. For \"Christ,\" as the Apostle says, \"is the Righteousness of God[fn-17-P1713_986118:43-nf] ,\" which is revealed by the Gospel; and whether you look at the world as a whole, or at the parts of the world which make up that complete whole, all these are works of the Father, in that they are works of His Power; and thus the word which says both that the Father made all things, and that none of these things that are came into being without the Son, speaks truly on both points; for the operation of the Power bears relation to Him Whose Power It is. Thus, since the Son is the Power of the Father, all the works of the Son are works of the Father. That He entered upon the dispensation of the Passion not by weakness of nature but by the power of His will, one might bring countless passages of the Gospel to show; but these, as the matter is clear, I will pretermit, that my discourse may not be prolonged by dwelling on points that are admitted. If, then, that which comes to pass is evil, we have to separate from that evil not the Father only, but the Son also; but if the saving of them that were lost is good, and if that which took place is not \"passion[fn-17-P1714_987204:44-nf] ,\" but love of men, why do you alienate from our thanksgiving for our salvation the Father, Who by His own Power, which is Christ, wrought for men their freedom from death?","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_16_book_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"2.

Thus to deny the Son of God, they quote the authority of His own words, Why callest than Me good? None is good, save one, God[fn-17-P1743_1142920:8-nf] .

The Father's omniscience and the Son's ignorance reveal unlikeness in the Divinity, for God must be ignorant of nothing, and the ignorant cannot be compared with the omniscient. All these passages they neither understand rationally, nor distinguish as to their occasions, nor apprehend in the light of the Gospel mysteries, nor realize in the strict meaning of the words and so they impugn the divine nature of Christ with crude and insensate rashness, quoting single detached utterances to catch the ears of the unwary, and keeping back either the sequel which explains or the incidents which prompted them, though the meaning of words must be sought in the context before or after them.","title":"Book IX.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":5,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_16_book_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"20.

But nowhere does He more plainly teach the mystery of His unity and His birth than when He says, But the witness which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father hath given Me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father hath sent Me, and the Father which sent Me, He hath borne witness of Me. Ye have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form. And ye have not His word abiding in you, for Whom He sent, Him ye believe not[fn-17-P1791_1172705:38-nf] How can the Father be truly said to have borne witness of the Son, when neither He Himself was seen, nor His voice heard? Yet I remember that a voice was heard from Heaven, which said, This is My beloved Son, in Whom I have been well pleased; hear ye Him[fn-17-P1792_1172984:39-nf] . How can it be said that they did not hear the voice of God, when the voice which they heard itself asserted that it was the Father's voice? But perhaps the dwellers in Jerusalem had not heard what John had heard in the solitude of the desert. We must ask, then, \"How did the Father bear witness in Jerusalem?\" It is no longer the witness given to John, who heard the voice from heaven, but a witness greater than that of John. What that witness is He goes on to say, The works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works which I do, bear witness of Me, that the Father hath sent Me. We must admit the authority of the testimony, for no one, except the Son sent of the Father, could do such works. His works are therefore His testimony. But what follows? And the Father, which sent Me, He hath borne witness of Me. Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form, and ye have not His word abiding in you. Are they blameless, in that they did not know the testimony of the Father, Who was never heard or seen amongst them, and Whose word was not abiding in them? No, for they cannot plead that His testimony was hidden from them; as Christ says, the testimony of His works is the testimony of the Father concerning Him. His works testify of Him that He was sent of the Father; but the testimony of these works is the Father's testimony; since, therefore, the working of the Son is the Father's testimony, it follows of necessity that the same nature was operative in Christ, by which the Father testifies of Him. So Christ, Who works the works, and the Father Who testifies through them, are revealed as possessing one inseparable nature through the birth, for the operation of Christ is signified to be itself the testimony of God concerning Him.","title":"Book IX.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":5,"verse":44,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_16_book_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"22.

But He proves abundantly that His will is free by the words, As the Father raiseth the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son also quickeneth whom He will[fn-18-P1869_1230222:86-nf] . When the equality of Father and Son in power and honour is indicated, then the freedom of the Son's will is made manifest: when Their unity is demonstrated, His conformity to the Father's will is signified, for what the Father wills, the Son does. But to do is something more than to obey a will: the latter would imply external necessity, while to do another's will requires unity with him, being an act of volition. In doing the will of the Father the Son teaches that through the identity of Their nature His will is the same in nature with the Father's, since all that He does is the Father's will. The Son plainly wills all that the Father wills, for wills of the same nature cannot dissent from one another. It is the will of the Father which is revealed in the words, For this is the will of My Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son and believeth in Him, should have eternal life, and that I should raise Him up at the last day[fn-18-P1870_1231188:87-nf] .

Here is no doubt that the Son wills: for while the Father wills that those who believe in the Son should have eternal life, the Son wills that the believer should be where He is. For is it not eternal life to dwell together with Christ? And does He not grant to the believer in Him all perfection of blessing when He says, No one hath known the Son save the Father, neither hath any known the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal Him[fn-18-P1872_1231865:89-nf] ? Has He not freedom of will, when He wills to impart to us the knowledge of the Father's mystery? Is not His will so free that He can bestow on whom He will the knowledge of Himself and His Father?

Far be it from us to imagine vicissitudes of bodily change in the Father and Son, as though the Father sometimes spoke to the Son, and sometimes was silent. We remember, indeed, that a voice was sometimes uttered from heaven for us, that the power of the Father's words might confirm for us the mystery of the Son, as the Lord says, This voice hath not come from Heaven for My sake but for your sakes[fn-19-P1934_1269176:128-nf] . But the divine nature can dispense with the various combinations necessary for human functions, the motion of the tongue, the adjustment of the mouth, the forcing of the breath, and the vibration of the air. God is a simple Being: we must understand Him by devotion, and confess Him by reverence. He is to be worshipped, not pursued by our senses, for a conditioned and weak nature cannot grasp with the guesses of its imagination the mystery of an infinite and omnipotent nature. In God is no variability, no parts, as of a composite divinity, that in Him will should follow inaction, speech silence, or work rest, or that He should not will, without passing from some other mental state to volition, or speak, without breaking the silence with His voice, or act, without going forth to labour. He is not subject to the laws of nature, for nature has received its law from Him: He never suffers weakness or change when He acts, for His power is boundless, as the Lord said, Father, all things are possible unto Thee[fn-19-P1935_1270220:129-nf] . He can do more than human sense can conceive. The Lord does not deprive even Himself of the quality of omnipotence, for He says, What things soever the Father doeht, these the Son also doeth in like manner[fn-19-P1936_1270453:130-nf] .

For we do not know how many days this judgment may occupy; but no one who reads the Scriptures, however negligently, need be told that in them \"day\" is customarily used for \"time.\" And when we speak of the day of God's judgment, we add the word last or final for this reason, because even now God judges, and has judged from the beginning of human history, banishing from paradise, and excluding from the tree of life, those first men who perpetrated so great a sin. Yea, He was certainly exercising judgment also when He did not spare the angels who sinned, whose prince, overcome by envy, seduced men after being himself seduced. Neither is it without God's profound and just judgment that the life of demons and men, the one in the air, the other on earth, is filled with misery, calamities, and mistakes. And even though no one had sinned, it could only have been by the good and right judgment of God that the whole rational creation could have been maintained in eternal blessedness by a persevering adherence to its Lord. He judges, too, not only in the mass, condemning the race of devils and the race of men to be miserable on account of the original sin of these races, but He also judges the voluntary and personal acts of individuals. For even the devils pray that they may not be tormented,[fn-37-P3774_2079151:1-nf] which proves that without injustice they might either be spared or tormented according to their deserts. And men are punished by God for their sins often visibly, always secretly, either in this life or after death, although no man acts rightly save by the assistance of divine aid; and no man or devil acts unrighteously save by the permission of the divine and most just judgment. For, as the apostle says, \"There is no unrighteousness with God;\"[fn-37-P3775_2079615:2-nf] and as he elsewhere says, \"His judgments are inscrutable, and His ways past finding out\"[fn-37-P3776_2079720:3-nf] In this book, then, I shall speak, as God permits, not of those first judgments, nor of these intervening judgments of God, but of the last judgment, when Christ is to come from heaven to judge the quick and the dead. For that day is properly called the day of judgment, because in it there shall be no room left for the ignorant questioning why this wicked person is happy and that righteous man unhappy.

And when they ask when they had seen Him in need of these things, He replies that, inasmuch as they had not done it to the least of His brethren, they had not done it unto Him, and concludes His address in the words, \"And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.\" Moreover, the evangelist John most distinctly states that He had predicted that the judgment should be at the resurrection of the dead. For after saying, \"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father: he that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father which hath sent Him;\" He immediately adds, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment; but is passed from death to life.\"[fn-38-P3810_2095332:21-nf] Here He said that believers on Him should not come into judgment.

It is for the sake of making this distinction that He says, \"The hour is coming, and now is.\" Now this resurrection regards not the body, but the soul. For souls, too, have a death of their own in wickedness and sins, whereby they are the dead of whom the same lips say, \"Suffer the dead to bury their dead,\"[fn-38-P3815_2096496:23-nf] -that is, let those who are dead in soul bury them that are dead in body. It is of these dead, then-the dead in ungodliness and wickedness-that He says, \"The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.\" \"They that hear,\" that is, they who obey, believe, and persevere to the end. Here no difference is made between the good and the bad. For it is good for all men to hear His voice and live, by passing to the life of godliness from the death of ungodliness.

He, therefore, who would not be damned in the second resurrection, let him rise in the first. For \"the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live,\" i.e., shall not come into damnation, which is called the second death; into which death, after the second or bodily resurrection, they shall be hurled who do not rise in the first or spiritual resurrection. For \"the hour is coming\" (but here He does not say, \"and now is,\" because it shall come in the end of the world in the last and greatest judgment of God) \"when all that are in the graves shall hear His voice and shall come forth.\" He does not say, as in the first resurrection, \"And they that Hear shall live.\" For all shall not live, at least with such life as ought alone to be called life because it alone is blessed. For some kind of life they must have in order to hear, and come forth from the graves in their rising bodies.

They have done evil because their life has been evil; and their life has been evil because it has not been renewed in the first or spiritual resurrection which now is, or because they have not persevered to the end in their renewed life.

And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and many of the just as the stars for ever.\"[fn-39-P3985_2189793:124-nf] This passage is very similar to the one we have quoted from the Gospel,[fn-39-P3986_2189886:125-nf] at least so far as regards the resurrection of dead bodies. For those who are there said to be \"in the graves\" are here spoken of as \"sleeping in the mound of earth,\" or, as others translate, \"in the dust of earth,\" There it is said, \"They shall come forth;\" so here, \"They shall arise.\" There, \"They that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment;\" here, \"Some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting confusion.\" Neither is it to be supposed a difference, though in place of the expression in the Gospel, \"All who are in their graves,\" the prophet does not say \"all,\" but \"many of them that sleep in the mound of earth.\" For many is sometimes used in Scripture for all. Thus it was said to Abraham, \"I have set thee as the father of many nations,\"though in another place it was said to him, \"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed.\"[fn-39-P3987_2190821:126-nf] Of such a resurrection it is said a little afterwards to the prophet himself, \"And come thou and rest: for there is yet a day till the completion of the consummation; and thou shall rest, and rise in thy lot in the end of the days.\"[fn-39-P3988_2191089:127-nf] ","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":46,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"117","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"In the succeeding words, \"Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel,\"[fn-40-P4037_2210871:156-nf] the prophet opportunely mentions precepts and statutes, after declaring the important distinction hereafter to be made between those who observe and those who despise the law. He intends also that they learn to interpret the law spiritually, and find Christ in it, by whose judgment that separation between the good and the bad is to be made. For it is not without reason that the Lord Himself says to the Jews, \"Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.\"[fn-40-P4038_2211374:157-nf] For by receiving the law carnally without perceiving that its earthly promises were figures of things spiritual, they fell into such murmurings as audaciously to say, \"It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept His ordinance, and that we have walked suppliantly before the face of the Lord Almighty? And now we call aliens happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up.\"[fn-40-P4039_2211790:158-nf] It was these words of theirs which in a manner compelled the prophet to announce the last judgment, in which the wicked shall not even in appearance be happy, but shall manifestly be most miserable; and in which the good shall be oppressed with not even a transitory wretchedness, but shall enjoy unsullied and eternal felicity. For he had previously cited some similar expressions of those who said, \"Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and such are pleasing to Him.\"[fn-40-P4040_2212308:159-nf] It was, I say, by understanding the law of Moses carnally that they had come to murmur thus against God. And hence, too, the writer of the 73d Psalm says that his feet were almost gone, his steps had well-nigh slipped, because he was envious of sinners while he considered their prosperity, so that he said among other things, How doth God know, and is there knowledge in the Most High? and again, Have I sanctified my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency?[fn-40-P4041_2212796:160-nf] He goes on to say that his efforts to solve this most difficult problem, which arises when the good seem to be wretched and the wicked happy, were in vain until he went into the sanctuary of God, and understood the last things.[fn-40-P4042_2213048:161-nf] For in the last judgment things shall not be so; but in the manifest felicity of the righteous and manifest misery of the wicked quite another state of things shall appear.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"When, therefore, we read in the prophetical books that God is to come to do judgment at the last, from the mere mention of the judgment, and although there is nothing else to determine the meaning, we must gather that Christ is meant; for though the Father will judge, He will judge by the coming of the Son. For He Himself, by His own manifested presence, \"judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son;\"[fn-40-P4066_2224896:176-nf] for as the Son was judged as a man, He shall also judge in human form. For it is none but He of whom God speaks by Isaiah under the name of Jacob and Israel, of whose seed Christ took a body, as it is written, \"Jacob is my servant, I will uphold Him; Israel is mine elect, my Spirit has assumed Him: I have put my Spirit upon Him; He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor cease, neither shall His voice be heard without. A bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall He not quench: but in truth shall He bring forth judgment. He shall shine and shall not be broken, until He sets judgment in the earth: and the nations shall hope in His name.\"[fn-40-P4067_2225603:177-nf] The Hebrew has not \"Jacob\" and \"Israel;\" but the Septuagint translators, wishing to show the significance of the expression \"my servant,\" and that it refers to the form of a servant in which the Most High humbled Himself, inserted the name of that man from whose stock He took the form of a servant. The Holy Spirit was given to Him, and was manifested, as the evangelist testifies, in the form of a dove.[fn-40-P4068_2226033:178-nf] He brought forth judgment to the Gentiles, because He predicted what was hidden from them. In His meekness He did not cry, nor did He cease to proclaim the truth. But His voice was not heard, nor is it heard, without, because He is not obeyed by those who are outside of His body. And the Jews themselves, who persecuted Him, He did not break, though as a bruised reed they had lost their integrity, and as smoking flax their light was quenched; for He spared them, having come to be judged and not yet to judge. He brought forth judgment in truth, declaring that they should be punished did they persist in their wickedness. His face shone on the Mount,[fn-40-P4069_2226707:179-nf] His fame in the world. He is not broken nor over come, because neither in Himself nor in His Church has persecution prevailed to annihilate Him. And therefore that has not, and shall not, be brought about which His enemies said or say, \"When shall He die, and His name perish?\"[fn-40-P4070_2227011:180-nf] \"until He set judgment in the earth.\" Behold, the hidden thing which we were seeking is discovered. For this is the last judgment, which He will set in the earth when He comes from heaven. And it is in Him, too, we already see the concluding expression of the prophecy fulfilled: \"In His name shall the nations hope.\" And by this fulfillment, which no one can deny, men are encouraged to believe in that which is most impudently denied. For who could have hoped for that which even those who do not yet believe in Christ now see fulfilled among us, and which is so undeniable that they can but gnash their teeth and pine away? Who, I say, could have hoped that the nations would hope in the name of Christ, when He was arrested, bound, scourged, mocked, crucified, when even the disciples themselves had lost the hope which they had begun to have in Him? The hope which was then entertained scarcely by the one thief on the cross, is now cherished by nations everywhere on the earth, who are marked with the sign of the cross on which He died that they may not die eternally.","title":"Book XX","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_20_lecture_xv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"24.

Whatever attributes therefore you require as worthy of God, must be found in the Father, who is invisible and unapproachable, and placid, and (so to speak) the God of the philosophers; whereas those qualities which you censure as unworthy must be supposed to be in the Son, who has been seen, and heard, and encountered, the Witness and Servant of the Father, uniting in Himself man and God, God in mighty deeds, in weak ones man, in order that He may give to man as much as He takes from God. What in your esteem is the entire disgrace of my God, Is in fact the sacrament of man's salvation God held converse with man, that man might learn to act as God. God dealt on equal terms[fn-47-P4728_1506823:375-nf] with man, that man might be able to deal on equal terms with God. God was found little, that man might become very great. You who disdain such a God, I hardly know whether you ex fide believe that God was crucified. How great, then, is your perversity in respect of the two characters of the Creator! You designate Him as Judge, and reprobate as Cruelty that severity of the Judge which only acts in accord with the merits of cases. You require God to be very good, and yet despise as meanness that gentleness of His which accorded with His kindness, (and) held lowly converse in proportion to the mediocrity of man's estate. He pleases you not, whether great or little, neither as your judge nor as your friend! What if the same features should be discovered in your God? That He too is a judge, we have already shown in the proper section:[fn-47-P4729_1507689:376-nf] that from being a judge He must needs be severe; and from being severe He must also be cruel, if indeed cruel.[fn-47-P4730_1507853:377-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_21_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"However, they who are enlightened in Eunomius' fashion pass the Son by, and are carried in their reasonings beyond Him, seeking eternal life in Him Who is contemplated as outside and apart from the Only-begotten. What ought one to say to such evils as these,-save whatever calls forth lamentation and weeping? Alas, how can we groan over this wretched and pitiable generation, bringing forth a crop of such deadly mischiefs? In days of yore the zealous Jeremiah bewailed the people of Israel, when they, gave an evil consent to Jehoiakim who led the way to idolatry, and were condemned to captivity under the Assyrians in requital for their unlawful worship, exiled from the sanctuary and banished far from the inheritance of their fathers. Yet more fitting does it seem to me that these lamentations be chanted when the imitator of Jehoiakim draws away those whom he deceives to this new kind of idolatry, banishing them from their ancestral inheritance,-I mean the Faith. They too, in a way corresponding to the Scriptural record, are carried away captive to Babylon from Jerusalem that is above,-that is from the Church of God to this confusion of pernicious doctrines,-for[fn-19-P1965_1177231:20-nf] Babylon means \"confusion.\" And even as Jehoiakim was mutilated, so this man, having voluntarily deprived himself of the light of the truth, has become a prey to the Babylonian despot, never having learned, poor wretch, that the Gospel enjoins us to behold eternal life alike in the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as the Word has thus spoken concerning the Father, that to know Him is life eternal[fn-19-P1966_1177683:21-nf] , and concerning the Son, that every one that believeth on Him hath eternal life[fn-19-P1967_1177790:22-nf] , and concerning the Holy Spirit, that to Him that hath received His grace it shall be a well of water springing up unto eternal life[fn-19-P1968_1177950:23-nf] . Accordingly every one that yearns for eternal life when he has found the Son,-I mean the true Son, and not the Son falsely so called-has found in Him in its entirety what he longed for, because He is life and hath life in Himself[fn-19-P1969_1178207:24-nf] . But this man, so subtle in mind, so keen-sighted of heart, does not by his extreme acuteness of vision discover life in the Son, but, having passed Him over and left Him behind as a hindrance in the way to that for which he searches he there seeks eternal life where he thinks the true Life not to be! What could we conceive more to be abhorred than this for profanity, or more melancholy as an occasion of lamentation? But that the charge of Sabellianism and Montanism should be repeatedly urged against our doctrines, is much the same as if one should lay to our charge the blasphemy of the Anomoeans. For if one were carefully to investigate the falsehood of these heresies, he would find that they have great similarity to the error of Eunomius. For each of them affects the Jew in his doctrine, admitting neither the Only-begotten God nor the Holy Spirit to share the Deity of the God Whom they call \"Great,\" and \"First.\" For Whom Sabellius calls God of the three names, Him does Eunomius term unbegotten: but neither contemplates the Godhead in the Trinity of Persons. Who then is really akin to Sabellius let the judgment of those who read our argument decide.

It is true that in common with you he holds a dualism of gods, and thinks that one is different in nature from the other, but it is the more courteous view to attribute goodness to the God of the Gospel. You however actually separate the Only begotten God from the nature of good, that you may surpass even Marcion in the depravity of your doctrines. However, they claim the Scripture on their side, and say that they are hardly treated when they are accused for using the very words of Scripture. For they say that the Lord Himself has said, \"There is none good but one, that is, God[fn-20-P2020_1217688:5-nf] .\" Accordingly, that misrepresentation may not prevail against the Divine words, we will briefly examine the actual passage in the Gospel. The history regards the rich man to whom the Lord spoke this word as young-the kind of person, I suppose, inclined to enjoy the pleasures of this life-and attached to his possessions; for it says that he was grieved at the advice to part with what he had, and that he did not choose to exchange his property for life eternal. This man, when he heard that a teacher of eternal life was in the neighbourhood, came to him in the expectation of living in perpetual luxury, with life indefinitely extended, flattering the Lord with the title of \"good,\"-flattering, I should rather say, not the Lord as we conceive Him, but as He then appeared in the form of a servant. For his character was not such as to enable him to penetrate the outward veil of flesh, and see through it into the inner shrine of Deity. The Lord, then, Who seeth the hearts, discerned the motive with which the young man approached Him as a suppliant,-that he did so, not with a soul intently fixed upon the Divine, but that it was the man whom he besought, calling Him \"Good Master,\" because he hoped to learn from Him some lore by which the approach of death might be hindered. Accordingly, with good reason did He Who was thus besought by him answer even as He was addressed[fn-20-P2021_1219096:6-nf] . For as the entreaty was not addressed to God the Word, so correspondingly the answer was delivered to the applicant by the Humanity of Christ, thereby impressing on the youth a double lesson. For He teaches him, by one and the same answer, both the duty of reverencing and paying homage to the Divinity, not by flattering speeches but by his life, by keeping the commandments and buying life eternal at the cost of all possessions, and also the truth that humanity, having been sunk in depravity by reason of sin, is debarred from the title of \"Good\": and for this reason He says, \"Why callest Thou Me good?\" suggesting in His answer by the word \"Me\" that human nature which encompassed Him, while by attributing goodness to the Godhead He expressly declared Himself to be good, seeing that He is proclaimed to be God by the Gospel. For had the Only-begotten Son been excluded from the title of God, it would perhaps not have been absurd to think Him alien also from the appellation of \"good.\" But if, as is the case, prophets, evangelists, and Apostles proclaim aloud the Godhead of the Only-begotten, and if the name of goodness is attested by the Lord Himself to belong to God, how is it possible that He Who is partaker of the Godhead should not be partaker of the goodness too? For that both prophets, evangelists, disciples and apostles acknowledge the Lord as God, there is none so uninitiated in Divine mysteries as to need to be expressly told. For who knows not that in the forty-fourth[fn-20-P2022_1220629:7-nf] Psalm the prophet in his word affirms the Christ to be God, anointed by God? And again, who of all that are conversant with prophecy is unaware that Isaiah, among other passages, thus openly proclaims the Godhead of the Son, where he says: \"The Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and shall be servants unto thee: they shall come after thee bound in fetters, and in thee shall they make supplication, because God is in thee, and there is no God beside thee; for thou art God[fn-20-P2023_1221227:8-nf] .\" For what other God there is Who has God in Himself, and is Himself God, except the Only-begotten, let them say who hearken not to the prophecy; but of the interpretation of Emmanuel, and the confession of Thomas after his recognition of the Lord, and the sublime diction of John, as being manifest even to those who are outside the faith, I will say nothing. Nay, I do not even think it necessary to bring forward in detail the utterances of Paul, since they are, as one may say, in all men's mouths, who gives the Lord the appellation not only of \"God,\" but of \"great God\" and \"God over all,\" saying to the Romans, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, Who is over all, God blessed for ever[fn-20-P2024_1221999:9-nf] ,\" and writing to his disciple Titus, \"According to the appearing of Jesus Christ the great God and our Saviour[fn-20-P2025_1222127:10-nf] ,\" and to Timothy, proclaims in plain terms, \"God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit[fn-20-P2026_1222403:11-nf] .\" Since then the fact has been demonstrated on every side that the Only-begotten God is God[fn-20-P2027_1222591:12-nf] , how is it that he who says that goodness belongs to God, strives to show that the Godhead of the Son is alien from this ascription, and this though the Lord has actually claimed for Himself the epithet \"good\" in the parable of those who were hired into the vineyard? For there, when those who had laboured before the others were dissatisfied at all receiving the same pay, and deemed the good fortune of the last to be their own loss, the just judge says to one of the murmurers[fn-20-P2028_1223220:13-nf] , \"Friend, I do thee no wrong: did I not agree with thee for a penny a day? Lo, there thou hast that is thine[fn-20-P2029_1223516:14-nf] : I will bestow upon this last even as upon thee. Have I not power to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am good?\" Of course no one will contest the point that to distribute recompense according to desert is the special function of the judge; and all the disciples of the Gospel agree that the Only-begotten God is Judge; \"for the Father,\" He saith, \"judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son[fn-20-P2030_1224039:15-nf] .\" But they do not set themselves in opposition[fn-20-P2031_1224107:16-nf] to the Scriptures. For they say that the word \"one\" absolutely points to the Father. For He saith, \"There is none good but one, that is God.\" Will truth then lack vigour to plead her own cause? Surely there are many means easily to convict of deception this quibble also. For He Who said this concerning the Father spake also to the Father that other word, \"All Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine, and I am glorified in them[fn-20-P2032_1224742:17-nf] .\" Now if He says that all that is the Father's is also the Son's, and goodness is one of the attributes pertaining to the Father, either the Son has not all things if He has not this, and they will be saying that the Truth lies, or if it is impious to suspect the very Truth of being carried away into falsehood, then He Who claimed all that is the Father's as His own, thereby asserted that He was not outside of goodness. For He Who has the Father in Himself, and contains all things that belong to the Father, manifestly has His goodness with \"all things.\" Therefore the Son is Good. But \"there is none good,\" he says, \"but one, that is God.\" This is what is alleged by our adversaries: nor do I myself reject the statement. I do not, however, for this cause deny the Godhead of the Son. But he who confesses that the Lord is God, by that very confession assuredly also asserts of Him goodness. For if goodness is a property of God, and if the Lord is God, then by our premises the Son is shown to be God. \"But,\" says our opponent, \"the word `one' excludes the Son from participation in goodness.\" It is easy, however, to show that not even the word \"one\" separates the Father from the Son. For in all other cases, it is true, the term \"one\" carries with it the signification of not being coupled with anything else, but in the case of the Father and the Son \"one\" does not imply isolation. For He says, \"I and the Father are one[fn-20-P2033_1226200:18-nf] .\" If, then, the good is one, and a particular kind of unity is contemplated in the Father and the Son, it follows that the Lord, in predicating goodness of \"one,\" claimed under the term \"one\" the title of \"good\" also for Himself, Who is one with the Father, and not severed from oneness of nature.","title":"Book XI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_30_5_five_books_in_reply_to_marcion_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"476","folder":"ANF-04","text":"145 August in life, and marked with praise sublime,[fn-38-P3894_714615:74-nf] ","title":"5.

But the other, conformation, is conferred in that work of His wherein \"He worketh hitherto.\"[fn-44-P4499_2482587:57-nf] For were He to withdraw His efficacious power from things, they should neither be able to go on and complete the periods assigned to their measured movements, nor should they even continue in possession of that nature they were created in. God, then, so created man that He gave him what we may call fertility, whereby he might propagate other men, giving them a congenital capacity to propagate their kind, but not imposing on them any necessity to do so. This capacity God withdraws at pleasure from individuals, making them barren; but from the whole race He has not withdrawn the blessing of propagation once conferred. But though not withdrawn on account of sin, this power of propagation is not what it would have been had there been no sin. For since \"man placed in honor fell, he has become like the beasts,\"[fn-45-P4500_2483421:58-nf] and generates as they do, though the little spark of reason, which was the image of God in him, has not been quite quenched. But if conformation were not added to propagation, there would be no reproduction of one's kind. For even though there were no such thing as copulation, and God wished to fill the earth with human inhabitants, He might create all these as He created one without the help of human generation. And, indeed, even as it is, those who copulate can generate nothing save by the creative energy of God. As, therefore, in respect of that spiritual growth whereby a man is formed to piety and righteousness, the apostle says, \"Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase,\"[fn-45-P4501_2484182:59-nf] so also it must be said that it is not he that generates that is anything, but God that giveth the essential form; that it is not the mother who carries and nurses the fruit of her womb that is anything, but God that giveth the increase. For He alone, by that energy wherewith \"He worketh hitherto,\" causes the seed to develop, and to evolve from certain secret and invisible folds into the visible forms of beauty which we see. He alone, coupling and connecting in some wonderful fashion the spiritual and corporeal natures, the one to command, the other to obey, makes a living being.

But as things stand, the fact that they themselves make no attempt to suppress the absurdity that naturally follows from their assumption, helps to support our contention that it was not without due reflection that, with the help of truth, we censured life argument of heresy. For behold, how undisguised and outspoken is their striving against the Only-begotten God! Nay, by His enemies His work of mercy is reckoned a means of disparaging and maligning the Nature of the Son of God, as though not of deliberate purpose, but by a compulsion of His Nature he had slipped down to life in the flesh, and to the suffering of the Cross! And as it is the nature of a stone to fall downward, and of fire to rise upward, and as these material objects do not exchange their natures one with another, so that the stone should have an upward tendency, and fire be depressed by its weight and sink downwards, even so they make out that passion was part of the very Nature of the Son, and that for this cause He came to that which was akin and familiar to Him, but that the Nature of the Father, being free from such passions, remained unapproachable by the contact of evil. For he says, that the God Who is over all, Who is Light unapproachable, neither was incarnate nor could be incarnate. The first of the two statements was quite enough, that the Father did not become incarnate. But now by his addition a double absurdity arises; for he either charges the Son with evil, or the Father with powerlessness. For if to partake of our flesh is evil, then he predicates evil of the Only-begotten God; but if the lovingkindness to man was good, then he makes out the Father to be powerless for good, by saying that it would not have been in His power to have effectually bestowed such grace by taking flesh. And yet who in the world does not know that life-giving power proceeds to actual operation both in the Father and in the Son? \"For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them,\" He says, \"even so the Son quickeneth whom He will[fn-21-P2125_1289217:32-nf] ,\"-meaning obviously by \"dead\" us who had fallen from the true life. If then it is even so as the Father quickeneth, and not otherwise, that the Son brings to operation the same grace, how comes it that the adversary of God moves his profane tongue against both, insulting the Father by attributing to Him powerlessness for good, and the Son by attributing to Him association with evil. But \"Light,\" he says, \"is not equal to Light,\" because the one he calls \"true,\" and the other \"unapproachable.\" Is then the true considered to be a diminution of the unapproachable? Why so? and yet their argument is that the Godhead of the Father must be conceived to be greater and more exalted than that of the Son, because the one is called in the Gospel \"true God[fn-21-P2126_1289992:33-nf] ,\" the other \"God[fn-21-P2127_1290032:34-nf] \" without the addition of \"true.\" How then does the same term, as applied to the Godhead, indicate an enhancement of the conception, and, as applied to Light, a diminution? For if they say that the Father is greater than the Son because He is true God, by the same showing the Son would be acknowledged to be greater than the Father, because the former is called \"true Light[fn-21-P2128_1290426:35-nf] ,\" and the latter not so. \"But this Light,\" says Eunomius, \"carried into effect the plan of mercy, while the other remained inoperative with respect to that gracious action.\" A new and strange mode of determining priority in dignity! They judge that which is ineffective for a benevolent purpose to be superior to that which is operative. But such a notion as this neither exists nor ever will be found amongst Christians,-a notion by which it is made out that every good that is in existent things has not its origin from the Father. But of goods that pertain to us men, the crowning blessing is held by all right-minded men to be the return to life; and it is secured by the dispensation carried out by the Lord in His human nature; not that the Father remained aloof, as heresy will have it, ineffective and inoperative during the time of this dispensation. For it is not this that He indicates Who said, \"He that sent Me is with Me[fn-21-P2129_1291381:36-nf] ,\" and \"The Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works[fn-21-P2130_1291482:37-nf] .\" With what right then does heresy attribute to the Son alone the gracious intervention on our behalf, and thereby exclude the Father from having any part or lot in our gratitude for its successful issue? For naturally the requital of thanks is due to our benefactors alone, and He Who is incapable of benefiting us is outside the pale of our gratitude. See you how the course of their profane attack upon the Only-begotten Son has missed its mark, and is working round in natural consequence so as to be directed against the majesty of the Father? And this seems to me to be a necessary result of their method of proceeding. For if he that honoureth the Son honoureth the Father[fn-21-P2131_1292185:38-nf] , according to the Divine declaration, it is plain on the other side that an assault upon the Son strikes at the Father. But I say that to those who with simplicity of heart receive the preaching of the Cross and the resurrection, the same grace should be a cause of equal thankfulness to the Son and to the Father, and now that the Son has accomplished the Father's will (and this, in the language of the Apostle, is \"that all men should be saved[fn-21-P2132_1292657:39-nf] \"), they ought for this boon to honour the Father and the Son alike, inasmuch as our salvation would not have been wrought, had not the good will of the Father proceeded to actual operation for us through His own power.

And yet who in the world does not know that life-giving power proceeds to actual operation both in the Father and in the Son? \"For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them,\" He says, \"even so the Son quickeneth whom He will[fn-21-P2125_1289217:32-nf] ,\"-meaning obviously by \"dead\" us who had fallen from the true life. If then it is even so as the Father quickeneth, and not otherwise, that the Son brings to operation the same grace, how comes it that the adversary of God moves his profane tongue against both, insulting the Father by attributing to Him powerlessness for good, and the Son by attributing to Him association with evil. But \"Light,\" he says, \"is not equal to Light,\" because the one he calls \"true,\" and the other \"unapproachable.\" Is then the true considered to be a diminution of the unapproachable? Why so? and yet their argument is that the Godhead of the Father must be conceived to be greater and more exalted than that of the Son, because the one is called in the Gospel \"true God[fn-21-P2126_1289992:33-nf] ,\" the other \"God[fn-21-P2127_1290032:34-nf] \" without the addition of \"true.\" How then does the same term, as applied to the Godhead, indicate an enhancement of the conception, and, as applied to Light, a diminution? For if they say that the Father is greater than the Son because He is true God, by the same showing the Son would be acknowledged to be greater than the Father, because the former is called \"true Light[fn-21-P2128_1290426:35-nf] ,\" and the latter not so. \"But this Light,\" says Eunomius, \"carried into effect the plan of mercy, while the other remained inoperative with respect to that gracious action.\" A new and strange mode of determining priority in dignity! They judge that which is ineffective for a benevolent purpose to be superior to that which is operative. But such a notion as this neither exists nor ever will be found amongst Christians,-a notion by which it is made out that every good that is in existent things has not its origin from the Father. But of goods that pertain to us men, the crowning blessing is held by all right-minded men to be the return to life; and it is secured by the dispensation carried out by the Lord in His human nature; not that the Father remained aloof, as heresy will have it, ineffective and inoperative during the time of this dispensation. For it is not this that He indicates Who said, \"He that sent Me is with Me[fn-21-P2129_1291381:36-nf] ,\" and \"The Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works[fn-21-P2130_1291482:37-nf] .\" With what right then does heresy attribute to the Son alone the gracious intervention on our behalf, and thereby exclude the Father from having any part or lot in our gratitude for its successful issue? For naturally the requital of thanks is due to our benefactors alone, and He Who is incapable of benefiting us is outside the pale of our gratitude. See you how the course of their profane attack upon the Only-begotten Son has missed its mark, and is working round in natural consequence so as to be directed against the majesty of the Father?

But I say that to those who with simplicity of heart receive the preaching of the Cross and the resurrection, the same grace should be a cause of equal thankfulness to the Son and to the Father, and now that the Son has accomplished the Father's will (and this, in the language of the Apostle, is \"that all men should be saved[fn-21-P2132_1292657:39-nf] \"), they ought for this boon to honour the Father and the Son alike, inasmuch as our salvation would not have been wrought, had not the good will of the Father proceeded to actual operation for us through His own power.

For he wishes to show that the essence of the Son is subject to passion, and to decay, and in no wise differs from material nature, which is in a state of flux, that by this means he may demonstrate His difference from the Father. For he says, \"If he can show that the God Who is over all, Who is the Light unapproachable, was incarnate or could be incarnate, came under authority, obeyed commands, came under the laws of men, bore the Cross, let him say that the Light is equal to the Light.\" If these words had been brought forward by us as following by necessary consequence from premises laid down by Eunomius, who would not have charged us with unfairness, in employing an over-subtle dialectic to reduce our adversaries' statement to such an absurdity? But as things stand, the fact that they themselves make no attempt to suppress the absurdity that naturally follows from their assumption, helps to support our contention that it was not without due reflection that, with the help of truth, we censured life argument of heresy. For behold, how undisguised and outspoken is their striving against the Only-begotten God! Nay, by His enemies His work of mercy is reckoned a means of disparaging and maligning the Nature of the Son of God, as though not of deliberate purpose, but by a compulsion of His Nature he had slipped down to life in the flesh, and to the suffering of the Cross! And as it is the nature of a stone to fall downward, and of fire to rise upward, and as these material objects do not exchange their natures one with another, so that the stone should have an upward tendency, and fire be depressed by its weight and sink downwards, even so they make out that passion was part of the very Nature of the Son, and that for this cause He came to that which was akin and familiar to Him, but that the Nature of the Father, being free from such passions, remained unapproachable by the contact of evil. For he says, that the God Who is over all, Who is Light unapproachable, neither was incarnate nor could be incarnate. The first of the two statements was quite enough, that the Father did not become incarnate. But now by his addition a double absurdity arises; for he either charges the Son with evil, or the Father with powerlessness.

Moreover, Matthew makes up his account of John in the following manner:-Now in those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, and saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For this is He that is spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.[fn-15-P1518_616292:125-nf] Mark also and Luke agree in presenting this testimony of Isaiah as one referring to John.[fn-15-P1519_616405:126-nf] Luke, indeed, has likewise recorded some other words from the same prophet, which follow those already cited, when he gives his narrative of John the Baptist. The evangelist John, again, mentions that John the Baptist did also personally advance this same testimony of Isaiah regarding himself.[fn-15-P1520_616731:127-nf] And, to a similar effect, Matthew here has given us certain words of John which are unrecorded by the other evangelists. For he speaks of him as \"preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, and saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand; \"which words of John have been omitted by the others. In what follows, however, in immediate connection with that passage in Matthew's Gospel,-namely, the sentence, \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight,\"-the position is ambiguous; and it does not clearly appear whether this is something recited by Matthew in his own person, or rather a continuance of the words spoken by John himself, so as to lead us to understand the whole passage to be the reproduction of John's own utterance, in this way: \"Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand; for this is He that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah,\" and so on. For it ought to create no difficulty against this latter view, that he does not say, \"For I am He that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah,\" but employs the phraseology, \"For this is He that was spoken of.\" For that, indeed, is a mode of speech[fn-15-P1521_617920:128-nf] which the evangelists Matthew and John are in the habit of using in reference to themselves. Thus Matthew has adopted the phrase, \"He found[fn-15-P1522_618223:129-nf] a man sitting at the receipt of custom,\"[fn-15-P1523_618280:130-nf] instead of \"He found me.\" John, too, says, \"This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true,\"[fn-15-P1524_618464:131-nf] instead of \"I am,\" etc., or, \"My testimony is true.\" Yea, our Lord Himself very frequently uses the words, \"The Son of man,\"[fn-15-P1525_618610:132-nf] or, \"The Son of God,\"[fn-15-P1526_618661:133-nf] instead of saying, \"I.\" So, again, He tells us that \"it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day,\"[fn-15-P1527_618804:134-nf] instead of saying, \"It behoved me to suffer.\" Consequently it is perfectly possible that the clause, \"For this is He that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah,\" which immediately follows the saying, \"Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,\" may be but a continuation of what John the Baptist said of himself; so that only after these words cited from the speaker himself will Matthew's own narrative proceed, being thus resumed: \"And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair,\" and so forth. But if this is the case, then it need not seem wonderful that, when asked what he had to say regarding himself, he should reply, according to the narrative of the evangelist John, \"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,\"[fn-15-P1528_619561:135-nf] as he had already spoken in the same terms when enjoining on them the duty of repentance. Accordingly, Matthew goes on to tell us about his attire and his mode of living, and continues his account thus: And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his meat was locusts and wild honey. Mark also gives us this same statement almost in so many words.

Another question which it is also usual to put is this: How comes it that Matthew and Luke have stated that the Lord said to His disciples that they were not to take a staff with them, whereas Mark puts the matter in this way: \"And He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only;\"[fn-17-P1788_731464:313-nf] and proceeds further in this strain, \"no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:\" thereby making it quite evident that his narrative belongs to the same place and circumstances with which the narratives of those others deal who have mentioned that the staff was not to be taken? Now this question admits of being solved on the principle of understanding that the staff which, according to Mark, was to be taken, bears one sense, and that the staff which,according to Matthew and Luke, was not to be taken with them, is to be interpreted in a different sense; just in the same way as we find the term \"temptation\" used in one meaning, when it is said, \"God tempteth no man,\"[fn-17-P1789_732347:314-nf] and in a different meaning where it is said, \"The Lord your God tempteth [proveth] you, to know whether ye love Him.\"[fn-17-P1790_732484:315-nf] For in the former case the temptation of seduction is intended; but in the latter the temptation of probation. Another parallel occurs in the case of the term \"judgment,\" which must be taken in one way, where it is said, \"They that have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment;\"[fn-17-P1791_732849:316-nf] and in another way, where it is said, \"Judge me, O God, and discern[fn-17-P1792_732945:317-nf] my cause, in respect of an ungodly nation.\"[fn-17-P1793_733006:318-nf] For the former refers to the judgment of damnation, and the latter to the judgment of discrimination.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"6. The next verse too is suspicious, \"If ye believed Moses, ye would also believe me;\" for the religion of Moses is so entirely different from that of Christ, that if the Jews believed one, they could not believe the other. Moses strictly forbids any work to be done on Sabbath, and gives as a reason for this prohibition that God made the world and all that is therein in six days, and rested on the seventh day, which is Sabbath; and therefore blessed or sanctified it as His haven of repose after toil, and commanded that breaking the Sabbath should be punished with death. The Jews, in obedience to Moses, insisted strongly on this, and so would not even listen to Christ when He told them that God always works, and that no day is appointed for the intermission of His pure and unwearied energy, and that accordingly He Himself had to work incessantly even on Sabbath. \"My Father,\" he says, \"worketh always, and I too must work.\"[fn-16-P1665_926556:5-nf] Again, Moses places circumcision among the rites pleasing to God, and commands every male to be circumcised in the foreskin of his flesh, and declares that this is a necessary sign of the covenant which God made with Abraham, and that every male not circumcised would be cut off from his tribe, and from his part in the inheritance promised to Abraham and to his seed.[fn-16-P1666_926940:6-nf] In this observance, too, the Jews were very zealous, and consequently could not believe in Christ, who made light of these things, and declared that a man when circumcised became twofold a child of hell.[fn-16-P1667_927164:7-nf] Again, Moses is very particular about the distinction in animal foods, and discourses like an epicure on the merits of fish, and birds, and quadrupeds, and orders some to be eaten as clean, and others which are unclean not to be touched. Among the unclean he reckons the swine and the hare, and fish without scales, and quadrupeds that neither divide the hoof nor chew the cud. In this also the Jews carefully obeyed Moses, and so could not believe in Christ, who taught that all food is alike, and though he allowed no animal food to his own disciples, gave full liberty to the laity to eat whatever they pleased, and taught that men are polluted not by what goes into the mouth, but by the evil things which come out of it. In these and many other things the doctrine of Jesus, as everybody knows, contradicts that of Moses.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":46,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"11. You ask me to show what Moses wrote of Christ. Many passages have already been pointed out. But who could point out all? Besides, when any quotation is made, you are ready perversely to try to give the words another meaning; or if the evidence is too strong to be resisted, you will say that you take the passage as a sweet fish out of the salt water, and that you will not therefore consent to drink all the brine of the books of Moses. It will be enough, then, to take those passages in the Hebrew law which Faustus has chosen for criticism, and to show that, when rightly understood, they apply to Christ. For if the things which our adversary ridicules and condemns are made to prove that he himself is condemned by Christian truth, it will be evident that either the mere quotation or the careful examination of the other passages will be enough to show their agreement with Christian faith. Well, then, O thou full of all subtilty, when the Lord in the Gospel says, \"If ye believed Moses, ye would believe me also, for he wrote of me,\"[fn-16-P1680_934977:14-nf] there is no occasion for the great perplexity you pretend to be in, or for the alternative of either pronouncing this verse spurious or calling Jesus a liar. The verse is as genuine as its words are true. I preferred, says Faustus, to attribute falsehood to the writers, rather than to the Author of truth. What sort of faith can you have in Christ as the author of truth, when your doctrine is that His flesh and His; death, His wounds and their marks, were reigned? And where is your authority for saying that Christ is the author of truth, if you dare to attribute falsehood to those who wrote of Him, whose testimony has come down to us with the confirmation of those immediately succeeding them? You have not seen Christ, nor has He conversed with you as with the apostles, nor called you from heaven as He did Saul. What knowledge or belief can we have of Christ, but on the authority of Scripture? Or if there is falsehood in the Gospel which has been widely published among all nations, and has been held in such high sacredness in all churches since the name of Christ was first preached, where shall we find a trustworthy record of Christ?

Augustin replied: What amazing folly, to disbelieve what Matthew records of Christ, while you believe Manichaeus! If Matthew is not to be believed because he was not present when Christ said, \"I came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill,\" was Manichaeus present, was he even born, when Christ appeared among men? According, then, to your rule, you should not believe anything that Manichaeus says of Christ. On the other hand, we refuse to believe what Manichaeus says of Christ; not because he was not present as a witness of Christ's words and actions, but because he contradicts Christ's disciples, and the Gospel which rests on their authority. The apostle, speaking in the Holy Spirit, tells us that such teachers would arise. With reference to such, he says to believers: \"If any man preaches to you another gospel than that ye have received, let him be accursed.\"[fn-17-P1765_998078:3-nf] If no one can say what is true of Christ unless he has himself seen and heard Him, no one now can be trusted. But if believers can now say what is true of Christ because the truth has been handed down in word or writing by those who saw and heard, why might not Matthew have heard the truth from his fellow-disciple John, if John was present and he himself was not, as from the writings of John both we who are born so long after and those who shall be born after us can learn the truth about Christ? In this way, the Gospels of Luke and Mark, who were companions of the disciples, as well as the Gospel of Matthew, have the same authority as that of John. Besides, the Lord Himself might have told Matthew what those called before him had already been witnesses of. Your idea is, that John should have recorded this saying of the Lord, as he was present on the occasion. As if it might not happen that, since it was impossible to write all that be heard from the Lord, he set himself to write some, omitting this among others. Does he not say at the close of his Gospel: \"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written\"?[fn-17-P1766_999357:4-nf] This proves that he omitted many things intentionally, But if you choose John as an authority regarding the law and the prophets, I ask you only to believe his testimony to them. It is John who writes that Isaiah saw the glory of Christ.[fn-17-P1767_999612:5-nf] It is in his Gospel we find the text already treated of: \"If ye believed Moses, ye would also believe me; for he wrote of me.\"[fn-17-P1768_999756:6-nf] Your evasions are met on every side. You ought to say plainly that you do not believe the gospel of Christ. For to believe what you please, and not to believe what you please, is to believe yourselves, and not the gospel.","title":"Book XVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_30_book_xvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"4. Faustus thinks himself wonderfully clever in proving that Matthew was not the writer of this Gospel, because, when speaking of his own election, he says not, He saw me, and said to me, Follow me; but, He saw him, and said to him, Follow me. This must have been said either in ignorance or from a design to mislead. Faustus can hardly be so ignorant as not to have read or heard that narrators, when speaking of themselves, often use a construction as if speaking of another. It is more probable that Faustus wished to bewilder those more ignorant than himself, in the hope of getting hold on not a few unacquainted with these things. It is needless to resort to other writings to quote examples of this construction from profane authors for the information of our friends, and for the refutation of Faustus. We find examples in passages quoted above from Moses by Faustus himself, without any denial, or rather with the assertion, that they were written by Moses, only not written of Christ. When Moses, then, writes of himself, does he say, I said this, or I did that, and not rather, Moses said, and Moses did? Or does he say, The Lord called me, The Lord said to me, and not rather, The Lord called Moses, The Lord said to Moses, and so on? So Matthew, too, speaks of himself in the third person. And John does the same; for towards the end of his book he says: \"Peter, turning, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved, who also lay on His breast at supper, and who said to the Lord, Who is it that shall betray Thee?\" Does he say, Peter, turning, saw me? Or will you argue from this that John did not write this Gospel? But he adds a little after: \"This is the disciple that testifies of Jesus, and has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.\"[fn-17-P1770_1001760:7-nf] Does he say, I am the disciple who testify of Jesus, and who have written these things, and we know that my testimony is true? Evidently this style is common in writers of narratives. There are innumerable instances in which the Lord Himself uses it. \"When the Son of man,\" He says, \"cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?\"[fn-17-P1771_1002107:8-nf] Not, When I come, shall I find? Again, \"The Son of man came eating and drinking;\"[fn-17-P1772_1002207:9-nf] not, I came. Again, \"The hour shall come, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live;\"[fn-17-P1773_1002365:10-nf] not, My voice. And so in many other places.

Again, how weighty are the things which this evangelist reports Jesus to have spoken, when He came back to the temple from Mount Olivet, and after the forgiveness which He extended to the adulteress, who had been brought before Him by His tempters, as one deserving to be stoned: on which occasion He wrote with His finger upon the ground, as if He would indicate that people of the character of these men would be written on earth, and not in heaven, as He also admonished His disciples to rejoice that their names were written in heaven![fn-28-P2837_1255716:62-nf] Or, it may be that He meant to convey the idea that it was by humbling Himself (which He expressed by bending down His head) that He wrought signs upon the earth; or, that the time was now come when His law should be written, not, as formerly, on the sterile stone, but on a soil which would yield fruit. Accordingly, after these incidents, He affirmed Himself to be the light of the world, and declared that be who followed Him would not walk in darkness, but would have the light of life.

Augustin replied: If you allow, in consideration of the authority of the Gospel, that Christ said that He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them, you should show the same consideration to the authority of the apostle, when he says, \"All these things were our examples;\" and again of Christ, \"He was not yea and nay, but in Him was yea; for all the promises of God are in Him yea;\"[fn-18-P1826_1029214:9-nf] that is, they are set forth and fulfilled in Him. In this way you will see in the clearest light both what law Christ fulfilled, and how He fulfilled it. It is a vain attempt that you make to escape by your three kinds of law and your three kinds of prophets. It is quite plain, and the New Testament leaves no doubt on the matter, what law and what prophets Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill. The law given by Moses is that which by Jesus Christ became grace and truth.[fn-18-P1827_1029716:10-nf] The law given by Moses is that of which Christ says, \"He wrote of me.\"[fn-18-P1828_1029804:11-nf] For undoubtedly this is the law which entered that the offence might abound;[fn-18-P1829_1029898:12-nf] words which you often ignorantly quote as a reproach to the law. Read what is there said of this law: \"The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good.\"[fn-18-P1830_1030220:13-nf] The entrance of the law made the offense abound, not because the law required what was wrong, but because the proud and self-confident incurred additional guilt as transgressors after their acquaintance with the holy, and just, and good commandments of the law; so that, being thus humbled, they might learn that only by grace through faith could they be freed from subjection to the law as transgressors, and be reconciled to the law as righteous. So the same apostle says: \"For before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which was afterwards revealed. Therefore the law was our schoolmaster in Christ Jesus; but after faith came, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.\"[fn-18-P1831_1030943:14-nf] That is, we are no longer subject to the penalty of the law, because we are set free by grace. Before we received in humility the grace of the Spirit, the letter was only death to us, for it required obedience which we could not render. Thus Paul also says: \"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.\"[fn-18-P1832_1031274:15-nf] Again, he says: \"For if a law had been given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law; but the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\"[fn-18-P1833_1031546:16-nf] And once more: \"What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\"[fn-18-P1834_1031861:17-nf] Here we see Christ coming not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. As the law brought the proud under the guilt of transgression, increasing their sin by commandments which they could not obey, so the righteousness of the same law is fulfilled by the grace of the Spirit in those who learn from Christ to be meek and lowly in heart; for Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. Moreover, because even for those who are under grace it is difficult in this mortal life perfectly to keep what is written in the law, Thou shall not covet, Christ, by the sacrifice of His flesh, as our Priest obtains pardon for us. And in this also He fulfills the law; for what we fail in through weakness is supplied by His perfection, who is the Head, while we are His members. Thus John says: \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not; and if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: He is the propitiation for our sins.\"[fn-18-P1835_1032867:18-nf] ","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"31. I am disposed, after careful examination, to doubt whether the expression so often used by the Lord, \"the kingdom of heaven,\" can be found in these books. It is said, indeed, \"Love wisdom, that ye may reign for ever.\"[fn-19-P1909_1083770:68-nf] And if eternal life had not been clearly made known in the Old Testament, the Lord would not have said, as He did even to the unbelieving Jews: \"Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think that ye have eternal life, and they are they that testify of me.\"[fn-19-P1910_1084044:69-nf] And to the same effect are the words of the Psalmist: \"I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.\"[fn-19-P1911_1084179:70-nf] And again: \"Enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death.\"[fn-19-P1912_1084267:71-nf] Again, we read, \"The souls of the righteous are in the hand of the Lord, and pain shall not touch them;\" and immediately following: \"They are in peace; and if they have suffered torture from men, their hope is full of immortality; and after a few trouble, they shall enjoy many rewards.\"[fn-19-P1913_1084572:72-nf] Again, in another place: \"The righteous shall live for ever, and their reward is with the Lord, and their concern with the Highest; therefore shall they receive from the hand of the Lord a kingdom of glory and a crown of beauty.\"[fn-19-P1914_1084823:73-nf] These and many similar declarations of eternal life, in more or less explicit terms, are found in these writings. Even the resurrection of the body is spoken of by theprophets. The Pharisees, accordingly, were fierce opponents of the Sadducees, who disbelieved the resurrection. This we learn not only from the canonical Acts of the Apostles, which the Manichaeans reject, because it tells of the advent of the Paraclete promised by the Lord, but also from the Gospel, when the Sadducees question the Lord about the woman who married seven brothers, one dying after the other, whose wife she would be in the resurrection.[fn-19-P1915_1085467:74-nf] As regards, then, eternal life and the resurrection of the dead, numerous testimonies are to be found in these Scriptures. But I do not find there the expression, \"the kingdom of heaven.\" This expression belongs properly to the revelation of the New Testament, because in the resurrection our earthly bodies shall, by that change which Paul fully describes, become spiritual bodies, and so heavenly, that thus we may possess the kingdom of heaven. And this expression was reserved for Him whose advent as King to govern and Priest to sanctify His believing people, was ushered in by all the symbolism of the old covenant, in its genealogies, its typical acts and words, its sacrifices and ceremonies and feasts, and in all its prophetic utterances and events and figures. He came full of grace and truth, in His grace helping us to obey the precepts, and in His truth securing the accomplishment of the promises. He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it.","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":39,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Deuteronomy God said to Moses: \"And the Lord said to me, A Prophet will I raise up to them from among their brethren, such as thee, and I will give my word in His mouth; and He shall speak unto them that which I shall command Him.

For instance, supposing the case of several rhetoricians, their pursuit, being one, has the same name in the numerous cases: but each of those who follow it works by himself, this one pleading on his own account, and that on his own account. Thus, since among men the action of each in the same pursuits is discriminated, they are properly called many, since each of them is separated from the others within his own environment, according to the special character of his operation. But in the case of the Divine nature we do not similarly learn that the Father does anything by Himself in which the Son does not work conjointly, or again that the Son has any special operation apart from the Holy Spirit; but every operation which extends from God to the Creation, and is named according to our variable conceptions of it, has its origin from the Father, and proceeds through the Son, and is perfected in the Holy Spirit. For this reason the name derived from the operation is not divided with regard to the number of those who fulfil it, because the action of each concerning anything is not separate and peculiar, but whatever comes to pass, in reference either to the acts of His providence for us, or to the government and constitution of the universe, comes to pass by the action of the Three, yet what does come to pass is not three things. We may understand the meaning of this from one single instance. From Him, I say, Who is the chief source of gifts, all things which have shared in this grace have obtained their life. When we inquire, then, whence this good gift came to us, we find by the guidance of the Scriptures that it was from the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Yet although we set forth Three Persons and three names, we do not consider that we have had bestowed upon us three lives, one from each Person separately; but the same life is wrought in us by the Father, and prepared by the Son, and depends on the will of the Holy Spirit. Since then the Holy Trinity fulfils every operation in a mannersimilar to that of which I have spoken, not by separate action according to the number of the Persons, but so that there is one motion and disposition of the good will which is communicated from the Father through the Son to the Spirit (for as we do not call those whose operation gives one life three Givers of life, neither do we call those who are contemplated in one goodness three Good beings, nor speak of them in the plural by any of their other attributes); so neither can we call those who exercise this Divine and superintending power and operation towards ourselves and all creation, conjointly and inseparably, by their mutual action, three Gods. For as when we learn concerning the God of the universe, from the words of Scripture, that He judges all the earth[fn-25-P2585_1773701:15-nf] , we say that He is the Judge of all things through the Son: and again, when we hear that the Father judgeth no man[fn-25-P2586_1773835:16-nf] , we do not think that the Scripture is at variance with itself,-(for He Who judges all the earth does this by His Son to Whom He has committed all judgment; and everything which is done by the Only-begotten has its reference to the Father, so that He Himself is at once the Judge of all things and judges no man, by reason of His having, as we said, committed all judgment to the Son, while all the judgment of the Son is conformable to the will of the Father; and one could not properly say either that They are two judges, or that one of Them is excluded from the authority and power implied in judgment);-so also in the case of the word \"Godhead,\" Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God, and that very power of superintendence and beholding which we call Godhead, the Father exercises through the Only-begotten, while the Son perfects every power by the Holy Spirit, judging, as Isaiah says, by the Spirit of judgment and the Spirit of burning[fn-25-P2587_1774812:17-nf] , and acting by Him also, according to the saying in the Gospel which was spoken to the Jews.

Then came He for whom it was reserved, the desire of nations; and the holy of holies was anointed with the oil of gladness above His fellows.[fn-22-P2261_1364735:158-nf] Christ was born in the time of the elder Herod, and suffered in the time of Herod the tetrarch.

Judah, we are told, came with his Adullamite shepherd, whose name was Iras; and Adullamite means, a testimony in water.

This is after the kingdom of the Son; then the Father will manifest in His works His name the Good, when God becomes all in all. And perhaps by His righteousness the Saviour prepares everything at the fit times, and by His word, by His ordering, by His chastisements, and, if I may use such an expression, by His spiritual healing aids, disposes all things to receive at the end the goodness of the Father. It was from His sense of that goodness that He answered him who addressed the Only-begotten with the words \"Good Master,\"[fn-63-P6392_1030277:178-nf] and said, \"Why callest thou Me good? None is good but one, God, the Father.\" This we have treated of elsewhere, especially in dealing with the question of the greater than the demiurge; Christ we have taken to be the demiurge, and the Father the greater than He. Such great things, then, He is, the Paraclete, the atonement, the propitiation, the sympathizer with our weaknesses, who was tempted in all human things, as we are, without sin; and in consequence He is a great High-Priest, having offered Himself as the sacrifice which is offered once for all, and not for men only but for every rational creature. For without[fn-63-P6393_1030920:179-nf] God He tasted death for every one. In some copies of the Epistle to the Hebrews the words are \"by the grace of God.\" Now, whether He tasted death for every one without God. He died not for men only but for all other intellectual beings too, or whether He tasted death for every one by the grace of God, He died for all without God, for by the grace of God He tasted death for every one. It would surely be absurd to say that He tasted death for human sins and not for any other being besides man which had fallen into sin, as for example for the stars. For not even the stars are clean in the eyes of God, as we read in Job,[fn-63-P6394_1031604:180-nf] \"The stars are not clean in His sight,\" unless this is to be regarded as a hyperbole. Hence he is a great High-Priest, since He restores all things to His Father's kingdom, and arranges that whatever defects exist in each part of creation shall be filled up so as to be full of the glory of the Father. This High-Priest is called, from some other notion of him than those we have noticed, Judas, that those who are Jews secretly[fn-63-P6395_1032052:181-nf] may take the name of Jew not froth Judah, son of Jacob, but from Him, since they are His brethren, and praise Him for the freedom they have attained. For it is He who sets them free, saving them from their enemies on whose backs He lays His hand to subdue them. When He has put under His feet the opposing power, and is alone in presence of His Father, then He is Jacob and Israel; and thus as we are made light by Him, since He is the light of the world, so we are made Jacob since He is called Jacob, and Israel since He is called Israel.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_126_oration_on_the_psalms_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"ANF-06","text":"III.

He also goes on to explain what He would have us to understand by spirit: \"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" In a like sense He had previously said: \"He that heareth my words, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but shall pass from death unto life.\"[fn-100-P10033_2787971:243-nf] Constituting, therefore, His word as the life-giving principle, because that word is spirit and life, He likewise called His flesh by the same appellation; because, too, the Word had become flesh,[fn-100-P10034_2788187:244-nf] we ought therefore to desire Him in order that we may have life, and to devour Him with the ear, and to ruminate on Him with the understanding, and to digest Him by faith.

As if there might not reasonably enough be something which, although it\" profiteth nothing\" itself, might yet be capable of being profited by something else. The spirit \"profiteth,\" for it imparts life. The flesh profiteth nothing, for it is subject to death.

For it is not the resurrection that is directly denied to flesh and blood, but the kingdom of God, which is incidental to[fn-101-P10197_2846210:368-nf] the resurrection (for there is a resurrection of judgment[fn-101-P10198_2846284:369-nf] also); and there is even a confirmation of the general resurrection of the flesh, whenever a special one is excepted. Now, when it is clearly stated what the condition is to which the resurrection does not lead, it is understood what that is to which it does lead; and, therefore, whilst it is in consideration of men's merits that a difference is made in their resurrection by their conduct in the flesh, and not by the substance thereof, it is evident even from this, that flesh and blood are excluded from the kingdom of God in respect of their sin, not of their substance; and although in respect of their natural condition[fn-101-P10199_2846947:370-nf] they will rise again for the judgment, because they rise not for the kingdom. Again, I will say, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; \"[fn-102-P10200_2847112:371-nf] and justly (does the apostle declare this of them, considered) alone and in themselves, in order to show that the Spirit is still needed (to qualify them) for the kingdom.[fn-102-P10201_2847306:372-nf] For it is \"the Spirit that quickeneth\" us for the kingdom of God; \"the flesh profiteth nothing.\"[fn-102-P10202_2847455:373-nf] There is, however, something else which can be profitable thereunto, that is, the Spirit; and through the Spirit, the works also of the Spirit. Flesh and blood, therefore, must in every case rise again, equally, in their proper quality. But they to whom it is granted to enter the kingdom of God, will have to put on the power of an incorruptible and immortal life; for without this, or before they are able to obtain it, they cannot enter into the kingdom of God. With good reason, then, flesh and blood, as we have already said, by themselves fail to obtain the kingdom of God. But inasmuch as \"this corruptible (that is, the flesh) must put on incorruption, and this mortal (that is, the blood) must put on immortality,\"[fn-102-P10203_2848200:374-nf] by the change which is to follow the resurrection, it will, for the best of reasons, happen that flesh and blood, after that change and investiture,[fn-102-P10204_2848371:375-nf] will become able to inherit the kingdom of God-but not without the resurrection. Some will have it, that by the phrase \"flesh and blood,\" because of its rite of circumcision, Judaism is meant, which is itself too alienated from the kingdom of God, as being accounted \"the old or former conversation,\" and as being designated by this title in another passage of the apostle also, who, \"when it pleased God to reveal to him His Son, to preach Him amongst the heathen, immediately conferred not with flesh and blood,\" as he writes to the Galatians,[fn-102-P10205_2849069:376-nf] (meaning by the phrase) the circumcision, that is to say, Judaism.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_36_homily_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"The fact is, He is signifying hereby that not He was transgressing the law, but they; as if He had said, \"Wherefore accuse me?

I feel myself growing dizzy with all this, and wonder whether, in obeying you, I have not been obeying God, nor walking in the footsteps of the saints, unless it be that my too great love to you, and my unwillingness to cause you any pain, has led me astray and caused me to think of all these excuses. We started from the words of the preacher, where he says: \"My son, beware of making many books.\" With this I compare a saying from the Proverbs of the same Solomon,[fn-66-P6671_1166477:10-nf] \"In the multitude of words thou shall not escape sin; but in sparing thy lips thou shalt be wise.\" Here I ask whether speaking many words of whatever kind is a multitude of words (in the sense of the preacher), even if the many words a man speaks are sacred and connected with salvation. If this be the case, and if he who makes use of many salutary words is guilty of \"multitude of words,\" then Solomon himself did not escape this sin, for \"he spoke[fn-66-P6672_1166940:11-nf] three thousand proverbs, and five thousand songs, and he spoke of trees from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall, he spoke also of beasts and of fowl, and of creeping things and of fishes.\" How, I may ask, can any one give any course of instruction, without a multitude of words, using the phrase in its simplest sense? Does not Wisdom herself say to those who are perishing,[fn-66-P6673_1167382:12-nf] \"I stretched out my words, and ye heeded not\"? Do we not find Paul, too, extending his discourse from morning to midnight,[fn-66-P6674_1167523:13-nf] when Eutychus was borne down with sleep and fell down, to the dismay of the hearers. who thought he was killed? If, then, the words are true, \"In much speaking thou wilt not escape sin,\" and if Solomon was yet not guilty of great sin when he discoursed on the subjects above mentioned, nor Paul when he prolonged his discourse till midnight, then the question arises, What is that much speaking which is referred to? and then we may pass on to consider what are the many books. Now the entire Word of God, who was in the beginning with God, is not much speaking, is not words; for the Word is one, being composed of the many speculations (theoremata), each of which is a part of the Word in its entirety. Whatever words there be outside of this one, which promise to give any description and exposition, even though they be words about truth, none of these, to put it in a somewhat paradoxical way, is Word or Reason, they are all words or reasons. They are not the monad, far from it; they are not that which agrees and is one in itself, by their inner divisions and conflicts unity has departed from them, they have become numbers, perhaps infinite numbers. We are obliged, therefore, to say that whoever speaks that which is foreign to religion is using many words, while he who speaks the words of truth, even should he go over the whole field and omit nothing, is always speaking the one word. Nor are the saints guilty of much speaking, since they always have the aim in view which is connected with the one word. It appears, then, that the much speaking which is condemned is judged to be so rather from the nature of the views propounded, than from the number of the words pronounced. Let us see if we cannot conclude in the same way that all the sacred books are one book, but that those outside are the \"many books\" of the preacher. The proof of this must be drawn from Holy Scripture, and it will be most satisfactorily established if I am able to show that it is not only one book, taking the word now in its commoner meaning, that we find to be written about Christ. Christ is written about even in the Pentateuch; He is spoken of in each of the Prophets, and in the Psalms, and, in a word, as the Saviour Himself says, in all the Scriptures. He refers us to them all, when He says:[fn-66-P6675_1169838:14-nf] \"Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and these are they which testify of Me.\" And if He refers us to the Scriptures as testifying of Him, it is not to one that He sends us, to the exclusion of another, but to all that speak of Him, those which, in the Psalms, He calls the chapter of the book, saying,[fn-66-P6676_1170187:15-nf] \"In the chapter of the book it is written of Me.\" If any one proposes to take these words, \"In the chapter of the book it is written of Me,\" literally, and to apply them to this or that special passage where Christ is spoken of, let him tell us on what principle he warrants his preference for one book over another. If any one supposes that we are doing something of this kind ourselves. and applying the words in question to the book of Psalms, we deny that we do so, and we would urge that in that case the words should have been, \"In this book it is written of Me.\" But He speaks of all the books as one chapter, thus sum-ruing up in one all that is spoken of Christ for our instruction. In fact the book was seen by John,[fn-66-P6677_1170927:16-nf] \"written within and without, and sealed; and no one could open it to read it, and to loose the seals thereof, but the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, who has the key of David,[fn-66-P6678_1171137:17-nf] he that openeth and none shall shut, and that shutteth and none shall open.\" For the book here spoken of means the whole of Scripture; and it is written within (lit. in front), on account of the meaning which is obvious, and on the back, on account of its remoter and spiritual sense. Observe, in addition to this, if a proof that the sacred writings are one book, and those of an opposite character many. may not be found in the fact that there is one book of the living from which those who have proved unworthy to be in it are blotted out, as it is written:[fn-66-P6679_1171717:18-nf] \"Let them be blotter out of the book of the living,\" while of those who are to undergo the judgment, there are books in the plural, as Daniel says:[fn-66-P6680_1171884:19-nf] \"The judgment was set, and the books were opened.\" But Moses also bears witness to the unity of the sacred book, when he says:[fn-66-P6681_1172030:20-nf] \"If Thou forgive the people their sins, forgive, but if not, then wipe me out of the book which Thou hast written.\" The passage in Isaiah,[fn-66-P6682_1172191:21-nf] too, I read in the same way. It is not peculiar to his prophecy that the words of the book should be sealed, and should neither be read by him who does not know letters, because he is ignorant of letters, nor by him who is learned, because the book is sealed. This is true of every writing, for every written work needs the reason (Logos) which closed it to open it. \"He shall shut, and none shall open,\"[fn-66-P6683_1172615:22-nf] and when He opens no one can cast doubt on the interpretation He brings. Hence it is said that He shall open and no man shall shut. I infer a similar lesson from the book spoken of in Ezekiel,[fn-66-P6684_1172828:23-nf] in which was written lamentation, and a song, and woe. For the whole book is full of the woe of the lost, and the song of the saved, and the lamentation of those between these two. And John, too, when he speaks of his eating the one roll,[fn-66-P6685_1173079:24-nf] in which both front and back were written on, means the whole of Scripture, one book which is, at first, most sweet when one begins, as it were, to chew it, but bitter in the revelation of himself which it makes to the conscience of each one who knows it. I will add to the proof of this an apostolic saying which has been quite misunderstood by the disciples of Marcion, who, therefore, set the Gospels at naught. The Apostle says:[fn-66-P6686_1173533:25-nf] \"According to my Gospel in Christ Jesus; \"he does not speak of Gospels in the plural, and, hence, they argue that as the Apostle only speaks of one Gospel in the singular, there was only one in existence. But they fail to see that, as He is one of whom all the evangelists write, so the Gospel, though written by several hands, is, in effect, one. And, in fact, the Gospel, though written by four, is one. From these considerations, then, we learn what the one book is, and what the many books, and what I am now concerned about is, not the quantity I may write, but the effect of what I say, lest, if I fail in this point, and set forth anything against the truth itself, even in one of my writings, I should prove to have transgressed the commandment, and to be a writer of \"many books.\" Yet I see the heterodox assailing the holy Church of God in these days, under the pretence of higher wisdom, and bringing forward works in many volumes in which they offer expositions of the evangelical and apostolic writings, and I fear that if I should be silent and should not put before our members the saving and true doctrines, these teachers might get a hold of curious souls, which, in the absence of wholesome nourishment, might go after food that is forbidden, and, in fact, unclean and horrible. It appears to me, therefore, to be necessary that one who is able to represent in a genuine manner the doctrine of the Church, and to refute those dealers in knowledge, falsely so-called, should take his stand against historical fictions, and oppose to them the true and lofty evangelical message in which the agreement of the doctrines, found both in the so-called Old Testament and in the so-called New, appears so plainly and fully. You yourself felt at one time the lack of good representatives of the better cause, and were impatient of a faith which was at issue with reason and absurd, and you then, for the love you bore to the Lord, gave yourself to composition from which, however, in the exercise of the judgment with which you are endowed, you afterwards desisted. This is the defence which I think admits of being made for those who have the faculty of speaking and writing. But I am also pleading my own cause, as I now devote myself with what boldness I may to the work of exposition; for it may be that I am not endowed with that habit and disposition which he ought to have who is fitted by God to be a minister of the New Covenant, not of the letter but of the spirit.","title":"From the Fifth Book.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_14_part_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"Has then the divine teaching, which abolished the godlessness of the heathen or the idols, passed over in silence, and left the race of mankind to go entirely unprovided with the knowledge of God? Not so: rather it anticipates their understanding when it says[fn-17-P1795_656900:27-nf] : \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God;\" and again, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy strength ;\" and again, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve, and shalt cleave to Him.\" 2. But that the providence and ordering power of the Word also, over all and toward all, is attested by all inspired Scripture, this passage suffices to confirm our argument, where men who speak of God say[fn-17-P1796_657399:28-nf] : \"Thou hast laid the foundation of the earth and it abideth. The day con-tinueth according to Thine ordinance.\" And again[fn-17-P1797_657540:29-nf] : \"Sing to our God upon the harp, that covereth the heaven with clouds, that pre-pareth rain for the earth, that bringeth forth grass upon the mountains, and green herb for the service of man, and giveth food to the cattle.\" 3. But by whom does He give it, save by Him through Whom all things were made? For the providence over all things belongs naturally to Him by Whom they were made; and who is this save the Word of God, concerning Whom in another psalm[fn-17-P1798_658021:30-nf] he says: \"By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the Breath of His mouth.\" For He tells us that all things were made in Him and through Him. 4. Wherefore He also persuades us and says[fn-17-P1799_658260:31-nf] , \"He spake and they were made, He commanded and they were created;\" as the illustrious Moses also at the beginning of his account of Creation confirms what we say by his narrative[fn-18-P1800_658462:32-nf] , saying: and God said, \"let us make man in our image and after our likeness:\" for also when He was carrying out the creation of the heaven and earth and all things, the Father said to Him[fn-18-P1801_658668:33-nf] , \"Let the heaven be made,\" and \"let the waters be gathered together and let the dry land appear,\" and \"let the earth bring forth herb\" and \"every green thing:\" so that one must convict Jews also of not genuinely attending to the Scriptures. 5. For one might ask them to whom was God speaking, to use the imperative mood? If He were commanding and addressing the things He was creating, the utterance would be redundant, for they were not yet in being, but were about to be made; but no one speaks to what does not exist, nor addresses to what is not yet made a command to be made. For if God were giving a command to the things that were to be, He must have said, \"Be modal, heaven, and be made, earth, and come forth, green herb, and be created, O man.\" But in fact He did not do so; but He gives the command thus: \"Let us make man,\" and \"let the green herb come forth.\" By which God is proved to be speaking about them to some one at hand: it follows then that some one was with Him to Whom He spoke when He made all things. 6. Who then could it be, save His Word? For to whom could God be said to speak, except His Word?

Not so: rather it anticipates their understanding when it says[fn-17-P1795_656900:27-nf] : \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God;\" and again, \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy strength ;\" and again, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve, and shalt cleave to Him.\" 2. But that the providence and ordering power of the Word also, over all and toward all, is attested by all inspired Scripture, this passage suffices to confirm our argument, where men who speak of God say[fn-17-P1796_657399:28-nf] : \"Thou hast laid the foundation of the earth and it abideth. The day con-tinueth according to Thine ordinance.\" And again[fn-17-P1797_657540:29-nf] : \"Sing to our God upon the harp, that covereth the heaven with clouds, that pre-pareth rain for the earth, that bringeth forth grass upon the mountains, and green herb for the service of man, and giveth food to the cattle.\" 3. But by whom does He give it, save by Him through Whom all things were made? For the providence over all things belongs naturally to Him by Whom they were made; and who is this save the Word of God, concerning Whom in another psalm[fn-17-P1798_658021:30-nf] he says: \"By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the Breath of His mouth.\" For He tells us that all things were made in Him and through Him. 4. Wherefore He also persuades us and says[fn-17-P1799_658260:31-nf] , \"He spake and they were made, He commanded and they were created;\" as the illustrious Moses also at the beginning of his account of Creation confirms what we say by his narrative[fn-18-P1800_658462:32-nf] , saying: and God said, \"let us make man in our image and after our likeness:\" for also when He was carrying out the creation of the heaven and earth and all things, the Father said to Him[fn-18-P1801_658668:33-nf] , \"Let the heaven be made,\" and \"let the waters be gathered together and let the dry land appear,\" and \"let the earth bring forth herb\" and \"every green thing:\" so that one must convict Jews also of not genuinely attending to the Scriptures. 5. For one might ask them to whom was God speaking, to use the imperative mood? If He were commanding and addressing the things He was creating, the utterance would be redundant, for they were not yet in being, but were about to be made; but no one speaks to what does not exist, nor addresses to what is not yet made a command to be made. For if God were giving a command to the things that were to be, He must have said, \"Be modal, heaven, and be made, earth, and come forth, green herb, and be created, O man.\" But in fact He did not do so; but He gives the command thus: \"Let us make man,\" and \"let the green herb come forth.\" By which God is proved to be speaking about them to some one at hand: it follows then that some one was with Him to Whom He spoke when He made all things. 6. Who then could it be, save His Word? For to whom could God be said to speak, except His Word? Or who was with Him when He made all created Existence, except His Wisdom, which says[fn-18-P1802_659898:34-nf] : \"When He was making the heaven and the earth I was present with Him?\" But in the mention of heaven and earth, all created things in heaven and earth are included as well. 7.

If the prophets had not love, and if that is why they were sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal, then how does the Lord send us to their sound, as these writers will have it, as if we could get help from that?

There was a point some way back which we deferred taking up, that, namely, of the motive of John's speeches. We may now take it up. The Saviour, according to Heracleon, calls him both a prophet and Elijah, but he himself denies that he is either of these. When the Saviour, Heracleon says, calls him a prophet and Elijah, He is speaking not of John himself, but of his surroundings; but when He calls him greater than the prophets and than those who are born of women, then He is describing the character of John himself. When John, on the other hand, is asked about himself, his answers relate to himself, not to his surroundings. This we have examined as carefully as possible, comparing each of the terms in question with the statements of Heracleon, lest he should not have expressed himself quite accurately. For how it comes that the statements that he is Elijah and that he is a prophet apply to those about him, but the statement that he is the voice of one crying in the wilderness, to himself, no attempt whatever is made to show Heracleon only gives an illustration, namely, this: His surroundings were, so to speak, his clothes, and other than himself, and when he was asked about his clothes, if he; were his clothes, he could not answer \"Yes.\" Now that his being Elijah, who was to come, was his clothes, is scarcely consistent, so far as I can see, with Heracleon's views; it might consist, perhaps, with the exposition we ourselves gave of the words, \"In the spirit and power of Elijah; \"it might, in a sense, be said that this spirit of Elijah is equivalent to the soul of John. He then goes on to try to determine why those who were sent by the Jews to question John were priests and levites, and he answers by no means badly, that it was incumbent on such persons, being devoted to the service of God, to busy themselves and to make enquiries about such matters. When he goes on, however, to say that it was \"because John was of the levitical tribe, this is less well considered. We raised the question ourselves above, and saw that if the Jews who were sent knew John's birth, it was not open to them to ask if he was Elijah. Then, again, in dealing with the question, \"Art thou the prophet? \"Heracleon does not regard the addition of the article as having any special force, and says, \"They asked him if he were a prophet, wishing to know this more general fact.\" Again, not Heracleon alone, but, so far as I am informed, all those who diverge from our views, as if they had not been able to deal with a trifling ambiguity and to draw the proper distinction, suppose John to be greater than Elijah and than all the prophets. The words are, \"Of those born of women there is none greater than John; \"but this admits of two mean-lugs, that John is greater than they all, or again, that some of them are equal to him.

Behold, then, I find both in the Gospels and in the (writings of the) apostles a visible and an invisible God (revealed to us), under a manifest and personal distinction in the condition of both. There is a certain emphatic saying by John: \"No man hath seen God at any time; \"[fn-105-P10594_2976311:172-nf] meaning, of course, at any previous time But he has indeed taken away all question of time, by saying that God had never been seen. The apostle confirms this statement; for, speaking of God, he says, \"Whom no man hath seen, nor can see; \"[fn-105-P10595_2976569:173-nf] because the man indeed would die who should see Him.[fn-105-P10596_2976644:174-nf] But the very same apostles testify that they had both seen and \"handled\" Christ.[fn-105-P10597_2976777:175-nf] Now, if Christ is Himself both the Father and the Son, how can He be both the Visible and the Invisible? In order, however, to reconcile this diversity between the Visible and the Invisible, will not some one on the other side argue that the two statements are quite correct: that He was visible indeed in the flesh, but was invisible before His appearance in the flesh; so that He who as the Father was invisible before the flesh, is the same as the Son who was visible in the flesh? If, however, He is the same who was invisible before the incarnation, how comes it that He was actually seen in ancient times before (coming in) the flesh? And by parity of reasoning, if He is the same who was visible after (coming in) the flesh, how happens it that He is now declared to be invisible by the apostles? How, I repeat, can all this be, unless it be that He is one, who anciently was visible only in mystery and enigma, and became more clearly visible by His incarnation, even the Word who was also made flesh; whilst He is another whom no man has seen at any time, being none else than the Father, even Him to whom the Word belongs? Let us, in short, examine who it is whom the apostles saw. \"That,\" says John, \"which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.\"[fn-105-P10598_2978120:176-nf] Now the Word of life became flesh, and was heard, and was seen, and was handled, because He was flesh who, before He came in the flesh, was the \"Word in the beginning with God\" the Father,[fn-105-P10599_2978329:177-nf] and not the Father with the Word. For although the Word was God, yet was He with God, because He is God of God; and being joined to the Father, is with the Father.[fn-106-P10600_2978514:178-nf] \"And we have seen His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father; \"[fn-106-P10601_2978630:179-nf] that is, of course, (the glory) of the Son, even Him who was visible, and was glorified by the invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the Word of God was God, in order that he might give no help to the presumption of the adversary, (which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself and in order to draw a distinction between the invisible Father and the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, ex abundanti as it were: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-106-P10602_2979142:180-nf] What God does he mean? The Word? But he has already said: \"Him we have seen and heard, and our hands have handled the Word of life.\" Well, (I must again ask, ) what God does he mean? It is of course the Father, with whom was the Word, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and has Himself declared Him.[fn-106-P10603_2979484:181-nf] He was both heard and seen and, that He might not be supposed to be a phantom, was actually handled. Him, too, did Paul behold; but yet he saw not the Father. \"Have I not,\" he says, \"seen Jesus Christ our Lord? \"[fn-106-P10604_2979716:182-nf] Moreover, he expressly called Christ God, saying: \"Of whom are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-106-P10605_2979902:183-nf] He shows us also that the Son of God, which is the Word of God, is visible, because He who became flesh was called Christ. Of the Father, however, he says to Timothy: \"Whom none among men hath seen, nor indeed can see; \"and he accumulates the description in still ampler terms: \"Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto.\"[fn-106-P10606_2980285:184-nf] It was of Him, too, that he had said in a previous passage: \"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to the only God; \"[fn-106-P10607_2980435:185-nf] so that we might apply even the contrary qualities to the Son Himself-mortality, accessibility-of whom the apostle testifies that \"He died according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-106-P10608_2980625:186-nf] and that \"He was seen by himself last of all,\"[fn-106-P10609_2980693:187-nf] -by means, of course, of the light which was accessible, although it was not without imperilling his sight that he experienced that light.[fn-106-P10610_2980847:188-nf] A like danger to which also befell Peter, and John, and James, (who confronted not the same light) without risking the loss of their reason and mind; and if they, who were unable to endure the glory of the Son,[fn-106-P10611_2981080:189-nf] had only seen the Father, they must have died then and there: \"For no man shall see God, and live.\"[fn-106-P10612_2981214:190-nf] This being the case, it is evident that He was always seen from the beginning, who became visible in the end; and that He, (on the contrary, ) was not seen in the end who had never been visible from the beginning; and that accordingly there are two-the Visible and the Invisible. It was the Son, therefore, who was always seen, and the Son who always conversed with men, and the Son who has always worked by the authority and will of the Father; because \"the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do\"[fn-106-P10613_2981760:191-nf] -\"do\" that is, in His mind and thought.[fn-106-P10614_2981819:192-nf] For the Father acts by mind and thought; whilst the Son, who is in the Father's mind and thought,[fn-106-P10615_2981934:193-nf] gives effect and form to what He sees. Thus all things were made by tile Son, and without Him was not anything made.[fn-106-P10616_2982167:194-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But you must not suppose that only the works which relate to the (creation of the) world were made by the Son, but also whatsoever since that time has been done by God.

Whence it is written, \"From the beginning the Word was with God, and the Word was God; \"[fn-106-P10621_2982873:196-nf] to whom \"is given by the Father all power in heaven and on earth.\"[fn-106-P10622_2982958:197-nf] \"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son\"[fn-106-P10623_2983054:198-nf] -from the very beginning even. For when He speaks of all power and all judgment, and says that all things were made by Him, and all things have been delivered into His hand, He allows no exception (in respect) of time, because they would not be all things unless they were the things of all time. It is the Son, therefore, who has been from the beginning administering judgment, throwing down the haughty tower, and dividing the tongues, punishing the whole world by the violence of waters, raining upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone, as the Lord from the Lord. For He it was who at all times came down to hold converse with men, from Adam on to the patriarchs and the prophets, in vision, in dream, in mirror, in dark saying; ever from the beginning laying the foundation of the course of His dispensations, which He meant to follow out to the very last. Thus was He ever learning even as God to converse with men upon earth, being no other than the Word which was to be made flesh. But He was thus learning (or rehearsing), in order to level for us the way of faith, that we might the more readily believe that the Son of God had come down into the world, if we knew that in times past also something similar had been done.[fn-106-P10624_2984308:199-nf] For as it was on our account and for our learning that these events are described in the Scriptures, so for our sakes also were they done-(even ours, I say), \"upon whom the ends of the world are come.\"[fn-106-P10625_2984562:200-nf] In this way it was that even then He knew full well what human feelings and affections were, intending as He always did to take upon Him man's actual component substances, body and soul, making inquiry of Adam (as if He were ignorant),[fn-106-P10626_2984825:201-nf] \"Where art thou, Adam? \"[fn-106-P10627_2984907:202-nf] -repenting that He had made man, as if He had lacked foresight;[fn-106-P10628_2984991:203-nf] tempting Abraham, as if ignorant of what was in man; offended with persons, and then reconciled to them; and whatever other (weaknesses and imperfections) the heretics lay hold of (in their assumptions) as unworthy of God, in order to discredit the Creator, not considering that these circumstances are suitable enough for the Son, who was one day to experience even human sufferings-hunger and thirst, and tears, and actual birth and real death, and in respect of such a dispensation \"made by the Father a little less than the angels.\"[fn-106-P10629_2985547:204-nf] But the heretics, you may be sure, will not allow that those things are suitable even to the Son of God, which you are imputing to the very Father Himself, when you pretend[fn-106-P10630_2985740:205-nf] that He made Himself less (than the angels) on our account; whereas the Scripture informs us that He who was made less was so affected by another, and not Himself by Himself. What, again, if He was One who was \"crowned with glory and honour,\" and He Another by whom He was so crowned,[fn-106-P10631_2986039:206-nf] -the Son, in fact, by the Father? Moreover, how comes it to pass, that the Almighty Invisible God, \"whom no man hath seen nor can see; He who dwelleth in light unapproachable; \"[fn-106-P10632_2986237:207-nf] \"He who dwelleth not in temples made with hands; \"[fn-106-P10633_2986310:208-nf] \"from before whose sight the earth trembles, and the mountains melt like wax; \"[fn-106-P10634_2986412:209-nf] who holdeth the whole world in His hand \"like a nest; \"[fn-106-P10635_2986501:210-nf] \"whose throne is heaven, and earth His footstool; \"[fn-106-P10636_2986572:211-nf] in whom is every place, but Himself is in no place; who is the utmost bound of the universe;-how happens it, I say, that He (who, though) the Most High, should yet have walked in paradise towards the cool of the evening, in quest of Adam; and should have shut up the ark after Noah had entered it; and at Abraham's tent should have refreshed Himself under an oak; and have called to Moses out of the burning bush; and have appeared as \"the fourth\" in the furnace of the Babylonian monarch (although He is there called the Son of man),-unless all these events had happened as an image, as a mirror, as an enigma (of the future incarnation)? Surely even these things could not have been believed even of the Son of God, unless they had been given us in the Scriptures; possibly also they could not have been believed of the Father, even if they had been given in the Scriptures, since these men bring Him down into Mary's womb, and set Him before Pilate's judgment-seat, and bury Him in the sepulchre of Joseph. Hence, therefore, their error becomes manifest; for, being ignorant that the entire order of the divine administration has from the very first had its course through the agency of the Son, they believe that the Father Himself was actually seen, and held converse with men. and worked, and was athirst, and suffered hunger (in spite of the prophet who says: \"The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, shall never thirst at all, nor be hungry; \"[fn-106-P10637_2988074:212-nf] much more, shall neither die at any time, nor be buried!), and therefore that it was uniformly one God, even the Father, who at all times did Himself the things which were really done by Him through the agency of the Son.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":43,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"ANF-03","text":"They more readily supposed that the Father acted in the Son's name, than that the Son acted in the Father's; although the Lord says Himself, \"I am come in my Father's name; \"[fn-106-P10641_2988618:213-nf] and even to the Father He declares, \"I have manifested Thy name unto these men; \"[fn-106-P10642_2988720:214-nf] whilst the Scripture likewise says, \"Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,\"[fn-106-P10643_2988830:215-nf] that is to say, the Son in the Father's name.

When He entered the temple, He called it \"His Father's house,\"[fn-106-P10692_3003666:252-nf] speaking as the Son.

This (divine relationship) Nathanµl at once recognised in Him,[fn-106-P10688_3002807:248-nf] even as Peter did on another occasion: \"Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-106-P10689_3002892:249-nf] And He affirmed Himself that they were quite right in their convictions; for He answered Nathanµl: \"Because I said, I saw thee under the fig-tree, therefore dose thou believe?\"[fn-106-P10690_3003091:250-nf] And in the same manner He pronounced Peter to be \"blessed,\" inasmuch as \"flesh and blood had not revealed it to him\"-that he had perceived the Father-\"but the Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-106-P10691_3003297:251-nf] By asserting all this, He determined the distinction which is between the two Persons: that is, the Son then on earth, whom Peter had confessed to be the Son of God; and the Father in heaven, who had revealed to Peter the discovery which he had made, that Christ was the Son of God. When He entered the temple, He called it \"His Father's house,\"[fn-106-P10692_3003666:252-nf] speaking as the Son. In His address to Nicodemus He says: \"So God loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"[fn-106-P10693_3003884:253-nf] And again: \"For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He that believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.\"[fn-106-P10694_3004192:254-nf] Moreover, when John (the Baptist) was asked what he happened to know of Jesus, he said: \"The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.\"[fn-106-P10695_3004518:255-nf] Whom, indeed, did He reveal to the woman of Samaria? Was it not \"the Messias which is called Christ? \"[fn-106-P10696_3004646:256-nf] And so lie showed, of course, that He was not the Father, but the Son; and elsewhere He is expressly called \"the Christ, the Son of God,\"[fn-106-P10697_3004804:257-nf] and not the Father. He says, therefore,\" My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work; \"[fn-106-P10698_3004938:258-nf] whilst to the Jews He remarks respecting the cure of the impotent man, \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\"[fn-106-P10699_3005071:259-nf] \"My Father and I\"-these are the Son's words. And it was on this very account that \"the Jews sought the more intently to kill Him, not only because He broke the Sabbath, but also because He said that God was His Father, thus making Himself equal with God. Then indeed did He answer and say unto them, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do; for what things soever He doeth these also doeth the Son likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that He Himself doeth; and He will also show Him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son also quickeneth whom He will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son, that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent the Son. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my words, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. Verily I say unto you, that the hour is coming, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and when they have heard it, they shall live. For as the Father hath eternal life in Himself, so also hath He given to the Son to have eternal life in Himself; and He hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man\"[fn-107-P10700_3006548:260-nf] -that is, according to the flesh, even as He is also the Son of God through His Spirit.[fn-107-P10701_3006658:261-nf] Afterwards He goes on to say: \"But I have greater witness than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to finish-those very works bear witness of me that the Father hath sent me. And the Father Himself, which hath sent me, hath also borne witness of me.\"[fn-107-P10702_3006963:262-nf] But He at once adds, \"Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape; \"[fn-107-P10703_3007075:263-nf] thus affirming that in former times it was not the Father, but the Son, who used to be seen and heard. Then He says at last: \"I am come in my Father's name, and ye have not received me.\"[fn-107-P10704_3007278:264-nf] It was therefore always the Son (of whom we read) under the designation of the Almighty and Most High God, and King, and Lord. To those also who inquired \"what they should do to work the works of God,\"[fn-107-P10705_3007496:265-nf] He answered, \"This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.\"[fn-107-P10706_3007598:266-nf] He also declares Himself to be \"the bread which the Father sent from heaven; \"[fn-107-P10707_3007693:267-nf] and adds, that \"all that the Father gave Him should come to Him, and that He Himself would not reject them,[fn-107-P10708_3007817:268-nf] because He had come down from heaven not to do His own will, but the will of the Father; and that the will of the Father was that every one who saw the Son, and believed on Him, should obtain the life (everlasting, ) and the resurrection at the last day. No man indeed was able to come to Him, except the Father attracted him; whereas every one who had heard and learnt of the Father came to Him.\"[fn-107-P10709_3008287:269-nf] He goes on then expressly to say, \"Not that any man hath seen the Father; \"[fn-107-P10710_3008386:270-nf] thus showing us that it was through the Word of the Father that men were instructed and taught. Then, when many departed from Him,[fn-107-P10711_3008534:271-nf] and He turned to the apostles with the inquiry whether \"they also would go away,\"[fn-107-P10712_3008632:272-nf] what was Simon Peter's answer? \"To whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life, and we believe that Thou art the Christ.\"[fn-107-P10713_3008780:273-nf] (Tell me now, did they believe) Him to be the Father, or the Christ of the Father?","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":43,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Again, when Martha in a later passage acknowledged Him to be the Son of God,[fn-107-P10750_3017310:304-nf] she no more made a mistake than Peter[fn-107-P10751_3017368:305-nf] and Nathanµl[fn-107-P10752_3017403:306-nf] had; and yet, even if she had made a mistake, she would at once have learnt the truth: for, behold, when about to raise her brother from the dead, the Lord looked up to heaven, and, addressing the Father, said-as the Son, of course: \"Father, I thank Thee that Thou always hearest me; it is because of these crowds that are standing by that I have spoken to Thee, that they may believe that Thou hast sent me.\"[fn-107-P10753_3017832:307-nf] But in the trouble of His soul, (on a later occasion, ) He said: \"What shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause is it that I am come to this hour; only, O Father, do Thou glorify Thy name\"[fn-107-P10754_3018068:308-nf] -in which He spake as the Son. (At another time) He said: \"I am come in my Father's name.\"[fn-107-P10755_3018185:309-nf] Accordingly, the Son's voice was indeed alone sufficient, (when addressed) to the Father. But, behold, with an abundance (of evidence)[fn-107-P10756_3018339:310-nf] the Father from heaven replies, for the purpose of testifying to the Son: \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.\"[fn-107-P10757_3018510:311-nf] So, again, in that asseveration, \"I have both glorified, and will glorify again,\"[fn-107-P10758_3018614:312-nf] how many Persons do you discover, obstinate Praxeas? Are there not as many as there are voices? You have the Son on earth, you have the Father in heaven. Now this is not a separation; it is nothing but the divine dispensation. We know, however, that God is in the bottomless depths, and exists everywhere; but then it is by power and authority. We are also sure that the Son, being indivisible from Him, is everywhere with Him. Nevertheless, in the Economy or Dispensation itself, the Father willed that the Son should be regarded[fn-107-P10759_3019166:313-nf] as on earth, and Himself in heaven; whither the Son also Him. self looked up, and prayed, and made supplication of the Father; whither also He taught us to raise ourselves, and pray, \"Our Father which art in heaven,\" etc.,[fn-107-P10760_3019414:314-nf] -although, indeed, He is everywhere present. This heaven the Father willed to be His own throne; while He made the Son to be \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-107-P10761_3019593:315-nf] by sending Him down to the earth, but meaning at the same time to \"crown Him with glory and honour,\"[fn-107-P10762_3019714:316-nf] even by taking Him back to heaven. This He now made good to Him when He said: \"I have both glorified Thee, and will glorify Thee again.\" The Son offers His request from earth, the Father gives His promise from heaven. Why, then, do you make liars of both the Father and the Son? If either the Father spake from heaven to the Son when He Himself was the Son on earth, or the Son prayed to the Father when He was Himself the Son in heaven, how happens it that the Son made a request of His own very self, by asking it of the Father, since the Son was the Father? Or, on the other hand, how is it that the Father made a promise to Himself, by making it to the Son, since the Father was the Son? Were we even to maintain that they are two separate gods, as you are so fond of throwing out against us, it would be a more tolerable assertion than the maintenance of so versatile and changeful a God as yours! Therefore it was that in the passage before us the Lord declared to the people present: \"Not on my own account has this voice addressed me, but for your sakes,\"[fn-107-P10763_3020795:317-nf] that these likewise may believe both in the Father and in the Son, severally, in their own names and persons and positions. \"Then again, Jesus exclaims, and says, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me; \"[fn-107-P10764_3021052:318-nf] because it is through the Son that men believe in the Father, while the Father also is the authority whence springs belief in the Son. \"And he that seeth me, seeth Him that sent me.\"[fn-107-P10765_3021256:319-nf] How so? Even because, (as He afterwards declares, ) \"I have not spoken from myself, but the Father which sent me: He hath given me a commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.\"[fn-107-P10766_3021462:320-nf] For \"the Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know when I ought to speak\"[fn-107-P10767_3021584:321-nf] the word which I actually speak. \"Even as the Father hath said unto me, so do I speak.\"[fn-107-P10768_3021690:322-nf] Now, in what way these things were said to Him, the evangelist and beloved disciple John knew better than Praxeas; and therefore he adds concerning i his own meaning: \"Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God, and was going to God.\"[fn-107-P10769_3022035:323-nf] Praxeas, however, would have it that it was the Father who proceeded forth from Himself, and had returned to Himself; so that what the devil put into the heart of Judas was the betrayal, not of the Son, but of the Father Himself. But for the matter of that, things have not turned out well either for the devil or the heretic; because, even in the Son's case, the treason which the devil wrought against Him contributed nothing to his advantage. It was, then, the Son of God, who was in the Son of man, that was betrayed, as the Scripture says afterwards: \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.\"[fn-107-P10770_3022679:324-nf] Who is here meant by \"God? \"Certainly not the Father, but the Word of the Father, who was in the Son of man-that is in the flesh, in which Jesus had been already glorified by the divine power and word. \"And God,\" says He, \"shall also glorify Him in Himself; \"[fn-107-P10771_3022955:325-nf] that is to say, the Father shall glorify the Son, because He has Him within Himself; and even though prostrated to the earth, and put to death, He would soon glorify Him by His resurrection, and making Him conqueror over death.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"84","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But there were some who even then did not understand. For Thomas, who was so long incredulous, said: \"Lord, we know not whither Thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye would have known the Father also: but henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.\"[fn-107-P10775_3023721:326-nf] And now we come to Philip, who, roused with the expectation of seeing the Father, and not understanding in what sense he was to take \"seeing the Father,\" says: \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\"[fn-107-P10776_3023946:327-nf] Then the Lord answered him: \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? \"[fn-107-P10777_3024067:328-nf] Now whom does He say that they ought to have known?-for this is the sole point of discussion. Was it as the Father that they ought to have known Him, or as the Son? If it was as the Father, Praxeas must tell us how Christ, who had been so long time with them, could have possibly ever been (I will not say understood, but even) supposed to have been the Father. He is clearly defined to us in all Scriptures-in the Old Testament as the Christ of God, in the New Testament as the Son of God. In this character was He anciently predicted, in this was He also declared even by Christ Himself; nay, by the very Father also, who openly confesses Him from heaven as His Son, and as His Son glorifies Him. \"This is my beloved Son; \"\"I have glorified Him, and I will glorify Him.\" In this character, too, was He believed on by His disciples, and rejected by the Jews. It was, moreover, in this character that He wished to be accepted by them whenever He named the Father, and gave preference to the Father, and honoured the Father. This, then, being the case, it was not the Father whom, after His lengthened intercourse with them, they were ignorant of, but it was the Son; and accordingly the Lord, while upbraiding Philip for not knowing Himself who was the object of their ignorance, wished Himself to be acknowledged indeed as that Being whom He had reproached them for being ignorant of after so long a time-in a word, as the Son. And now it may be seen in what sense it was said, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father,\"[fn-107-P10778_3025606:329-nf] -even in the same in which it was said in a previous passage, \"I and my Father are one.\"[fn-107-P10779_3025715:330-nf] Wherefore? Because \"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world\"[fn-107-P10780_3025812:331-nf] and, \"I am the way: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me; \"[fn-107-P10781_3025897:332-nf] and, \"No man can come to me, except the Father draw him; \"[fn-107-P10782_3025976:333-nf] and, \"All things are delivered unto me by the Father; \"[fn-107-P10783_3026052:334-nf] and, \"As the Father quickeneth (the dead), so also doth the Son; \"[fn-107-P10784_3026140:335-nf] and again, \"If ye had known me, ye would have known the Father also.\"[fn-107-P10785_3026229:336-nf] For in all these passages He had shown Himself to be the Father's Commissioner,[fn-107-P10786_3026329:337-nf] through whose agency even the Father could be seen in His works, and heard in His words, and recognised in the Son's administration of the Father's words and deeds. The Father indeed was invisible, as Philip had learnt in the law, and ought at the moment to have remembered: \"No man shall see God, and live.\"[fn-107-P10787_3026655:338-nf] So he is reproved for desiring to see the Father, as if He were a visible Being, and is taught that He only becomes visible in the Son from His mighty works, and not in the manifestation of His person. If, indeed, He meant the Father to be understood as the same with the Son, by saying, \"He who seeth me seeth the Father,\" how is it that He adds immediately afterwards, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? \"[fn-107-P10788_3027118:339-nf] He ought rather to have said: \"Believest thou not that I am the Father? \"With what view else did He so emphatically dwell on this point, if it Were not to clear up that which He wished men to understand-namely, that He was the Son? And then, again, by saying, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me,\"[fn-107-P10789_3027467:340-nf] He laid the greater stress on His question on this very account, that He should not, because He had said, \"He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father,\" be supposed to be the Father; because He had never wished Himself to be so regarded, having always professed Himself to be the Son, and to have come from the Father. And then He also set the conjunction of the two Persons in the clearest light, in order that no wish might be entertained of seeing the Father as if He were separately visible, and that the Son might be regarded as the representative of the Father. And yet He omitted not to explain how the Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. \"The words,\" says He, \"which I speak unto you, are not mine,\"[fn-107-P10790_3028208:341-nf] because indeed they were the Father's words; \"but the Father that dwelleth in me, He doeth the works.\"[fn-107-P10791_3028332:342-nf] It is therefore by His mighty works, and by the words of His doctrine, that the Father who dwells in the Son makes Himself visible-even by those words and works whereby He abides in Him, and also by Him in whom He abides; the special properties of Both the Persons being apparent from this very circumstance, that He says, \"I am in the Father, and the Father is in me.\"[fn-107-P10792_3028719:343-nf] Accordingly He adds: \"Believe-\" What? That I am the Father? I do not find that it is so written, but rather, \"that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for my works' sake; \"[fn-107-P10793_3028934:344-nf] meaning those works by which the Father manifested Himself to be in the Son, not indeed to the sight of man, but to his intelligence.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":46,"source_code":"npnf2_13_npnf2_13_33_on_our_lord_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF2-13","text":"32. For, lo! the power of our cars and eyes is in us and is formed in us in its natural manner; and yet our sight and hearing cannot stand before mighty thunderings and lightnings; first, because they come with vehemence; and secondly, because their potency suddenly surprises and astounds our feebleness. This is what happened to Paul. For the potency of the light suddenly surprised his feeble eyes and injured them. But the greatness of the voice brought low his strength and entered his ears and opened them. For they had been closed up by Jewish contentiousness as by wax. For the voice did not plough up the ears, as the light injured the eyeballs. Why? but because it was meet that he should hear, but not that he should see. Therefore the doors of hearing were opened by the voice as by a key: but the doors of sight were shut by the light that should open them. Why then was it meet that he should hear? Clearly because by that voice our Lord was able to reveal Himself as being persecuted by Saul. For He was not able to show Himself by sight as being persecuted; for there was no way whereby this should be, that the son of David should he seen fleeing and Saul pursuing after Him.[fn-37-P3781_1226434:36-nf] For this happened in very deed with that first Saul and with the first David. The one was pursuing; the other was being persecuted; they both of them saw and were seen, each by the other. But here the ear alone could hear of the persecution of the Son of David; the eye could not see that He was being persecuted. For it was in [the person of] others He was being persecuted, while He was Himself in heaven;-He Who beforetime had been persecuted ill His own person while He was upon earth. Therefore the ears [of Saul] were opened and his eyes were closed. And He Who by sight could not represent Himself before Saul as persecuted, represented Himself by word before him as persecuted; when he cried and said ;-Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me? Accordingly, his eyes were closed, because they could not see the persecution of Christ; but his ears were opened, because they could hear of His persecution. So then although tile eyes of Moses were bodily eyes, as those of Paul, yet his inward eyes were Christian; for Moses wrote of Me.[fn-37-P3782_1227497:37-nf] but the outward eyes of Paul were open, while the inward [eyes] were shut. Then because the inward eyes of Moses shone clear, his outward eyes also were made to shine clearly. But the outward eyes of Paul were closed, that by the closing of those that were outward, there might come to pass the opening of those that were inward. For he who by the outward eyes was not able to see the Lord in His signs, he when those bodily eyes were closed, saw with those within. And because he had received the proof in his own person, he wrote to those who had their bodily eyes full of light;-May He illumine the eyes of your hearts.[fn-37-P3783_1228137:38-nf] Therefore the signs manifested to the external eyes of the Jews, profited them not at all; but faith of the heart opened the eyes of the heart of the Gentiles. But because, had Moses come down in his accustomed aspect from the mountain, without that shining of countenance, and said, \"I saw there the glory of God,\" the faithless fathers would not have believed him; so also, had Paul, without suffering blindness of his eyes, said, \"I heard the voice of Christ,\" the sons who crucified Christ would not have received it as true. Therefore He set on Moses as in love, an excelling sign of splendour, that the deceivers might believe that he had seen the Divine glory; but on Saul, as on a persecutor, He set the hateful sign of blindness, that the liars might believe that he had heard the words of Christ; that so thou might not again speak against Moses, and that these might not doubt concerning Paul. For God set signs on the bodies of the blind, and sent them to those who were in error, who used to make signs upon the borders of their garments. But they remembered not the signs on their garments, and in the signs of the body they greatly erred. The fathers who saw the glory of Moses, did not obey Moses; nor did the sons who saw the blindness of Paul believe Paul. But three times in the desert they threatened to stone Moses and his house with stones as dogs.[fn-37-P3784_1229525:39-nf] For all congregation bade stone them with stones.[fn-37-P3785_1229664:40-nf] And thrice they scourged Paul with rods as a dog on his body.[?][fn-37-P3786_1229747:41-nf] Thrice was I beaten with rods.[fn-37-P3787_1229803:42-nf] These are the lions who through their love for their Lord were beaten as dogs and were torn as flocks of sheep, those flocks that used to stone their guardian shepherds, in order that ravening wolves might rule over them.","title":"On Our Lord.","author":"Ephraim Syrus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_45_book_i_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"ANF-04","text":"12. But wisdom is also called the stainless mirror of the e0ne/rgeia or working of God. We must first understand, then, what the working of the power of God is.

For as the image formed in a mirror unerringly reflects all the acts and movements of him who gazes on it, so would Wisdom have herself to be understood when she is called the stainless mirror of the power and working of the Father: as the Lord Jesus Christ also, who is the Wisdom of God, declares of Himself when He says, \"The works which the Father doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.\"[fn-63-P6324_1151692:53-nf] And again He says, that the Son cannot do anything of Himself, save what He sees the Father do.

Now let us shew briefly, if you will, that these things were foretold by the Prophets. You will yourself, since you are so minded, gather together more from the ample range of the Scriptures. The Prophet Malachi says, \"Behold the Lord Almighty shall come, and who shall abide the day of His coming, or who shall abide the sight of Him? For He doth come as the fire of a furnace and as fuller's soap: and He shall sit, refining and purifying as it were gold and silver.\"[fn-98-P9832_2762094:136-nf] But that thou mayest know more certainly Who this Lord is of Whom these things are said, hear what the Prophet Daniel also foretells: \"I saw,\" saith he, \"in the vision of the night, and, behold, One like the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven, and He came nigh to the Ancient of days, and was brought near before Him; and there was given to Him dominion, and honour, and a kingdom. And all peoples, tribes, and languages shall serve Him. And His dominion is an eternal dominion which shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.\"[fn-98-P9833_2762672:137-nf] By these words we are taught not only of His coming and judgment, but of His dominion and kingdom, that His dominion is eternal, and His kingdom indestructible, without end; as it is said in the Creed,[fn-98-P9834_2762909:138-nf] \"and of His kingdom there shall be no end.\" So that one who says that Christ's kingdom shall one day have an end is very far from the faith. Yet it behoves us to know that the enemy is wont to counterfeit this salutary advent of Christ with cunningfraud in order to deceive the faithful, and in the place of the Son of Man, Who is looked for as coming in the majesty of His Father, to prepare the Son of Perdition with prodigies and lying signs, that instead of Christ he may introduce Antichrist into the world; of whom the Lord Himself warned the Jews beforehand in the Gospels, \"Because I am come in My Father's Name, and ye received Me not, another will come in his own name, and him ye will receive.\"[fn-98-P9835_2763858:139-nf] And again, \"When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, standing in the holy place, let him that readeth understand.\"[fn-98-P9836_2764033:140-nf] Daniel, therefore, in his visions speaks very fully and amply of the coming of that delusion: but it is not worth while to cite instances, for we have enlarged enough already; we therefore refer any one who may wish to know more concerning these matters to the visions themselves. The Apostle also himself says, \"Let no than deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the Son of Perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above everything that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as though himself were God.\"[fn-98-P9837_2764710:141-nf] And soon afterwards, \"Then shall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders.\"[fn-98-P9838_2765013:142-nf] And again, shortly afterwards, \"And therefore the Lord shall send unto them strong delusion, that they may believe a lie, that all may be judged who have not believed the truth.\"[fn-98-P9839_2765232:143-nf] For this reason, therefore, is this \"delusion\" foretold unto us by the words of Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles, lest any one should mistake the coming of Antichrist for the coming of Christ. But as the Lord Himself says, \"When they shall say unto you, lo, here is Christ, or lo, He is there, believe it not. For many false Christs and false prophets shall come and shall seduce many.\" But let us see how He hath pointed out the judgment of the true Christ: \"As the lightning shineth from the east unto the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be.\"[fn-98-P9840_2765813:144-nf] When, therefore, the true Lord Jesus Christ shall come, He will sit and set up his throne of judgment. As also He says in the Gospel, \"He shall separate the sheep from the goats,\"[fn-98-P9841_2766032:145-nf] that is, the righteous from the unrighteous; as the Apostle writes, \"We must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every man may receive the awards due to the body, according as he hath done, whether they be good or evil.\"[fn-98-P9842_2766290:146-nf] Moreover, the judgment will be not only for deeds, but for thoughts also, as the same Apostle saith, \"Their thoughts mutually accusing or else excusing One another, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men.\"[fn-98-P9843_2766529:147-nf] But on these points let this suffice.

Either, therefore, He is before every creature, that He may be the first-born of every creature, and He is not man only, because man is after every creature; or He is man only, and He is after every creature. And how is He the first-born of every creature, except because being that Word which is before every creature; and therefore, the first-born of every creature, He becomes flesh and dwells in us, that is, assumes that man's nature which is after every creature, and so dwells with him and in him, in us, that neither is humanity taken away from Christ, nor His divinity denied? For if He is only before every creature, humanity is taken away from Him; but if He is only man, the divinity which is before every creature is interfered with. Both of these, therefore, are leagued together in Christ, and both are conjoined, and both are linked with one another. And rightly, as there is in Him something which excels the creature, the agreement of the divinity and the humanity seems to be pledged in Him: for which reason He who is declared as made the \"Mediator between God and man\"[fn-103-P10329_3240515:175-nf] is revealed to have associated in Himself God and man.

Who, therefore, is He that thus put off and put on the flesh? Let the heretics seek out. For we know that the Word of God was invested with the substance of flesh, and that He again was divested of the same bodily material, which again He took up in the resurrection and resumed as a garment. And yet Christ could neither have been divested of nor invested with manhood, had He been only man: for man is never either deprived of nor invested with himself. For that must be something else, whatever it may be, which by any other is either taken away or put on. Whence, reasonably, it was the Word of God who put off the flesh, and again in the resurrection put it on, since He put it off because at His birth He had been invested with it. Therefore in Christ it is God who is invested, and moreover must be divested, because He who is invested must also likewise be He who is divested; whereas, as man, He is invested with and divested of, as it were, a certain tunic of the compacted body.[fn-103-P10331_3241913:177-nf] And therefore by consequence He was, as we have said, the Word of God, who is revealed to be at one time invested, at another time divested of the flesh.

For again and again, and frequently, he objects that it was said, \"Have I been so long time with you, and do ye not know me, Philip? He who hath seen me, hath seen the Father also.\"[fn-103-P10395_3272821:220-nf] But let him learn what he does not understand. Philip is reproved, and rightly, and deservedly indeed, because he has said, \"Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\"[fn-103-P10396_3273015:221-nf] For when had he either heard from Christ, or learnt that Christ was the Father? although, on the other hand, he had frequently heard, and had often learned, rather that He was the Son, not that He was the Father. For what the Lord said, \"If ye have known me, ye have known my Father also: and henceforth ye have known Him, and have seen Him,\"[fn-103-P10397_3273379:222-nf] He said not as wishing to be understood Himself to be the Father, but implying that he who thoroughly, and fully, and with all faith and all religiousness, drew near to the Son of God, by all means shall attain, through the Son Himself, in whom he thus believes, to the Father, and shall see Him. \"For no one,\" says He, \"can come to the Father, but by me.\"[fn-103-P10398_3273757:223-nf] And therefore he shall not only come to God the Father, and shall know the Father Himself; but, moreover, he ought thus to hold, and so to presume in mind and heart, that he has henceforth not only known, but seen the Father. For often the divine Scripture announces things that are not yet done as being done, because thus they shall be; and things which by all means have to happen, it does not predict as if they were future, but narrates as if they were done. And thus, although Christ had not been born as yet in the times of Isaiah the prophet, he said, \"For unto us a child is born; \"[fn-103-P10399_3274371:224-nf] and although Mary had not yet been approached, he said, \"' And I approached unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.\"[fn-104-P10400_3274524:225-nf] And when Christ had not yet made known the mind of the Father, it is said, \"And His name shall be called the Angel of Great Counsel.\"[fn-104-P10401_3274680:226-nf] And when He had not yet suffered, he declared, \"He is as a sheep led to the slaughter.\"[fn-104-P10402_3274820:227-nf] And although the cross had never yet existed, He said, \"All day long have I stretched out my hands to an unbelieving people.\"[fn-104-P10403_3274968:228-nf] And although not yet had He been scornfully given to drink, the Scripture says, \"In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.\"[fn-104-P10404_3275115:229-nf] And although He had not yet been stripped, He said, \"Upon my vesture they did cast lots, and they numbered my bones: they pierced my hands and my feet.\"[fn-104-P10405_3275290:230-nf] For the divine Scripture, foreseeing, speaks of things which it knows shall be as being already done, and speaks of things as perfected which it regards as future, but which shall come to pass without any doubt. And thus the Lord in the present passage said, \"Henceforth ye have known and have seen Him.\" Now He said that the Father should be seen by whomsoever had followed the Son, not as if the Son Himself should be the Father seen, but that whosoever was willing to follow Him, and be His disciple, should obtain the reward of being able to see the Father. For He also is the image of God the Father; so that it is added, moreover, to these things, that \"as the Father worketh, so also the Son worketh.\"[fn-104-P10406_3276024:231-nf] And the Son is an imitator[fn-104-P10407_3276071:232-nf] of all the Father's works, so that every one may regard it just as if he saw the Father, when he sees Him who always imitates the invisible Father in all His works. But if Christ is the Father Himself, in what manner does He immediately add, and say, \"Whosoever believeth in me, the works that I do he shall do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father?[fn-104-P10408_3276496:233-nf] And He further subjoins, \"If ye love me, keep my commandments; and I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter.\"[fn-104-P10409_3276649:234-nf] After which also He adds this: \"If any one loveth me, he shall keep my word: and my Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and will make our abode with him.\"[fn-104-P10410_3276842:235-nf] Moreover, also, He added this too: \"But the Advocate, that Holy Spirit whom the Father will send, He will teach you, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\"[fn-104-P10411_3277057:236-nf] He utters, further, that passage when He shows Himself to be the Son, and reasonably subjoins, and says, \"If ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.\"[fn-104-P10412_3277283:237-nf] But what shall we say when He also continues in these words: \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit He purgeth, that it may bring forth more fruit? \"[fn-104-P10413_3277564:238-nf] Still He persists, and adds: \"As the Father hath loved me, so also have I loved you: remain in my love. If ye have kept my commandments, ye shall remain in my love; even as I have kept the Father's commandments, and remain in His love.\"[fn-104-P10414_3277821:239-nf] Further, He says in addition: \"But I have called you friends; for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.\"[fn-104-P10415_3277983:240-nf] Moreover, He adds to all this: \"But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not Him that sent me.\"[fn-104-P10416_3278141:241-nf] These things then, after the former, evidently attesting Him to be not the Father but the Son, the Lord would never have added, if He had had it in mind, either that He was the Father, or wished Himself to be understood as the Father, except that He might declare this, that every man ought henceforth to consider, in seeing the image of God the Father through the Son, that it was as if he saw the Father; since every one believing on the Son may be exercised in the contemplation of the likeness, so that, being accustomed to seeing the divinity in likeness, he may go forward, and grow even to the perfect contemplation of God the Father Almighty. And since he who has imbibed this truth into his mind and soul, and has believed of all things that thus it shall be, he shall even now see, as it were, in some measure the Father whom he will see hereafter; and he may so regard it, as if he actually held, what he knows for certain that he shall one day hold. But if Christ Himself had been the Father, why did He promise as future, a reward which He had already granted and given? For that He says, \"Blessed are they of a pure heart, for they shall see God,\"[fn-104-P10417_3279325:242-nf] it is understood to promise the contemplation and vision of the Father; therefore He had not given this; for why should He promise if He had already given? For He had given if He was the Father: for He was seen, and He was touched, But since, when Christ Himself is seen and touched, He still promises, and says that he who is of a pure heart shall see God, He proves by this very saying that He who was then present was not the Father, seeing that He was seen, and yet promised that whoever should be of a pure heart should see the Father. It was therefore not the Father, but the Son, who promised this, because He who was the Son promised that which had yet to be seen; and His promise would have been superfluous unless He had been the Son. For why did He promise to the pure in heart that they should see the Father, if already they who were then present saw Christ as the Father? But because He was the Son, not the Father, rightly also He was then seen as the Son, because He was the image of God; and the Father, because He is invisible, is promised and pointed out as to be seen by the pure in heart. Let it then be enough to have suggested even these points against that heretic; a few words about many things. For a field which is indeed both wide and expansive would be laid open if we should desire to discuss that heretic more fully; seeing that bereaved, in these two particulars, as it were of his eyes plucked out, he is altogether overcome in the blindness of his doctrine.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_34_sermon_xvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"9.

Sixthly, let it be asserted that it is written, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do.[fn-45-P4530_1426571:39-nf] The solution of this is as follows:-Can and Cannot are not words with only one meaning, but have many meanings. On the one hand they are used sometimes in respect of deficiency of strength, sometimes in respect of time, and sometimes relatively to a certain object; as for instance, A Child cannot be an Athlete, or, A Puppy cannot see, or fight with so and so. Perhaps some day the child will be an athlete, the puppy will see, will fight with that other, though it may still be unable to fight with Any other. Or again, they may be used of that which is Generally true. For instance,-A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid;[fn-45-P4531_1427218:40-nf] while yet it might possibly be hidden by another higher hill being in a line with it. Or in another sense they are used of a thing which is not reasonable; as, Can the Children of the Bridechamber fast while the Bridegroom is with them;[fn-45-P4532_1427473:41-nf] whether He be considered as visible in bodily form (for the time of His sojourning among us was not one of mourning, but of gladness), or, as the Word. For why should they keep a bodily fast who are cleansed by the Word?[fn-45-P4533_1427713:42-nf] Or, again, they are used of that which is contrary to the will; as in, He could do no mighty works there because of their unbelief,[fn-45-P4534_1427862:43-nf] -i.e. of those who should receive them. For since in order to healing there is need of both faith in the patient and power in the Healer,[fn-45-P4535_1428018:44-nf] when one of the two failed the other was impossible. But probably this sense also is to be referred to the head of the unreasonable. For healing is not reasonable in the case of those who would afterwards be injured by unbelief. The sentence The world cannot hate you,[fn-45-P4536_1428427:45-nf] comes under the same head, as does also How can ye, being evil, speak good things?[fn-45-P4537_1428528:46-nf] For in what sense is either impossible, except that it is contrary to the will? There is a somewhat similar meaning in the expressions which imply that a thing impossible by nature is possible to God if He so wills;[fn-45-P4538_1428764:47-nf] as that a man cannot be born a second time,[fn-45-P4539_1428828:48-nf] or that a needle will not let a camel through it.[fn-45-P4540_1428896:49-nf] For what could prevent either of these things happening, if God so willed?","title":"Oration XXX.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_45_oration_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XI.

And as in a dream we fancy that we hear, and that the organs of hearing are actually impressed, and that we see with our eyes-although neither the bodily organs of sight nor hearing are affected, but it is the mind alone which has these sensations-so there is no absurdity in believing that similar things occurred to the prophets, when it is recorded that they witnessed occurrences of a rather wonderful kind, as when they either heard the words of the Lord or beheld the heavens opened. For I do not suppose that the visible heaven was actually opened, and its physical structure divided, in order that Ezekiel might be able to record such an occurrence. Should not, therefore, the same be believed of the Saviour by every intelligent hearer of the Gospels?-although such an occurrence may be a stumbling-block to the simple, who in their simplicity would set the whole world in movement, and split in sunder the compact and mighty body of the whole heavens. But he who examines such matters more profoundly will say, that there being, as the Scripture calls it, a kind of general divine perception which the blessed man alone knows how to discover, according to the saying of Solomon, \"Thou shall find the knowledge of God; \"[fn-78-P7862_1882781:79-nf] and as there are various forms of this perceptive power, such as a faculty of vision which can naturally see things that are better than bodies, among which are ranked the cherubim and seraphim; and a faculty of hearing which can perceive voices which have not their being in the air; and a sense of taste which can make use of living bread that has come down from heaven, and that giveth life unto the world; and so also a sense of smelling, which scents such things as leads Paul to say that he is a sweet savour of Christ unto God;[fn-78-P7863_1883339:80-nf] and a sense of touch, by which John says that he \"handled with his hands of the Word of life; \"[fn-78-P7864_1883459:81-nf] -the blessed prophets having discovered this divine perception, and seeing and hearing in this divine manner, and tasting likewise, and smelling, so to speak, with no sensible organs of perception, and laying hold on the Logos by faith, so that a healing effluence from it comes upon them, saw in this manner what they record as having seen, and heard what they say they heard, and were affected in a similar manner to what they describe when eating the roll of a book that was given them.[fn-78-P7865_1883971:82-nf] And so also Isaac smelled the savour of his son's divine garments,[fn-78-P7866_1884064:83-nf] and added to the spiritual blessing these words: \"See, the savour of my son is as the savour of a full field which the Lord blessed.\"[fn-78-P7867_1884254:84-nf] And similarly to this, and more as a matter to be understood by the mind than to be perceived by the senses, Jesus touched the leper,[fn-78-P7868_1884413:85-nf] to cleanse him, as I think, in a twofold sense,-freeing him not only, as the multitude heard, from the visible leprosy by visible contact, but also from that other leprosy, by His truly divine touch. It is in this way, accordingly, that John testifies when he says, \"I beheld the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon Him. And I knew Him not; but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, Upon whom you will see the Spirit descending, and abiding on Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost And I saw, and bear witness, that this is the Son of God.\"[fn-78-P7869_1885042:86-nf] Now it was to Jesus that the heavens were opened; and on that occasion no one except John is recorded to have seen them opened. But with respect to this opening of the heavens, the Saviour, foretelling to His disciples that it would happen, and that they would see it, says, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heavens opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\"[fn-78-P7870_1885476:87-nf] And so Paul was carried away into the third heaven, having previously seen it opened, since he was a disciple of Jesus. It does not, however, belong to our present object to explain why Paul says, \"Whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not: God knoweth.\"[fn-78-P7871_1885782:88-nf] But I shall add to my argument even those very points which Celsus imagines, viz., that Jesus Himself related the account of the opening of the heavens, and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Him at the Jordan in the form of a dove, although the Scripture does not assert that He said that He saw it. For this great man did not perceive that it was not in keeping with Him who commanded His disciples on the occasion of the vision on the mount, \"Tell what ye have seen to no man, until the Son of man he risen from the dead,\"[fn-78-P7872_1886333:89-nf] to have related to His disciples what was seen and heard by John at the Jordan. For it may be observed as a trait of the character of Jesus, that He on all occasions avoided unnecessary talk about Himself; and on that account said, \"If I speak of Myself, My witness is not true.\"[fn-78-P7873_1886637:90-nf] And since He avoided unnecessary talk about Himself, and preferred to show by acts rather than words that He was the Christ, the Jews for that reason said to Him, \"If Thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.\"[fn-78-P7874_1886860:91-nf] And as it is a Jew who, in the work of Celsus, uses the language to Jesus regarding the appearance of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, \"This is your own testimony, unsupported save by one of those who were sharers of your punishment, whom you adduce,\" it is necessary for us to show him that such a statement is not appropriately placed in the mouth of a Jew. For the Jews do not connect John with Jesus, nor the punishment of John with that of Christ. And by this instance, this man who boasts of universal knowledge is convicted of not knowing what words he ought to ascribe to a Jew engaged in a disputation with Jesus.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_46_book_xii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"And so God, the Creator and Healer of all, knowing that pride is the cause and fountain head of evils, has been careful to heal opposites with opposites, that those things which were ruined by pride might be restored by humility.

For the Son Himself saith of the Father, \"If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.\"[fn-39-P3981_1718798:89-nf] And we say to Him in the Lord's Prayer, \"Our Father, which art in heaven.\"[fn-39-P3982_1718892:90-nf] And amongst the other petitions we ask this, saying, \"Forgive us our debts.\"[fn-39-P3983_1718987:91-nf] And again of Himself He saith, \"That ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins.\"[fn-39-P3984_1719113:92-nf] If then,\" you will say, \"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit forgive sins, why is that impenitence which shall never be forgiven, said to relate only to the blasphemy of the Spirit, as though he who should be bound in this sin of impenitence should seem to resist the gift of the Holy Spirit, because by that gift is wrought the remission of sins?\" Now on this point, I will also ask, Whether Christ only cast out devils, or the Father and the Holy Spirit also? For if Christ only, what means His saying, \"The Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works.\"[fn-39-P3985_1719696:93-nf] For so it is said, \"He doeth the works,\" as if the Son doeth them not, but the Father who dwelleth in the Son. Why then in another place doth He say, \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\"[fn-39-P3986_1719907:94-nf] And a little after, \"For what things soever He doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.\"[fn-39-P3987_1720014:95-nf] But when in another place He says, \"If I had not done amongst them the works which none other man did,\"[fn-39-P3988_1720135:96-nf] He speaks as if He did them alone. Now if these things are so expressed, as that nevertheless the works of the Father and the Son are inseparable, what must we believe of the Holy Spirit, but that He also worketh equally with them? For in that very place, from which this question arose which we are discussing, when the Son was casting out devils, He yet said, \"If I in the Holy Spirit cast out devils, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.\"[fn-39-P3989_1720600:97-nf] ","title":"Sermon XXI.

For if he will adduce any reason worthy of consideration, and point out any purpose worthy of God in conferring such a power on Cleomedes, we will decide on the answer which we ought to give; but if he fail to say anything convincing on the point, clearly because no reason can be discovered, then we shall either speak slightingly of the story to those who have not accepted it, and charge it with being false, or we shall say that some demoniac power, casting a glamour over the eyes, produced, in the case of the Astypalaean, a result like that which is produced by the performers of juggling tricks,[fn-86-P8684_2199728:112-nf] while Celsus thinks that with respect to him he has spoken like an oracle, when he said that \"by some divine arrangement he flew away from the ark.\"","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_59_book_ii","source_chapter":24,"source_paragraph":"175","folder":"ANF-01","text":"3.

For that which the artificer, the Word, had omitted to form in the womb, [viz., the blind man's eyes], He then supplied in public, that the works of God might be manifested in him, in order that we might not be seeking out another hand by which man was fashioned, nor another Father; knowing that this hand of God which formed us at the beginning, and which does form us in the womb, has in the last times sought us out who were lost, winning back His own, and taking up the lost sheep upon His shoulders, and with joy restoring it to the fold of life.","title":"Book V.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":43,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_63_book_v_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"143","folder":"ANF-01","text":"4.

But, as if feeling his error, he corrects the words, \"If thou worship any other of the things in the universe,\" by adding, \"We may honour none, however, except those to whom that right has been given by God.\" And we would put to Celsus this question in regard to those who are honoured as gods, as demons, or as heroes: \"Now, sir, can you prove that the right to be honoured has been given to these by God, and that it has not arisen from the ignorance and folly of men who in their wanderings have fallen away from Him to whom alone worship and service are properly due? You said a little ago, O Celsus, that Antinous, the favourite of Adrian, is honoured; but surely you will not say that the right to be worshipped as a god was given to him by the God of the universe? And so of the others, we ask proof that the right to be worshipped was given to them by the Most High God.\" But if the same question is put to us in regard to the worship of Jesus, we will show that the right to be honoured was given to Him by God, \"that all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.\"[fn-112-P11260_3058911:17-nf] For all the prophecies which preceded His birth were preparations for His worship.

Often for their probation, sometimes for their improvement, and in some cases because their sins deserve it. For their probation indeed, as we read that the blessed Abraham and Job and many of the saints endured countless tribulations; or this which is said to the people in Deuteronomy by Moses: \"And thou shalt remember all the way through which the Lord thy God hath brought thee for forty years through the desert, to afflict thee and to prove thee, and that the things that were in thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldst keep His Commandments or no:\"[fn-43-P4327_1597865:37-nf] and this which we find in the Psalms: \"I proved thee at the waters of strife.\"[fn-43-P4328_1597964:38-nf] To Job also: \"Thinkest thou that I have spoken for any other cause than that thou mightest be seen to be righteous?\"[fn-43-P4329_1598108:39-nf] But for improvement, when God chastens his righteous ones for some small and venial sins, or to raise them to a higher state of purity, and delivers them over to various trials, that He may purge away all their unclean thoughts, and, to use the prophet's word, the \"dross,\" which he sees to have collected in their secret parts, and may thus transmit them like pure gold, to the judgment to come, as He allows nothing to remain in them for the fire of judgment to discover when hereafter it searches them with penal torments according to this saying: \"Many are the tribulations of the righteous.\"[fn-43-P4330_1598728:40-nf] And: \"My son, neglect not the discipline of the Lord, neither be thou wearied whilst thou art rebuked by Him. For whom the Lord loveth He chastiseth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. For what son is there whom the father doth not correct? But if ye are without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.\"[fn-43-P4331_1599108:41-nf] And in the Apocalypse: \"Those whom I love, I reprove and chasten.\"[fn-43-P4332_1599195:42-nf] To whom under the figure of Jerusalem the following words are spoken by Jeremiah, in the person of God: \"For I will utterly consume all the nations among which I scattered thee: but I will not utterly consume thee: but I will chastise thee in judgment, that thou mayest not seem to thyself innocent.\"[fn-43-P4333_1599515:43-nf] And for this life-giving cleansing David prays when he says: \"Prove me, O Lord, and try me; turn my reins and my heart.\"[fn-43-P4334_1599655:44-nf] Isaiah also, well knowing the value of this trial, says \"O Lord, correct us but with judgment: not in Thine anger.\"[fn-43-P4335_1599796:45-nf] And again: \"I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, for thou wast angry with me: Thy wrath is turned away, and Thou hast comforted me.\"[fn-43-P4336_1599985:46-nf] But as a punishment for sins, the blows of trial are inflicted, as where the Lord threatens that He will send plagues upon the people of Israel: \"I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground:\"[fn-43-P4337_1600247:47-nf] and \"In vain have I struck your children: they have not received correction.\"[fn-43-P4338_1600347:48-nf] In the Psalms also: \"Many are the scourges of the sinners:\"[fn-43-P4339_1600425:49-nf] and in the gospel: \"Behold thou art made whole: now sin no more, lest a worse thing happen unto thee.\"[fn-43-P4340_1600556:50-nf] We find, it is true, a fourth way also in which we know on the authority of Scripture that some sufferings are brought upon us simply for the manifestation of the glory of God and His works, according to these words of the gospel: \"Neither did this man sin nor his parents, but that the works of God might be manifested in him:\"[fn-43-P4341_1600905:51-nf] and again: \"This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God that the Son of God may be glorified by it.\"[fn-43-P4342_1601040:52-nf] There are also other sorts of vengeance, with which some who have overpassed the bounds of wickedness are smitten in this life, as we read that Dathan and Abiram or Korah were punished, or above all, those of whom the Apostle speaks: \"Wherefore God gave them up to vile passions and a reprobate mind:\"[fn-43-P4343_1601362:53-nf] and this must be counted worse than all other punishments. For of these the Psalmist says: \"They are not in the labours of men; neither shall they be scourged like other men.\"[fn-43-P4344_1601559:54-nf] For theyare not worthy of being healed by the visitation of the Lord which gives life, and by plagues in this world, as \"in despair they have given themselves over to lasciviousness, unto the working of all error unto uncleanness,\"[fn-43-P4345_1601820:55-nf] and as by hardening their hearts, and by growing accustomed and used to sin they have got beyond cleansing in this brief life and punishment in the present world: men, who are thus reproved by the holy word of the prophet: \"I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet you returned not to Me, saith the Lord,\"[fn-43-P4346_1602225:56-nf] and Jeremiah: \"I have killed and destroyed thy people, and yet they are not returned from their ways.\"[fn-43-P4347_1602346:57-nf] And again: \"Thou hast smitten them and they have not grieved: Thou hast bruised them and they refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than the rock, they have refused to return.\"[fn-43-P4348_1602567:58-nf] And the prophet seeing that all the remedies of this life will have been applied in vain for their healing, and already as it were despairing of their life, declares: \"The bellows have failed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are not consumed. Call them reprobate silver, for the Lord hath rejected them.\"[fn-43-P4349_1602924:59-nf] And the Lord thus laments that to no purpose has He applied this salutary cleansing by fire to those who are hardened in their sins, in the person of Jerusalem crusted all over with the rust of her sins, when He says: \"set it empty upon burning coals, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may be melted; and let the filth of it be melted in the midst thereof. Great pains have been taken, and the great rust thereof is not gone out, no not even by fire. Thy uncleanness is execrable: because I desired to cleanse thee, and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness.\"[fn-43-P4350_1603518:60-nf] Wherefore like a skilful physician, who has tried all saving cures, and sees there is no remedy left which can be applied to their disease, the Lord is in a manner overcome by their iniquities and is obliged to desist from that kindly chastisement of His, and so denounces them saying: \"I will no longer be angry with thee, and thy jealousy has departed from thee.\"[fn-43-P4351_1603908:61-nf] But of others, whose heart has not grown hard by continuance in sin, and who do not stand in need of that most severe and (if I may so call it) caustic remedy, but for whose salvation the instruction of the life-giving word is suffi- cient-of them it is said: \"I will improve them by hearing of their suffering.\"[fn-43-P4352_1604242:62-nf] We are well aware that there are other reasons also of the punishment and vengeance whichis inflicted on those who have sinned grievously-not to expiate their crimes, nor wipeout the deserts of their sins, but that the living may be put in fear and amend their lives. And these we plainly see were inflicted on Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and Baasha the son of Ahiah, and Ahab and Jezebel, when the Divine reproof thus declares: \"Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will cut down thy posterity, and will kill of Ahab every male, and him that is shut up and the last in Israel. And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahiah: for that which thou hast done to provoke Me to anger, and for making Israel to sin. The dogs also shall eat Jezebel in the field of Jezreel. If Ahab die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field the birds of the air shall eat him,\"[fn-43-P4353_1605220:63-nf] and this which is threatened as the greatest threat of all: \"Thy dead body shall not be brought to the sepulchre of thy fathers.\"[fn-43-P4354_1605375:64-nf] It was not that this short and momentary punishment would suffice to purge away the blasphemous inventions of him who first made the golden calves and led to the lasting sin of the people, and their wicked separation from the Lord,-or the countless and disgraceful profanities of those others, but it was that by their example the fear of those punishments which they dreaded might fall on others also, who, as they thought little of the future or even disbelieved in it altogether, would only be moved by consideration of things present; and that owing to this proof of His severity they might acknowledge that there is no lack of care for the affairs of men, and for their daily doings, in the majesty of God on high, and so through that which they greatly feared might the more clearly See in God the rewarder of all their deeds. We find, it is true, that even for lighter faults some men have received the same sentence of death in this world, as that with which those men were punished who, as we said before, were the authors of a blasphemous falling away: as happened in the case of the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath,[fn-43-P4355_1606532:65-nf] and in that of Ananias and Sapphira, who through the sin of unbelief kept back some portion of their goods: not that the guilt of their sins was equal, but because they were the firstfound out in a new kind of transgression, and so it was right that as they had given to others an example of sin, so also they should give them an example of punishment and of fear, that anyone, who should attempt to copy them, might know that (even if his punishment were postponed in this life) he would be punished in the same way that they were at the trial of the judgment hereafter. And, since in our desire to run through the different kinds of trials and punishments we seem to have wandered somewhat from our subject, on which we were saying that the perfect man will always remain steadfast in either kind of trial, now let us return to it once more.","title":"VI.

And with what words of laudation, then, shall we describe her virgin-dignity? With what indications and proclamations of praise shall we celebrate her stainless figure? With what spiritual song or word shall we honour her who is most glorious among the angels? She is planted in the house of God like a fruitful olive that the Holy Spirit overshadowed; and by her means are we called sons and heirs of the kingdom of Christ. She is the ever-blooming paradise of incorruptibility, wherein is planted the tree that giveth life, and that furnisheth to all the fruits of immortality. She is the boast and glory of virgins, and the exultation of mothers. She is the sure support of the believing, and the succourer[fn-12-P1203_304004:13-nf] of the pious. She is the vesture of light, and the domicile of virtue.[fn-12-P1204_304104:14-nf] She is the ever-flowing fountain, wherein the water of life sprang and produced the Lord's incarnate manifestation. She is the monument of righteousness; and all who become lovers of her, and set their affections on virgin-like ingenuousness and purity, shall enjoy the grace of angels. All who keep themselves from wine and intoxication, and from the wanton enjoyments of strong drink, shall be made glad with the products of the life-bearing plant. All who have preserved the lamp of virginity unextinguished shall be privileged to receive the amaranthine crown of immortality. All who have possessed themselves of the stainless robe of temperance shall be received into the mystical bride-chamber of righteousness. All who have come nearer the angelic degree than others shall also enter into the more real enjoyment of their Lord's beatitude. All who have possessed the illuminating oil of understanding, and the pure incense of conscience, shall inherit the promise of spiritual favour and the spiritual adoption. All who worthily observe the festival of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary, the mother of God, acquire as their meet recompense the fuller interest in the message, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured!\" It is our duty, therefore, to keep this feast, seeing that it has tilled the whole world with joy and gladness. And let us keep it with psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs. Of old did Israel also keep their festival, but then it was with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, of which the prophet says: \"I will turn their feasts into afflictions and lamentation, and their joy into shame.\"[fn-12-P1205_305734:15-nf] But our afflictions our Lord has assured us He will turn into joy by the fruits of penitence.[fn-12-P1206_305848:16-nf] And again, the first covenant maintained the righteous requirements[fn-12-P1207_305936:17-nf] of a divine service, as in the case of our forefather Abraham; but these stood in the inflictions of pain in the flesh by circumcision, until the time of the fulfilment. \"The law was given to them through Moses\" for their discipline; \"but grace and truth\" have been given to us by Jesus Christ.[fn-12-P1208_306277:18-nf] The beginning of all these blessings to us appeared in the annunciation to Mary, the highly-favoured, in the economy of the Saviour which is worthy of all praise, and in His divine and supra-mundane instruction. Thence rise the rays of the light of understanding upon us. Thence spring for us the fruits of wisdom and immortality, sending forth the clear pure streams of piety. Thence come to us the brilliant splendours of the treasures of divine knowledge. \"For this is life eternal, that we may know the true God, and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent.\"[fn-12-P1209_306848:19-nf] And again, \"Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life.\"[fn-12-P1210_306946:20-nf] For on this account the treasure of the knowledge of God is revealed to them who search the divine oracles. That treasure of the inspired Scriptures the Paraclete has unfolded to us this day. And let the tongue of prophecy and the doctrine of apostles be the treasure of wisdom to us; for without the law and the prophets, or the evangelists and the apostles, it is not possible to have the certain hope of salvation. For by the tongue of the holy prophets and apostles our Lord speaks, and God takes pleasure in the words of the saints; not that He requires the spoken address, but that He delights in the good disposition; not that He receives any profit from men, but that He finds a restful satisfaction in the rightly-affected soul of the righteous. For it is not that Christ is magnified by what we say; but as we receive benefits from Him, we proclaim with grateful mind His beneficence to us; not that we can attain to what is worthy therein, but that we give the meet return to the best of our ability. And when the Gospels or the Epistles, therefore, are read, let not your attention centre on the book or on the reader, but on the God who speaks to you from heaven. For the book is but that which is seen, while Christ is the divine subject spoken of. It brings us then the glad tidings of that economy of the Saviour, which is worthy of all praise, to wit, that, though He was God, He became man through kindness toward man, and did not lay aside, indeed, the dignity which was His from all eternity, but assumed the economy that should work salvation. It brings us the glad tidings of that economy of the Saviour worthy of all praise, to wit, that He sojourned with us as a physician for the sick, who did not heal them with potions, but restored them by the inclination of His philanthropy.","title":"The Second Homily","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_60_letter_xvii_to_eustathia_ambrosia_and_basilissa_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"The meeting with the good and the beloved, and the memorials of the immense love of the Lord for us men, which are shown in your localities, have been the source to me of the most intense joy and gladness. Doubly indeed have these shone upon divinely festal days; both in beholding the saving tokens[fn-43-P4382_2861709:2-nf] of the God who gave us life, and in meeting with souls in whom the tokens of the Lord's grace are to be discerned spiritually in such clearness, that one can believe that Bethlehem and Golgotha, and Olivet, and the scene of the Resurrection are really in the God-containing heart. For when through a good conscience Christ has been formed in any, when any has by dint of godly fear nailed down the promptings of the flesh and become crucified to Christ, when any has rolled away from himself the heavy stone of this world's illusions, and coming forth from the grave of the body has begun to walk as it were in a newness of life, abandoning this low-lying valley of human life, and mounting with a soaring desire to that heavenly country[fn-43-P4383_2863025:3-nf] with all its elevated thoughts, where Christ is, no longer feeling the body's burden, but lifting it by chastity, so that the flesh with cloud-like lightness accompanies the ascending soul-such an one, in my opinion, is to be counted in the number of those famous ones in whom the memorials of the Lord's love for us men are to be seen. When, then, I not only saw with the sense of sight those Sacred Places, but I saw the tokens of places like them, plain in yourselves as well, I was filled with joy so great that the description of its blessing is beyond the power of utterance. But because it is a difficult, not to say an impossible thing for a human being to enjoy unmixed with evil any blessing, therefore something of bitterness was mingled with the sweets I tasted: and by this, after the enjoyment of those blessings, I was saddened in my journey back to my native land, estimating now the truth of the Lord's words, that \"the whole world lieth in wickedness[fn-43-P4384_2864238:4-nf] ,\" so that no single part of the inhabited earth is without its share of degeneracy. For if the spot itself that has received the footprints of the very Life is not clear of the wicked thorns, what are we to think of other places where communion with the Blessing has been inculcated by hearing and preaching alone[fn-43-P4385_2864573:5-nf] .

But there is plainly a reasonable ground and cause[fn-40-P4042_1693286:97-nf] , why such representations as these are given of Him in the Scriptures; and it is because He became man and the Son of man, and took upon Him the form of a servant, which is the human flesh: for `the Word,' says John, `was made flesh[fn-40-P4043_1693538:98-nf] .' And since He became man, no one ought to be offended at such expressions; for it is proper to man to be created, and born, and formed, to suffer toil and pain, to die and to rise again from the dead.

These last are in error either concerning the body or the incarnation of the Lord, falsifying the truth, some in one way and some in another, or else they deny that the Lord has sojourned here at all, as the Jews erroneously suppose. But this one alone more madly than the rest has dared to assail the very Godhead, and to assert that the Word is not at all, and that the Father was not always a father; so that one might reasonably say that that Psalm was written against them; `The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God[fn-40-P4049_1695745:104-nf] .

And this too we can prove by the instances of calls in the gospels. For He chose Andrew and Peter and the rest of the apostles by the free compassion of His grace when they were thinking nothing of their healing and salvation. Zacchaeus, when in his faithfulness he was struggling to see the Lord, and making up for his littleness of stature by the height of the sycamore tree, He not only received, but actually honoured by the blessing of His dwelling with him. Paul even against his will and resisting He drew to Him. Another He charged to cleave to Him so closely that when he asked for the shortest possible delay in order to bury his father He did not grant it. To Cornelius when constantly attending to prayers and alms the way of salvation was shown by way of recompense, and by the visitation of an angel he was bidden to summon Peter, and learn from him the words of salvation, whereby he might be saved with all his. And so the manifold wisdom of God grants with manifold and inscrutable kindness salvation to men; and imparts to each one according to his capacity the grace of His bounty, so that He wills to grant His healing not according to the uniform power of His Majesty but according to the measure of the faith in which He finds each one, or as He Himself has imparted it to each one. For when one believed that for the cure of his leprosy the will of Christ alone was sufficient He healed him by the simple consent of His will, saying: \"I will, be thou clean.\"[fn-54-P5400_1935913:99-nf] When another prayed that He would come and raise his dead daughter by laying His hands on her, He entered his house as he had hoped, and granted what was asked of Him.

To some, when asked, He bestowed remedies for their diseases. To others He afforded the means of healing unasked: others He urged on to hope, saying: \"Willest thou to be made whole?\"[fn-54-P5403_1936737:102-nf] to others when they were without hope He brought help spontaneously. The desires of some He searched out before satisfying their wants, saying: \"What will ye that I should do for you?\"[fn-54-P5404_1936943:103-nf] To another who knew not the way to obtain what he desired, He showed it in His kindness, saying: \"If thou believest thou shalt see the glory of God.\"[fn-54-P5405_1937117:104-nf] Among some so richly did He pour forth the mighty works of His cures that of them the Evangelist says' \"And He healed all their sick.\"[fn-54-P5406_1937276:105-nf] But among others the unfathomable depth of Christ's beneficence was so stopped up, that it was said: \"And Jesus could do there no mighty works because of their unbelief.\"[fn-54-P5407_1937472:106-nf] And so the bounty of God is actually shaped according to the capacity of man's faith, so that to one it is said:\" According to thy faith be it unto thee:\"[fn-54-P5408_1937652:107-nf] and toanother: \"Go thy way, and as thou hast believed so be it unto thee;\"[fn-54-P5409_1937751:108-nf] to another \"Be it unto thee according as thou wilt,\"[fn-54-P5410_1937830:109-nf] and again to another: \"Thy faith hath made thee whole.\"[fn-54-P5411_1937910:110-nf] ","title":"XIII.

And this, as we remember, happened in the case of the ruler in the gospel, who, as he believed that it was an easier thing for his son to be cured when sick than to be raised when dead, implored the Lord to come at once, saying: \"Lord, come down ere my child die;\" and though Christ reproved his lack of faith with these words: \"Except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe,\" yet He did not manifest the grace of His Divinity in proportion to the weakness of his faith, nor did He expell the deadly disease of the fever by His bodily presence, as the man believed he would, but by the word of His power, saying: \"Go thy way, thy son liveth.\"[fn-54-P5416_1939153:111-nf] And we read also that the Lord poured forth this superabundance of grace in the case of the cure of the paralytic, when, though he only asked for the healing of the weakness by which his body was enervated, He first brought health to the soul by sating: \"Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven thee.\" After which, when the scribes did not believe that He could forgive men's sins, in order to confound their incredulity, He set free by the power of His word the man's limb, and put an end to his disease of paralysis, by saying: \"Why think ye evil in. your hearts? Whether is easier to say, thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, arise and walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, then saith He to the sick of the palsy: Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.\"[fn-54-P5417_1939997:112-nf] And in the same way in the case of the man who had been lying for thirty-eight years near the edge of the pool, and hoping for a cure from the moving of the water, He showed the princely character of His bounty unasked. For when in His wish to arouse him for the saving remedy, He had said to him: \"wiliest thou to be made whole,\" and when the man complained of his lack of human assistance and said: \"I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled,\" the Lord in His pity granted pardon to his unbelief and ignorance, and restored him to his former health, not in the way which he expected, but in the way which He Himself willed, saying: \"Arise, take up thy bed and go unto thine house.\"[fn-54-P5418_1940729:113-nf] And what wonder if these acts are told of the Lord's power, when Divine grace has actually wrought similar works by means of His servants! For when Peter and John were entering the temple, when the man who was lame from his mother's womb and had no idea how to walk, asked an alms, they gave him not the miserable coppers which the sick man asked for, but the power to walk, and when he was only expecting the smallest of gifts to console him, enriched him with the prize of unlooked for health, as Peter said: \"Silver and gold have I none: but such as I have, give I unto thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.\"[fn-54-P5419_1941391:114-nf] ","title":"XIII.

Now you need to be reminded whence this discourse arose, by reason of what precedes this passage, where the Lord had cured a certain man among those who were lying in the five porches of that pool of Solomon, and to whom He had said, \"Take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.\" But this He had done on the Sabbath; and hence the Jews, being troubled, were falsely accusing Him as a destroyer and transgressor of the law. He then said to them, \"My Father worketh even until now, and I work.\"[fn-10-P1042_620104:1-nf] For they, taking the observance of the Sabbath in a carnal sense, fancied that God had, as it were, slept after the labor of framing the world even to this day; and that therefore He had sanctified that day, from which He began to rest as from labor. Now, to our fathers of old there was ordained a sacrament of the Sabbath,[fn-10-P1043_620444:2-nf] which we Christians observe spiritually, in abstaining from every servile work, that is, from every sin (for the Lord saith, \"Every one that committeth sin is the servant of sin\"), and in having rest in our heart, that is, spiritual tranquillity. And although in this life we strive after this rests yet not until we have departed this life shall we attain to that perfect rest. But the reason why God is said to have rested is, that He made no creature after all was finished. Moreover, the Scripture called it rest, to admonish us that after good works we shall rest. For thus we have it written in Genesis, \"And God made all things very good, and God rested on the seventh day,\" in order that thou, O man, considering that God Himself is said to have rested after good works, shouldest not expect rest for thyself, until after thou hast wrought good works; and even as God after He made man in His own image and likeness, and in him finished all His works very good, rested on the seventh day, so mayest thou also not expect rest to thyself, except thou return to that likeness in which thou wast made, which likeness thou hast lost by sinning. For, in reality, God cannot be said to have toiled, who \"said, and they were done.\" Who is there that, after such facility of work, desires to rest as if after labor? If He commanded and some one resisted Him, if He commanded and it was not done, and labored that it might be done, then justly He should be said to have rested after labor. But when in that same book of Genesis we read, \"God said, Let there be light, and there was light; God said, Let there be a firmament, and the firmament was made,[fn-10-P1044_622109:3-nf] and all the rest were made immediately at His word: to which also the psalm testifies, saying, \"He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created,\"[fn-10-P1045_622293:4-nf] -how could He require rest after the world was made, as if to enjoy leisure after toil, He who in commanding never toiled? Consequently these sayings are mystical, and are laid down in this wise that we may be looking for rest after this life, provided we have done good works. Accordingly, the Lord, restraining the impudence and refuting the error of the Jews, and showing them that they did not think rightly of God, says to them, when they were offended at His working men's healing on the Sabbath, \"My Father worketh until now, and I work:\" do not therefore suppose that my Father so rested on the Sabbath, that thenceforth He doth not work; but even as He now worketh, so I also work. But as the Father without toil, so too the Son without toil. God \"said, and they were done;\" Christ said to the impotent man, \"Take up thy bed, and go unto thy house,\" and it was done.","title":"Tractate XX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_25_tractate_xx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. Behold, then, we have now heard the Gospel, where He answered the Jews who were indignant \"that He not only broke the Sabbath, but said also that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.[fn-10-P1050_626158:7-nf] For so it is written in the foregoing paragraph. When, therefore, the Son of God, the Truth, made answer to their erring indignation, saith He, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son cannot of Himself do anything, but what He seeth the Father doing;\" as if He said, \"Why are ye offended because I have said that God is my Father, and that I make myself equal with God? I am equal in that wise that He begat me; I am equal in that wise that He is not from me, but I from Him.\" For this is implied in these words: \"The Son cannot do anything of Himself, but what He seeth the Father doing.\" That is, whatever the Son hath to do, the doing it He hath of the Father. Why of the Father hath He the doing it? Because of the Father He hath it that He is Son. Why hath He it of the Father to be Son? Because of the Father He hath it that He is able, of the Father that He is. For, to the Son, both to be able and to be is the self-same thing. It is not so with man. Raise your hearts by all means from a comparison of human weakness, that lies far beneath; and should any of us perhaps reach to the secret, and, while awe-struck by the brilliance as it were of a great light, should discern somewhat, and not remain wholly ignorant; yet let him not imagine that he understands the whole, lest he should become proud, and lose what knowledge he has gotten. With man, to be and to be able are different things. For sometimes the man is, and yet cannot what he wills; sometimes, again, the man is in such wise, that he can what he wills; therefore his being and his being able are different things. For if man's esse and posse were the same thing, then he could when he would. But with God it is not so, that His substance to be is one thing, and His power to be able another thing; but whatever is His, and whatever He is, is consubstantial with Him, because He is God: it is not so that in one way He is, in another way is able; He has the esse and the posse together, because He has to will and to do together. Since, then, the power of the Son is of the Father, therefore also the substance of the Son is of the Father; and since the substance of the Son is of the Father, therefore the power of the Son is of the Father. In the Son, power and substance are not different: the power is the self-same that the substance is; the substance to be, the power to be able. Accordingly, because the Son is of the Father, He said, \"The Son cannot of Himself do anything.\" Because He is not Son from Himself, therefore He is not able from Himself.","title":"Tractate XX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_73_homily_lxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Thou mayest not say, \"While I am coming, another steppeth down before me.\"[fn-66-P6602_2022133:34-nf] For if it be thy will to go down into the fountain, there is none to hinder thee.

If they have confidence in their own positions, they should stand to them, and not change about so variously[fn-55-P5507_2179219:183-nf] ; but this they will not, from an idea that success is easy, if they do but shelter their heresy under colour of the word `unoriginate.'

For if we say that the Father has power and mastery over all things by the Word, and the Son rules the Father's kingdom, and has the power of all, as His Word, and as the Image of the Father, it is quite plain that neither here is the Son reckoned among that all, nor is God called Almighty and Lord with reference to Him, but to those things which through the Son come to be, and over which He exercises power and mastery through the Word. And therefore the Unoriginate is specified not by contrast to the Son, but to the things which through the Son come to be. And excellently: since God is not as things originated, but is their Creator and Framer through the Son. And as the word `Unoriginate' is specified relatively to things originated, so the word `Father' is indicative of the Son. And he who names God Maker and Framer and Unoriginate, regards and apprehends things created and made; and he who calls God Father, thereby conceives and contemplates the Son. And hence one might marvel at the obstinacy which is added to their irreligion, that, whereas the term `unoriginate' has the aforesaid good sense, and admits of being used religiously[fn-55-P5509_2181331:185-nf] , they, in their own heresy, bring it forth for the dishonour of the Son, not having read that he who honoureth the Son honoureth the Father, and he who dishonoureth the Son, dishonoureth the Father[fn-55-P5510_2181551:186-nf] . If they had any concern at all[fn-55-P5511_2181603:187-nf] for reverent speaking and the honour due to the Father, it became them rather, and this were better and higher, to acknowledge and call God Father, than to give Him this name. For, in calling God unoriginate, they are, as I said before, calling Him from His works, and as Maker only and Framer, supposing that hence they may signify that the Word is a work after their own pleasure. But that he who calls God Father, signifies Him from the Son being well aware that if there be a Son, of necessity through that Son all things originate were created. And they, when they call Him Unoriginate, name Him only from His works, and know not the Son any more than the Greeks; but he who calls God Father, names Him from the Word; and knowing the Word he acknowledges Him to be Framer of all, and understands that through Him all things have been made.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":5,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"12.

But if the whole earth hymns the Framer and the Truth, and blesses, and fears it, and its Framer is the Word, and He Himself says, `I am the Truth[fn-59-P5951_2374846:123-nf] ,' it follows that the Word is not a creature, but alone proper to the Father, in whom all things are disposed, and He is celebrated by all, as Framer; for `I was by Him disposing[fn-59-P5952_2375046:124-nf] ;' and `My Father worketh hitherto, and I work[fn-59-P5953_2375121:125-nf] .' And the word `hitherto' shews His eternal existence in the Father as the Word; for it is proper to the Word to work the Father's works and not to be external to Him.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"29. For if the power of framing accrues to anyone from teaching, these insensate men are ascribing jealousy and weakness[fn-60-P6015_2400713:173-nf] to God;-jealousy, in that He has not taught many how to frame, so that there may be around Him, as Archangels and Angels many, so framers many; and weakness, in that He could not make by Himself, but needed a fellow-worker, or under-worker; and that, though it has been already shewn that created nature admits of being made by God alone, since they consider the Son to be of such a nature and so made. But God is deficient in nothing: perish the thought! for He has said Himself, `I am full[fn-60-P6016_2401219:174-nf] .' Nor did the Word become Framer of all from teaching; but being the Image and Wisdom of the Father, He does the things of the Father. Nor hath He made the Son for the making of things created; for behold, though the Son exists, still[fn-60-P6017_2401473:175-nf] the Father is seen to work, as the Lord Himself says, `My Father worketh hitherto and I work[fn-60-P6018_2401613:176-nf] .' If however, as you say, the Son came into being for the purpose of making the things after Him, and yet the Father is seen to work even after the Son, you must hold even in this light the making of such a Son to be superfluous. Besides, why, when He would create us, does He seek for a mediator at all, as if His will did not suffice to constitute whatever seemed good to Him? Yet the Scriptures say, `He hath done whatsoever pleased Hires[fn-60-P6019_2402076:177-nf] ,' and `Who hath resisted His will[fn-60-P6020_2402130:178-nf] ?' And if His mere will[fn-60-P6021_2402174:179-nf] is sufficient for the framing of all things, you make the office of a mediator superfluous; for your instance of Moses, and the sun and the moon has been shewn not to hold. And here again is an argument to silence you. You say that God, willing the creation of originated nature, and deliberating concerning it, designs and creates the Son, that through Him He may frame us; now, if so, consider how great an irreligion[fn-60-P6022_2402614:180-nf] you have dared to utter.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":5,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"20","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"7. Now that this is the sense of the Prophet is clear and manifest to all; but since the irreligious men, alleging such passages also, dishonour the Lord and reproach us, saying, `Behold God is said to be One and Only and First; how say ye that the Son is God? for if He were God, He had not said, \"I Alone,\" nor \"God is One[fn-65-P6564_2603403:60-nf] ;\"' it is necessary to declare the sense of these phrases in addition, as far as we can, that all may know from this also that the Arians are really contending with God[fn-65-P6565_2603611:61-nf] . If there then is rivalry of the Son towards the Father, then be such words uttered against Him; and if according to what is said to David concerning Adonijah and Absalom[fn-65-P6566_2603815:62-nf] , so also the Father looks upon the Son, then let Him utter and urge such words against Himself, lest He the Son, calling Himself God, make any to revolt from the Father. But if he who knows the Son, on the contrary, knows the Father, the Son Himself revealing Him to him, and in the Word he shall rather see the Father, as has been said, and if the Son on coming, glorified not Himself but the Father, saying to one who came to Him, `Why callest thou Me good? none is good save One, that is, God[fn-65-P6567_2604347:63-nf] ;' and to one who asked, what was the great commandment in the Law, answering, `Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is One Lords[fn-65-P6568_2604522:64-nf] ;' and saying to the multitudes, `I came down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him that sent Me[fn-65-P6569_2604656:65-nf] ;' and teaching the disciples, `My Father is greater than I,' and `He that honoureth Me, honoureth Him that sent Me[fn-65-P6570_2604804:66-nf] ;' if the Son is such towards His own Father, what is the difficulty[fn-65-P6571_2604909:67-nf] , that one must need take such a view of such passages? and on the other hand, if the Son is the Father's Word, who is so wild, besides these Christ-opposers, as to think that God has thus spoken, as traducing and denying His own Word? This is not the mind of Christians; perish the thought; for not with reference to the Son is it thus written, but for the denial of those falsely called gods, invented by men.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":5,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"16. For if it be not so, but the Word is a creature and a work out of nothing, either He is not True God because He is Himself one of the creatures, or if they name Him God from regard for the Scriptures, they must of necessity say that there are two Gods[fn-66-P6638_2635988:122-nf] , one Creator, the other creature, and must serve two Lords, one Unoriginate, and the other originate and a creature; and must have two faiths, one in the True God, and the other in one who is made and fashioned by themselves and called God. And it follows of necessity in so great blindness, that, when they worship the Unoriginate, they renounce the originate, and when they come to the creature, they turn from the Creator. For they cannot see the One in the Other, because their natures and operations are foreign and distinct[fn-66-P6639_2636972:123-nf] . And with such sentiments, they will certainly be going on to more gods, for this will be the essay[fn-66-P6640_2637091:124-nf] of those who revolt from the One God. Wherefore then, when the Arians have these speculations and views, do they not rank themselves with the Gentiles? for they too, as these, worship the creature rather than God the Creator of all[fn-66-P6641_2637360:125-nf] , and though they shrink from the Gentile name, in order to deceive the unskilful, yet they secretly hold a like sentiment with them. For their subtle saying which they are accustomed to urge, We say not two `Unoriginates[fn-66-P6642_2637896:126-nf] ,' they plainly say to deceive the simple; for in their very professing `We say not two Unoriginates,' they imply two Gods, and these with different natures, one originate and one Unoriginate. And though the Greeks worship one Unoriginate and many originate, but these one Unoriginate and one originate, this is no differ- ence from them; for the God whom they call originate is one out of many, and again the many gods of the Greeks have the same nature with this one, for both he and they are creatures. Unhappy are they, and the more for that their hurt is from thinking against Christ; for they have fallen from the truth, and are greater traitors than the Jews in denying the Christ, and they wallow[fn-66-P6643_2638626:127-nf] with the Gentiles, hateful[fn-66-P6644_2638751:128-nf] as they are to God, worshipping the creature and many deities. For there is One God, and not many, and One is His Word, and not many; for the Word is God, and He alone has the Form[fn-66-P6645_2638975:129-nf] of the Father. Being then such, the Saviour Himself troubled the Jews with these words, `The Father Himself which hath sent Me, hath borne witness of Me; ye have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His Form; and ye have not His Word abiding in you; for whom He hath sent, Him ye believe not[fn-66-P6646_2641125:130-nf] .' Suitably has He joined the `Word' to the `Form,' to shew that the Word of God is Himself Image and Expression and Form of His Father; and that the Jews who did not receive Him who spoke to them, thereby did not receive the Word, which is the Form of God. This too it was that the Patriarch Jacob having seen, received a blessing from Him and the name of Israel instead of Jacob, as divine Scripture witnesses, saying, `And as he passed by the Form of God, the Sun rose upon him[fn-66-P6647_2641625:131-nf] .' And This it was who said, `He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father,' and,`I in the Father and the Father in Me,' and, `I and the Father are one[fn-66-P6648_2641802:132-nf] ;' for thus God is One, and one the faith in the Father and Son; for, though the Word be God, the Lord our God is one Lord; for the Son is proper to that One, and inseparable according to the propriety and peculiarity of His Essence.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"26.

And this scope is to be found throughout inspired Scripture, as the Lord Himself has said, `Search the Scriptures, for they are they which testify of Me[fn-67-P6752_2678144:220-nf] .' But lest I should exceed in writing, by bringing together all the passages on the subject, let it suffice to mention as a specimen, first John saying, `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was made not one thing[fn-67-P6753_2678506:221-nf] ;' next, `And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of one Only-begotten from the Fathers[fn-67-P6754_2678659:222-nf] ;' and next Paul writing, `Who being in the form of God, thought it not a prize to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion like a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross[fn-67-P6755_2678978:223-nf] .' Any one, beginning with these passages and going through the whole of the Scripture upon the interpretation[fn-67-P6756_2679112:224-nf] which they suggest, will perceive how in the beginning the Father said to Him, `Let there be light,' and `Let there be a firmament,' and `Let us make man[fn-67-P6757_2679287:225-nf] ;' but in fulness of the ages, He sent Him into the world, not that He might judge the world, but that the world by Him might be saved, and how it is written `Behold, the Virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call his Name Emmanuel, which, being interpreted, is God with us[fn-67-P6758_2679652:226-nf] .'","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":5,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"35 (continued).

For lest a man, perceiving that the Son has all that the Father hath, from the exact likeness and identity of that He hath, should wander into the irreligion of Sabellius, considering Him to be the Father, therefore He has said `Was given unto Me,' and `I received,' and `Were delivered to Me[fn-68-P6820_2703665:276-nf] ,' only to shew that He is not the Father, but the Father's Word, and the Eternal Son, who because of His likeness to the Father, has eternally what He has from Him, and because He is the Son, has from the Father what He has eternally. Moreover that `Was given' and `Were delivered,' and the like, do not impair[fn-68-P6821_2704013:277-nf] the Godhead of the Son, but rather shew Him to be truly[fn-68-P6822_2704100:278-nf] Son, we may learn from the passages themselves. For if all things are delivered unto Him, first, He is other than that all which He has received; next, being Heir of all things, He alone is the Son and proper according to the Essence of the Father. For if He were one of all, then He were not `heir of all[fn-68-P6823_2704431:279-nf] ,' but every one had received according as the Father willed and gave. But now, as receiving all things, He is other than them all, and alone proper to the Father. Moreover that `Was given' and `Were delivered' do not shew that once He had them not, we may conclude from a similar passage, and in like manner concerning them all; for the Saviour Himself says, `As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself[fn-68-P6824_2704903:280-nf] .' Now from the words `Hath given,' He signifies that He is not the Father; but in saying `so,' He shews the Son's natural likeness and propriety towards the Father. If then once the Father had not, plainly the Son once had not; for as the Father, `so' also the Son has. But if this is irreligious to say, and religious on the contrary to say that the Father had ever, is it not unseemly in themwhen the Son says that, `as' the Father has, `so' also the Son has, to say that He has not `so[fn-68-P6825_2705413:281-nf] ,' but otherwise? Rather then is the Word faithful, and all things which He says that He has received, He has always, yet has from the Father; and the Father indeed not from any, but the Son from the Father. For as in the instance of the radiance, if the radiance itself should say, `All places the light hath given me to enlighten, and I do not enlighten from myself, but as the light wills,' yet, in saying this, it does not imply that it once had not, but it means, `I am proper to the light, and all things of the light are mine;' so, and much more, must we understand in the instance of the Son. For the Father, having given all things to the Son, in the Son still[fn-68-P6826_2706108:282-nf] hath all things; and the Son having, still the Father hath them; for the Son's Godhead is the Father's Godhead, and thus the Father in the Son exercises His Providence[fn-68-P6827_2708323:283-nf] over all things.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":5,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"95","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"66.

Such are their idle words; but they admit of an obvious refutation.","title":"Discourse IV","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":5,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_81_book_iii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"I want you to tell me, you heretic, whether in this passage He who, as the Apostle tells us, speaks in him, is man or God. If He is man, how can another's body speak in his heart? If God, then Christ is not a man but God; for since Christ spoke in the Apostle, and only God could speak in him, therefore a Divine Christ spoke in him. And so you see that there is nothing to be said here, that no division or separation can be made between Christ and God: because complete Divinity was in Christ, and Christ was completely in God. No division or severing of the two can here be admitted. There is only one simple, pious, and sound confession to be made; viz., to adore, love, and worship Christ as God. But do you want to understand more fully and thoroughly that there is no separation to be made between God and Christ, and that we must hold that God is altogether one with Christ? Hear what the Apostle says to the Corinthians: \"For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil.\"[fn-70-P7015_2541517:14-nf] But in another passage, in writing to the Romans he says: \"We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God: for it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.\"[fn-70-P7016_2541766:15-nf] You see then that the judgment seat of God is the same as that of Christ; understand then without any doubt that Christ is God; and when you see that the substance of God and Christ is altogether inseparable, admit also that the Person cannot be severed. Unless forsooth because the Apostle in one Epistle said that we should be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, and in another before that of God, you invent two judgment seats, and fancy that some will be judged by Christ and others by God. But this is foolish and wild, and madder than a madman's utterances. Acknowledge then the Lord of all, the God of the universe, acknowledge the judgment seat of God in the judgment seat of Christ. Love life, love your salvation, love Him by whom you were created. Fear Him by whom you are to be judged. For whether you will or no, you have to be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, and laying aside wicked blasphemy and the childish talk of unbelieving words, though you think that the judgment seat of God is different from that of Christ, you will come before the judgment seat of Christ, and will find by evidence that there is no gainsaying, that the judgment seat of God is indeed the same as that of Christ, and that in Christ the Son of God, there is all the glory of God the Son, and the power of God the Father. \"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men may honour the Son as they honour the Father.\"[fn-70-P7017_2543264:16-nf] For whoever denies the Father denies the Son also. \"Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also.\"[fn-70-P7018_2543444:17-nf] And so you should learn that the glory of the Father and the Son is inseparable, and their majesty is inseparable also and that the Son cannot be honoured without the Father, nor the Father without the Son. But no man can honour God and the Son of God except in Christ the only-begotten Son of God. For it is impossible for a man to have the Spirit of God who is to be honoured except in the Spirit of Christ, as the Apostle says: \"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. But if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.\"[fn-70-P7019_2544055:18-nf] And again: \"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus who died, yea rather who rose again.\"[fn-70-P7020_2544255:19-nf] You see then now, even against your will, that there is absolutely no difference between the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ, or between the judgment of God and the judgment of Christ. Choose then which you will -for one of the two must happen-either acknowledge in faith that Christ is God, or admit that God is in Christ at your condemnation.","title":"Book III.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_48_tractate_xliii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"9. This point may also be solved from the word itself. Thou hast penal judgment spoken of in the Gospel: \"He that believeth not is judged[fn-18-P1833_1154711:12-nf] already;\" and in another place, \"The hour is coming, when those who are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.\"[fn-18-P1834_1154994:13-nf] You see how He has put judgment for condemnation and punishment. And yet if judgment were always to be taken for condemnation, should we ever have heard in the psalm, \"Judge me, O God\"? In the former place, judgment is used in the sense of inflicting pain; here, it is used in the sense of discernment.[fn-18-P1835_1155329:14-nf] How so? Just because so expounded by him who says, \"Judge me, O God.\" For read, and see what follows. What is this \"Judge me, O God,\" but just what he adds, \"and discern[fn-18-P1836_1155699:15-nf] my cause against an unholy nation\"?[fn-18-P1837_1155760:16-nf] Because then it was said, \"Judge me, O God, and discern [the true merits of] my cause against an unholy nation;\" similarly now said the Lord Christ, \"I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.\" How is there \"one that seeketh and judgeth\"? There is the Father, who discerns and distinguishes l between my glory and yours. For ye glory in the spirit of this present world. Not so do I who say to the Father, \"Father, glorify Thou me with that glory which I had with Thee before the world was.\"[fn-18-P1838_1156294:17-nf] What is \"that glory\"? One altogether different from human inflation. Thus doth the Father judge. And so to \"judge\" is to \"discern.\"[fn-18-P1839_1156446:18-nf] And what does He discern? The glory of His Son from the glory of mere men; for to that end is it said, \"God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.\"[fn-18-P1840_1156828:19-nf] For not because He became man is He now to be compared with us. We, as men, are sinful, He is sinless; we, as men, inherit from Adam both death and delinquency, He received from the Virgin mortal flesh, but no iniquity. In fine, neither because we wish it are we born, nor as long as we wish it do we live, nor in the way that we wish it do we die: but He, before He was born, chose of whom He should be born; at His birth He brought about the adoration of the Magi; He grew as an infant, and showed Himself God by His miracles, and surpassed man in His weakness. Lastly, He chose also the manner of His death, that is, to be hung on the cross, and to fasten the cross itself on the foreheads of believers, so that the Christian may say, \"God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.\"[fn-18-P1841_1157662:20-nf] On the very cross, when He pleased, He made His body be taken down, and departed; in the very sepulchre, as long as it pleased Him, He lay; and, when He pleased, He arose as from a bed. So, then, brethren, in respect to His very form as a servant (for who can speak of that other form as it ought to be spoken of, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"?)-in respect, I say, to His very form as a servant, the difference is great between the glory of Christ and the glory of other men.

For actions not done lawfully and piously, are not of advantage, though they may be reputed to be so, but they rather argue hypocrisy in those who venture upon them. Therefore, although such persons feign to offer sacrifices, yet they hear from the Father, `Your whole burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices do not please Me; and although ye bring fine flour, it is vanity, incense also is an abomination unto Me[fn-95-P9555_3442695:9-nf] .' For God does not need anything[fn-95-P9556_3442751:10-nf] ; and, since nothing is unclean to Him, He is full in regard to them, as He testifies, by Isaiah, saying, `I am full[fn-95-P9557_3442884:11-nf] .' Now there was a law given about these things, for the instruction of the people, and to prefigure things to come, for Paul saith to the Galatians; `Before faith came, we were kept guarded under the law, being shut up in the faith which should afterwards be revealed unto us; wherefore the law was our instructor in Christ, that we might be justified by faith[fn-95-P9558_3443411:12-nf] .' But the Jews knew not, neither did they understand, therefore they walked in the daytime as in darkness, feeling for, but not touching, the truth we possess, which [was contained] in the law; conforming to the letter, but not submitting to the spirit. And when Moses was veiled, they looked on him, but turned away their faces from him when he was uncovered. For they knew not what they read, but erroneously substituted one thing for another. The prophet, therefore, cried against them, saying, `Falsehood and faithlessness have prevailed among them.' The Lord also therefore said concerning them, `The strange children have dealt falsely with Me; the strange children have waxen old[fn-95-P9559_3444139:13-nf] .' But how gently does He reprove them, saying, `Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me[fn-95-P9560_3444274:14-nf] .' But being faithless, they went on to deal falsely with the law, affirming things after their own pleasure, but not understanding the Scripture; and, further, as they had hypocritically made a pretence of the plain text of Scripture, and had confidence in this, He is angry with them, saying by Isaiah, `Who hath required these of your hands[fn-95-P9561_3444634:15-nf] ?' And by Jeremiah, since they were very bold, he threatens, `Gather together your whole burnt-offerings with your sacrifices, and eat flesh, for I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices[fn-95-P9562_3444968:16-nf] .' For they did not act as was right, neither was their zeal according to law, but they rather sought their own pleasure in such days, as the prophet accuses them, beating clown their bondsmen, and gathering themselves together for strifes and quarrels, and they smote the lowly with the fist, and did all things that tended to their own gratification. For this cause, they continue without a feast until the end, although they make a display now of eating flesh, out of place and out of season. For, instead of the legally-appointed lamb, they have learned to sacrifice to Baal; instead of the true unleavened bread, `they collect the wood, and their fathers kindle the fire, and their wives prepare the dough, that they may make cakes to the host of heaven, and pour out libations to strange gods, that they may provoke Me to anger, saith the Lord[fn-95-P9563_3445836:17-nf] .' They have the just reward of such devices, since, although they pretend to keep the Passover, yet joy and gladness is taken from their mouth, as saith Jeremiah, `There hath been taken away from the cities of Judah, and the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of those who are glad, and the voice of those who rejoice; the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride[fn-95-P9564_3446227:18-nf] .' Therefore now, `he who among them sacrificeth an ox, is as he who smiteth a man, and he who sacrificeth a lamb is as he who killeth a dog, he that offereth fine flour, is as [if he offered] swine's blood, he that giveth frankincense for a memorial, is as a blasphemer[fn-95-P9565_3446516:19-nf] .'

It was a great miracle that was wrought, dearly beloved, for five thousand men to be filled with five loaves and two fishes, and the remnants of the fragments to fill twelve baskets.

He multiplied the five loaves in the hands of them that brake them, who multiplieth the seeds that grow in the earth, so as that a few grains are sown, and whole barns are filled.

For they wish it to be thought unworthy of belief that God the Son of God placed Himself within a woman's body and subjected His majesty to such a degradation as to be joined to our fleshly nature and be born in the true body of human substance although this is entirely the outcome of His power, not of His ill-treatment, and it is His glorious condescension, not His being polluted that should be believed in. For if yonder visible light is not marred by any of the uncleannesses with which it is encompassed, and the brightness of the sun's rays, which is doubtless a material creature, is not contaminated by any of the dirty or muddy places to which it penetrates, is there anything whatever its quality which could pollute the essence of that eternal and immaterial Light? seeing that by allying Himself to that creature which He had made after His own image He furnished it with purification and received no stain, and healed the wounds of its weakness without suffering loss of power.

For they saw that everything contradicted and made against them and that not only by the New but also by the Old Testament their blasphemous and treacherous folly was confuted. And yet persisting in their mad lies they cease not to disturb the Church of God with their deceits, persuading those miserable creatures whom they can ensnare to deny that man's nature was truly taken by the Lord Jesus Christ; to deny that He was truly crucified for the world's salvation: to deny that from His side wounded by the spear flowed the blood of Redemption and the water of baptism[fn-33-P3301_806080:10-nf] : to deny that He was buried and raised again the third day: to deny that in sight of the disciples He was lifted above all the heights of the skies to take His seat on the right hand of the Father; and in order that when all the truth of the Apostles' Creed was destroyed, there may be nothing to frighten the wicked or inspire the saints with hope, to deny that the living and the dead must be judged by Christ; so that those whom they have robbed of the power of these great mysteries may learn to worship Christ in the sun and moon, and under the name of the Holy Spirit to adore Manichaeus himself, the inventor of all these blasphemies.","title":"Sermon XXXIV.

Listen also to what I have to say on this other expression which has been adduced, viz., \"Christ, who redeemed us from the curse of the law.\"[fn-35-P3544_971877:275-nf] My view of this passage is that Moses, that illustrious servant of God, committed to those who wished to have the right vision,[fn-35-P3545_972026:276-nf] an emblematic[fn-35-P3546_972130:277-nf] law, and also a real law. Thus, to take an example, after God had made the world, and all things that are in it, in the space of six days, He rested on the seventh day from all His works by which statement I do not mean to affirm that He rested because He was fatigued, but that He did so as having brought to its perfection every creature which He had resolved to introduce. And yet in the sequel it, the new law, says: \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\"[fn-35-P3547_973554:278-nf] Does that mean, then, that He is still making heaven, or sun, or man, or animals, or trees, or any such thing? Nay; but the meaning is, that when these visible objects were perfectly finished, He rested from that kind of work; while, however, He still continues to work at objects invisible with an inward mode of action,[fn-35-P3548_973895:279-nf] and saves men. In like manner, then, the legislator desires also that every individual amongst us should be devoted unceasingly to this kind of work, even as God Himself is; and he enjoins us consequently to rest continuously from secular things, and to engage in no worldly sort of work whatsoever; and this is called our Sabbath. This also he added in the law, that nothing senseless[fn-35-P3549_974390:280-nf] should be done but that we should be careful and direct our life in accordance with what is just and righteous. Now this law was suspended over men, discharging most sharply its curse against those who might transgress it. But because its subjects, too, were but men, and because, as happens also frequently I with us, controversies arose and injuries were inflicted, the law likewise at once, and with the severest equity, made any wrong that was done return upon the head of the wrong-doer;[fn-35-P3550_974964:281-nf] so that, for instance, if a poor man was minded to gather a bundle of wood upon the Sabbath, he was placed under the curse of the law, and exposed to the penality of instant death.[fn-35-P3551_975286:282-nf] The men, therefore, who had been brought up with the Egyptians were thus severely pressed by the restrictive power of the law, and they were unable to bear the penalties and the curses of the law. But, again, He who is ever the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ, came and delivered those men from these pains and curses of the law, forgiving them their offences. And He indeed did not deal with them as Moses did, putting the severities of the law in force, and granting indulgence to no man for any offence; but He declared that if any man suffered an injury at the hands of his neighbour, he was to forgive him not once only, nor even twice or thrice, nor only seven times, but even unto seventy times seven;[fn-35-P3552_976014:283-nf] but that, on the other hand, if after all this the offender still continued to do such wrong, he ought then, as the last resource, to be brought under the law of Moses, and that no further pardon should be granted to the man who would thus persist in wrong-doing, even after having been forgiven unto seventy times seven. And He bestowed His forgiveness not only on a transgressor of such a character as that, but even on one who did offence to the Son of man. But if a man dealt thus with the Holy Spirit, He made him subject to two curses,-namely, to that of the law of Moses, and to that of His own law; to the law of Moses in truth in this present life, but to His own law at the time of the judgment: for His word is this: \"It shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.\"[fn-35-P3553_976851:284-nf] There is the law of Moses, thus, that in this world gives pardon to no such person; and there is the law of Christ that punishes in the future world. From this, therefore, mark how He confirms the law, not only not destroying it, but fulfilling it. Thus, then, He redeemed them from that curse of the law which belongs to the present life; and from this fact has come the appellation \"the curse of the law.\" This is the whole account which needs be given of that mode of speech. But, again, why the law is called the \"strength of sin, we shall at once explain in brief to the best of our ability. Now it is written that \"the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners.\"[fn-35-P3554_977606:285-nf] In these times, then, before Moses, there was no written law for transgressors; whence also Pharaoh, not knowing the strength of sin, transgressed in the way of afflicting the children of Israel with unrighteous burdens, and despised the Godhead, not only himself, but also all who were with him. But, not to make any roundabout statement, I shall explain the matter briefly as follows. There were certain persons of the Egyptian race mingling with the people of Moses, when that people was under his rule in the desert; and when Moses had taken his position on the mount, with the purpose of receiving the law, the impatient people, I do not mean those who were the true Israel, but those who had been intermixed with the Egyptians,[fn-35-P3555_978360:286-nf] set up a calf as their god, in accordance with their ancient custom of worshipping idols, with the notion that by such means they might secure themselves against ever having to pay the proper penalties for their iniquities.[fn-35-P3556_979141:287-nf] Thus were they altogether ignorant of the strength of their sin. But when Moses returned (from the mount) and found that out, he issued orders that those men should be put to death with the sword. From that occasion a beginning was made ill the correct perception of the strength of sin on the part of these persons through the instrumentality of the law of Moses, and for that reason the law has been called the \"strength of sin.\"","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":46,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"ANF-06","text":"The receipt of your letter has rejoiced me exceedingly, my dearly beloved friend. I have been given to understand, moreover, that this man, who made his way to me before these days, and sought to introduce a novel kind of knowledge here, different from what is apostolic and ecclesiastical, has also come to you. To that person, indeed, I gave no place: for presently, when we held a disputation together, he was confuted. And I could wish now to transcribe for your behoof all the arguments of which I made use on that occasion, so that by means of these you might get an idea of what that man's faith is. But as that could be done only with leisure at my disposal, I have deemed it requisite, in view of the immediate exigency, to write a short reply to you with reference to what you have written me on the subject of the statements advanced by him. I understand, then, that his chief[fn-37-P3722_1043809:441-nf] effort was directed to prove that the law of Moses is not consonant with the law of Christ; and this position he attempted to found on the authority of our Scriptures. Well, on the other hand, not only did we establish the law of Moses, and all things which are written in it, by the same Scripture; but we also proved that the whole Old Testament agrees with the New Testament, and is in perfect harmony with the same, and that they form really one texture, just as a person may see one and the same robe made up of weft and warp together.[fn-37-P3723_1044417:442-nf] For the truth is simply this, that just as we trace the purple in a robe, so, if we may thus express it, we can discern the New Testament in the texture of the Old Testament; for we see the glory of the Lord mirrored in the same.[fn-37-P3724_1044923:443-nf] We are not therefore to cast aside the mirror,[fn-37-P3725_1045151:444-nf] seeing that it shows us the genuine image of the things themselves, faithfully and truly; but, on the contrary, we ought to honour it all the more. Think you, indeed, that the boy who is brought by his paedagogue to the teachers of learning[fn-37-P3726_1045531:445-nf] when he is yet a very little fellow, ought to hold that paedagogue in no honour[fn-37-P3727_1045827:446-nf] after he has grown up to manhood, simply because he needs his services[fn-37-P3728_1045965:447-nf] no longer, but can make his course without any assistance from that attendant to the schools, and quickly find his way to the lecture-rooms? Or, to take another instance, would it be right for the child who has been nourished on milk at first, after he has grown to be capable of receiving stronger meats, then injuriously to spurn the breasts of his nurse, and conceive a horror of them? Nay, rather he should honour and cherish them, and confess himself a debtor to their good services. We may also make use, if it please you, of another illustration. A certain man on one occasion having noticed an infant exposed on the ground and already suffering excessively, picked it up, and undertook to rear it in his own house until it should reach the age of youth, and sustained all the toils and anxieties which are wont to fall to the lot of those who have to bring up children. After a time, however, it happened that he who was the child's natural father came seeking the boy, and found him with this person who had brought him up.[fn-37-P3729_1047088:448-nf] What ought this boy to do on learning that this is his real father? For I speak, of course, of a boy of the right type. Would he not see to it, that he who had brought him up should be recompensed with liberal gifts; and would he not then follow his natural father, having his proper inheritance in view?[fn-37-P3730_1047553:449-nf] Even so, then, I think we must suppose that that distinguished servant of God, Moses, in a manner something like this, found[fn-37-P3731_1047761:450-nf] a people afflicted by the Egyptians; and he took this people to himself, and nurtured them in the desert like a father, and instructed them like a teacher, and ruled them as a magistrate. This people he also preserved against the coming of him whose people they were. And after a considerable period the father[fn-37-P3732_1048134:451-nf] did come, and did receive, his sheep. Now will not that guardian be honoured in all things by him to whom he delivered that flock; and will he not be glorified by those who have been preserved by him? Who, then, can be so senseless, my dearly beloved Diodorus, as to say that those are aliens to each other who have been allied with each other, who have prophesied in turn for each other, and who have shown signs and wonders which are equal and similar, the one to the other, and of like nature with each other;[fn-37-P3733_1048702:452-nf] or rather, to speak in truth, which belong wholly to the same stock the one with the other? For, indeed, Moses first said to the people: \"A Prophet will the Lord our God raise up unto you, like unto me.\"[fn-37-P3734_1048972:453-nf] And Jesus afterwards said: \"For Moses spake of me.\"[fn-37-P3735_1049048:454-nf] You see[fn-37-P3736_1049075:455-nf] how these twain give the fight hand to each other, although[fn-37-P3737_1049222:456-nf] the one was the prophet and the other was the beloved Son,[fn-37-P3738_1049314:457-nf] and although in the one we are to recognise the faithful servant, but in the other the Lord Himself. Now, on the other hand, I might refer to the fact, that one who of old was minded to make his way to the schools without the paedagogue was not taken in by the master. For the master said: \"I will not receive him unless he accepts the paedagogue.\" And who the person is, who is spoken of under that figure, I shall briefly explain. There was a certain rich man,[fn-37-P3739_1049804:458-nf] who lived after the manner of the Gentiles, and passed his time in great luxury every day; and there was also another man, a poor man, who was his neighbour, and who was unable to procure even his daily bread. It happened that both these men departed this life, that they both descended into the grave,[fn-37-P3740_1050133:459-nf] and that the poor man was conveyed into the place of rest, and so forth, as is known to you. But, furthermore, that rich man had also five brothers, living as he too had lived, and disturbed by no doubt as to lessons which they had learned at home from such a master. The rich man then entreated that these should be instructed in the superior doctrine together and at once.[fn-37-P3741_1050552:460-nf] But Abraham, knowing that they still stood in need of the paedagogue, said to him: \"They have Moses and the prophets.\" For if they received not these, so as to have their course directed by him, i.e., Moses, as by a paedagogue, they would not be capable of accepting the doctrine of the superior master.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":45,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"ANF-06","text":"45. On receipt of this letter, Diodorus made himself master of its contents, and then entered the lists against Manes. This he did too with such spirit, that he was commended greatly by all for the careful and satisfactory demonstration which he gave of the fact that there is a mutual relationship between the two testaments, and also between the two laws.[fn-38-P3829_1075287:544-nf] Discovering also more arguments for himself he was able to bring forward many points of great pertinency and power against the man, and in defence of the truth. He also reasoned in a conclusive manner against his opponent on verbal grounds.[fn-38-P3830_1075555:545-nf] For example, he argued with him in the following manner:-Did you say that the testaments are two? Well, then, say either that there are two old testaments, or that there are two new testaments. For you assert that there are two unbegottens[fn-38-P3831_1075883:546-nf] belonging to the same time, or rather eternity: and if there are in this way two, there should be either two old testaments or two new testaments. If, however, you do not allow this, but affirm, on the contrary, that there is one old testament and that there is also another new restatement, that will only prove again that there is but one author for both; and the very sequence will show that the Old Testament belongs to Him to whom also the New Testament pertains. We may illustrate this by the case of a man who says to some other individual,[fn-38-P3832_1076449:547-nf] Lease me your old house. For by such a mode of address does he not pronounce the man to be alsothe owner of a new house? Or, on the other hand, if he says to him, Show me[fn-38-P3833_1076766:548-nf] your new house; does he not by that very word designate him also as the possessor of an old house? Then, again, this also is to be considered, that since there are two beings, having an unbegotten nature, it is also necessary from that to suppose each of them to have (what must be called) an old testament, and thus there will appear to be two old testaments; if indeed you affirm that both these beings are ancient, and both indeed without a beginning.[fn-38-P3834_1077237:549-nf] But I have not learned doctrine like that; neither do the Scriptures contain it. You, however, who allege that the law of Moses comes from the prince of evil, and not from the good God, tell me who those were who withstood Moses to the face-I mean Jamnes and Mambres?[fn-38-P3835_1077910:550-nf] For, every object that withstands, withstands not itself, but some other one, either better or worse; as Paul also gives us to understand when he writes in the following terms in his second Epistle to Timothy: \"As Jamnes and Mambres withstood Moses, so have these also resisted the truth: men of corrupt mind, reprobate concerning the faith. But they shall proceed no further: for their folly is manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.\"[fn-38-P3836_1078413:551-nf] Do you observe how he compares Jamnes and Mambres to men of corrupt mind, and reprobate concerning the faith.; while he likens Moses, on the other hand, to the truth? But the holy John, the greatest of the evangelists, also tells us of the giving and diffusing of grace for grace;[fn-38-P3837_1078719:552-nf] for he indicates, indeed, that we have received the law of Moses out of the fulness of Christ, and he means that for that one grace this other grace has been made perfect in us through Jesus Christ. It was also to show this to be the case that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself spake in these terms: \"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye hope. For had ye believed Moses, ye would indeed have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?[fn-38-P3838_1079333:553-nf] And besides all these words, there are still many other passages that might be adduced both from the Apostle Paul and from the Gospels, by which we are able to prove that the old law belongs to no other one than that Lord to whom also the new testament appertains, and which it would suit us very well to set forth, and to make use of in a satisfactory manner.[fn-38-P3839_1079716:554-nf] Now, however, the evening prevents us from doing so; for the day is drawing to its close, and it is right that we should now bring our disputation to an end. But an opportunity will be given you to-morrow to put questions to us on any points you are pleased to take up.

But do you bid goodbye to those wine-laden heads, bemuddled by the swelling fumes that mount from their debauch, and from me who am wide awake and from fear of God cannot keep silence. hear what plague is rife among you. Sabellianism is Judaism[fn-50-P5074_1585802:7-nf] imported into the preaching of the Gospel under the guise of Christianity. For if a man calls Father Son and Holy Ghost one thing of many faces,[fn-50-P5075_1586001:8-nf] and makes the hypostasis of the three one,[fn-50-P5076_1586127:9-nf] what is this but to deny the everlasting pre-existence of the Only begotten? He denies too the Lord's sojourn among men in the incarnation,[fn-50-P5077_1586291:10-nf] the going down into hell, the resurrection, the judgment; he denies also the proper operations of the Spirit. And I hear that even rasher innovations than those of the foolish Sabellius are now ventured on among you. It is said, and that on the evidence of ear witnesses, that your clever men go to such an extreme as to say that there is no tradition of the name of the Only-begotten, while of the name of the adversary there is; and at this they are highly delighted and elated, as though it were a discovery of their own. For it is said, \"I came in my Father's name and ye received me not; if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.\"[fn-50-P5078_1586966:11-nf] And because it is said, \"Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,\"[fn-50-P5079_1587136:12-nf] it is obvious, they urge, that the name is one, for it is not \"in the names,\" but \"in the name.\"","title":"Letter CCX","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":5,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_33_letter_xxviii_to_flavian_commonly_called_the_tome_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"Therefore in consequence of this unity of person which is to be understood in both natures[fn-11-P1124_265476:45-nf] , we read of the Son of Man also descending from heaven, when the Son of God took flesh from the Virgin who bore Him. And again the Son of God is said to have been crucified and buried, although it was not actually in His Divinity whereby the Only-begotten is co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father, but in His weak human nature that He suffered these things. And so it is that in the Creed also we all confess that the Only-begotten Son of God was crucified and buried, according to that saying of the Apostle: \"for if they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory[fn-11-P1125_266352:46-nf] .\" But when our Lord and Saviour Himself would instruct His disciples' faith by His questionings, He said, \"Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?\" And when they had put on record the various opinions of other people, He said, \"But ye, whom do ye say that I am?\" Me, that is, who am the Son of Man, and whom ye see in the form of a slave, and in true flesh, whom do ye say that I am? Whereupon blessed Peter, whose divinely inspired confession was destined to profit all nations, said, \"Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God[fn-11-P1126_266906:47-nf] .\" And not undeservedly was he pronounced blessed by the Lord, drawing from the chief corner-stone[fn-11-P1127_267030:48-nf] the solidity of power which his name also expresses, he, who, through the revelation of the Father, confessed Him to be at once Christ and Son of God: because the receiving of the one of these without the other was of no avail to salvation, and it was equally perilous to have believed the Lord Jesus Christ to be either only God without man, or only man without God. But after the Lord's resurrection (which, of course, was of His true body, because He was raised the same as He had died and been buried), what else was effected by the forty days' delay than the cleansing of our faith's purity from all darkness? For to that end He talked with His disciples, and dwelt and ate with them, He allowed Himself to be handled with diligent and curious touch by those who were affected by doubt, He entered when the doors were shut upon the Apostles, and by His breathing upon them gave them the Holy Spirit[fn-11-P1128_268604:49-nf] , and bestowing on them the light of understanding, opened the secrets of the Holy Scriptures[fn-11-P1129_268719:50-nf] . So again He showed the wound in His side, the marks of the nails, and all the signs of His quite recent suffering, saying, \"See My hands and feet, that it is I. Handle Me and see that a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have[fn-11-P1130_268981:51-nf] ;\" in order that the properties of His Divine and human nature might be acknowledged to remain still inseparable: and that we might know the Word not to be different from the flesh, in such a sense as also to confess that the one Son of God iS both the Word and flesh[fn-11-P1131_269263:52-nf] . Of this mystery of the faith[fn-11-P1132_269391:53-nf] your opponent Eutyches must be reckoned to have but little sense if he bus recognized our nature in the Only-begotten of God neither through the humiliation of His having to die, nor through the glory of His rising again. Nor has he any fear of the blessed apostle and evangelist John's declaration when he says, \"every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ to have come in the flesh, is of God: and every spirit which destroys Jesus is not of God, and this is Antichrist[fn-11-P1133_269885:54-nf] .\" But what is \"to destroy Jesus,\" except to take away the human nature from Him, and to render void the mystery, by which alone we were saved, by the most barefaced fictions. The truth is that being in darkness about the nature of Christ's body, he must also be befooled by the same blindness in the matter of His sufferings. For if he does not think the cross of the Lord fictitious, and does not doubt that the punishment He underwent to save the world is likewise true, let him acknowledge the flesh of Him whose death he already believes: and let him not disbelieve Him man with a body like ours, since he acknowledges Him to have been able to suffer: seeing that the denial of His true flesh is also the denial of His bodily suffering. If therefore he receives the Christian faith, and does not turn away his ears from the preaching of the Gospel: let him see what was the nature that hung pierced with nails on the wooden cross, and, when the side of the Crucified was opened by the soldier's spear, let him understand whence it was that blood and water flowed, that the Church of God might be watered from the font and from the cup[fn-11-P1134_271585:55-nf] . Let him hear also the blessed Apostle Peter, proclaiming that the sanctification of the Spirit takes place through the sprinkling of Christ's blood[fn-11-P1135_271924:56-nf] . And let him not read cursorily the same Apostle's words when he says, \"Knowing that not with corruptible things, such as silver and gold, have ye been redeemed from your vain manner of life which is part of your fathers' tradition, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ as of a lamb without spot and blemish[fn-11-P1136_272279:57-nf] .\" Let him not resist too the witness of the blessed Apostle John, who says: \"and the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanseth us from all sin[fn-11-P1137_272439:58-nf] .\" And again: \"this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.\" And \"who is He that overcometh the world save He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God. This is He that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that testifieth, because the Spirit is the truth[fn-11-P1138_272797:59-nf] , because there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the water and the blood, and the three are one[fn-11-P1139_273124:60-nf] .\" The Spirit, that is, of sanctification, and the blood of redemption, and the water of baptism: because the three are one, and remain undivided, and none of them is separated from this connection; because the catholic Church lives and progresses by this faith, so that in Christ Jesus neither the manhood without the true Godhead nor the Godhead without the true manhood is believed in.","title":"Letter XXVIII.

But another passage is also seized by those who are fighting against God to the perversion of their hearers: I mean the words \"The Son can do nothing of Himself.\"[fn-27-P2723_918508:64-nf] To me this saying too seems distinctly declaratory of the Son's being of the same nature as the Father. For if every rational creature is able to do anything of himself, and the inclination which each has to the worse and to the better is in his own power, but the Son can do nothing of Himself, then the Son is not a creature. And if He is not a creature, then He is of one essence and substance with the Father. Again; no creature can do what be likes. But the Son does what He wills in heaven and in earth. Therefore the Son is not a creature. Again; all creatures are either constituted of contraries or receptive of contraries. But the Son is very righteousness, and immaterial.

Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?\"[fn-32-P3295_1079136:38-nf] You might indeed find many remedies for evil in Scripture, many medicines to save from destruction and lead to health; the mysteries of death and resurrection, the sentences of terrible judgment and everlasting punishment; the doctrines of repentance and of remission of sins; all the countless illustrations of conversion, the piece of money, the sheep, the son who wasted his substance with harlots, who was lost and was found, who was dead and alive again. Let us not use these remedies for ill; by these means let us heal our soul. Bethink you of your last day, for you will surely not, unlike all other women, live for ever. The distress, the gasping for breath, the hour of death, the imminent sentence of God, the angels hastening on their way, the soul fearfully dismayed, and lashed to agony by the consciousness of sin, turning itself piteously to things of this life and to the inevitable necessity of that long life to be lived elsewhere. Picture to me, as it rises in your imagination, the conclusion of all human life, when the Son of God shall come in His glory with His angels, \"For he shall come anti shall not keep silence;\"[fn-32-P3296_1080299:39-nf] when He shall come to judge the quick and dead, to render to every one according to his work; when that terrible trumpet with its mighty voice shall wake those that have slept through the ages, and they that have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation.[fn-32-P3297_1080650:40-nf] Remember the vision of Daniel, and bow he brings the judgment before us: \"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head likethe pure wool; ... and His wheels as burning fire.

What then must those men be who have lived wicked lives? Where then shall that soul hide which in the sight of all these spectators shall suddenly be revealed in its fulness of shame? With what kind of body shall it sustain those endless and unbearable pangs in the place of fire unquenched, and of the worm that perishes and never dies, and of depth of Hades, dark and horrible; bitter wailings, loud lamenting, weeping and gnashing of teeth and anguish without end? From all these woes there is no release after death; no device, no means of coming forth from the chastisement of pain.","title":"Letter XLVI","author":"St. Basil"}]
