{"verses":["After these things was a festival day of the Jews:  and Jesus went\nup to Jerusalem.","Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which in\nHebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches.","In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of\nwithered:  waiting for the moving of the water.","And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond\nand the water was moved.  And he that went down first into the pond\nafter the motion of the water was made whole of whatsoever infirmity he\nlay under.","And there was a certain man there that had been eight and thirty\nyears under his infirmity.","Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a\nlong time, he saith to him:  Wilt thou be made whole?","The infirm man answered him:  Sir, I have no man, when the water is\ntroubled, to put me into the pond.  For whilst I am coming, another\ngoeth down before me.","Jesus saith to him:  Arise, take up thy bed and walk.","And immediately the man was made whole:  and he took up his bed and\nwalked.  And it was the sabbath that day.","The Jews therefore said to him that was healed:  It is the\nsabbath.  It is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.","He answered them:  He that made me whole, he said to me:  Take up\nthy bed and walk.","They asked him therefore:  Who is that man who said to thee:  Take\nup thy bed and walk?","But he who was healed knew not who it was:  for Jesus went aside\nfrom the multitude standing in the place.","Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple and saith to him:\nBehold thou art made whole:  sin no more, lest some worse thing happen\nto thee.","The man went his way and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had\nmade him whole.","Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these\nthings on the sabbath.","But Jesus answered them:  My Father worketh until now; and I work.","Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because\nhe did not only break the sabbath but also said God was his Father,\nmaking himself equal to God.","Then Jesus answered and said to them:  Amen, amen, I say unto you,\nthe Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the Father\ndoing:  for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like\nmanner.","For the Father loveth the Son and sheweth him all things which\nhimself doth:  and greater works than these will he shew him, that you\nmay wonder.","For as the Father raiseth up the dead and giveth life:  so the Son\nalso giveth life to whom he will.","For neither does the Father judge any man:  but hath given all\njudgment to the Son.","That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father.  He\nwho honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father who hath sent him.","Amen, amen, I say unto you that he who heareth my word and\nbelieveth him that sent me hath life everlasting:  and cometh not into\njudgment, but is passed from death to life.","Amen, amen, I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is,\nwhen the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God:  and they that\nhear shall live.","For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given to the\nSon also to have life in himself.","And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the Son\nof man.","Wonder not at this:  for the hour cometh wherein all that are in\nthe graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.","And they that have done good things shall come forth unto the\nresurrection of life:  but they that have done evil, unto the\nresurrection of judgment.","I cannot of myself do any thing.  As I hear, so I judge.  And my\njudgment is just:  because I seek not my own will.  but the will of him\nthat sent me.","If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.","There is another that beareth witness of me:  and I know that the\nwitness which he witnesseth of me is true.","You sent to John:  and he gave testimony to the truth.","But I receive not testimony from man:  but I say these things,\nthat you may be saved.","He was a burning and a shining light:  and you were willing for a\ntime to rejoice in his light.","But I have a greater testimony than that of John:  for the works\nwhich the Father hath given me to perfect, the works themselves which I\ndo, give testimony of me, that the Father hath sent me.","And the Father himself who hath sent me hath given testimony of\nme:  neither have you heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.","And you have not his word abiding in you:  for whom he hath sent,\nhim you believe not.","Search the scriptures:  for you think in them to have life\neverlasting.  And the same are they that give testimony of me.","And you will not come to me that you may have life.","I receive not glory from men.","But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.","I am come in the name of my Father, and you receive me not:  if\nanother shall come in his own name, him you will receive.","How can you believe, who receive glory one from another:  and the\nglory which is from God alone, you do not seek?","Think not that I will accuse you to the Father.  There is one that\naccuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust.","For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe me also:\nfor he wrote of me.","But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my\nwords?"]}
