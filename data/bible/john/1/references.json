But if any one wonders that God could be produced from God by a putting forth of the voice and breath, if he is acquainted with the sacred utterances of the prophets he will cease to wonder.

But herein is declared, not only that He is God, but also that He is of the same substance with the Father; because, after saying, \"And the Word was God,\" it is said also, \"The same was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made.\"[fn-2-P217_73757:27-nf] Not simply \"all things;\" but only all things that were made, that is; the whole creature.

In these and like testimonies of the divine Scriptures, by free use of which, as I have said, our predecessors exploded such sophistries or errors of the heretics, the unity and equality of the Trinity are intimated to our faith. But because, on account of the incarnation of the Word of God for the working out of our salvation, that the man Christ Jesus might be the Mediator between God and men,[fn-2-P247_86430:50-nf] many things are so said in the sacred books as to signify, or even most expressly declare, the Father to be greater than the Son; men have erred through a want of careful examination or consideration of the whole tenor of the Scriptures, and have endeavored to transfer those things which are said of Jesus Christ according to the flesh, to that substance of His which was eternal before the incarnation, and is eternal. They say, for instance, that the Son is less than the Father, because it is written that the Lord Himself said, \"My Father is greater than I.\"[fn-2-P248_87013:51-nf] But the truth shows that after the same sense the Son is less also than Himself; for how was He not made less also than Himself, who \"emptied[fn-2-P249_87175:52-nf] Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant?\" For He did not so take the form of a servant as that He should lose the form of God, in which He was equal to the Father. If, then, the form of a servant was so taken that the form of God was not lost, since both in the form of a servant and in the form of God He Himself is the same only-begotten Son of God the Father, in the form of God equal to the Father, in the form of a servant the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; is there any one who cannot perceive that He Himself in the form of God is also greater than Himself, but yet likewise in the form of a servant less than Himself? And not, therefore, without cause the Scripture says both the one and the other, both that the Son is equal to the Father, and that the Father is greater than the Son. For there is no confusion when the former is understood as on account of the form of God, and the latter as on account of the form of a servant. And, in truth, this rule for clearing the question through all the sacred Scripturesis set forth in one chapter of an epistle of the Apostle Paul, where this distinction is commended to us plainly enough. For he says, \"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and was found in fashion[fn-2-P250_88580:53-nf] as a man.\"[fn-2-P251_88604:54-nf] The Son of God, then, is equal to God the Father in nature, but less in \"fashion.\"[fn-2-P252_88708:55-nf] For in the form of a servant which He took He is less than the Father; but in the form of God, in which also He was before He took the form of a servant, He is equal to the Father. In the form of God He is the Word, \"by whom all things are made;\"[fn-2-P253_88968:56-nf] but in the form of a servant He was \"made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.\"[fn-2-P254_89099:57-nf] In like manner, in the form of God He made man; in the form of a servant He was made man. For if the Father alone had made man without the Son, it would not have been written, \"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.\"[fn-2-P255_89347:58-nf] Therefore, because the form of God took the form of a servant, both is God and both is man; but both God, on account of God who takes; and both man, on account of man whois taken.

For both the Son and the Holy Spirit, according to the form of God, are equal to the Father, because neither of them is a creature, as we have already shown: but according to the form of a servant He is less than the Father, because He Himself has said, \"My Father is greater than I;\"[fn-3-P327_117822:113-nf] and He is less than Himself, because it is said of Him, He emptied Himself;\"[fn-3-P328_117921:114-nf] and He is less than the Holy Spirit, because He Himself says, \"Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven Him.\"[fn-3-P329_118158:115-nf] And in the Spirit too He wrought miracles, saying: \"But if I with the Spirit of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.\"[fn-3-P330_118327:116-nf] And in Isaiah He says,-in the lesson which He Himself read in the synagogue, and showed without a scruple of doubt to be fulfilled concerning Himself,-\"The Spirit of the Lord God,\" He says, \"is upon me: because He hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek He hath sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives,\"[fn-3-P331_118671:117-nf] etc.: for the doing of which things He therefore declares Himself to be \"sent,\" because the Spirit of God is upon Him. According to the form of God, all things were made by Him;[fn-3-P332_118886:118-nf] according to the form of a servant, He was Himself made of a woman, made under the law.[fn-3-P333_118992:119-nf] According to the form of God, He and the Father are one;[fn-3-P334_119068:120-nf] according to the form of a servant, He came not to do His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him.[fn-3-P335_119191:121-nf] According to the form of God, \"As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself;\"[fn-3-P336_119332:122-nf] according to the form of a servant, His \"soul is sorrowful even unto death;\" and, \"O my Father,\" He says, \"if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.\"[fn-3-P337_119843:123-nf] According to the form of God, \"He is the True God, and eternal life;\"[fn-3-P338_119941:124-nf] according to the form of a servant, \"He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\"[fn-3-P339_120060:125-nf] -23. According to the form of God, all things that the Father hath are His,[fn-3-P340_120156:126-nf] and \"All mine,\" He says, \"are Thine, and Thine are mine;\"[fn-3-P341_120236:127-nf] according to the form of a servant, the doctrine is not His own, but His that sent Him.[fn-3-P342_120346:128-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_06_tractate_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"6.

But being proved wrong so far, men betake themselves to saying, that he who sends is greater than he who is sent: therefore the Father is greater than the Son, because the Son continually speaks of Himself as being sent by the Father; and the Father is also greater than the Holy Spirit, because Jesus has said of the Spirit, \"Whom the Father will send in my name;\"[fn-4-P469_168231:17-nf] and the Holy Spirit is less than both, because both the Father sends Him, as we have said, and the Son, when He says, \"But if I depart, I will send Him unto you.\" I first ask, then, in this inquiry, whence and whither the Son was sent. \"I,\" He says, \"came forth from the Father, and am come into the world.\"[fn-4-P470_168558:18-nf] Therefore, to be sent, is to come forth forth from the Father, and to come into the world. What, then, is that which the same evangelist says concerning Him, \"He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not;\" and then he adds, \"He came unto His own?\"[fn-4-P471_168862:19-nf] Certainly He was sent thither, whither He came; but if He was sent into the world, because He came forth from the Father, then He both came into the world and was in the world. He was sent therefore thither, where He already was. For consider that, too, which is written in the prophet, that God said, \"Do not I fill heaven . and earth?\"[fn-4-P472_169221:20-nf] If this is said of the Son (for some will have it understood that the Son Himself spoke either by the prophets or in the prophets), whither was He sent except to the place where He already was? For He who says, \"I fill heaven and earth,\" was everywhere. But if it is said of the Father, where could He be without His own word and without His own wisdom, which \"reacheth from one end to another mightily, and sweetly ordereth all things?\"[fn-4-P473_169680:21-nf] But He cannot be anywhere without His own Spirit. Therefore, if God is everywhere, His Spirit also is everywhere. Therefore, the Holy Spirit, too, was sent thither, where He already was. For he, too, who finds no place to which he might go from the presence of God, and who says, \"If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there; if I shall go down into hell, behold, Thou art there;\" wishing it to be understood that God is present everywhere, named in the previous verse His Spirit; for He says,\" Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?\"[fn-4-P474_170274:22-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"9. Perhaps some one may wish to drive us to say, that the Son is sent also by Himself, because the conception and childbirth of Mary is the working of the Trinity, by whose act of creating all things are created. And how, he will go on to say, has the Father sent Him, if He sent Himself? To whom I answer first, by asking him to tell me, if he can, in what manner the Father hath sanctified Him, if He hath sanctified Himself? For the same Lord says both; \"Say ye of Him,\" He says, \"whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God;\"[fn-4-P482_172618:28-nf] while in another place He says, \"And for their sake I sanctify myself.\"[fn-4-P483_172707:29-nf] I ask, also, in what manner the Father delivered Him, if He delivered Himself? For the Apostle Paul says both: \"Who,\" he says, \"spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all;\"[fn-4-P484_172913:30-nf] while elsewhere he says of the Saviour Himself, \"Who loved me, and delivered Himself for me.\"[fn-4-P485_173027:31-nf] He will reply, I suppose, if he has a right sense in these things, Because the will of the Father and the Son is one, and their working indivisible. In like manner, then, let him understand the incarnation and nativity of the Virgin, wherein the Son is understood as sent, to have been wrought by one and the same operation of the Father and of the Son indivisibly; the Holy Spirit certainly not being thence excluded, of whom it is expressly said, \"She was found with child by the Holy Ghost.\" For perhaps our meaning will be more plainly unfolded, if we ask in what manner God sent His Son. He commanded that He should come, and He, complying with the commandment, came. Did He then request, or did He only suggest? But whichever of these it was, certainly it was done by a word, and the Word of God is the Son of God Himself. Wherefore, since the Father sent Him by a word, His being sent was the work of both the Father and His Word; therefore the same Son was sent by the Father and the Son, because the Son Himself is the Word of the Father. For who would embrace so impious an opinion as to think the Father to have uttered a word in time, in order thatthe eternal Son might thereby be sent and might appear in the flesh in the fullness oftime? But assuredly it was in that Word of God itself which was in the beginning with God and was God, namely, in the wisdom itself of God, apart from time, at what time that wisdom must needs appear in the flesh. Therefore, since without any commencement of time, the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, it was in the Word itself without any time, at what time the Word was to be made flesh and dwell among us.[fn-4-P486_174743:32-nf] And when this fullness of time had come, \"God sent His Son, made of a woman,\"[fn-4-P487_174844:33-nf] that is, made in time, that the Incarnate Word might appear to men; while it was in that Word Himself, apart from time, at what time this was to be done; for the order of times is in the eternal wisdom of God without time. Since, then, that the Son should appear in the flesh was wrought by both the Father and the Son, it is fitly said that He who appeared in that flesh was sent, and that He who did not appear in it, sent Him; because those things which are transacted outwardly before the bodily eyes have their existence from the inward structure (apparatu) of the spiritual nature, and on that account are filly said to be sent. Further, that form of man which He took is the person of the Son, not also of the Father; on which account the invisible Father, together with the Son, who with the Father is invisible, is said to have sent the same Son by making Him visible. But if He became visible in such way as to cease to be invisible with the Father, that is, if the substance of the invisible Word were turned by a change and transition into a visible creature, then the Son would be so understood to be sent by the Father, that He would be found to be only sent; not also, with the Father, sending. But since He so took the form of a servant, as that the unchangeable form of God remained, it is clear that that which became apparent in the Son was done by the Father and the Son not being apparent; that is, that by the invisible Father, with the invisible Son, the same Son Himself was sent so as to be visible. Why, therefore, does He say, \"Neither came I of myself?\" This, we may now say, is said according to the form of a servant, in the same way as it is said, \"I judge no man.\"[fn-4-P488_176558:34-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"11.

But whosoever saw that dove and that fire, saw them with their eyes. Although it may perhaps be disputed concerning the fire, whether it was seen by the eyes or in the spirit, on account of the form of the sentence. For the text does not say, They saw cloven tongues like fire, but, \"There appeared to them.\" But we are not wont to say with the same meaning, It appeared to me; as we say, I saw. And in those spiritual visions of corporeal images the usual expressions are, both, It appeared to me; and, I saw: but in those things which are shown to the eyes through express corporeal forms, the common expression is not, It appeared to me; but, I saw. There may, therefore, be a question raised respecting that fire, how it was seen; whether within in the spirit as it were outwardly, or really outwardly before the eyes of the flesh. But of that dove, which is said to have descended in a bodily form, no one ever doubted that it was seen by the eyes. Nor, again, as we call the Son a Rock (for it is written, \"And that Rock was Christ\"[fn-5-P503_182093:45-nf] ), can we so call the Spirits dove or fire.

For that rock was a thing already created, and after the mode of its action was called by the name of Christ, whom it signified; like the stone placed under Jacob's head, and also anointed, which he took in order to signify the Lord;[fn-5-P504_182390:46-nf] or as Isaac was Christ, when he carried the wood for the sacrifice of himself.[fn-5-P505_182492:47-nf] A particular significative action was added to those already existing things; they did not, as that dove and fire, suddenly come into being in order simply so to signify. The dove and the fire, indeed, seem to me more like that flame which appeared to Moses in the bush,[fn-5-P506_182782:48-nf] or that pillar which the people followed in the wilderness,[fn-5-P507_182860:49-nf] or the thunders and lightnings which came when the Law was given in the mount.[fn-5-P508_182962:50-nf] For the corporeal form of these things came into being for the very purpose, that it might signify something, and then pass away.[fn-5-P509_183110:51-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"14.

Forsooth, Moses may have seen Him with the eyes of the flesh, if not only the wisdom of God which is Christ, but even that of any man you please and howsoever wise, can be seen with the eyes of the flesh; or if, because it is written of the elders of Israel, that \"they saw the place where the God of Israel had stood,\" and that \"there was under His feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness,\"[fn-5-P583_216807:92-nf] therefore we are to believe that the word and wisdom of God in His own substance stood within the space of an earthly place, who indeed \"reacheth firmly from end to end, and sweetly ordereth all things;\"[fn-5-P584_217030:93-nf] and that the Word of God, by whom all things were made,[fn-5-P585_217106:94-nf] is in such wise changeable, as now to contract, now to expand Himself; (may the Lord cleanse the hearts of His faithful ones from such thoughts!)

God was thought to have appeared by His own substance; whence the Son of God has been believed by these miserable people to be visible not by the creature, but by Himself; and that Moses, entering into the cloud, appeared to have had this very object in entering, that a cloudy darkness indeed might be shown to the eyes of the people, but that Moses within might hear the words of God, as though he beheld His face; and, as it is said, \"And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend;\" and yet, behold, the same Moses says, \"If I have found grace in Thy sight, show me Thyself plainly?\" Assuredly he knew that he saw corporeally, and he sought the true sight of God spiritually.

What else is this but to say that Christ has died in vain? He has indeed died in vain if there are any whom He cannot make alive. When John the Baptist points to Christ and says: \"Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sins[fn-28-P2837_744819:2015-nf] of the world\"[fn-28-P2838_744855:2016-nf] he utters a falsehood if after all there are persons living whose sins Christ has not taken away. For either it must be shewn that they are not of the world whom the grace of Christ thus ignores: or, if it be admitted that they are of the world, we have to choose between the horns of a dilemma. Either they have been delivered from their sins, in which case the power of Christ to save all men is proved; or they remain undelivered and as it were still under the charge of misdoing, in which case Christ is proved to be powerless. But far be it from us to believe of the Almighty that He is powerless in aught.

If all the members of my body were to be converted into tongues, and if each of my limbs were to be gifted with a human voice, I could still do no justice to the virtues of the holy and venerable Paula. Noble in family, she was nobler still in holiness; rich formerly in this world's goods, she is now more distinguished by the poverty that she has embraced for Christ. Of the stock of the Gracchi and descended from the Scipios, the heir and representative of that Paulus whose name she bore, the true and legitimate daughter of that Martia Papyria who was mother to Africanus, she yet preferred Bethlehem to Rome, and left her palace glittering with gold to dwell in a mud cabin.

Not content with assuring her own salvation she has sought yours also, in former days at home and now in the holy places.

But in her despair she lost her composure, and looking back became a monument of an unbelieving soul.[fn-44-P4407_1200148:3117-nf] Yet, as if to make up for the loss of a single woman, Lot's glowing faith set free the whole city of Zoar. In fact when he left the dark valleys in which Sodom lay and came to the mountains, the sun rose upon him as he entered Zoar or the little City; so-called because the little faith that Lot possessed, though unable to save greater places, was at least able to preserve smaller ones. For one who had gone so far astray as to live in Gomorrah could not all at once reach the noonland where Abraham, the friend of God,[fn-44-P4408_1200697:3118-nf] entertained God and His angels.[fn-44-P4409_1200751:3119-nf] (For it was in Egypt that Joseph fed his brothers, and when the bride speaks to the Bridegroom her cry is: \"tell me where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon.\"[fn-44-P4410_1200957:3120-nf] ) Good men have always sorrowed for the sins of others. Samuel of old lamented for Saul[fn-44-P4411_1201066:3121-nf] because he neglected to treat the ulcers of pride with the balm of penitence. And Paul wept for the Corinthians[fn-44-P4412_1201202:3122-nf] who refused to wash out with their tears the stains of fornication. For the same reason Ezekiel swallowed the book where were written within and without song, and lamentation and woe;[fn-44-P4413_1201409:3123-nf] the song in praise of the righteous, the lamentation over the penitent, and the woe for those of whom it is written, \"When the wicked man falleth into the depths of evil, then is he filled with scorn.\"[fn-44-P4414_1201639:3124-nf] It is to these that Isaiah alludes when he says: \"in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen; and killing sheep, eating flesh\" and saying, \"let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\"[fn-44-P4415_1201969:3125-nf] Yet of such persons Ezekiel is bidden to speak thus: \"O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live,\" and again, \"turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?\"[fn-44-P4416_1202467:3126-nf] Nothing makes God so angry as when men from despair of better things cleave to those which are worse; and indeed this despair in itself is a sign of unbelief. One who despairs of salvation can have no expectation of a judgment to come. For if he dreaded such, he would by doing good works prepare to meet his Judge. Let us hear what God says through Jeremiah, \"withhold thy foot from a rough way and thy throat from thirst\"[fn-44-P4417_1202936:3127-nf] and again \"shall they fall, and not arise? Shall he turn away, and not return?\"[fn-44-P4418_1203043:3128-nf] Let us hear also what God says by Isaiah: \"When thou shalt turn and bewail thyself, then shall thou be saved, and then shalt thou know where thou hast hitherto been.\"[fn-44-P4419_1203233:3129-nf] We do not realize the miseries of sickness till returning health reveals them to us. So sins serve as a foil to the blessedness of virtue; and light shines more brightly when it is relieved against darkness. Ezekiel uses language like that of the other prophets because he is animated by a similar spirit. \"Repent,\" he cries, \"and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord.\"[fn-44-P4420_1203902:3130-nf] Wherefore in a subsequent passage he says: \"As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked: but that the wicked turn from his way and live.\"[fn-44-P4421_1204103:3131-nf] These words shew us that the mind must not through disbelief in the promised blessings give way to despair; and that the soul once marked out for perdition must not refuse to apply remedies on the ground that its wounds are past curing. Ezekiel describes God as swearing, that if we refuse to believe His promise in regard to our salvation we may at least believe His oath. It is with full confidence that the righteous man prays and says, \"Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease,\"[fn-44-P4422_1204647:3132-nf] and again, \"Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.\"[fn-44-P4423_1204792:3133-nf] He means to say, \"when I forsook the foulness of my faults for the beauty of virtue, God strengthened my weakness with His grace.\" Lo, I hear. His promise: \"I will pursue mine enemies and overtake them: neither will I turn again till they are consumed,\"[fn-44-P4424_1205067:3134-nf] so that I who was once thine enemy and a fugitive from thee, shall be laid hold of by thine hand. Cease not from pursuing me till my wickedness is consumed, and I return to my old husband who will give me my wool and my flax, my oil and my fine flour and will feed me with the richest foods.[fn-44-P4425_1205388:3135-nf] He it was who hedged up and enclosed my evil ways[fn-44-P4426_1205461:3136-nf] that I might find Him the true way who says in the gospel, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\"[fn-44-P4427_1205582:3137-nf] Hear the words of the prophet: \"they that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\"[fn-44-P4428_1205809:3138-nf] Say also with him: \"All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears\"[fn-44-P4429_1205935:3139-nf] : and again, \"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night,\"[fn-44-P4430_1206182:3140-nf] and in another place, \"O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and weary land where no water is. So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary.\"[fn-44-P4431_1206420:3141-nf] For although my soul has thirsted after thee, yet much more have I sought thee by the labour of my flesh and have not been able to look upon thee in thy sanctuary; not at any rate till I have first dwelt in a land barren of sin, where the weary wayfarer is no more assailed by the adversary, and where there are no pools or rivers of lust.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1244","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"I.

For one who had gone so far astray as to live in Gomorrah could not all at once reach the noonland where Abraham, the friend of God,[fn-44-P4408_1200697:3118-nf] entertained God and His angels.[fn-44-P4409_1200751:3119-nf] (For it was in Egypt that Joseph fed his brothers, and when the bride speaks to the Bridegroom her cry is: \"tell me where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon.\"[fn-44-P4410_1200957:3120-nf] ) Good men have always sorrowed for the sins of others. Samuel of old lamented for Saul[fn-44-P4411_1201066:3121-nf] because he neglected to treat the ulcers of pride with the balm of penitence. And Paul wept for the Corinthians[fn-44-P4412_1201202:3122-nf] who refused to wash out with their tears the stains of fornication. For the same reason Ezekiel swallowed the book where were written within and without song, and lamentation and woe;[fn-44-P4413_1201409:3123-nf] the song in praise of the righteous, the lamentation over the penitent, and the woe for those of whom it is written, \"When the wicked man falleth into the depths of evil, then is he filled with scorn.\"[fn-44-P4414_1201639:3124-nf] It is to these that Isaiah alludes when he says: \"in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen; and killing sheep, eating flesh\" and saying, \"let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\"[fn-44-P4415_1201969:3125-nf] Yet of such persons Ezekiel is bidden to speak thus: \"O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live,\" and again, \"turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?\"[fn-44-P4416_1202467:3126-nf] Nothing makes God so angry as when men from despair of better things cleave to those which are worse; and indeed this despair in itself is a sign of unbelief. One who despairs of salvation can have no expectation of a judgment to come. For if he dreaded such, he would by doing good works prepare to meet his Judge. Let us hear what God says through Jeremiah, \"withhold thy foot from a rough way and thy throat from thirst\"[fn-44-P4417_1202936:3127-nf] and again \"shall they fall, and not arise? Shall he turn away, and not return?\"[fn-44-P4418_1203043:3128-nf] Let us hear also what God says by Isaiah: \"When thou shalt turn and bewail thyself, then shall thou be saved, and then shalt thou know where thou hast hitherto been.\"[fn-44-P4419_1203233:3129-nf] We do not realize the miseries of sickness till returning health reveals them to us. So sins serve as a foil to the blessedness of virtue; and light shines more brightly when it is relieved against darkness. Ezekiel uses language like that of the other prophets because he is animated by a similar spirit. \"Repent,\" he cries, \"and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord.\"[fn-44-P4420_1203902:3130-nf] Wherefore in a subsequent passage he says: \"As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked: but that the wicked turn from his way and live.\"[fn-44-P4421_1204103:3131-nf] These words shew us that the mind must not through disbelief in the promised blessings give way to despair; and that the soul once marked out for perdition must not refuse to apply remedies on the ground that its wounds are past curing. Ezekiel describes God as swearing, that if we refuse to believe His promise in regard to our salvation we may at least believe His oath. It is with full confidence that the righteous man prays and says, \"Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease,\"[fn-44-P4422_1204647:3132-nf] and again, \"Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.\"[fn-44-P4423_1204792:3133-nf] He means to say, \"when I forsook the foulness of my faults for the beauty of virtue, God strengthened my weakness with His grace.\" Lo, I hear. His promise: \"I will pursue mine enemies and overtake them: neither will I turn again till they are consumed,\"[fn-44-P4424_1205067:3134-nf] so that I who was once thine enemy and a fugitive from thee, shall be laid hold of by thine hand.

I say this, however, inasmuch as they received the commands of the law, which they were ordered to observe: for the prophets often show that this same Lord of ours might have been their Father also, if they had not strayed from His commandments: as, for instance, we have that statement, \"I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me;\"[fn-6-P639_238652:30-nf] and that other,\" I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the Most High;\"[fn-6-P640_238758:31-nf] and this again, \"If then I be a Father, where is mine honour? and if I be a Master, where is my fear?\"[fn-6-P641_238881:32-nf] and very many other statements, where the Jews are accused of showing by their sin that they did not wish to become sons: those things being left out of account which are said in prophecy of a future Christian people, that they would have God as a Father, according to that gospel statement,\" To them gave He power to become the sons of God.\"[fn-6-P642_239240:33-nf] The Apostle Paul, again, says, \"The heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant;\" and mentions that we have received the Spirit of adoption, \"whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-6-P643_239451:34-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"117","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"70. Then, further, when our Lord is found to have made certain statements which many who were present did not accept, but either resisted or despised, He is not to be thought to have given that which is holy to the dogs, or to have cast pearls before swine: for He did not give such things to those who were not able to receive them, but to those who were able, and were at the same time present; whom it was not meet that He should neglect on account of the impurity of others. And when tempters put questions to Him, and He answered them, so that they might have nothing to gainsay, although they might pine away from the effects of their own poisons, rather than be filled with His food, yet others, who were able to receive His teaching, heard to their profit many things in consequence of the opportunity created by these parties. I have said this, lest any one, perhaps, when he is not able to reply to one who puts a question to him, should seem to himself excused, if he should say that he is unwilling to give that which is holy to the dogs, or to cast pearls before swine. For he who knows what to answer ought to do it, even for the sake of others, in whose minds despair arises, if they believe that the question proposed cannot be answered: and this in reference to matters that are useful, and that belong to saving instruction. For many things which may be the subject of inquiry on the part of idle people are needless and vain, and often hurtful, respecting which, however, something must be said; but this very point is to be opened up and explained, viz. why such things ought not to form the subject of inquiry. In reference, therefore, to things that are useful, we ought sometimes to give a reply to what is asked of us: just as the Lord did, when the Sadducees had asked Him about the woman who had seven husbands, to which of them she would belong in the resurrection. For He answered that in the resurrection they will neither marry, nor be given in marriage, but will be as the angels in heaven. But sometimes, he who asks is to be asked something else, by telling which he would answer himself as to the matter he asked about; but if he should refuse to make a statement, it would not seem to those who are present unfair, if he himself should not hear anything as to the matter he inquired about. For those who put the question, tempting Him, whether tribute was to be paid, were asked another question, viz. whose image the money bore which was brought forward by themselves; and because they told what they had been asked, i.e. that the money bore the image of Caesar, they gave a kind of answer to themselves in reference to the question they had asked the Lord: and accordingly from their answer He drew this inference, \"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.\"[fn-9-P900_346612:204-nf] When, however, the chief priests and elders of the people had asked by what authority He was doing those things, He asked them about the baptism of John: and when they would not make a statement which they saw to be against themselves, and yet would not venture to say anything bad about John, on account of the bystanders, \"Neither tell I you,\" says He, \"by what authority I do these things;\"[fn-9-P901_347032:205-nf] a refusal which appeared most just to the bystanders. For they said they were ignorant of that which they really knew, but did not wish to tell. And, in truth, it was right that they who wished to have an answer to what they asked, should themselves first do what they required to be done toward them; and if they had done this, they would certainly have answered themselves. For they themselves had sent to John, asking who he was; or rather they themselves, being priests and Levites, had been sent, supposing that he was the very Christ, but he said that he was not, and gave forth a testimony concerning the Lord:[fn-9-P902_347676:206-nf] a testimony respecting which if they chose to make a confession, they would teach themselves by what authority as the Christ He was doing those things; which as if ignorant of they had asked, in order that they might find an avenue for calumny.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_09_book_iii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"3.

The prospect of a revival of the charges against him moved him to set in order an unanswerable array of documents, in proof, firstly of the unanimity, secondly of the good reason, with which he had been acquitted of them (see p. 97). He had also, in view of revived assertions of Arianism, drawn up the two letters or memoranda on the rationale of the Nicene formula and on the opinion ascribed to his famous predecessor, Dionysius (the Apology was probably written about 351, the date of the de Decr., and de Sent. Dion.[fn-4-P442_287142:69-nf] falls a little later). In 353 he began to apprehend danger, from the hopes with which the establishment of Constantius in the sole possession of the Empire was inspiring his enemies, headed by Valens in the West, and Acacius of Caesarea in the East. Accordingly, he despatched a powerful deputation to Constantius, who was then at Milan, headed by Serapion, his most trusted suffragan (cf. p. 560, note 3 a; p. 497, §3, copied by Soz. iv. 9; Fest. Ind. xxv.). The legates sailed May 19, but on the 23rd Montanus, an officer of the Palace, arrived with an Imperial letter, declining to receive any legates, but granting an alleged request of Athanasius to be allowed to come to Italy (p. 245 sq.). As he had made no request of the kind, Athanasius naturally suspected a plot to entice him away from his stronghold. The letter of Constantius did not convey an absolute command, so Athanasius, protesting his willingness to come when ordered to do so, resolved to remain where he was for the present. `All the people were exceedingly troubled,' according to our chroniclers. `In this year Montanus was sent against the bishop, but a tumult having been excited, he retired without effect.' Two years and two months later, i.e., in July-Aug. 355 (p. 497), force was attempted instead of stratagem, which the proceedings of Arles had, of course, made useless. `In this year Diogenes, the Secretary of the Emperor, came with the intention of seizing the bishop,' and `Diogenes pressed hard upon all, trying to dislodge the bishop from the city, and he afflicted all pretty severely; but on Sept. 4[fn-4-P443_289016:70-nf] he pressed sharply, and stormed a Church, and this he did continually for four months ...until Dec. 23. But as the people and magistrates vehemently withstood Diogenes, he returned back without effect on the 23rd of December aforesaid' (Fest. Ind. xxvii., Hist. Aceph. iii.). The fatal blow was clearly imminent. By this time the exiles had begun to arrive in the East, and rumours came[fn-4-P444_289524:71-nf] that not even the powerful and popular Liberius, not even `Father' Hosius himself, had been spared. Athanasius might well point out to Dracontius (p. 558) that in declining the bishopric of the `country district of Alexandria' he was avoiding the post of danger. On the sixth of January the `Duke' Syrianus arrived in Alexandria, concentrating in the city drafts from all the legions stationed in Egypt and Libya. Rumour was active as to the intentions of the commandant, and Athanasius felt justified in asking him whether he came with any orders from the Court. Syrianus replied that he did not, and Athanasius then produced the letter of Constantius referred to above (written 350-351). The magistrates and people joined in the remonstrance, and at last Syrianus. protested `by the life of Caesar' that he would remain quiet until the matter had been referred to the Emperor. This restored confidence, and on Thursday night, Feb. 8, Athanasius was presiding at a crowded service of preparation for a Communion on the following morning (Friday after Septuagesima) in the Church of Theonas, which with the exception of the unfinished Caesareum was the largest in the city (p. 243). Suddenly the church was surrounded and the doors broken in, and just after midnight Syrianus and the `notary' Hilary `entered with an infinite force of soldiers.' Athanasius (his fullest account is p. 263) calmly took his seat upon the throne (in the recess of the apse), and ordered the deacon to begin the 136th psalm, the people responding at each verse `for His mercy endureth for ever.' Meanwhile the soldiers crowded up to the chancel, and in spite of entreaties the bishop refused to escape until the congregation were in safety. He ordered the prayers to proceed, and only at the last moment a crowd of monks and clergy seized the Archbishop and managed to convey him in the confusion out of the church in a half-fainting state (protest of Alexandrians, p. 301), but thankful that he had been able to secure the escape of his people before his own (p. 264). From that moment Athanasius was lost to public view for `six years and fourteen days' (Hist. Aceph., i.e., Mechir 13, 356-Mechir 27, 362), `for he remembered that which was written, Hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast (pp. 288, 252, 262). Constantius and the Arians had planned their blow with skill and delivered it with decisive effect.

But for this partaking we were utterly unfit, and fell short of it, on account of the uncleanness of sins. Therefore we were to be cleansed. And further, the one cleansing of the unrighteous and of the proud is the blood of the Righteous One, and the humbling of God Himself;[fn-8-P823_318821:11-nf] that we might be cleansed through Him, made as He was what we are by nature, and what we are not by sin, that we might contemplate God, which by nature we are not. For by nature we are not God: by nature we are men, by sin we are not righteous. Wherefore God, made a righteous man, interceded with God for man the sinner. For the sinner is not congruous to the righteous, but man is congruous to man. By joining therefore to us the likeness of His humanity, He took away the unlikeness of our unrighteousness; and by being made partaker of our mortality, He made us partakers of His divinity.

For (as it just occurs to me) what I mean is precisely that co-adaptation which the Greeks call armonia. However this is not the place to set forth the power of that consonance of single to double which is found especially in us, and which is naturally so implanted in us (and by whom, except by Him who created us?), that not even the ignorant can fail to perceive it, whether when singing themselves or hearing others. For by this it is that treble and bass voices are in harmony, so that any one who in his note departs from it, offends extremely, not only trained skill, of which the most part of men are devoid, but the very sense of hearing.

But if the Son is said to be sent by the Father on this account, that the one is the Father, and the other the Son, this does not in any manner hinder us from believing the Son to be equal, and consubstantial, and co-eternal with the Father, and yet to have been sent as Son by the Father. Not because the one is greater, the other less; but because the one is Father, the other Son; the one begetter, the other begotten; the one, He from whom He is who is sent; the other, He who is from Him who sends. For the Son is from the Father, not the Father from the Son. And according to this manner we can now understand that the Son is not only said to have been sent because \"the Word was made flesh,\"[fn-9-P969_378969:97-nf] but therefore sent that the Word might be made flesh, and that He might perform through His bodily presence those things which were written; that is, that not only is He understood to have been sent as man, which the Word was made but the Word, too, was sent that it might be made man; because He was not sent in respect to any inequality of power, or substance, or anything that in Him was not equal to the Father; but in respect to this, that the Son is from the Father, not the Father from the Son; for the Son is the Word of the Father, which is also called His wisdom. What wonder, therefore, if He is sent, not because He is unequal with the Father, but because He is \"a pure emanation (manatio) issuing from the glory of the Almighty God?\" For there, that which issues, and that from which it issues, is of one and the same substance. For it does not issue as water issues from an aperture of earth or of stone, but as light issues from light. For the words, \"For she is the brightness of the everlasting light,\" what else are they than, she is light of everlasting light? For what is the brightness of light, except light itself? and so co-eternal, with the light, from which the light is. But it is preferable to say, \"the brightness of light,\" rather than\" the light of light;\" lest that which issues should be thought to be darker than that from which it issues. For when one hears of the brightness of light as being light itself, it is more easy to believe that the former shines by means of the latter, than that the latter shines less. But because there was no need of warning men not to think that light to be less, which begat the other (for no heretic ever dared say this, neither is it to be believed that any one will dare to do so), Scripture meets that other thought, whereby that light which issues might seem darker than that from which it issues; and it has removed this surmise by saying, \"It is the brightness of that light,\" namely, of eternal light, and so shows it to be equal. For if it were less, then it would be its darkness, not its brightness; but if it were greater, then it could not issue from it, for it could not surpass that from which it is educed. Therefore, because it issues from it, it is not greater than it is; and because it is not its darkness, but its brightness, it is not less than it is: therefore it is equal. Nor ought this to trouble us, that it is called a pure emanation issuing from the glory of the Almighty God, as if itself were not omnipotent, but an emanation from the Omnipotent; for soon after it is said of it, \"And being but one, she can do all things.\"[fn-9-P970_381617:98-nf] But who is omnipotent, unless He who can do all things? It is sent, therefore, by Him from whom it issues; for so she is sought after by him who loved and desired her. \"Send her,\" he says, \"out of Thy holy heavens, and from the throne of Thy glory, that, being present, she may labor with me;\"[fn-9-P971_381934:99-nf] that is, may teach me to labor [heartily] in order that I may not labor [irksomely]. For her labors are virtues. But she is sent in one way that she may be with man; she has been sent in another way that she herself may be man. For, \"entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God and prophets;\"[fn-9-P972_382261:100-nf] so she also fills the holy angels, and works all things fitting for such ministries by them.[fn-9-P973_382376:101-nf] But when the fullness of time was come, she was sent,[fn-9-P974_382587:102-nf] not to fill angels, nor to be an angel, except in so far as she announced the counsel of the Father, which was her own also; nor, again, to be with men or in men, for this too took place before, both in the fathers and in the prophets; but that the Word itself should be made flesh, that is, should be made man. In which future mystery, when revealed, was to be the salvation of those wise and holy men also, who, before He was born of the Virgin, were born of women; and in which, when done and made known, is the salvation of all who believe, and hope, and love.

The Son, therefore, is not properly said to have been sent in that He is begotten of the Father; but either in that the Word made flesh appeared to the world, whence He says, \"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world;\"[fn-9-P978_384080:105-nf] or in that from time to time, He is perceived by the mind of each, according to the saying, \"Send her, that, being present with me, she may labor with me.\"[fn-9-P979_384257:106-nf] What then is born (natum) from eternity is eternal, \"for it is the brightness of the everlasting light;\" but what is sent from time to time, is that which is apprehended by each. But when the Son of God was made manifest in the flesh, He was sent into this world in the fullness of time, made of a woman. \"For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God\" (since \"the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not\"), it \"pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe,\"[fn-9-P980_384811:107-nf] and that the Word should be made flesh, and dwell among us.[fn-9-P981_384892:108-nf] But when from time to time He comes forth and is perceived by the mind of each, He is said indeed to be sent, but not into this world; for He does not appear sensibly, that is, He does not present Himself to the corporeal senses. For we ourselves, too, are not in this world, in respect to our grasping with the mind as far as we can that which is eternal; and the spirits of all the righteous are not in this world, even of those who are still living in the flesh, in so far as they have discernment in things divine. But the Father is not said to be sent, when from time to time He is apprehended by any one, for He has no one of whom to be, or from whom to proceed; since Wisdom says, \"I came out of the mouth of the Most High,\"[fn-9-P982_385646:109-nf] and it is said of the Holy Spirit, \"He proceedeth from the Father,\"[fn-9-P983_385738:110-nf] but the Father is from no one.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"But with respect to the sensible showing of the Holy Spirit, whether by the shape of a dove,[fn-10-P1001_391928:123-nf] or by fiery tongues,[fn-10-P1002_391971:124-nf] when the subjected and subservient creature by temporal motions and forms manifested His substance co-eternal with the Father and the Son, and alike with them unchangeable, while it was not united so as to be one person with Him, as the flesh was which the Word was made;[fn-10-P1003_392261:125-nf] I do not dare to say that nothing of the kind was done aforetime. But I would boldly say, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, of one and the same substance, God the Creator, the Omnipotent Trinity, work indivisibly; but that this cannot be indivisibly manifested by the creature, which is far inferior, and least of all by the bodily creature: just as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit cannot be named by our words, which certainly are bodily sounds, except in their own proper intervals of time, divided by a distinct separation, which intervals the proper syllables of each word occupy. Since in their proper substance wherein they are, the three are one, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the very same, by no temporal motion, above the whole creature, without any interval of time and place, and at once one and the same from eternity to eternity, as it were eternity itself, which is not without truth and charity. But, in my words, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are separated, and cannot be named at once, and occupy their own proper places separately invisible letters. And as, when I name my memory, and intellect, and will, each name refers to each severally, but yet each is uttered by all three; for there is no one of these three names that is not uttered by both my memory and my intellect and my will together [by the soul as a whole]; so the Trinity together wrought both the voice of the Father, and the flesh of the Son, and the dove of the Holy Spirit, while each of these things is referred severally to each person. And by this similitude it is in some degree discernible, that the Trinity, which is inseparable in itself, is manifested separably by the appearance of the visible creature; and that the operation of the Trinity is also inseparable in each severally of those things which are said to pertain properly to the manifesting of either the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_06_book_i_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"Some one accordingly asked them whether the Word of God could be changed, as the devil has been? and they feared not to say, `Yes, he could; for being begotten, he is susceptible of change' We then, with the bishops of Egypt and Libya, being assembled together to the number of nearly a hundred, have anathematized Arius for his shameless avowal of these heresies, together with all such as have countenanced them.

Nor let it trouble us that the Holy Spirit, although He is co-eternal with the Father and the Son, yet is called something which exists in time; as, for instance, this very thing which we have called Him, a thing that has been given. For the Spirit is a gift eternally, but a thing that has been given in time. For if a lord also is not so called unless when he begins to have a slave, that appellation likewise is relative and in time to God; for the creature is not from all eternity, of which He is the Lord. How then shall we make it good that relative terms themselves are not accidental, since nothing happens accidentally to God in time, because He is incapable of change, as we have argued in the beginning of this discussion? Behold! to be the Lord, is not eternal to God; otherwise we should be compelled to say that the creature also is from eternity, since He would not be a lord from all eternity unless the creature also was a servant from all eternity. But as he cannot be a slave who has not a lord, neither can he be a lord who has not a slave. And if there be any one who says that God, indeed, is alone eternal, and that times are not eternal on account of their variety and changeableness, but that times nevertheless did not begin to be in time (for there was no time before times began, and therefore it did not happen to God in time that He should be Lord, since He was Lord of the very times themselves, which assuredly did not begin in time): what will he reply respecting man, who was made in time, and of whom assuredly He was not the Lord before he was of whom He was to be Lord? Certainly to be the Lord of man happened to God in time. And that all dispute may seem to be taken away, certainly to be your Lord, or mine, who have only lately begun to be, happened to God in time. Or if this, too, seems uncertain on account of the obscure question respecting the soul, what is to be said of His being the Lord of the people of Israel? since, although the nature of the soul already existed, which that people had (a matter into which we do not now inquire), yet that people existed not as yet, and the time is apparent when it began to exist. Lastly, that He should be Lord of this or that tree, or of this or that corn crop, which only lately began to be, happened in time; since, although the matter itself already existed, yet it is on, thing to be Lord of the matter (materiae), another to be Lord of the already created nature (naturae).[fn-10-P1097_445514:36-nf] For man, too, is lord of the wood at one time, and at another he is lord of the chest, although fabricated of that same wood; which he certainly was not at the time when he was already the lord of the wood. How then shall we make it good that nothing is said of God according to accident, except because nothing happens to His nature by which He may be changed, so that those things are relative accidents which happen in, connection with some change of the things of which they are spoken. As a friend is so called relatively: for he does not begin to be one, unless when he has begun to love; therefore some change of will takes place, in order that he may be called a friend. And money, when it is called a price, is spoken of relatively, and yet it was not changed when it began to be a price; nor, again, when it is called a pledge, or any other thing of the kind. If, therefore, money can so often be spoken of relatively with no change of itself, so that neither when it begins, nor when it ceases to be so spoken of, does any change take place in that nature or form of it, whereby it is money; how much more easily ought we to admit, concerning that unchangeable substance of God, that something may be so predicated relatively in respect to the creature, that although it begin to be so predicated in time, yet nothing shall be understood to have happened to the substance itself of God, but only to that creature in respect to which it is predicated? \"Lord,\" it is said, \"Thou hast been made our refuge.\"[fn-10-P1098_447346:37-nf] God, therefore, is said to be our refuge relatively, for He is referred to us, and He then becomes our refuge when we flee to Him; pray does anything come to pass then in His nature, which, before we fled to Him, was not? In us therefore some change does take place; for we were worse before we fled to Him, and we become better by fleeing to Him: but in Him there is no change. So also He begins to be our Father, when we are regenerated through His grace, since He gave us power to become the sons of God.[fn-10-P1099_447869:38-nf] Our substance therefore is changed for the better, when we become His sons; and He at the same time begins to be our Father, but without any change of His own substance. Therefore that which begins to be spoken of God in time, and which was not spoken of Him before, is manifestly spoken of Him relatively; yet not according to any accident of God, so that anything should have happened to Him, but clearly according to some accident of that, in respect to which God begins to be called something relatively. When a righteous man begins to be a friend of God, he himself is changed; but far be it from us to say, that God loves any one in time with as it were a new love, which was not in Him before, with whom things gone by have not passed away and things future have been already done. Therefore He loved all His saints before the foundation of the world, as He predestinated them; but whenthey are converted and find them; then they are said to begin to be loved by Him, that what is said may be said in that way in which it can be comprehended by human affections.

[We believe] also in the Holy Spirit, that is to say the Comforter, whom, having promised to his apostles after his ascension into the heavens, to teach them, and bring all thinks to their remembrance, he sent; by whom also the souls of those who have sincerely believed in him are sanctified. But those who affirm that the Son is of things which are not, or of another substance, and not of God, and that there was a time or an age when he was not, the holy and catholic Church recognizes to be aliens. We therefore again say, if any one affirms that the Father and Son are two Gods, let him be anathema. And if any one admits that Christ is God and the Son of God before the ages, but does not confess that he ministered to the Father in the formation of all things, let him be anathema. If any one shall dare to assert that the Unbegotten, or a part of him, was born of Mary, let him be anathema. If any one should say that the Son was of Mary according to foreknowledge, and not that he was with God, begotten of the Father before the ages, and that all things were not made by him, let him be anathema. If any one affirms the essence of God to be dilated or contracted, let him be anathema. If any one says that the dilated essence of God makes the Son, or shall term the Son the dilatation of his essence, let him be anathema. If any one calls the Son of God the internal or uttered word, let him be anathema. If any one declares that the Son that was born of Mary was man only, let him be anathema. If any man affirming him that was born of Mary to be God and man, shall imply the unbegotten God himself, let him be anathema. If any one shall understand the text, \"I am the first, and I am the last, and besides me there is no God,\"[fn-8-P804_339296:100-nf] which was spoken for the destruction of idols and false gods, in the sense the Jews do, as if it were said for the subversion of the only-begotten of God before the ages, let him be anathema. If any one hearing \"the Word was made flesh,\"[fn-8-P805_339555:101-nf] should imagine that the Word was changed into flesh, or that he underwent any change in assuming flesh, let him be anathema. If any one hearing that the only-begotten Son of God was crucified, should say that his divinity underwent any corruption, or suffering, or change, or diminution, or destruction, let him be anathema. If any one should affirm that the Father said not to the Son, \"Let us make man,\"[fn-8-P806_339980:102-nf] but that God spoke to himself, let him be anathema. If any one says that it was not the Son that was seen by Abraham, but the unbegotten God, or a part of him, let him be anathema. If any one says that it was not the Son that as man wrestled with Jacob, but the unbegotten God, or a part of him, let him be anathema. If any one shall understand the words, \"The Lord rained from the Lord,\"[fn-8-P807_340388:103-nf] not in relation to the Father and the Son, but shall say that he rained from himself, let him be anathema: for the Lord the Son rained from the Lord the Father. If any one hearing \"the Lord the Father, and the Lord the Son,\" shall term both the Father and the Son Lord, and saying \"the Lord from the Lord\" shall assert that there are two Gods, let him be anathema. For we do not co-ordinate the Son with the Father, but [conceive him to be] subordinate to the Father. For he neither came down to the body[fn-8-P808_340988:104-nf] without his Father's will; nor did he rain from himself, but from the Lord (i.e. the Father) who exercises supreme authority: nor does he sit at the Father's right hand of himself, but in obedience to the Father saying, \"Sit thou at my right hand\"[fn-8-P809_341363:105-nf] [let him be anathema]. If any one should say that the Father, Son, and Holy? Spirit are one person, let him be anathema. If any one, speaking of the Holy Spirit the Comforter, shall call him the unbegotten God, let him be anathema. If any one, as he hath taught us, shall not say that the Comforter is other than the Son, when he has himself said, \"the Father, whom I will ask, shall send you another Comforter,\"[fn-8-P810_341801:106-nf] let him be anathema. If any one affirm that the Spirit is part of the Father and of the Son, let him be anathema. If any one say that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three Gods, let him be anathema. If any one say that the Son of God was made as one of the creatures by the will of God, let him be anathema. If any one shall say that the Son was begotten without the Father's will, let him be anathema: for the Father did not, as compelled by any natural necessity, beget the Son at a time when he was unwilling; but as soon as it pleased him, he has declared that of himself without time and without passion, he begot him. If any one should say that the Son is unbegotten, and without beginning, intimating that there are two without beginning, and unbegotten, so making two Gods, let him be anathema: for the Son is the head and beginning of all things; but \"the head of Christ is God.\"[fn-8-P811_342730:107-nf] Thus do we devoutly trace up all things by the Son to one source of all things who is without beginning. Moreover, to give an accurate conception of Christian doctrine, we again say, that if any one shall not declare Christ Jesus to have been the Son of God before all ages, and to have ministered to the Father in the creation of all things; but shall affirm that from the time only when he was born of Mary, was he called the Son and Christ, and that he then received the commencement of his divinity, let him be anathema, as the Samosatan.'[fn-8-P812_343295:108-nf] Another Exposition of the Faith set forth at Sirmium in Latin, and afterwards translated into Greek.[fn-8-P813_343440:109-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_09_homily_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"For nothing is so acceptable to God as to number one's self with the last.

And I also say, and all say, that it behoveth the ministers of so great a Judge to be righteous; let the ministers, by all means, be righteous if they will; but if they will not be righteous who sit in the seat of Moses, my Master made me safe, of whom His Spirit said, \"This is He which baptizeth.\" How did He make me safe? \"The scribes and the Pharisees,\" He says, \"sit in Moses' seat: what they say, do; but what they do, that do not ye: for they say, and do not.\"[fn-4-P419_152628:18-nf] If the minister is righteous, I reckon him with Paul, I reckon him with Peter; with those I reckon righteous ministers: because, in truth, righteous ministers seek not their own glory; for they are ministers, they do not wish to be thought judges, they abhor that one should place his hope on them; therefore, I reckon the righteous minister with Paul.

Suppose that he is stony, that he cannot from water rear fruit; even through the stony channel the water passes, the water passes to the garden beds; in the stony channel it causes nothing to grow, but nevertheless it brings much fruit to the gardens. For the spiritual virtue of the sacrament is like the light: both by those who are to be enlightened is it received pure, and if it passes through the impure it is not stained. Let the ministers be by all means righteous, and seek not their own glory, but His glory whose ministers they are; let them not say, The baptism is mine; for it is not theirs.

He said himself, \"Prepare ye the way for the Lord.\"[fn-4-P421_154208:20-nf] But when the Lord was known, Himself became the way; there was no longer need for the baptism of John to prepare the way for the Lord.","title":"Tractate V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":35,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Let us therefore give in and yield our assent to the authority of Holy Scripture, which knows not how either to be deceived or to deceive; and as we do not believe that men as yet unborn have done any good or evil for raising a difference in their moral deserts, so let us by no means doubt that all men are under sin, which came into the world by one man and has passed through unto all men; and from which nothing frees us but the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ.

The words, no doubt, are so placed in the Greek, that they may be understood to express that the light itself \"cometh into the world.\"[fn-5-P507_389347:119-nf] If, nevertheless, the clause must be taken as expressing the man who cometh into this world, I suppose that it is either a simple phrase, like many others one finds in the Scriptures, which may be removed without impairing the general sense; or else, if it is to be regarded as a distinctive addition, it was perhaps inserted in order to distinguish spiritual illumination from that bodily one which enlightens the eyes of the flesh either by means of the luminaries of the sky, or by the lights of ordinary fire. So that he mentioned the inner man as coming into the world, because the outward man is of a corporeal nature, just as this world itself; as if he said, \"Which lighteth every man that cometh into the body,\" in accordance with that which is written: \"I obtained a good spirit, and I came in a body undefiled.\"[fn-5-P508_390252:120-nf] Or again, the passage, \"Which lighteth every one that cometh into the world,\"-if it was added for the sake of expressing some distinction,-might perhaps mean: Which lighteth every inner man, because the inner man, when he becomes truly wise, is enlightened only by Him who is the true Light. Or, once more, if the intention was to designate reason herself, which causes the human soul to be called rational (and this reason, although as yet quiet and as it were asleep, for all that lies hidden in infants, innate and, so to speak, implanted), by the term illumination, as if it were the creation of an inner eye, then it cannot be denied that it is made when the soul is created; and there is no absurdity in supposing this to take place when the human being comes into the world. But yet, although his eye is now created, he himself must needs remain in darkness, if he does not believe in Him who said: \"I am come a Light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.\"[fn-5-P509_391283:121-nf] And that this takes place in the case of infants, through the sacrament of baptism, is not doubted by mother Church, which uses for them the heart and mouth of a mother, that they may be imbued with the sacred mysteries, seeing that they cannot as yet with their own heart \"believe unto righteousness,\" nor with their own mouth make \"confession unto salvation.\"[fn-5-P510_391666:122-nf] There is not indeed a man among the faithful, who would hesitate to call such infants believers merely from the circumstance that such a designation is derived from the act of believing; for although incapable of such an act themselves, yet others are sponsors for them in the sacraments.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_11_book_i_","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"152","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"This reasoning will carry more weight, after I have collected the mass of Scripture testimonies which I have undertaken to adduce.

He will say, \"In that He said, `I go not up to this feast,' and went up.\" Whence dost thou know that He said so? What if I were to say, nay, not I, but any one, for God forbid that I should say it; what if another were to say, \"Christ did not say this;\" whereby dost thou refute him, whereby wilt thou prove it? Thou wouldest open the book, find the passage, point it out to the man, yea with great confidence force the book upon him if he resisted, \"Hold it, mark, read, it is the Gospel you have in your hands.\" But why, I ask thee, why dost thou so rudely accost[fn-63-P6368_2690546:21-nf] this feeble one? Do not be so eager; speak more composedly, more tranquilly. See, it is the Gospel I have in my hands; and what is there in it? He answers: \"The Gospel declares that Christ said what thou deniest.\" And wilt thou believe that Christ said it, because the Gospel declares it? \"Decidedly for that reason,\" says he. I marvel exceedingly how thou shouldest say that Christ lieth, anti the Gospel doth not lie. But test haply when I speak of the Gospel, thou shouldest think of the book itself, and imagine the parchment and ink to be the Gospel, see what the Greek word means; Gospel is \"a good messenger,\" or \"a good message.\" The messenger then doth not lie, and doth He who sent him, lie? This messenger, the Evangelist to wit, to give his name also, this John who wrote this, did he lie concerning Christ, or say the truth? Choose which you will, I am ready to hear you on either side. If he spake falsely, you have no means of proving that Christ spake those words. If he said the truth, truth cannot flow from the fountain of falsehood. Who is the Fountain? Christ: let John be the stream. The stream comes to me, and you say to me, \"Drink securely;\" yea, whereas you alarm me as to the Fountain Himself, whereas you tell me there is falsehood in the Fountain, you say to me, \"Drink securely.\" What do I drink? What said John, that Christ spake falsely? Whence came John? From Christ. Is he who came from Him, to tell me truth, when He from whom he came lied? I have read in the Gospel plainly, \"John lay on the Lord's Breast;\"[fn-63-P6369_2692106:22-nf] but I conclude that he drank in truth. What saw he as he lay on the Lord's Breast? What drank he in? what, but that which he poured forth? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The Same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made. That which was made in Him was life, and the Life wasthe Light of men; And the Light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended It not;\"[fn-63-P6370_2692594:23-nf] nevertheless It shineth, and though I chance to have some obscurity, and cannot thoroughly comprehend It, still It shineth. \"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John; he came to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. He was not the Light:\" who? John: who? John the Baptist. For of him saith John the Evangelist, \"He was not the Light;\" of whom the Lord saith, \"He was a burning, and a shining lamp.\"[fn-63-P6371_2693053:24-nf] But a lamp can be lighted, and extinguished. What then? whence drawest thou the distinction? of what place art thou enquiring? He to whom the lamp bare witness, \"was the True Light.\"[fn-63-P6372_2693253:25-nf] Where John added, \"the True,\" there art thou looking out for a lie. But hear still the same Evangelist John pouring forth what he had drunk in; \"And we beheld,\" saith he, \"His glory.\" What did he behold? what glory beheld he? \"The glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\"[fn-63-P6373_2693571:26-nf] See then, see, if we ought not haply to restrain weak or rash disputings, and to presume nothing false of the truth, to give to the Lord what is His due; let us give glory to the Fountain, that we may fill ourselves securely. \"Now God is true, but every man a liar.\"[fn-63-P6374_2693856:27-nf] What is this? God is fill; every man is empty; if he will be filled, let him come to Him That is full. \"Come unto Him, and be enlightened.\"[fn-63-P6375_2694014:28-nf] Moreover, if man is empty, in that he is a liar, and he seeks to be filled, and with haste and eagerness runs to the fountain, he wishes to be filled, he is empty. But thou sayest, \"Beware of the fountain, there is falsehood there.\" What else sayest thou, but \"there is poison there \"?","title":"Sermon LXXXIII. [CXXXIII.

But do thou, who hast power from the things that are seen to form an analogy of the unseen, glorify the Maker by whom all things were made, visible and invisible, principalities and powers, authorities, thrones, and dominions, and all other reasonable natures whom we cannot name.[fn-15-P1559_383788:327-nf] And in the creation bethink thee first, I pray thee, of the original cause of all things that are made, the Father; of the creative cause, the Son; of the perfecting cause, the Spirit; so that the ministering spirits subsist by the will of the Father, are brought into being by the operation of the Son, and perfected by the presence of the Spirit. Moreover, the perfection of angels is sanctification and continuance in it. And let no one imagine me either to affirm that there are three original hypostases[fn-15-P1560_384325:328-nf] or to allege the operation of the Son to be imperfect. For the first principle of existing things is One, creating through the Son and perfecting through the Spirit.[fn-15-P1561_384514:329-nf] The operation of the Father who worketh all in all is not imperfect, neither is the creating work of the Son incomplete if not perfected by the Spirit. The Father, who creates by His sole will, could not stand in any need of the Son, but nevertheless He wills through the Son; nor could the Son, who works according to the likeness of the Father, need co-operation, but the Son too wills to make perfect through the Spirit. \"For by the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath [the Spirit] of His mouth.\"[fn-15-P1562_385080:330-nf] The Word then is not a mere significant impression on the air, borne by the organs of speech; nor is the Spirit of His mouth a vapour, emitted by the organs of respiration; but the Word is He who \"was with God in the beginning\" and \"was God,\"[fn-15-P1563_385462:331-nf] and the Spirit of the mouth of God is \"the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father.\"[fn-15-P1564_385668:332-nf] You are therefore to perceive three, the Lord who gives the order, the Word who creates,and the Spirit who confirms.[fn-15-P1565_385807:333-nf] And what other thing could confirmation be than the perfecting according to holiness? This perfectingexpresses the confirmation's firmness,unchangeableness,and fixity in good. But there is no sanctification without the Spirit. The powers of the heavens are not holy by nature; were it so there would in this respect be no difference between them and the Holy Spirit. It is in proportion to their relative excellence that they have their meed of holiness from the Spirit. The branding-iron is conceived of together with the fire; and yet the material and the fire are distinct. Thus too in the case of the heavenly powers; their substance is, peradventure, an aerial spirit, or an immaterial fire, as it is written, \"Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;\"[fn-15-P1566_386607:334-nf] wherefore they exist in space and become visible, and appear in their proper bodily form to them that are worthy. But their sanctification, being external to their substance, superinduces their perfection through the communion of the Spirit. They keep their rank by their abiding in the good and true, and while they retain their freedom of will, never fall away from their patient attendance on Him who is truly good. It results that, if by your argument you do away with the Spirit, the hosts of the angels are disbanded, the dominions of archangels are destroyed, all is thrown into confusion, and their life loses law, order, and distinctness. For how are angels to cry \"Glory to God in the highest\"[fn-15-P1567_387331:335-nf] without being empowered by the Spirit? For \"No man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost, and no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed;\"[fn-15-P1568_387931:336-nf] as might be said by wicked and hostile spirits, whose fall establishes our statement of the freedom of the will of the invisible powers; being, as they are, in a condition of equipoise between virtue and vice, and on this account needing the succour of the Spirit. I indeed maintain that even Gabriel[fn-15-P1569_388251:337-nf] in no other way foretells events to come than by the foreknowledge of the Spirit, by reason of the fact that one of the boons distributed by the Spirit is prophecy. And whence did he who was ordained to announce the mysteries of the vision to the Man of Desires[fn-15-P1570_388533:338-nf] derive the wisdom whereby he was enabled to teach hidden things, if not from the Holy Spirit? The revelation of mysteries is indeed the peculiar function of the Spirit, as it is written, \"God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit.\"[fn-15-P1571_388790:339-nf] And how could \"thrones, dominions, principalities and powers\"[fn-15-P1572_388871:340-nf] live their blessed life, did they not \"behold the face of the Father which is in heaven\"?[fn-15-P1573_389017:341-nf] But to behold it is impossible without the Spirit! Just as at night, if you withdraw the light from the house, the eyes fall blind and their faculties become inactive, and the worth of objects cannot be discerned, and gold is trodden on in ignorance as though it were iron, so in the order of the intellectual world it is impossible for the high life of Law to abide without the Spirit. For it so to abide were as likely as that an army should maintain its discipline in the absence of its commander, or a chorus its harmony without the guidance of the coryphaeus. How could the Seraphim cry\"Holy, Holy, Holy,\"[fn-15-P1574_389650:342-nf] were they not taught by the Spirit how often true religion requires them to lift their voice in this ascription of glory? Do \"all His angels\" and \"all His hosts\"[fn-15-P1575_389831:343-nf] praise God? It is through the co-operation of the Spirit. Do \"thousand thousand\" of angels stand before Him, and\"ten thousand times ten thouSand\" ministering spirits?[fn-15-P1576_390022:344-nf] They are blamelessly doing their proper work by the power of the Spirit. All the glorious and unspeakable harmony[fn-15-P1577_390154:345-nf] of the highest heavens both in the service of God, and in the mutual concord of the celestial powers, can therefore only be preserved by the direction of the Spirit. Thus with those beings who are not gradually perfected by increase and advance,[fn-15-P1578_390423:346-nf] butare perfect from the moment of the creation, there is in creation the presence of the Holy Spirit, who confers on them the grace that flows from Him for the completion and perfection of their essence.[fn-15-P1579_390648:347-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"125","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"39.

Whether you wish to examine ancient evidence;-the blessings of the partriarchs, the succour given through the legislation, the types, the prophecies, the valorous feats in war, the signs wrought through just men;-or on the other hand the things done in the dispensation of the coming of our Lord in the flesh;-all is through the Spirit. In the first place He was made an unction, and being inseparably present was with the very flesh of the Lord, according to that which is written, \"Upon whom thou shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, the same is\"[fn-15-P1582_391636:349-nf] \"my beloved Son;\"[fn-15-P1583_391740:350-nf] and \"Jesus of Nazareth\" whom \"God anointed with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-15-P1584_391993:351-nf] After this every operation was wrought with the co-operation of the Spirit.

But in no way is the \"mouth\" a member, nor the Spirit breath that is dissolved; but the word \"mouth\" is used so far as it can be appropriate to God, and the Spirit is a Substance having life, gifted with supreme power of sanctification. Thus the dose relation is made plain, while the mode of the ineffable existence is safeguarded. He is moreover styled `Spirit of Christ,' as being by nature closely related to Him. Wherefore \"If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.\"[fn-16-P1635_415112:388-nf] Hence He alone worthily glorifies the Lord, for, it is said,\"He shall glorify me,\"[fn-16-P1636_415215:389-nf] not as the creature, but as \"Spirit of truth,\"[fn-16-P1637_415618:390-nf] dearly shewing forth the truth in Himself, and, as Spirit of wisdom, in His own greatness revealing \"Christ the Power of God and the wisdom of God.\"[fn-16-P1638_415788:391-nf] And as Paraclete[fn-16-P1639_415826:392-nf] He expresses in Himself the goodness of the Paraclete who sent Him, and in His own dignity manifests the majesty of Him from whom He proceeded.

I do not personally understand why we ought to preach before everything else, as the most valuable and important of doctrines and in itself sufficient, a truth which cannot be piously preached before other truths, although it is impious to deny it after them.","title":"On the Councils, or the Faith of the Easterns","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":1,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_08_counter_statements_of_theodoret_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Against IX.-Here he has plainly had the hardihood to anathematize not only those who at the present time hold pious opinions, but also those who were in former days heralds of truth; aye even the writers of the divine gospels, the band of the holy Apostles, and, in addition to these, Gabriel the archangel. For he indeed it was who first, even before the conception, announced the birth of the Christ according to the flesh; saying in reply to Mary when she asked, \"How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?\" \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-9-P902_160022:206-nf] And to Joseph he said, \"Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P903_160177:207-nf] And the Evangelist says, \"When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph...she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P904_160315:208-nf] And the Lord Himself when He had come into the synagogue of the Jews and had taken the prophet Isaiah, after reading the passage in which he says, \"The spirit of the Lord is upon me because He hath anointed me\" and so on, added, \"This day is this scripture ful-filled in your ears.\"[fn-9-P905_160619:209-nf] And the blessed Peter in his sermon to the Jews said, \"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P906_160760:210-nf] And Isaiah many ages before had predicted, \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots; and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;\"[fn-9-P907_161095:211-nf] and again, \"Behold my servant whom I uphold, my beloved in whom my soul delighteth. I will put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.\"[fn-9-P908_161293:212-nf] This testimony the Evangelist too has inserted in his own writings. And the Lord Himself in the Gospels says to the Jews, \"If I with the spirit of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come ripen you.\"[fn-9-P909_161532:213-nf] And John says, \"He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P910_161754:214-nf] So this exact examiner of the divine decrees has not only anathematized prophets, apostles, and even the archangel Gabriel, but has suffered his blasphemy to reach even the Saviour of the world Himself. For we have shewn that the Lord Himself after reading the passage \"The spirit of the Lord is upon me because He hath anointed me,\" said to the Jews, \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.\" And to those who said that He was casting out devils by Beelzebub He replied that He was casting them out by the Spirit of God. But we maintain that it was not God the Word, of one substance and co-eternal with the Father, that was formed by the Holy Ghost and anointed, but the human nature which was assumed by Him at the end of days. We shall confess that the Spirit of the Son was His own if he spoke of it as of the same nature and proceeding from the Father, and shall accept the expression as consistent with true piety. But if he speaks of the Spirit as being of the Son, or as having its origin through the Son we shall reject this statement as blasphemous and impious. For we believe the Lord when He says, \"The spirit which proceedeth from the Father;\"[fn-9-P911_162942:215-nf] and likewise the very divine Paul saying, \"We have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God.\"[fn-9-P912_163094:216-nf] ","title":"Counter-Statements of Theodoret.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_07_the_dialogue_against_the_luciferians","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"48","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"O. I do not think that those who form our audience are so ignorant of the sacred books that many words are needed to settle this little question. But before I say anything in support of my assertion, listen while I point out what confusion, upon your view, is introduced into Scripture. What do we mean by saying that John in his baptism could not give the Holy Spirit to others, yet gave him to Christ? And who is that John?[fn-58-P5851_1705386:26-nf] \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.\" He who used to say,[fn-58-P5852_1705541:27-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world\": I say too little, he who from his mother's womb cried out,[fn-58-P5853_1705684:28-nf] \"And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come unto me,\" did he not give the Holy Ghost? And did[fn-58-P5854_1705816:29-nf] Ananias give him to Paul? It perhaps looks like boldness in me to prefer him to all other men. Hear then the words of our Lord,[fn-58-P5855_1705962:30-nf] \"Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist.\" For no prophet had the good fortune both to announce the coming of Christ, and to point Him out with the finger. And what necessity is there for me to dwell upon the praises of so illustrious a man when God the Father even calls him an angel?[fn-58-P5856_1706315:31-nf] \"Behold, I send my messenger (angel) before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.\" He must have been an angel who after lodging in his mother's womb at once began to frequent the desert wilds, and while still an infant played with serpents; who, when his eyes had once gazed on Christ thought nothing else worth looking at; who exercised his voice, worthy of a messenger of God, in the words of the Lord, which are sweeter than honey and the honey-comb. And, to delay my question no further, thus it behooved[fn-58-P5857_1706854:32-nf] the Forerunner f of the Lord to grow up. Now is it possible f that a man of such character and renown did not give the Holy Ghost, while Cornelius the centurion received Him before baptism? Tell me, pray, why could he not give Him? You don't know? Then listen to the teaching of Scripture: the baptism of John did not so much consist in the forgiveness of sins as in being a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, that is, for a future remission, which was to follow through the sanctification of Christ. For it is written,[fn-58-P5858_1707514:33-nf] \"John came, who baptized in the wilderness, and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.\" And soon after,[fn-58-P5859_1707654:34-nf] \"And they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.\" For as he himself preceded Christ as His forerunner, so also his baptism was the prelude to the Lord's baptism.[fn-58-P5860_1707858:35-nf] \"He that is of the earth,\" he said, \"speaketh of the earth; he that cometh from heaven is above all.\" And again,[fn-58-P5861_1707990:36-nf] \"I indeed baptize you with water, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.\" But if John, as he himself confessed, did not baptize with the Spirit, it follows that he did not forgive sins either, for no man has his sins remitted without the Holy Ghost. Or if you contentiously argue that, because the baptism of John was from heaven, therefore sins were forgiven by it, show me what more there is for us to get in Christ's baptism. Because it forgives sins, it releases from Gehenna. Because it releases from Gehenna, it is perfect. But no baptism can be called perfect except that which depends on the cross and resurrection of Christ. Thus, although John himself said,[fn-58-P5862_1708681:37-nf] \"He must increase, but I must decrease,\" in your perverse scrupulosity you give more than is due to the baptism of the servant, and destroy that of the master to which you leave no more than to the other. What is the drift of your assertion? Just this-it does not strike you as strange that those who had been baptized by John, should afterwards by the laying on of hands receive the Holy Ghost, although it is evident that they did not obtain even remission of sins apart from the faith which was to follow. But you who receive a person baptized by the Arians and allow him to have perfect baptism, after that admission do you invoke the Holy Ghost as if this were still some slight defect, whereas there is no baptism of Christ without the Holy Ghost? But I have wandered too far, and when I might have met my opponent face to face and repelled his attack, I have only thrown a few light darts rom a distance. The baptism of John was so ar imperfect that it is plain they who had been baptized by him were afterwards baptized with the baptism of Christ. For thus the history relates[fn-58-P5863_1709785:38-nf] \"And it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found certain disciples: and he said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Ghost when ye believed? And they said unto him, Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the Holy Ghost was given. And he said, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism. And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on Him which should come after him, that is, on Jesus. And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus: And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, immediately the Holy Ghost fell on them.\" If then they were baptized with the true and lawful baptism of the Church, and thus received the Holy Ghost: do you follow the apostles and baptize those who have not had Christian baptism, and you will be able to invoke the Holy Ghost.","title":"The Dialogue Against the Luciferians","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_07_the_dialogue_against_the_luciferians","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"89","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"27.

But it is one question, whether he could exist; and another question, whether he does exist. Again, it is one question, if he does not exist when he could exist, why he does not exist; and another question, whether such a man as had never sinned at all, not only is in existence, but also could ever have existed, or can ever exist. Now, if in the order of this fourfold set of interrogative propositions, I were asked, [1st,] Whether it be possible for a man in this life to be without sin? I should allow the possibility, through the grace of God and the man's own free will; not doubting that the free will itself is ascribable to God's grace, in other words, to the gifts of God,-not only as to its existence, but also as to its being good, that is, to its conversion to doing the commandments of God.

And \"we shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall free us;\" that is, Christ the Son of God who hath said, \"I am the Truth,\"[fn-64-P6418_2709521:21-nf] shall make you free, that is, shall free you, not from barbarians, but from the devil; not from the captivity of the body, but from the iniquity of the soul. It is He Only who freeth in such wise. Let no one call himself free, lest he remain a slave. Our soul shall not remain in bondage, for that day by day our debts are forgiven.

Let us now inquire more carefully, so far as God grants, into that which a little before we deferred; whether each person also in the Trinity can also by Himself and not with the other two be called God, or great, or wise, or true, or omnipotent, or just, or anything else that can be said of God, not relatively, but absolutely; or whether these things cannot be said except when the Trinity is understood. For the question is raised,-because it is written, \"Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God,\"[fn-11-P1172_484349:1-nf] -whether He is so the Father of His own wisdom and His own power, as that He is wise with that wisdom which He begat, and powerful with that power which He begat; and whether, since He is always powerful and wise, He always begat power and wisdom. For if it be so, then, as we have said, why is He not also the Father of His own greatness by which He is great, and of His own goodness by which He is good, and of His own justice by which He is just, and whatever else there is? Or if all these things are understood, although under more names than one, to be in the same wisdom and power, so that that is greatness which is power, that is goodness which is wisdom, and that again is wisdom which is power, as we have already argued; then let us remember, that when I mention any one of these, I am to be taken as if I mentioned all. It is asked, then, whether the Father also by Himself is wise, and is Himself His own wisdom itself; or whether He is wise in the same way as He speaks. For He speaks by the Word which He begat, not by the word which is uttered, and sounds, and passes away, but by the Word which was with God, and the Word was God, and all things were made by Him:[fn-11-P1173_485548:2-nf] by the Word which is equal to Himself, by whom He always and unchangeably utters Himself. For He is not Himself the Word, as He is not the Son nor the image. But in speaking (putting aside those words of God in time which are produced in the creature, for they sound and pass away,-in speaking then) by that co-eternal Word, He is not understood singly, but with that Word itself, without whom certainly He does not speak. Is He then in such way wise as He is one who speaks, so as to be in such way wisdom, as He is the Word, and so that to be the Word is to be wisdom, that is, also to be power, so that power and wisdom and the Word may be the same, and be so called relatively as the Son and the image: and that the Father is not singly powerful or wise, but together with the power and wisdom itself which He begat (genuit); just as He is not singly one who speaks, but by that Word and together with that Word which He begat; and in like way great by that and together with that greatness, which He begat? And if He is not great by one thing, and God by another, but great by that whereby He is God, because it is not one thing to Him to be great and another to be God; it follows that neither is He God singly, but by that and together with that deity (deitas) which He begat; so that the Son is the deity of the Father, as He is the wisdom and power of the Father, and as He is the Word and image of the Father. And because it is not one thing to Him to be, another to be God, the Son is also the essence of the Father, as He is His Word and image. And hence also-except that He is the Father [the Unbegotten]-the Father is not anything unless because He has the Son; so that not only that which is meant by Father (which it is manifest He is not called relatively to Himself but to the Son, and therefore is the Father because He has the Son), but that which He is in respect to His own substance is so called, because He begat His own essence. For as He is great, only with that greatness which He begat, so also He is, only with that essence which He begat; because it is not one thing to Him to be, and another to be great. Is He therefore the Father of His own essence, in the same way as He is the Father of His own greatness, as He is the Father of His own power and wisdom? since His greatness is the same as His power, and His essence the same as His greatness.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_13_book_vii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"4.

On this account, then,when anything concerning wisdom is declared or narrated in the Scriptures, whether as itself speaking, or where anything is spoken of it, the Son chiefly is intimated to us. And by the example of Him who is the image, let us also not depart from Gods since we also are the Image of God: not indeed that which is equal to Him, since we are made so by the Father through the Son, and not born of the Father, as that is. And we are so, because we are enlightened with light; but that is so, because it is the light that enlightens; and which, therefore, being without pattern, is to us a pattern. For He does not imitate any one going before Him, in respect to the Father, from whom He is never separable at all, since He is the very same substance with Him from whom He is. But we by striving imitate Him who abides, and follow Him who stands still, and walking in Him, reach out towards Him; because He is made for us a way in time by His humiliation, which is to us an eternal abiding-place by His divinity. For since to pure intellectual spirits, who have not fallen through pride, He gives an example in the form of God and as equal with God and as God; so, in order that He might also give Himself as an example of returning to fallen man who on account of the uncleanness of sins and the punishment of mortality cannot see God, \"He emptied Himself;\" not by changing His own divinity, but by assuming our changeableness: and \"taking upon Him the form of a servant\"[fn-11-P1191_504612:12-nf] He came to us into this world,\"[fn-11-P1192_504662:13-nf] who \"was in this world,\" because \"the world was made by Him;\"[fn-11-P1193_504743:14-nf] that He might be an example upwards to those who see God, an example downwards to those who admire man, an example to the sound to persevere, an example to the sick to be made whole, an example to those who are to die that they may not fear, an example to the dead that they may rise again, \"that in all things He might have the pre-eminence.\"[fn-11-P1194_505104:15-nf] So that, because man ought not to follow any except God to blessedness, and yet cannot perceive God; by following God made man, he might follow at once Him whom he could perceive, and whom he ought to follow. Let us then love Him and cleave to Him, by charity spread abroad in our hearts, through the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.[fn-11-P1195_505458:16-nf] It is not therefore to be wondered at, if, on account of the example which the Image, which is equal to the Father, gives to us, in order that we may be refashioned after the image of God, Scripture, when it speaks of wisdom, speaks of the Son, whom we follow by living wisely; although the Father also is wisdom, as He is both light and God.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":45,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_08_the_perpetual_virginity_of_blessed_mary","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"18. There are things which, in your extreme ignorance, you had never read, and therefore you neglected the whole range of Scripture and employed your madness in outraging the Virgin, like the man in the story who being unknown to everybody and finding that he could devise no good deed by which to gain renown, burned the temple of Diana: and when no one revealed the sacrilegious act, it is said that he himself went up and down proclaiming that he was the man who had applied the fire. The rulers of Ephesus were curious to know what made him do this thing, whereupon he replied that if he could not have fame for good deeds, all men should give him credit for bad ones. Grecian history relates the incident. But you do worse. You have set on fire the temple of the Lord's body, you have defiled the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit from which you are determined to make a team of four brethren and a heap of sisters come forth. In a word, joining in the chorus of the Jews, you say,[fn-60-P6090_1817429:72-nf] \"Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? and his sisters, are they not all with us? The word all would not be used if there were not a crowd of them.\" Pray tell me, who, before you appeared, was acquainted with this blasphemy? who thought the theory worth two-pence? You have gained your desire, and are become notorious by crime. For myself who am your opponent, although we live in the[fn-60-P6091_1817938:73-nf] same city, I don't know, as the saying is, whether you are white or black. I pass over faults of diction which abound in every book you write. I say not a word about your absurd introduction. Good heavens! I do not ask for eloquence, since, having none yourself, you applied for a supply of it to your brother Craterius. I do not ask for grace of style, I look for purity of soul: for with Christians it is the greatest of solecisms and of vices of style to introduce anything base either in word or action. I am come to the conclusion of my argument. I will deal with you as though I had as yet prevailed nothing; and you will find yourself on the horns of a dilemma. It is clear that our Lord's brethren bore the name in the same way that Joseph was called his father:[fn-60-P6092_1818729:74-nf] \"I and thy father sought thee sorrowing.\" It was His mother who said this, not the Jews. The Evangelist himself relates that His father and His mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning Him, and there are similar passages which we have already quoted in which Joseph and Mary are called his parents. Seeing that you have been foolish enough to persuade yourself that the Greek manuscripts are corrupt, you will perhaps plead the diversity of readings. I therefore come to the Gospel of John, and there it is plainly written,[fn-60-P6093_1819298:75-nf] \"Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" You will certainly find this in your manuscript. Now tell me, how is Jesus the son of Joseph when it is clear that He was begotten of the Holy Ghost? Was Joseph His true father? Dull as you are, you will not venture to say that. Was he His reputed father? If so, let the same rule be applied to them when they are called brethren, that you apply to Joseph when he is called father.","title":"The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_08_lecture_iii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"14.

Lo, the Father commands, the Son obeys; is the Son therefore not of the same Nature, because the One commands, and the Other obeys? Give me two men, father and son; they are two men: he that commands is a man; he that obeys is a man; he that commands and he that obeys have one and the same nature. Does not he that commands, beget a son of his own nature? Does he who obeys, by obeying lose his nature? Now take for the present, as you thus take two men, the Father commanding, the Son obeying, yet God and God. But the first two together are two men, the Latter together is but One God; this is a divine miracle. Meanwhile if you would that with you I acknowledge the obedience, do you first with me acknowledge the Nature. The Father begat That which Himself is. If the Father begat ought else than what Himself is, He did not beget a true Son.

Had God a womb? Shall we imagine that God was fashioned with bodily members? God forbid! And why said He, \"From the womb,\" but that it might be understood that He begat Him of His Own Substance?

When the Lord Jesus taught them that prayer, they were yet babes, weak, carnal; they were not yet spiritual, who have no sin. What then, Brethren? When they became spiritual, did they cease to pray? Then Christ ought to have said, \"Pray in such wise now;\" and to have given them, when spiritual, another prayer. It is one andthe same.

But Alypius imagined the Catholics to believe that God was so clothed with flesh, that, besides God and flesh, there was no soul in Christ, and did not think that a human mind was ascribed to Him. And, because He was thoroughly persuaded that the actions which were recorded of Him could not be performed except by a vital and rational creature, he moved the more slowly towards the Christian faith. But, learning afterwards that this was the error of the Apollinarian heretics,[fn-10-P1097_455393:76-nf] he rejoiced in the Catholic faith, and was conformed to it.

And so truly in Christ are all things recalled to \"the beginning,\" that even faith returns from circumcision to the integrity of that (original) flesh, as \"it was from the beginning; and freedom of meats and abstinence from blood alone, as \"it was from the beginning; \"and the individuality of marriage, as \"it was from the beginning; \"and the restriction of divorce, which was not \"from the beginning; \"and lastly, the whole man into Paradise, where he was \"from the beginning.\" Why, then, ought He not to restore Adam thither at least as a monogamist, who cannot present him in so entire perfection as he was when dismissed thence?

But, presenting to your weakness the gift of the example of His own flesh, the more perfect Adam-that is, Christ, more perfect on this account as well (as on others), that He was more entirely pure-stands before you, if you are willing (to copy Him), as a voluntary celibate in the flesh. If, however, you are unequal (to that perfection), He stands before you a monogamist in spirit, having one Church as His spouse, according to the figure of Adam and of Eve, which (figure) the apostle interprets of that great sacrament of Christ and the Church, (teaching that), through the spiritual, it was analogous to the carnal monogamy. You see, therefore, after what manner, renewing your origin even in Christ, you cannot trace down that (origin) without the profession of monogamy; unless, (that is), you be in flesh what He is in spirit; albeit withal, what He was in flesh, you equally ought to have been.","title":"VI.

For how can it be that \"the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,\" if what follows is also true: \"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man?\"[fn-13-P1363_675512:56-nf] For who but a righteous man lawfully uses the law? Yet it is not for him that it is made, but for the unrighteous. Must then the unrighteous man, in order that he may be justified,- that is, become a righteous man,- lawfully use the law, to lead him, as by the schoolmaster's hand,[fn-13-P1364_675812:57-nf] to that grace by which alone he can fulfil what the law commands? Now it is freely that he is justified thereby,-that is, on account of no antecedent merits of his own works; \"otherwise grace is no more grace,\"[fn-13-P1365_676042:58-nf] since it is bestowed on us, not because we have done good works, but that we may be able to do them,- in other words, not because we have fulfilled the law, but in order that we may be able to fulfil the law. Now He said, \"I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil it,\"[fn-13-P1366_676335:59-nf] of whom it was said, \"We have seen His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\"[fn-13-P1367_676474:60-nf] This is the glory which is meant in the words, \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\"[fn-13-P1368_676593:61-nf] and this the grace of which he speaks in the next verse, \"Being justified freely by His grace.\"[fn-13-P1369_676709:62-nf] The unrighteous man therefore lawfully uses the law, that he may become righteous; but when he has become so, he must no longer use it as a chariot, for he has arrived at his journey's end,- or rather (that I may employ the apostle's own simile, which has been already mentioned) as a schoolmaster, seeing that he is now fully learned. How then is the law not made for a righteous man, if it is necessary for the righteous man too, not that hemay be brought as an unrighteous man to the grace that justifies, but that he may use it lawfully, now that he is righteous? Does not the case perhaps stand thus, -nay, not perhaps, but rather certainly,- that the man who is become righteous thus lawfully uses the law, when he applies it to alarm the unrighteous, so that whenever the disease of some unusual desire begins in them, too, to be augmented by the incentive of the law's prohibition and an increased amount of transgression, they may in faith flee for refuge to the grace that justifies, and becoming delighted with the sweet pleasures of holiness, may escape the penalty of the law's menacing letter through the spirit's soothing gift? In this way the two statements will not be contrary, nor will they be repugnant to each other: even the righteous man may lawfully use a good law, and yet the law be not made for the righteous man; for it is not by the law that he becomes righteous, but by the law of faith, which led him to believe that no other resource was possible to his weakness for fulfilling the precepts which \"the law of works\"[fn-13-P1370_678276:63-nf] commanded, except to be assisted by the grace of God.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":47,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":48,"source_paragraph":"163","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"If therefore the apostle, when he mentioned that the Gentiles do by nature the things contained in the law, and have the work of the law written in their hearts,[fn-16-P1621_745051:224-nf] intended those to be understood who believed in Christ, - who do not come to the faith like the Jews, through a precedent law,-there is no good reason why we should endeavour to distinguish them from those to whom the Lord by the prophet promises the new covenant, telling them that He will write His laws in their hearts,[fn-16-P1622_745398:225-nf] inasmuch as they too, by the grafting which he says had been made of the wild olive, belong to the self-same olive-tree,[fn-16-P1623_745542:226-nf] -in other words, to the same people of God.

These persons also believe in God; for if they had no faith in Him at all, neither would they of course have any dread of the penalty of His law. This, however, is not the faith which the apostle commends. He says: \"Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-17-P1735_774857:308-nf] The fear, then, of which we speak is slavish; and therefore, even though there be in it a belief in the Lord, yet righteousness is not loved by it, but condemnation is feared. God's children, however, exclaim, \"Abba, Father,\"-one of which words they of the circumcision utter; the other, they of the uncircumcision,-the Jew first, and then the Greek;[fn-17-P1736_775230:309-nf] since there is \"one God, which justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.\"[fn-17-P1737_775357:310-nf] When indeed they utter this call, they seek something; and what do they seek, but that which they hunger and thirst after? And what else is this but that which is said of them, \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled?\"[fn-17-P1738_775648:311-nf] Let, then, those who are under the law pass over hither, and become sons instead of slaves; and yet not so as to cease to be slaves, but so as, while they are sons, still to serve their Lord and Father freely. For even this have they received; for the Only-begotten \"gave them power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name;\"[fn-17-P1739_776017:312-nf] and He advised them to ask, to seek, and to knock, in order to receive, to find, and to have the gate opened to them,[fn-17-P1740_776154:313-nf] adding by way of rebuke, the words : \"If ye, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\"[fn-17-P1741_776373:314-nf] When, therefore, that strength of sin, the law,[fn-17-P1742_776443:315-nf] inflamed the sting of death, even sin, to take occasion and by the commandment work all manner of concupiscence in them,[fn-17-P1743_776586:316-nf] of whom were they to ask for the gift of continence but of Him who knows how to give good gifts to His children? Perhaps, however, a man, in his folly, is unaware that no one can be continent except God give him the gift. To know this, indeed, he requires Wisdom herself.[fn-17-P1744_776878:317-nf] Why, then, does he not listen to the Spirit of his Father, speaking through Christ's apostle, or even Christ Himself, who says in His gospel, \"Seek and ye shall find; \"[fn-17-P1745_777070:318-nf] and who also says to us, speaking by His apostle: \"If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given to him. Let him, however, ask in faith, nothing wavering? \"[fn-17-P1746_777329:319-nf] This is the faith by which the just man lives;[fn-17-P1747_777397:320-nf] this is the faith whereby he believes on Him who justifies the ungodly;[fn-17-P1748_777488:321-nf] this is the faith through which boasting is excluded,[fn-17-P1749_777561:322-nf] either by the retreat of that with which we become self-inflated, or by the rising of that with which we glory in the Lord. This, again, is the faith by which we procure that largess of the Spirit, of which it is said: \"We indeed through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.\"[fn-17-P1750_777877:323-nf] But this admits of the further question, Whether he meant by \"the hope of righteousness\" that by which righteousness hopes, or that whereby righteousness is itself hoped for? For the just man, who lives by faith, hopes undoubtedly for eternal life; and the faith likewise, which hungers and thirsts for righteousness, makes progress therein by the renewal of the inward man day by day,[fn-17-P1751_778281:324-nf] and hopes to be satiated therewith in that eternal life, where shall be realized that which is said of God by the psalm: \"Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.\"[fn-17-P1752_778470:325-nf] This, moreover, is the faith whereby they are saved to whom it is said: \"By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\"[fn-17-P1753_778822:326-nf] This, in short, is the faith which works not by fear, but by love;[fn-17-P1754_778910:327-nf] not by dreading punishment, but by loving righteousness. Whence, therefore, arises this love,-that is to say, this charity,-by which faith works, if not from the source whence faith itself obtained it? For it would not be within us, to what extent soever it is in us, if it were not diffused in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us.[fn-17-P1755_779272:328-nf] Now \"the love of God\" is said to be shed abroad in our hearts, not because He loves us, but because He makes us lovers of Himself; just as \"the righteousness of God\"[fn-17-P1756_779456:329-nf] is used in the sense of our being made righteous by His gift; and \"the salvation of the Lord,\"[fn-17-P1757_779572:330-nf] in that we are saved by Him; and \"the faith of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-17-P1758_779653:331-nf] because He makes us believers in Him. This is that righteousness of God, which He not only teaches us by the precept of His law, but also bestows upon us by the gift of His Spirit.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_14_on_the_spirit_and_the_letter","source_chapter":60,"source_paragraph":"187","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Let us then, first of all, lay down this proposition, and see whether it satisfies the question before us: that free will, naturally assigned by the Creator to our rational soul, is such a neutral[fn-17-P1768_781845:335-nf] power, as can either incline towards faith, or turn towards unbelief. Consequently a man cannot be said to have even that will with which he believes in God, without having received it; since this rises at the call of God out of the free will which he received naturally when he was created. God no doubt wishes all men to be saved[fn-17-P1769_782338:336-nf] and to come into the knowledge of the truth; but yet not so as to take away from them free. will, for the good or the evil use of which they may be most righteously judged. This being the case, unbelievers indeed do contrary to the will of God when they do not believe His gospel; nevertheless they do not therefore overcome His will, but rob their own selves of the great, nay, the very greatest, good, and implicate themselves in penalties of punishment, destined to experience the power of Him in punishments whose mercy in His gifts they despised. Thus God's will is for ever invincible; but it would be vanquished, unless it devised what to do with such as despised it, or if these despises could in any way escape from the retribution which He has appointed for such as they. Suppose a master, for example, who should say to his servants, I wish you to labour in my vineyard, and, after your work is done, to feast and take your rest l but who, at the same time, should require any who refused to work to grind in the mill ever after. Whoever neglected such a command would evidently act contrary to the master's will; but he would do more than that,-he would vanquish that will, if he also escaped the mill. This, however, cannot possibly happen under the government of God. Whence it is written, \"God hath spoken once,\"-that is, irrevocably,-although the passage may refer also to His one only Word.[fn-17-P1770_783766:337-nf] He then adds what it is which He had irrevocably uttered, saying: \"Twice have I heard this, that power belongeth unto God. Also unto Thee, O Lord, doth mercy belong: because Thou wilt render to every man according to his work.\"[fn-17-P1771_784012:338-nf] He therefore will be guilty unto condemnation under God's power, who shall think too contemptuously of His mercy to believe in Him. But whosoever shall put his trust in Him, and yield himself up to Him, for the forgiveness of all his sins, for the cure of all his corruption, and for the kindling and illumination of his soul by His warmth and light, shall have good works by his grace; and by them[fn-17-P1772_784436:339-nf] he shall be even in his body redeemed from the corruption of death, crowned, satisfied with blessings,-not temporal, but eternal,-above what we can ask or understand.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_09_lecture_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"4.

Coming to the Gospel he sets before us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his mother-in-law, and, with a shamelessness to which we have now grown accustomed, fails to understand that they, too, ought to have been reckoned among those who served the Law. For the Gospel had no being before the crucifixion of Christ-it was consecrated by His passion and by His blood. In accordance with this rule Peter and the other Apostles (I must give Jovinianus something now and then out of my abundance) had indeed wives, but those which they had taken before they knew the Gospel. But once they were received into the Apostolate, they forsook the offices of marriage. For when Peter, representing the Apostles, says to the Lord:[fn-63-P6320_1936460:161-nf] \"Lo we have left all and followed thee,\" the Lord answered him,[fn-63-P6321_1936546:162-nf] \"Verily I say unto you, there is no man that hath left house or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.\" But if, in order to show that all the Apostles had wives, he meets us with the words[fn-63-P6322_1936898:163-nf] \"Have we no right to lead about women or wives\" (for gunh in Greek has both meanings) \"even as the rest of the apostles, and Cephas, and the brethren of the Lord?\" let him add what is found in the Greek copies, \"Have we no right to lead about women that are sisters, or wives?\" This makes it clear that the writer referred to other holy women, who, in accordance with Jewish custom, ministered to their teachers of their substance, as we read was the practice with even our Lord himself. Where there is a previous reference to eating and drinking, and the outlay of money, and mention is afterwards made of women that are sisters, it is quite clear, as we have said, that we must understand, not wives, but those women who ministered of their substance. And we read the same account in the Old Testament of the Shunammite who was wont to welcome Elisha, and to put for him a table, and bread, and a candlestick, and the rest. At all events if we take gunaikaj to mean wives, not women, the addition of the word sisters destroys the effect of the word wives, and shews that they were related in spirit, not by wedlock. Nevertheless, with the exception of the Apostle Peter, it is not openly stated that the Apostles had wives; and since the statement is made of one while nothing is said about the rest, we must understand that those of whom Scripture gives no such description had no wives. Yet Jovinianus, who has arrayed against us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his wife's mother, should know, that John was the son of Zacharias and Elizabeth, that is, a virgin was the offspring of marriage, the Gospel of the law, chastity of matrimony; so that by a virgin prophet the virgin Lord might be both announced and baptized. But we might say concerning Peter, that he had a mother-in-law when he believed, and no longer had a wife, although in the[fn-63-P6323_1939524:164-nf] \"Sentences\" we read of both his wife and daughter. But for the present our argument must be based wholly on Scripture. He has made his appeal to the Apostles, because he thinks that they, who hold the chief authority in our moral system and are the typical Christian teachers, were not virgins. If, then, we allow that they were not virgins (and, with the exception of Peter, the point cannot be proved), yet I must tell him that it is to the Apostles that the words of Isaiah relate:[fn-63-P6324_1940049:165-nf] \"Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.\" So, then, they who were by birth Jews could not under the Gospel recover the virginity which they had lost in Judaism. And yet John, one of the disciples, who is related to have been the youngest of the Apostles, and who was a virgin when he embraced Christianity, remained a virgin, and on that account was more beloved by our Lord, and lay upon the breast of Jesus. And what Peter, who had had a wife, did not dare ask,[fn-63-P6325_1940620:166-nf] he requested John to ask. And after the resurrection, when Mary Magdalene told them that the Lord had risen,[fn-63-P6326_1940754:167-nf] they both ran to the sepulchre, but John outran Peter. And when they were fishing in the ship on the lake of Gennesaret, Jesus stood upon the shore, and the Apostles knew not who it was they saw;[fn-63-P6327_1940972:168-nf] the virgin alone recognized a virgin, and said to Peter, \"It is the Lord.\" Again, after hearing the prediction that he must be bound by another, and led whither he would not, and must suffer on the cross. Peter said, \"Lord what shall this man do?\" being unwilling to desert John, with whom he had always been united. Our Lord said to him, \"What is that to thee if I wish him so to be?\" Whence the saying went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die. Here we have a proof that virginity does not die, and that the defilement of marriage is not washed away by the blood of martyrdom, but virginity abides with Christ, and its sleep is not death but a passing to another state. If, however, Jovinianus should obstinately contend that John was not a virgin, (whereas we have maintained that his virginity was the cause of the special love our Lord bore to him), let him explain, if he was not a virgin, why it was that he was loved more than the other Apostles. But you say,[fn-63-P6328_1941990:169-nf] the Church was rounded upon Peter: although[fn-63-P6329_1942059:170-nf] elsewhere the same is attributed to all the Apostles, and they all receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the strength of the Church depends upon them all alike, yet one among the twelve is chosen so that when a head has been appointed, there may be no occasion for schism. But why was not John chosen, who was a virgin? Deference was paid to age, because Peter was the eider: one who was a youth, I may say almost a boy, could not be set over men of advanced age; and a good master who was bound to remove every occasion of strife among his disciples, and who had said to them,[fn-63-P6330_1942702:171-nf] \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,\" and,[fn-63-P6331_1942783:172-nf] \"He that is the greater among you, let him be the least of all,\" would not be thought to afford cause of envy against the youth whom he had loved. We maybe sure that John was then a boy because ecclesiastical history most clearly proves that he lived to the reign of Trajan, that is, he fell asleep in the sixty-eighth year after our Lord's passion, as I have briefly noted in my treatise on Illustrious Men.[fn-63-P6332_1943234:173-nf] Peter is an Apostle, and John is an Apostle-the one a married man, the other a virgin; but Peter is an Apostle only, John is both an Apostle and an Evangelist, and a prophet. An Apostle, because he wrote to the Churches as a master; an Evangelist, because he composed a Gospel, a thing which no other of the Apostles, excepting Matthew, did; a prophet, for he saw in the island of Patmos, to which he had been banished by the Emperor Domitian as a martyr for the Lord, an Apocalypse containing the boundless mysteries of the future Tertullian, more over, relates that he was sent to Rome, and that having been plunged into a jar of boiling oil he came out fresher and more active than when he went in. But his very Gospel is widely different from the rest. Matthew as though he were writing of a man begins thus: \"The book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham;\" Luke begins with the priesthood of Zacharias; Mark with a prophecy of the prophets Malachi and Isaiah. The first has the face of a man, on account of the genealogical table; the second, the face of a calf, on account of the priesthood; the third, the face of a lion, on account of the voice of one crying in the desert,[fn-63-P6333_1944501:174-nf] \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" But John like an eagle soars aloft, and reaches the Father Himself, and says,[fn-63-P6334_1944656:175-nf] \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God,\" and so on. The virgin writer expounded mysteries which the married could not, and to briefly sum up all and show how great was the privilege of John, or rather of virginity in John, the Virgin Mother[fn-63-P6335_1944999:176-nf] was entrusted by the Virgin Lord to the Virgin disciple.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_16_book_x","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But with these more estimable philosophers we have no dispute in this matter. For they perceived, and in various forms abundantly expressed in their writings, that these spirits have the same source of happiness as ourselves,-a certain intelligible light, which is their God, and is different from themselves, and illumines them that they may be penetrated with light, and enjoy perfect happiness in the participation of God. Plotinus, commenting on Plato, repeatedly and strongly asserts that not even the soul which they believe to be the soul of the world, derives its blessedness from any other source than we do, viz., from that Light which is distinct from it and created it, and by whose intelligible illumination it enjoys light in things intelligible. He also compares those spiritual things to the vast and conspicuous heavenly bodies, as if God were the sun, and the soul the moon; for they suppose that the moon derives its light from the sun. That great Platonist, therefore, says that the rational soul, or rather the intellectual soul,-in which class he comprehends the souls of the blessed immortals who inhabit heaven,-has no nature superior to it save God, the Creator of the world and the soul itself, and that these heavenly spirits derive their blessed life, and the light of truth from their blessed life, and the light of truth, the source as ourselves, agreeing with the gospel where we read, \"There was a man sent from God whose name was John; the same came for a witness to bear witness of that Light, that through Him all might believe.

It was therefore truly said that man is cleansed only by a Principle, although the Platonists erred in speaking in the plural of principles. But Porphyry, being under the dominion of these envious powers, whose influence he was at once ashamed of and afraid to throw off, refused to recognize that Christ is the Principle by whose incarnation we are purified. Indeed he despised Him, because of the flesh itself which He assumed, that He might offer a sacrifice for our purification,-a great mystery, unintelligible to Porphyry's pride, which that true and benignant Redeemer brought low by His humility, manifesting Himself to mortals by the mortality which He assumed, and which the malignant and deceitful mediators are proud of wanting, promising, as the boon of immortals, a deceptive assistance to wretched men. Thus the good and true Mediator showed that it is sin which is evil, and not the substance or nature of flesh; for this, together with the human soul, could without sin be both assumed and retained, and laid down in death, and changed to something better by resurrection. He showed also that death itself, although the punishment of sin, was submitted to by Him for our sakes without sin, and must not be evaded by sin on our part, but rather, if opportunity serves, be borne for righteousness' sake. For he was able to expiate sins by dying, because He both died, and not for sin of His own. But He has not been recognized by Porphyry as the Principle, otherwise he would have recognized Him as the Purifier. The Principle is neither the flesh nor the human soul in Christ but the Word by which all things were made. The flesh, therefore, does not by its own virtue purify, but by virtue of the Word by which it was assumed, when \"the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.\"[fn-17-P1718_974446:52-nf] For speaking mystically of eating His flesh, when those who did not understand Him were offended and went away, saying, \"This is an hard saying, who can hear it?\" He answered to the rest who remained, \"It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.\"[fn-17-P1719_974729:53-nf] The Principle, therefore, having assumed a human soul and flesh, cleanses the soul and flesh of believers. Therefore, when the Jews asked Him who He was, He answered that He was the Principle.[fn-17-P1720_974944:54-nf] And this we carnal and feeble men, liable to sin, and involved in the darkness of ignorance, could not possibly understand, unless we were cleansed and healed by Him, both by means of what we were, and of what we were not. For we were men, but we were not righteous; whereas in His incarnation there was a human nature, but it was righteous, and not sinful. This is the mediation whereby a hand is stretched to the lapsed and fallen; this is the seed \"ordained by angels,\" by whose ministry the law also was given enjoining the worship of one God, and promising that this Mediator should come.","title":"Book X","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_16_book_x","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"102","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"But in order to your acquiescence in this truth, it is lowliness that is requisite, and to this it is extremely difficult to bend you.

But here, in place of following Porphyry, you ought rather to have corrected him, especially since you agree with him in believing such incredible things about the soul of this visible world and huge material frame.

Why is it, then, that when the Christian faith is pressed upon you, you forget, or pretend to ignore, what you habitually discuss or teach? Why is it that you refuse to be Christians, on the ground that you hold opinions which, in fact, you yourselves demolish? Is it not because Christ came in lowliness, and ye are proud? The precise nature of the resurrection bodies of the saints may sometimes occasion discussion among those who are best read in the Christian Scriptures; yet there is not among us the smallest doubt that they shall be everlasting, and of a nature exemplified in the instance of Christ's risen body. But whatever be their nature, since we maintain that they shall be absolutely incorruptible and immortal, and shall offer no hindrance to the soul's contemplation, by which it is fixed in God, and as you say that among the celestials the bodies of the eternally blessed are eternal, why do you maintain that, in order to blessedness, every body must be escaped from? Why do you thus seek such a plausible reason for escaping from the Christian faith, if not because, as I again say, Christ is humble and ye proud? Are ye ashamed to be corrected? This is the vice of the proud. It is, forsooth, a degradation for learned men to pass from the school of Plato to the discipleship of Christ, who by His Spirit taught a fisherman to think and to say, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

The sun, too, and the other stars, you not only acknowledge to be bodies, in which you have the cordial assent of all seeing men, but also, in obedience to what you reckon a profounder insight, you declare that they are very blessed animals, and eternal, together with their bodies. Why is it, then, that when the Christian faith is pressed upon you, you forget, or pretend to ignore, what you habitually discuss or teach? Why is it that you refuse to be Christians, on the ground that you hold opinions which, in fact, you yourselves demolish? Is it not because Christ came in lowliness, and ye are proud? The precise nature of the resurrection bodies of the saints may sometimes occasion discussion among those who are best read in the Christian Scriptures; yet there is not among us the smallest doubt that they shall be everlasting, and of a nature exemplified in the instance of Christ's risen body. But whatever be their nature, since we maintain that they shall be absolutely incorruptible and immortal, and shall offer no hindrance to the soul's contemplation, by which it is fixed in God, and as you say that among the celestials the bodies of the eternally blessed are eternal, why do you maintain that, in order to blessedness, every body must be escaped from? Why do you thus seek such a plausible reason for escaping from the Christian faith, if not because, as I again say, Christ is humble and ye proud? Are ye ashamed to be corrected? This is the vice of the proud. It is, forsooth, a degradation for learned men to pass from the school of Plato to the discipleship of Christ, who by His Spirit taught a fisherman to think and to say, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\"[fn-17-P1746_999675:64-nf] The old saint Simplicianus, afterwards bishop of Milan, used to tell me that a certain Platonist was in the habit of saying that this opening passage of the holy gospel, entitled, According to John, should be written in letters of gold, and hung up in all churches in the most conspicuous place. But the proud scorn to take God for their Master, because \"the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\"[fn-17-P1747_1000093:65-nf] So that, with these miserable creatures, it is not enough that they are sick, but they boast of their sickness, and are ashamed of the medicine which could heal them.

For unless He had given it to all by no means would He have habitually permitted even proselytes out of the nations to have access to it. But-as is congruous with the goodness of God, and with His equity, as the Fashioner of mankind-He gave to all nations the selfsame law, which at definite and stated times He enjoined should be observed, when He willed, and through whom He willed, and as He willed. For in the beginning of the world He gave to Adam himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of the tree planted in the midst of paradise; but that, if they did contrariwise, by death they were to die.[fn-20-P2047_698574:16-nf] Which law had continued enough for them, had it been kept. For in this law given to Adam we recognise in embryo[fn-20-P2048_698720:17-nf] all the precepts which afterwards sprouted forth when given through Moses; that is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart and out of thy whole soul; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;[fn-20-P2049_698941:18-nf] Thou shalt not kill; Thou shall not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; False witness thou shall not utter; Honour thy father and mother; and, That which is another's, shall thou not covet. For the primordial law was given to Adam and Eve in paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of God. In short, if they had loved the Lord their God, they would not have contravened His precept; if they had habitually loved their neighbour-that is, themselves[fn-20-P2050_699548:19-nf] -they would not have believed the persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed murder upon themselves,[fn-20-P2051_699698:20-nf] by falling[fn-20-P2052_699740:21-nf] from immortality, by contravening God's precept; from theft also they would have abstained, if they had not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had been anxious to skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their God; nor would they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating devil, by believing him that they would be \"like God; \"and thus they would not have offended God either, as their Father, who had fashioned them from clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if they had not coveted another's, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit. Therefore, in this general and primordial law of God, the observance of which, in the case of the tree's fruit, He had sanctioned, we recognise enclosed all the precepts specially of the posterior Law, which germinated when disclosed at their proper times. For the subsequent superinduction of a law is the work of the same Being who had before premised a precept; since it is His province withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to form, righteous creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it? if He advances who begins? In short, before the Law of Moses,[fn-20-P2053_701005:22-nf] written in stone-tables, I contend that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood naturally, and by the fathers was habitually kept. For whence was Noah \"found righteous,\"[fn-20-P2054_701248:23-nf] if in his case the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was Abraham accounted \"a friend of God,\"[fn-20-P2055_701408:24-nf] if not on the ground of equity and righteousness, (in the observance) of a natural law? Whence was Melchizedek named \"priest of the most high God,\"[fn-20-P2056_701591:25-nf] if, before the priesthood of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer sacrifices to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from Egypt, after the interval and spaces of four hundred years. In fact, it was after Abraham's \"four hundred and thirty years\"[fn-20-P2057_702033:26-nf] that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God's law was anterior even to Moses, and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient; (existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses' Law as to the primitive law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better; and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as \"the law was given through Moses\"[fn-20-P2058_702739:27-nf] at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law's precepts answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man's salvation. In fine, let him who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered \"friends of God.\" For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges? At all events, in settling him in paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise. Therefore, since God originated Adam uncircumcised, and inobservant of the Sabbath, consequently his offspring also, Abel, offering Him sacrifices, uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was by Him commended; while He accepted[fn-20-P2059_703780:28-nf] what he was offering in simplicity of heart, and reprobated the sacrifice of his brother Cain, who was not rightly dividing what he was offering.[fn-20-P2060_703955:29-nf] Noah also, uncircumcised-yes, and inobservant of the Sabbath-God freed from the deluge.[fn-20-P2061_704104:30-nf] For Enoch, too, most righteous man, uncircumcised and in-observant of the Sabbath, He translated from this world;[fn-20-P2062_704259:31-nf] who did not first taste[fn-20-P2063_704320:32-nf] death, in order that, being a candidate for eternal life,[fn-20-P2064_704418:33-nf] he might by this time show us that we also may, without the burden of the law of Moses, please God. Melchizedek also, \"the priest of the most high God,\" uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was chosen to the priesthood of God.[fn-20-P2065_704730:34-nf] Lot, withal, the brother[fn-20-P2066_704771:35-nf] of Abraham, proves that it was for the merits of righteousness, without observance of the law, that he was freed from the conflagration of the Sodomites.[fn-20-P2067_704969:36-nf] ","title":"An Answer to the Jews.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"105","folder":"ANF-03","text":"\"But if the Christ,\" say they, \"who is believed to be coming is not called Jesus, why is he who is come called Jesus Christ? \"Well, each name will meet in the Christ of God, in whom is found likewise the appellation[fn-22-P2283_756698:160-nf] Jesus.

We, too, indeed have precedents in the self-same antiquity on the side of our opinion,-(precedents) of judgment not merely not waived, but even summarily executed upon fornication.

But to them from whom \"the kingdom\" is taken away, of course the life which exists in the kingdom is not permitted either.

Flee fornication.\"[fn-15-P1513_443181:172-nf] If revocable by pardon, in what sense am I to flee it, to turn adulterer anew?

If you wish to imbibe to the utmost all knowledge of the apostle, in order to understand with what an axe of censorship he lops, and eradicates, and extirpates, every forest of lusts, for fear of permitting aught to regain strength and sprout again; behold him desiring souls to keep a fast from the legitimate fruit of nature-the apple, I mean, of marriage: \"But with regard to what ye wrote, good it is for a man to have no contact with a woman; but, on account of fornication, let each one have his own wife: let husband to wife, and wife to husband, render what is due.\"[fn-15-P1517_444834:176-nf] Who but must know that it was against his will that he relaxed the bond of this \"good,\" in order to prevent fornication? But if he either has granted, or does grant, indulgence to fornication, of course he has frustrated the design of his own remedy. and will be bound forthwith to put the curb upon the nuptials of continence, if the fornication for the sake of which those nuptials are permitted shall cease to be feared. For (a fornication) which has indulgence granted it will not be feared. And yet he professes that he has granted the use of marriage \"by way of indulgence, not of command.\"[fn-15-P1518_445455:177-nf] For he \"wills\" all to be on a level with himself. But when things lawful are (only) granted by way of indulgence, who hope for things unlawful? \"To the unmarried\" also, \"and widows,\" he says, \"It is good, by his example, to persevere\" (in their present state); \"but if they were too weak, to marry; because it is preferable to marry than to bum.\"[fn-15-P1519_445823:178-nf] With what fires, I pray you, is it preferable to \"burn\"-(the fires) of concupiscence, or (the fires) of penalty? Nay, but if fornication is pardonable, it will not be an object of concupiscence. But it is more (the manner) of an apostle to take forethought for the fires of penalty. Wherefore, if it is penalty which \"burns,\" it follows that fornication, which penalty awaits, is not pardonable. Meantime withal, while prohibiting divorce, he uses the Lord's precept against adultery as an instrument for providing, in place of divorce, either perseverance in widowhood, or else a reconciliation of peace: inasmuch as \"whoever shall have dismissed a wife (for any cause) except the cause of adultery, maketh her commit adultery; and he who marrieth one dismissed by a husband committeth adultery.\"[fn-15-P1520_446646:179-nf] What powerful remedies does the Holy Spirit furnish, to prevent, to wit, the commission anew of that which He wills not should anew be pardoned!","title":"VII.

But, says our Lord:[fn-68-P6872_2191100:249-nf] \"Thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.\" You see, then, that we are privileged to partake of His essence, not in the realm of nature, but of grace, and the reason why we are beloved of the Father is that He has loved the Son; and the members are loved, those namely of the body.[fn-68-P6873_2191409:250-nf] \"For as many as received Christ, to them gave He power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\" The Word was made flesh that we might pass from the flesh into the Word. The Word did not cease to be what He had been; nor did the human nature lose that which it was by birth. The glory was increased, the nature was not changed. Do you ask how we are made one body with Christ?Your creator shall be your instructor:[fn-68-P6874_2191975:251-nf] \"He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me. This is the bread which came down out of heaven.\" But the Evangelist John, who had drunk in wisdom from the breast of Christ, agrees herewith, and says:[fn-68-P6875_2192350:252-nf] \"Hereby know we that we abide in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.\" If you believe in Christ, as the apostles believed, you shall be made one body with them in Christ.

For when he speaks of \"becoming like unto God,\" it is indeed through God's love that men are to be like unto God,-even the love which is \"shed abroad in our hearts,\" not by any ability of nature or the free will within us, but \"by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\"[fn-23-P2325_957463:202-nf] Then, in respect of what the same martyr further says, \"A pure mind is a holy temple for God, and a heart clean and without sin is His best altar\" who knows not that the dean heart must be brought to this perfection, whilst \"the inward man is renewed day by day,\"[fn-23-P2326_957745:203-nf] but yet not without the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord? Again, when he says, \"A man of chastity and without sin has receded power from God to be a son of God,\" he of course meant it as an admonition that on a man's becoming so chaste and sinless (without raising any question as to where and when this perfection was to be obtained by him,-although in fact it is quite an interesting question among godly men, who are notwithstanding agreed as to the possibility of such perfection on the one hand, and on the other hand its impossibility except through \"the one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus\");[fn-23-P2327_958396:204-nf] -nevertheless, as I began to say, Xystus designed his words to be an admonition that, on any man's attiring such a high character, and thereby being rightly reckoned to be among the sons of God, the attainment must not be thought to have been the work of his own power.

Where Scripture speaks of the world's creation, it is not plainly said whether or when the angels were created; but if mention of them is made, it is implicitly under the name of \"heaven,\" when it is said, \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,\" or perhaps rather under the name of \"light,\" of which presently. But that they were wholly omitted, I am unable to believe, because it is written that God on the seventh day rested from all His works which He made; and this very book itself begins, \"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,\" so that before heaven and earth God seems to have made nothing. Since, therefore, He began with the heavens and the earth,-and the earth itself, as Scripture adds, was at first invisible and formless, light not being as yet made, and darkness covering the face of the deep (that is to say, covering an undefined chaos of earth and sea, for where light is not, darkness must needs be),-and then when all things, which are recorded to have been completed in six days, were created and arranged, how should the angels be omitted, as if they were not among the works of God, from which on the seventh day He rested? Yet, though the fact that the angels are the work of God is not omitted here, it is indeed not explicitly mentioned; but elsewhere Holy Scripture asserts it in the clearest manner. For in the Hymn of the Three Children in the Furnace it was said, \"O all ye works of the Lord bless ye the Lord;\"[fn-18-P1827_1044805:18-nf] and among these works mentioned afterwards in detail, the angels are named. And in the psalm it is said, \"Praise ye the Lord from the heavens, praise Him in the heights. Praise ye Him, all His angels; praise ye Him, all His hosts. Praise ye Him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise Him, ye heaven of heavens; and ye waters that be above the heavens. Let them praise the name of the Lord; for He commanded, and they were created.\"[fn-18-P1828_1045270:19-nf] Here the angels are most expressly and by divine authority said to have been made by God, for of them among the other heavenly things it is said, \"He commanded, and they were created.\" Who, then, will be bold enough to suggest that the angels were made after the six days' creation? If any one is so foolish, his folly is disposed of by a scripture of like authority, where God says, \"When the stars were made, the angels praised me with a loud voice.\"[fn-18-P1829_1045747:20-nf] The angels therefore existed before the stars; and the stars were made the fourth day. Shall we then say that they were made the third day? Far from it; for we know what was made that day. The earth was separated from the water, and each element took its own distinct form, and the earth produced all that grows on it. On the second day, then? Not even on this; for on it the firmament was made between the waters above and beneath, and was called \"Heaven,\" in which firmament the stars were made on the fourth day. There is no question, then, that if the angels are included in the works of God during these six days, they are that light which was called \"Day,\" and whose unity Scripture signalizes by calling that day not the \"first day,\" but \"one day.\"[fn-18-P1830_1046524:21-nf] For the second day, the third, and the rest are not other days; but the same \"one\" day is repeated to complete the number six or seven, so that there should be knowledge both of God's works and of His rest. For when God said, \"Let there be light, and there was light,\" if we are justifiedin understanding in this light the creation of the angels, then certainly they were created partakers of the eternal light which is the unchangeable Wisdom of God, by which all things were made, and whom we call the only-begotten Son of God; so that they, being illumined by the Light that created them, might themselves become light and be called \"Day,\" in participation of that unchangeable Light and Day which is the Word of God, by whom both themselves and all else were made. \"The true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,\"[fn-18-P1831_1047608:22-nf] -this Light lighteth also every pure angel, that he may be light not in himself, but in God; from whom if an angel turn away, he becomes impure, as are all those who are called unclean spirits, and are no longer light in the Lord, but darkness in themselves, being deprived of the participation of Light eternal. For evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name \"evil.\"[fn-18-P1832_1048021:23-nf] ","title":"Book XI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_10_book_iii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"161","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"102.

Such is the result of the teaching of this theologian who affirms of the Lord Artificer of heaven and earth and of all the Creation, the Word of God Who was in the beginning, through Whom are all things, that He owes His existence to such a baseless entity or conception as that unnameable `energy' which he has just invented, and that He is circumscribed by it, as by an enclosing prison of unreality.

Now that we have exposed their plan of belittling the Son under cover of magnifying the Father, the next step is to listen to the exact terms in which they express their own belief concerning the Son. For, since we have to answer in succession each of their allegations and to display on the evidence of Holy Scripture the impiety of their doctrines, we must append, to what they say of the Father, the decisions which they bare put on record concerning the Son, that by a comparison of their confession of the Father with their confession of the Son we may follow a uniform order in our solution of the questions as they arise. They state as their verdict that the Son is not derived from any pre-existent matter, for through Him all things were created, nor yet begotten from God, for nothing can be withdrawn from God; but that He was made out of what was nonexistent, that is, that He is a perfect creature of God, though different from His other creatures. They argue that He is a creature, because it is written, The Lord hath created Me for a beginning of His ways[fn-12-P1219_741631:27-nf] ; that He is the perfect handiwork of God, though different from His other works, they prove, as to the first point, by what Paul writes to the Hebrews, Being made so much belief than the angels, as He possesseth a more excellent name than they[fn-12-P1220_741897:28-nf] , and again, Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus Christ, who is faithful to Him that made Him[fn-12-P1221_742094:29-nf] .

Since, therefore, the words of the Apostle, One God the Father, from Whom are all things, and one Jesus Christ, our Lord, through Whom are all things[fn-12-P1233_749642:36-nf] , form an accurate and complete confession concerning God, let us see what Moses has to say of the beginning of the world. His words are, And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water, and let it divide the water from the water. And it was so, and God made the firmament and God divided the water through the midst[fn-12-P1234_749997:37-nf] . Here, then, you have the God from Whom, and the God through Whom. If you deny it, you must tell us through whom it was that God's work in creation was done, or else point for your explanation to an obedience in things yet uncreated, which, when God said Let there be a firmament, impelled the firmament to establish itself. Such suggestions are inconsistent with the clear sense of Scripture. For all things, as the Prophet says[fn-12-P1235_750447:38-nf] , were made out of nothing; it was no transformation of existing things, but the creation into a perfect form of the non-existent. Through whom? Hear the Evangelist: All things were made through Him. If you ask Who this is, the same Evangelist will tell you: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him[fn-12-P1236_750875:39-nf] . If you are minded to combat the view that it was the Father Who said, Let there be a firmament, the prophet will answer you: He spake, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created[fn-12-P1237_751090:40-nf] . The recorded words, Let there be a firmament, reveal to us that the Father spoke. But in the words which follow, And it was so, in the statement that God did this thing, we must recognise the Person of the Agent. He spake, and they, were made; the Scripture does not say that He willed it, and did it. He commanded, and they were created; you observe that it does not say they came into existence, because it was His pleasure. In that case there would be no office for a Mediator between God and the world which was awaiting its creation. God, from Whom are all things, gives the order for creation which God, through Whom are all things, executes. Under one and the same Name we confess Him Who gave and Him Who fulfilled the command. If you dare to deny that God made is spoken of the Son, how do you explain All things were made through Him? Or the Apostle's words, One Jesus Christ, our Lord, through, Whom are all things? Or, He spake, and they were made? If these inspired words succeed in convincing your stubborn mind, you will cease to regard that text, Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One, as a refusal of Divinity to the Son of God, since at the very foundation of the world He Who spoke it proclaimed that His Son also is God. But let us see what increase of profit we may draw from this distinction of God Who commands and God Who executes. For though it is repugnant even to our natural reason to suppose that in the words, He commanded, and they were made, one single and isolated Person is intended, yet, for the avoidance of all doubts, we must expound the events which followed upon the creation of the world.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_11_book_iv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"42. As you have listened already to Moses and Isaiah, so listen now to Jeremiah inculcating the same truth as they:-This is our God, and there shall be none other likened unto Him, Who hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant and to Israel His beloved. Afterward did He shew Himself upon earth and dwelt among men[fn-13-P1306_793321:83-nf] . For previously he had said, And He is Man, and Who shall know Him[fn-13-P1307_793413:84-nf] ? Thus you have God seen on earth and dwelling among men. Now I ask you what sense you would assign to No one hath seen God at any time, save the Only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father[fn-13-P1308_793640:85-nf] , when Jeremiah proclaims God seen on earth and dwelling among men? The Father confessedly cannot be seen except by the Son; Who then is This who was seen and dwelt among men? He must be our God, for He is God visible in human form, Whom men can handle. And take to heart the prophet's words, There shall be none other likened to Him. If you ask how this can be, listen to the remainder of the sentence, lest you be tempted to deny to the Father His share of the confession. Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One. The whole passage is, There shall be none likened unto Him, Who hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant and to Israel His beloved. Afterward did He skew Himself upon earth and dwelt among men. For there is one Mediator between God and Men, Who is both God and Man; Mediator both in giving of the Law and in taking of our body. Therefore none other can be likened unto Him, for He is One, born from God into God, and the it was through Whom all things were created in heaven and earth, through Whom times and worlds were made. Everything, in fine, that exists owes its existence to His action. He it is that instructs Abraham, that speaks with Moses, that testifies to Israel, that abides in the prophets, that was born through the Virgin from the Holy Ghost, that nails to the cross of His passion the powers that are our foes, that slays death in hell, that strengthens the assurance of our hope by His Resurrection, that destroys the corruption of human flesh by the glory of His Body. Therefore none shall be likened unto Him. For these are the peculiar powers of God the Only-begotten; He alone was born from God, the blissful Possessor of such great prerogatives. No second god can be likened unto Him, for He is God from God, not born from any alien being. There is nothing new or strange or modern created in Him. When Israel hears that its God is one, and that no second god is likened, that men may deem him God, to God Who is God's Son, the revelation means that God the Father and God the Son are One altogether, not by confusion of Person but by unity of substance. For the prophet forbids us, because God the Son is God, to liken Him to some second deity.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_12_lecture_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"11.

For once for all we have learned from the Lord, through Whom comes the transformation of our nature from mortality to immortality,-from Him, I say, we have learned to what we ought to look with the eyes of our understanding,-that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We say that it is a terrible and soul-destroying thing to misinterpret these Divine utterances and to devise in their stead assertions to subvert them,-assertions pretending to correct God the Word, Who appointed that we should maintain these statements as part of our faith. For each of these titles understood in its natural sense becomes for Christians a rule of truth and a law of piety. For while there are many other names by which Deity is indicated in the Historical Books, in the Prophets and in the Law, our Master Christ passes by all these and commits to us these titles as better able to bring us to the faith about the Self-Existent, declaring that it suffices us to cling to the title, \"Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\" in order to attain to the apprehension of Him Who is absolutely Existent, Who is one and yet not one. In regard to essence He is one, wherefore the Lord ordained that we should look to one Name: but in regard to the attributes indicative of the Persons, our belief in Him is distinguished into belief in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost[fn-9-P957_523101:8-nf] ; He is divided without separation, and united without confusion. For when we hear the title \"Father\" we apprehend the meaning to be this, that the name is not understood with reference to itself alone, but also by its special signification indicates the relation to the Son. For the term \"Father\" would have no meaning apart by itself, if \"Son\" were not connoted by the utterance of the word \"Father.\" When, then, we learnt the name \"Father\" we were taught at the same time, by the selfsame title, faith also in the Son. Now since Deity by its very nature is permanently and immutably the same in all that pertains to its essence, nor did it at any time fail to be anything that it now is, nor will it at any future time be anything that it now is not, and since He Who is the very Father was named Father by the Word, and since in the Father the Son is implied,-since these things are so, we of necessity believe that He Who admits no change or alteration in His nature was always entirely what He is now, or, if there is anything which He was not, that He assuredly is not now. Since then He is named Father by the very Word, He assuredly always was Father, and is and will be even as He was. For surely it is not lawful in speaking of the Divine and unimpaired Essence to deny that what is excellent always belonged to lt. For if He was not always what He now is, He certainly changed either from the better to the worse or from the worse to the better, and of these assertions the impiety is equal either way, whichever statement is made concerning the Divine nature. But in fact the Deity is incapable of change and alteration. So, then, everything that is excellent and good is always contemplated in the fountain of excellency. But \"the Only-begotten God, Who is in the bosom of the Father[fn-9-P958_525033:9-nf] \" is excellent, and beyond all excellency:-mark you, He says, \"Who is in the bosom of the Father,\" not \"Who came to be\" there.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Now the wording of their doctrine is as follows: \"We believe in the one and only true God, according to the teaching of the Lord Himself, not honouring Him with a lying title (for He cannot lie), but really existent, one God in nature and in glory, who is without beginning, eternally, without end, alone.\" Let not him who professes to believe in accordance with the teaching of the Lord pervert the exposition of the faith that was made concerning the Lord of all to suit his own fancy, but himself follow the utterance of the truth.

Let us pass to the next point of his statement. He adds to what he had already said, \"Not standing in need, in the act of creation, of matter or parts or natural instruments: for He stands in need of nothing.\" This proposition, though Eunomius states it with a certain looseness of phrase, we yet do not reject as inconsistent with godly doctrine. For learning as we do that \"He spake the word and they were made: He commanded and they were created[fn-10-P1053_571210:76-nf] ,\"we know that the Word is the Creator of matter, by that very act also producing with the matter the qualitiesof matter, so that for Him the impulse of Hisalmighty will was everything and instead of everything, matter, instrument, place, time, essence, quality, everything that is conceived in creation. For at one and the same time did He will that that which ought to be should be, and His power, that produced all things that are, kept pace with His will, turning His will into act. For thus the mighty Moses in the record of creation instructs us about the Divine power, ascribing the production of each of the objects that were manifested in the creation to the words that bade them be. For \"God said,\" he tells us, \"Let there be light, and there was light[fn-10-P1054_572021:77-nf] :\" and so about the rest, without any mention either of matter or of any instrumental agency. Accordingly the language of Eunomius on this point is not to be rejected. For God, when creating all things that have their origin by creation, neither stood in need of any matter on which to operate, nor of instruments to aid Him in His construction: for the power and wisdom of God has no need of any external assistance. But Christ is \"the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-10-P1055_572509:78-nf] ,\" by Whom all things were made and without Whom is no existent thing, as John testifies[fn-10-P1056_572617:79-nf] . If, then, all things were made by Him, both visible and invisible, and if His will alone suffices to effect the subsistence of existing things (for His will is power), Eunomius utters our doctrine though with a loose mode of expression[fn-10-P1057_572878:80-nf] . For what instrument and what matter could He Who upholds all thinsg by the word of His power[fn-10-P1058_573089:81-nf] need in upholding the constitution of existing things by His almighty word? But if he maintains that what we have believed to be true of the Only-begotten in the case of the creation, is true also in the case of the Son -in the sense that the Father created Him in like manner as the creation was made by the Son,-then we retract our former statement, because such a supposition is a denial of the Godhead of the Only-begotten. For we have learnt from the mighty utterance of Paul that it is the distinguishing feature of idolatry to worship and serve the creature more than the Creator[fn-10-P1059_573733:82-nf] , as well as from David, when He says \"There shall no new God be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any alien God[fn-10-P1060_573869:83-nf] .\" We use this line and rule to arrive at the discernment of the object of worship, so as to be convinced that that alone is God which is neither \"new\" nor \"alien.\" Since then we have been taught to believe that the Only-begotten God is God, we acknowledge, by our belief that He is God, that He is neither \"new\" or \"alien.\" If, then, He is God, He is not \"new,\" and if He is not new, He is assuredly eternal. Accordingly, neither is the Eternal \"new,\" nor is He Who is of the Father and in the bosom of the Father and Who has the Father in Himself \"alien\" from true Deity. Thus he who severs the Son from the nature of the Father either absolutely disallows the worship of the Son, that he may not worship an alien God, or bows down before an idol, making a creature and not God the object of his worship, and giving to his idol the name of Christ.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Now that this is the meaning to which he tends in his conception concerning the Only-begotten will become more plain by considering the language he employs touching the Only-begotten Himself, which is as follows. \"We believe also in the Son of God, the Only-begotten God, the first-born of all creation, very Son, not ungenerate, verily begotten before the worlds, named Son not without being begotten before He existed, coming into being before all creation, not un-create.\" I think that the mere reading of his exposition of his faith is quite sufficient to render its impiety plain without any investigation on our part. For though he calls Him \"first-born,\" yet that he may not raise any doubt in his readers' minds as to His not being created, he immediately adds the words, \"not uncreate,\" lest if the natural significance of the term \"Son\" were apprehended by his readers, any pious conception concerning Him might find place in their minds. It is for this reason that after at first confessing Him to be Son of God and Only-begotten God, he proceeds at once, by what he adds, to pervert the minds of his readers from their devout belief to his heretical notions. For he who hears the titles \"Son of God\" and \"Only-begotten God\" is of necessity lifted up to the loftier kind of assertions respecting the Son, led onward by the significance of these terms, inasmuch as no difference of nature is introduced by the use of the title \"God\" and by the significance of the term \"Son.\" For how could He Who is truly the Son of God and Himself God be conceived as something else differing from the nature of the Father? But that godly conceptions may not by these names be impressed beforehand on the hearts of his readers, he forthwith calls Him \"the first-born of all creation, named Son, not without being begotten before He existed, coming into being before all creation, not uncreate.\" Let us linger a little while, then, over his argument, that the miscreant may be shown to be holding out his first statements to people merely as a bait to induce them to receive the poison that he sugars over with phrases of a pious tendency, as it were with honey. Who does not know how great is the difference in signification between. the term \"only-begotten\" and \"first-born?\" For \"first-born\" implies brethren, and \"only-begotten\" implies that there are no other brethren. Thus the \"first-born\" is not \"only-begotten,\" for certainly \"first-born\" is the first-born among brethren, while he who is \"only-begotten\" has no brother: for if he were numbered among brethren he would not be only-begotten. And moreover, whatever the essence of the brothers of the first-born is, the same is the essence of the first-born himself. Nor is this all that is signified by the title, but also that the first-born and those born after him draw their being from the same source, without the first born contributing at all to the birth of those that come after him: so that hereby[fn-10-P1062_577954:84-nf] is maintained the falsehood of that statement of John, which affirms that \"all things were made by Him[fn-10-P1063_578151:85-nf] .\" For if He is first-born, He differs from those born after Him only by priority in time, while there must be some one else by Whom the power to be at all is imparted alike to Him and to the rest. But that we may not by our objections give any unfair opponent ground for an insinuation that we do not receive the inspired utterances of Scripture, we will first set before our readers our own view about these titles, and then leave it to their judgment which is the better.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Since, then, the first-fruits made the true God to be its God, and the good Father to be its Father, the blessing is secured for human nature as a whole, and by means of the first-fruits the true God and Father becomes Father and God of all men.

For neither is the figure of breath intended to convey to us the notion of dispersion into the air from the material from which it is formed, nor is the figure of fragrance designed to express the passing off of the quality of the ointment into the air, nor the figure of effulgence the efflux which takes place by means of the rays from the body of the sun: but as has been said in all cases, by such a mode of generation is indicated this alone, that the Son is of the Father and is conceived of along with Him, no interval intervening between the Father and Him Who is of the Father.

He knows not what he says nor whereof he affirms[fn-11-P1108_599924:119-nf] , but he endeavours, as though he were constructing the pedigree of a mere man, to apply to the Lord of all creation the language which properly belongs to our nature here below. For, to take an example, Ishmael was not before the generation that brought him into being, and before his birth there was of course an interval of time. But with Him Who is \"the brightness of glory[fn-11-P1109_600326:120-nf] ,\" \"before\" and \"after\" have no place: for before the brightness, of course neither was there any glory, for concurrently with the existence of the glory there assuredly beams forth its brightness; and it is impossible in the nature of things that one should be severed from the other, nor is it possible to see the glory by itself before its brightness. For he who says thus will make out the glory in itself to be darkling and dim, if the brightness from it does not shine out at the same time. But this is the unfair method of the heresy, to endeavour, by the notions and terms employed concerning the Only-begotten God, to displace Him from His oneness with the Father. It is to this end they say, \"Before the generation that brought Him into being He was not Son:\" but the \"sons of rams[fn-11-P1110_601140:121-nf] ,\" of whom the prophet speaks,-are not they too called sons after coming into being? That quality, then, which reason notices in the \"sons of rams,\" that they are not \"sons of rams\" before the generation which brings them into being,-this our reverend divine now ascribes to the Maker of the worlds and of all creation, Who has the Eternal Father in Himself, and is contemplated in the eternity of the Father, as He Himself says, \"I am in the Father, and the Father in Me[fn-11-P1111_601647:122-nf] .\" Those, however, who are not able to detect the sophistry that lurks in his statement, and are not trained to any sort of logical perception, follow these inconsequent statements and receive what comes next as a logical consequence of what preceded. For he says, \"coming into being before all creation,\" and as though this were not enough to prove his impiety, he has a piece of profanity in reserve in the phrase that follows, when he terms the Son \"not uncreate.\" In what sense then does he call Him Who is not uncreate \"very Son\"? For if it is meet to call Him Who is not uncreate \"very Son,\" then of course the heaven is \"very Son;\" for it too is \"not uncreate.\" So the sun too is \"very Son,\" and all that the creation contains, both small and great, are of course entitled to the appellation of \"very Son.\" And in what sense does He call Him Who has come into being \"Only-begotten\"? For all things that come into being are unquestionably in brotherhood with each other, so far, I mean, as their coming into being is concerned. And from whom did He come into being? For assuredly all things that have ever come into being did so from the Son. For thus did John testify, saying, \"All things were made by Him[fn-11-P1112_602884:123-nf] .\" If then the Son also came into being, according to Eunomius' creed, He is certainly ranked in the class of things which have come into being. If then all things that came into being were made by Him, and the Word is one of the things that came into being, who is so dull as not to draw from these premises the absurd conclusion that our new creed-monger makes out the Lord of creation to have been His own work, in saying in so many words that the Lord and Maker of all creation is \"not uncreate\"? Let him tell us whence he has this boldness assertion. From what inspired utterance? What evangelist, what apostle ever uttered such words as these? What prophet, what lawgiver, what patriarch, what other person of all who were divinely moved by the Holy Ghost, whose voices are preserved in writing, ever originated such a statement as this? In the tradition of the faith delivered by the Truth we are taught to believe in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. If it were right to believe that the Son was created, how was it that the Truth in delivering to us this mystery bade us believe in the Son, and not in the creature? and how is it that the inspired Apostle, himself adoring Christ, lays it down that they who worship the creature besides the Creator are guilty of idolatry[fn-11-P1113_604183:124-nf] ? For, were the Son created, either he would not have wor-shipped Him, or he would have refrained from classing those who worship the creature along with idolaters, lest he himself should appear to be an idolater, in offering adoration to the created. But he knew that He Whom he adored was God over all[fn-11-P1114_604628:125-nf] , for so he terms theSon in his Epistle to the Romans. Why then do those who divorce the Son from the essence of the Father, and call Him creature, bestow on Him i mockery the fictitious title of Deity, idly conferring on one alien from true Divinity the name of \"God,\" as they might confer it on Bel or Dagon or the Dragon?

He declares Him Who was in the beginning Himself to have a beginning: and is not aware that if He Who is in the beginning has a beginning, then the Beginning itself must needs have another beginning. Whatever He says of the beginning he must necessarily confess to be true of Him Who was in the beginning: for how can that which is in the beginning be severed from the beginning? and how can any one imagine a \"was not\" as preceding the \"was\"? For however far one carries back one's thought to apprehend the beginning, one most certainly understands as one does so that the Word which was in the beginning (inasmuch as It cannot be separated from the beginning in which It is) does not at any point of time either begin or cease its existence therein. Yet let no one be induced by these words of mine to separate into two the one beginning we acknowledge. For the beginning is most assuredly one, wherein is discerned, indivisibly, that Word Who is completely united to the Father. He who thus thinks will never leave heresy a loophole to impair his piety by the novelty of the term \"ungenerate.\" But in Eunomius' next propositions his statements are like bread with a large admixture of sand. For by mixing his heretical opinions with sound doctrines, he makes uneatable even that which is in itself nutritious, by the gravel which he has mingled with it. For he calls the Lord \"living wisdom,\" \"operative truth,\" subsistent power, and \"life\":-so far is the nutritious portion. But into these assertions he instils the poison of heresy. For when he speaks of the \"life\" as \"generate\" he makes a reservation by the implied opposition to the \"ungenerate\" life, and does not affirm the Son to be the very Life. Next he says:-\"As Son of God, quickening the dead, the true light, the light that lighteneth every man coming into the world[fn-11-P1133_611738:140-nf] , good, and the bestower of good things.\" All these things he offers for honey to the simple-minded, concealing his deadly drug under the sweetness of terms like these. For he immediately introduces, on the heels of these statements, his pernicious principle, in the words \"Not partitioning with Him that begat Him His high estate, not dividing with another the essence of the Father, but becoming by generation glorious, yea, the Lord of glory, and receiving glory from the Father, not sharing His glory with the Father, for the glory of the Almighty is incommunicable, as He hath said, `My glory will I not give to another[fn-11-P1134_612387:141-nf] '\"These are his deadly poisons, which they alone can discover who have their souls' senses trained so to do: but the mortal mischief of the words is disclosed by their conclusion:-Receiving glory from the Father, not sharing glory with the Father, for the glory of the Almighty is incommunicable, as He hath said, `My glory will I not give to another.' Who is that \"other\" to whom God has said that He will not give His glory? The prophet speaks of the adversary of God, and Eunomius refers the prophecy to the only begotten God Himself! For when the prophet, speaking in the person of God, had said, \"My glory will I not give to another,\" he added, \"neither My praise to graven images.\" For when men were beguiled to offer to the adversary of God the worship and adoration due to God alone, paying homage in the representations of graven images to the enemy of God, who appeared in many shapes amongst men in the forms furnished by idols, He Who healeth them that are sick, in pity for men's ruin, foretold by the prophet the loving-kindness which in the latter days He would show in the abolishing of idols, saying, \"When My truth shall have been manifested, My glory shall no more be given to another, nor My praise bestowed upon graven images: for men, when they come to know My glory, shall no more be in bondage to them that by nature are no gods.\" All therefore that the prophet says in the person of the Lord concerning the power of the adversary, this fighter against God, refers to the Lord Himself, Who spake these words by the prophet!Who among the tyrants is recorded to have been such a persecutor of the faith as this? Who maintained such blasphemy as this, that He Who, as we believe, was manifested in the flesh for the salvation of our souls, is not very God, but the adversary of God, who puts his guile into effect against men by the instrumentality of idols and graven images? For it is what was said of that adversary by the prophet that Eunomius transfers to the only-begotten God, without so much as reflecting that it is the Only-begotten Himself Who spoke these words by the prophet, as Eunomius himself subsequently confesses when he says, \"this is He Who spake by the prophets.\"","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Now the drift of Eunomius' excessive concern about the Ungenerate has been often ex plained before; and it shall here be briefly discovered yet again. For as the term Father points to no difference of nature from the Son, his impiety, if he had brought his statement to a close here, would have had no support, seeing that the natural sense of the names Father and Son excludes the idea of their being alien in essence. But as it is, by employing the terms \"generate\" and \"ungenerate,\" since the contradictory opposition between them admits of no mean, just like that between \"mortal\" and \"immortal,\" \"rational\" and \"irrational,\" and all those terms which are opposed to each other by the mutually exclusive nature of their meaning,-by the use of these terms, I repeat, he gives free course to his profanity, so as to contemplate as existing in the \"generate\" with reference to the \"ungenerate\" the same difference which there is between \"mortal\" and \"immortal\": and even as the nature of the mortal is one, and that of the immortal another, and as the special attributes of the rational and of the irrational are essentially incompatible, just so he wants to make out that the nature of the ungenerate is one, and that of the generate another, in order to show that as the irrational nature has been created in subjection to the rational, so the generate is by a necessity of its being in a state of subordination to the ungenerate. For which reason he attaches to the ungenerate the name of \"Almighty,\" and this he does not apply to express providential operation, as the argument led the way for him in suggesting, but transfers the application of the word to arbitrary sovereignty, so as to make the Son to be a part of the subject and subordinate universe, a fellow-slave with all the rest to Him Who with arbitrary and absolute sovereignty controls all alike. And that it is with an eye to this result that he employs these argumentative distinctions, will be clearly established from the passage before us. For after those sapient and carefully-considered expressions, that He is not like either as Father to Father, or as Son to Son,-and yet there is no necessity that father should invariably be like father or son like son: for suppose there is one father among the Ethiopians, and another among the Scythians, and each of these has a son, the Ethiopian's son black, but the Scythian white-skinned and with hair of a golden tinge, yet none the more because each is a father does the Scythian turn black on the Ethiopian's account, nor does the Ethiopian's body change to white on account of the Scythian,-after saying this, however, according to his own fancy, Eunomius subjoins that \"He is like as Son to Father[fn-11-P1182_645287:176-nf] .\" But although such a phrase indicates kinship in nature, as the inspired Scripture attests in the case of Seth and Adam, our doctor, with but small respect for his intelligent readers, introduces his idle exposition of the title \"Son,\" defining Him to be the image and seal of the energy[fn-11-P1183_645670:177-nf] of the Almighty. \"For the Son,\" he says, \"is the image and seal of the energy of the Almighty.\" Let him who hath ears to hear first, I pray, consider this particular point-What is \"the seal of the energy\"? Every energy is contemplated as exertion in the party who exhibits it, and on the completion of his exertion, it has no independent existence. Thus, far example, the energy of the runner is the motion of his feet, and when the motion has stopped there is no longer any energy. So too about every pursuit the same may be said;-when the exertion of him who is busied about anything ceases, the energy ceases also, and has no independent existence, either when a person is actively engaged in the exertion he undertakes, or when he ceases from that exertion. What then does he tell us that the energy is in itself, which is neither essence, nor image, nor person? So he speaks of the Son as the similitude of the impersonal, and that which is like the non-existent surely has itself no existence at all. This is what his juggling with idle opinions comes to,-belief in nonentity! for that which is like nonentity surely itself is not. O Paul and John and all you others of the band of Apostles and Evangelists, who are they that arm their venomous tongues against your words? who are they that raise their frog-like croakings against your heavenly thunder? What then saith the son of thunder? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-11-P1184_647260:178-nf] .\" And what saith he that came after him, that other who had been within the heavenly temple, who in Paradise had been initiated into mysteries unspeakable? \"Being,\" he says, \"the Brightness of His glory, and the express Image of His person[fn-11-P1185_647522:179-nf] .\" What, after these have thus spoken, are the words of our ventriloquist[fn-11-P1186_647614:180-nf] ? \"The seal,\" quoth he, \"of the energy of the Almighty.\" He makes Him third after the Father, with that non-existent energy mediating between them, or rather moulded at pleasure by non-existence. God the Word, Who was in the beginning, is \"the seal of the energy\":-the Only-begotten God, Who is contemplated in the eternity of the Beginning of existent things, Who is in the bosom of the Father[fn-11-P1187_648087:181-nf] , Who sustains all things, by the word of His power[fn-11-P1188_648161:182-nf] , the creator of the ages, from Whom and through Whom and in Whom are all things[fn-11-P1189_648264:183-nf] , Who sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and hath meted out heaven with the span, Who measureth the water in the hollow of his hand[fn-11-P1190_648423:184-nf] , Who holdeth in His hand all things that are, Who dwelleth on high and looketh upon the things that are lowly[fn-11-P1191_648561:185-nf] , or rather did look upon them to make all the world to be His footstool[fn-11-P1192_648662:186-nf] , imprinted by the footmark of the Word-the form of God[fn-11-P1193_648744:187-nf] is \"the seal\" of an \"energy.\" Is God then an energy, not a Person? Surely Paul when expounding this very truth says He is \"the express image,\" not of His energy, but \"of His Person.\" Is the Brightness of His glory a seal of the energy of God? Alas for his impious ignorance! What is there intermediate between God and His own form? and Whom does the Person employ as mediator with His own express image? and what can be conceived as coming between the glory and its brightness? But while there are such weighty and numerous testimonies wherein the greatness of the Lord of the creation is proclaimed by those who were entrusted with the proclamation of the Gospel, what sort of language does this forerunner of the final apostasy hold concerning Him? What says he? \"As image,\" he says, \"and seal of all the energy and power of the Almighty.\" How does he take upon himself to emend the words of the mighty Paul? Paul says that the Son is \"the Power of God[fn-11-P1194_649722:188-nf] \"; Eunomius calls Him \"the seal of a power,\" not the Power. And then, repeating his expression, what is it that he adds to his previous statement? He calls Him \"seal of the Father's works and words and counsels.\" To what works of the Father is He like? He will say, of course, the world, and all things that are therein. But the Gospel has testified that all these things are the works of the Only-begotten. To what works of theFather, then, was He likened? of what works was He made the seal? what Scripture ever entitled Him \"seal of the Father's works\"? But if any one should grant Eunomius the right to fashion his words at his own will, as he desires, even though Scripture does not agree with him, let him tell us what works of the Father there are of which he says that the Son was made the seal, apart from those that have been wrought by the Son. All things visible and invisible are the work of the Son: in the visible are included the whole world and all that is therein; in the invisible, the supramundane creation. What works of the Father, then, are remaining to be contemplated by themselves, over and above things visible and invisible, whereof he says that the Son was made the \"seal\"? Will he perhaps, when driven into a corner, return once more to the fetid vomit of heresy, and say that the Son is a work of the Father? How then does the Son come to be he seal of these works when He Himself, as Eunomius says, is the work of the Father? Or does he say that the same Person is at once a work and the likeness of a work? Let this be granted: let us suppose him to speak of the other works of which he says the Father was the creator, if indeed he intends us to understand likeness by the term \"seal.\" But what other \"words\" of the Father does Eunomius know, besides that Word Who was ever in the Father, Whom he calls a \"seal\"-Him Who is and is called the Word in the absolute, true, and primary sense? And to what counsels can he possibly refer, apart from the Wisdom of God, to which the Wisdom of God is made like, in becoming a \"seal\" of those counsels? Look at the want of discrimination and circumspection, at the confused muddle of his statement, how he brings the mystery into ridicule, without understanding either what he says or what he is arguing about. For He Who has the Father in His entirety in Himself, and is Himself in His entirety in the Father, as Word and Wisdom and Power and Truth, as His express image and brightness, Himself is all things in the Father, and does not come to be the image and seal and likeness of certain other things discerned in the Father prior to Himself.

For as the term Father points to no difference of nature from the Son, his impiety, if he had brought his statement to a close here, would have had no support, seeing that the natural sense of the names Father and Son excludes the idea of their being alien in essence. But as it is, by employing the terms \"generate\" and \"ungenerate,\" since the contradictory opposition between them admits of no mean, just like that between \"mortal\" and \"immortal,\" \"rational\" and \"irrational,\" and all those terms which are opposed to each other by the mutually exclusive nature of their meaning,-by the use of these terms, I repeat, he gives free course to his profanity, so as to contemplate as existing in the \"generate\" with reference to the \"ungenerate\" the same difference which there is between \"mortal\" and \"immortal\": and even as the nature of the mortal is one, and that of the immortal another, and as the special attributes of the rational and of the irrational are essentially incompatible, just so he wants to make out that the nature of the ungenerate is one, and that of the generate another, in order to show that as the irrational nature has been created in subjection to the rational, so the generate is by a necessity of its being in a state of subordination to the ungenerate. For which reason he attaches to the ungenerate the name of \"Almighty,\" and this he does not apply to express providential operation, as the argument led the way for him in suggesting, but transfers the application of the word to arbitrary sovereignty, so as to make the Son to be a part of the subject and subordinate universe, a fellow-slave with all the rest to Him Who with arbitrary and absolute sovereignty controls all alike. And that it is with an eye to this result that he employs these argumentative distinctions, will be clearly established from the passage before us. For after those sapient and carefully-considered expressions, that He is not like either as Father to Father, or as Son to Son,-and yet there is no necessity that father should invariably be like father or son like son: for suppose there is one father among the Ethiopians, and another among the Scythians, and each of these has a son, the Ethiopian's son black, but the Scythian white-skinned and with hair of a golden tinge, yet none the more because each is a father does the Scythian turn black on the Ethiopian's account, nor does the Ethiopian's body change to white on account of the Scythian,-after saying this, however, according to his own fancy, Eunomius subjoins that \"He is like as Son to Father[fn-11-P1182_645287:176-nf] .\" But although such a phrase indicates kinship in nature, as the inspired Scripture attests in the case of Seth and Adam, our doctor, with but small respect for his intelligent readers, introduces his idle exposition of the title \"Son,\" defining Him to be the image and seal of the energy[fn-11-P1183_645670:177-nf] of the Almighty. \"For the Son,\" he says, \"is the image and seal of the energy of the Almighty.\" Let him who hath ears to hear first, I pray, consider this particular point-What is \"the seal of the energy\"? Every energy is contemplated as exertion in the party who exhibits it, and on the completion of his exertion, it has no independent existence. Thus, far example, the energy of the runner is the motion of his feet, and when the motion has stopped there is no longer any energy. So too about every pursuit the same may be said;-when the exertion of him who is busied about anything ceases, the energy ceases also, and has no independent existence, either when a person is actively engaged in the exertion he undertakes, or when he ceases from that exertion. What then does he tell us that the energy is in itself, which is neither essence, nor image, nor person? So he speaks of the Son as the similitude of the impersonal, and that which is like the non-existent surely has itself no existence at all. This is what his juggling with idle opinions comes to,-belief in nonentity! for that which is like nonentity surely itself is not. O Paul and John and all you others of the band of Apostles and Evangelists, who are they that arm their venomous tongues against your words? who are they that raise their frog-like croakings against your heavenly thunder? What then saith the son of thunder? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-11-P1184_647260:178-nf] .\" And what saith he that came after him, that other who had been within the heavenly temple, who in Paradise had been initiated into mysteries unspeakable? \"Being,\" he says, \"the Brightness of His glory, and the express Image of His person[fn-11-P1185_647522:179-nf] .\" What, after these have thus spoken, are the words of our ventriloquist[fn-11-P1186_647614:180-nf] ? \"The seal,\" quoth he, \"of the energy of the Almighty.\" He makes Him third after the Father, with that non-existent energy mediating between them, or rather moulded at pleasure by non-existence.

Though this absurdity has already been exposed, I will nevertheless endeavour, in few words, to make plain the aim of his knavery. As in the former case, he avoided using the name \"Father,\" that so he might not include the Son in the eternity of the Father, so he avoided employing the title Son, that he might not by it suggest His natural affinity to the Father; so here, too, he refrains from saying \"Holy Spirit,\" that he may not by this name acknowledge the majesty of His glory, and His complete union with the Father and the Son. For since the appellation of \"Spirit,\" and that of \"Holy,\" are by the Scriptures equally applied to the Father and the Son (for \"God is a Spirits[fn-12-P1225_665183:210-nf] ,\" and \"the anointed Lord is the Spirit before our face[fn-12-P1226_665262:211-nf] ,\" and \"the Lord our God is Holy[fn-12-P1227_665326:212-nf] ,\" and there is \"one Holy, one Lord Jesus Christ[fn-12-P1228_665395:213-nf] \") lest there should, by the use of these terms, be bred in the minds of his readers some orthodox conception of the Holy Spirit, such as would naturally arise in them from His sharing His glorious appellation with the Father and the Son, for this reason, deluding the ears of the foolish, he changes the words of the Faith as set forth by God in the delivery of this mystery, making a way, so to speak, by this sequence, for the entrance of his impiety against the Holy Spirit. For if he had said, \"We believe in the Holy Spirit,\" and \"God is a Spirit,\" any one instructed in things divine would have interposed the remark, that if we are to believe in the Holy Spirit, while God is called a Spirit, He is assuredly not distinct in nature from that which receives the same titles in a proper sense. For of all those things which are indicated not unreally, nor metaphorically, but properly and absolutely, by the same names, we are necessarily compelled to acknowledge that the nature also, which is signified by this identity of names, is one and the same. For this reason it is that, suppressing the name appointed by the Lord in the formula of the faith, he says, \"We believe in the Comforter.\" But I have been taught that this very name is also applied by the inspired Scripture to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost alike. For the Son gives the name of \"Comforter\" equally to Himself and to the Holy Spirit[fn-12-P1229_666903:214-nf] ; and the Father, where He is said to work comfort, surely claims as His own the name of \"Comforter.\" For assuredly he Who does the work of a Comforter does not disdain the name belonging to the work: for David says to the Father, \"Thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me[fn-12-P1230_667203:215-nf] ,\" and the great Apostle applies to the Father the same language, when he says, \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1231_667403:216-nf] \"; and John, in one of his Catholic Epistles, expressly gives to the Son the name of Comforter[fn-12-P1232_667520:217-nf] . Nay, more, the Lord Himself, in saying that another Comforter would be sent us, when speaking of the Spirit, clearly asserted this title of Himself in the first place. But as there are two senses of the parakalein[fn-12-P1233_667807:218-nf] ,-one to beseech, by words and gestures of respect, to induce him to whom we apply for anything, to feel with us in respect of those things for which we apply,-the other to comfort, to take remedial thought for affections of body and soul,-the Holy Scripture affirms the conception of the Paraclete, in either sense alike, to belong to the Divine nature. For at one time Paul sets before us by the word parakalein the healing power of God, as when he says, \"God, Who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus[fn-12-P1234_668424:219-nf] \"; and at another time he uses this word in its other meaning, when he says, writing to the Corinthians, \"Now we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God[fn-12-P1235_668680:220-nf] .\" Now since these things are so, in whatever way you understand the title \"Paraclete,\" when used of the Spirit, you will not in either of its significations detach Him from His community in it with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, he has not been able, even though he wished it, to belittle the glory of the Spirit by ascribing to Him the very attribute which Holy Scripture refers also to the Father and to the Son. But in styling Him \"the Spirit of Truth,\" Eunomius' own wish, I suppose, was to suggest by this phrase subjection, since Christ is the Truth, and he called Him the Spirit of Truth, as if one should say that He is a possession and chattel of the Truth, without being aware that God is called a God of righteousness[fn-12-P1236_669437:221-nf] ; and we certainly do not understand thereby that God is a possession of righteousness. Wherefore also, when we hear of the \"Spirit of Truth,\" we acquire by that phrase such a conception as befits the Deity, being guided to the loftier interpretation by the words which follow it. For when the Lord said \"The Spirit of Truth,\" He immediately added \"Which proceedeth from the Father[fn-12-P1237_669966:222-nf] ,\" a fact which the voice of the Lord never asserted of any conceivable thing in creation, not of aught visible or invisible, not of thrones, principalities, powers, or dominions, nor of any other name that is named either in this world or in that which is to come. It is plain then that that, from share in which all creation is excluded, is something special and peculiar to uncreated being. But this man bids us believe in \"the Guide of godliness.\" Let a man then believe in Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and all those by whom we have been led into the way of thefaith. For if we are to believe in \"that which guides us to godliness,\" along with the Father and the Son, all the prophets and lawgivers and patriarchs, heralds, evangelists, apostles, pastors,and teachers, have equal honour with the Holy Spirit, as they bare been \"guides to godliness\" to those who came after them. \"Who came into being,\" he goes on, \"by the only God through the Only-begotten.\" In these words he gathers up in one head all his blasphemy. Once more he calls the Father \"only God,\" who employs the Only-begotten as an instrument for the production of the Spirit. What shadow of such a notion did he find in Scripture, that he ventures upon this assertion? by deduction from what premises did he bring his profanity to such a conclusion as this?Which of the Evangelists says it? what apostle? what prophet? Nay, on the contrary every scripture divinely inspired, written by the afflatus of the Spirit, attests the Divinity of the Spirit. For example (for it is better to prove my position from the actual testimonies), those who receive power to become children of God bear witness to the Divinity of the Spirit. Who knows not that utterance of the Lord which tells us that they who are born of the Spirit are the children of God? For thus He expressly ascribes the birth of the children of God to the Spirit, saying, that as that which is born of the flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. But as many as are born of the Spirit are called the children of God[fn-12-P1238_672086:223-nf] . So also when the Lord by breathing upon His disciples had imparted to them the Holy Spirit, John says, \"Of His fulness have all we received[fn-12-P1239_672321:224-nf] .\" And that \"in Him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead[fn-12-P1240_672419:225-nf] ,\" the mighty Paul attests: yea, moreover, through the prophet Isaiah it is attested, as to the manifestation of the Divine appearance vouchsafed to him, when he saw Him that sat \"on the throne high and lifted up[fn-12-P1241_672651:226-nf] ;\" the older tradition, it is true, says that it was the Father Who appeared to him, but the evangelist John refers the prophecy to our Lord, saying, touching those of the Jews who did not believe the words uttered by the prophet concerning the Lord, \"These things said Esaias, when he saw His glory and spoke of Him[fn-12-P1242_672986:227-nf] .\" But the mighty Paul attributes the same passage to the Holy Spirit in his speech made to the Jews at Rome, when he says, \"Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet concerning you, saying, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand[fn-12-P1243_673333:228-nf] ,\" showing, in my opinion, by Holy Scripture itself, that every specially divine vision, every theophany, every word uttered in the Person of God, is to be understood to refer to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hence when David says, \"they provoked God in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert[fn-12-P1244_673719:229-nf] ,\" the apostle refers to the Holy Spirit the despite done by the Israelites to God, in these terms: \"Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me[fn-12-P1245_674004:230-nf] ,\" and goes on to refer all that the prophecy refers to God, to the Person of the Holy Ghost. Those who keep repeating against us the phrase \"three Gods,\" because we hold these views, have perhaps not yet learnt how to count. For if the Father and the Son are not divided into duality, (for they are, according to the Lord's words, One, and not Two[fn-12-P1246_674374:231-nf] ) and if the Holy Ghost is also one, how can one added to one be divided into the number of three Gods? Is it not rather plain that no one can charge us with believing in the number of three Gods, without himself first maintaining in his own doctrine a pair of Gods? For it is by being added to two that the one completes the triad of Gods. But what room is there for the charge of tritheism against those by whom one God is worshipped, the God expressed by the Name ofthe Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost?","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Thus much with regard to his profanity towards the Son.

For the Son gives the name of \"Comforter\" equally to Himself and to the Holy Spirit[fn-12-P1229_666903:214-nf] ; and the Father, where He is said to work comfort, surely claims as His own the name of \"Comforter.\" For assuredly he Who does the work of a Comforter does not disdain the name belonging to the work: for David says to the Father, \"Thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me[fn-12-P1230_667203:215-nf] ,\" and the great Apostle applies to the Father the same language, when he says, \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1231_667403:216-nf] \"; and John, in one of his Catholic Epistles, expressly gives to the Son the name of Comforter[fn-12-P1232_667520:217-nf] . Nay, more, the Lord Himself, in saying that another Comforter would be sent us, when speaking of the Spirit, clearly asserted this title of Himself in the first place. But as there are two senses of the parakalein[fn-12-P1233_667807:218-nf] ,-one to beseech, by words and gestures of respect, to induce him to whom we apply for anything, to feel with us in respect of those things for which we apply,-the other to comfort, to take remedial thought for affections of body and soul,-the Holy Scripture affirms the conception of the Paraclete, in either sense alike, to belong to the Divine nature. For at one time Paul sets before us by the word parakalein the healing power of God, as when he says, \"God, Who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus[fn-12-P1234_668424:219-nf] \"; and at another time he uses this word in its other meaning, when he says, writing to the Corinthians, \"Now we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God[fn-12-P1235_668680:220-nf] .\" Now since these things are so, in whatever way you understand the title \"Paraclete,\" when used of the Spirit, you will not in either of its significations detach Him from His community in it with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, he has not been able, even though he wished it, to belittle the glory of the Spirit by ascribing to Him the very attribute which Holy Scripture refers also to the Father and to the Son. But in styling Him \"the Spirit of Truth,\" Eunomius' own wish, I suppose, was to suggest by this phrase subjection, since Christ is the Truth, and he called Him the Spirit of Truth, as if one should say that He is a possession and chattel of the Truth, without being aware that God is called a God of righteousness[fn-12-P1236_669437:221-nf] ; and we certainly do not understand thereby that God is a possession of righteousness. Wherefore also, when we hear of the \"Spirit of Truth,\" we acquire by that phrase such a conception as befits the Deity, being guided to the loftier interpretation by the words which follow it. For when the Lord said \"The Spirit of Truth,\" He immediately added \"Which proceedeth from the Father[fn-12-P1237_669966:222-nf] ,\" a fact which the voice of the Lord never asserted of any conceivable thing in creation, not of aught visible or invisible, not of thrones, principalities, powers, or dominions, nor of any other name that is named either in this world or in that which is to come. It is plain then that that, from share in which all creation is excluded, is something special and peculiar to uncreated being. But this man bids us believe in \"the Guide of godliness.\" Let a man then believe in Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and all those by whom we have been led into the way of thefaith. For if we are to believe in \"that which guides us to godliness,\" along with the Father and the Son, all the prophets and lawgivers and patriarchs, heralds, evangelists, apostles, pastors,and teachers, have equal honour with the Holy Spirit, as they bare been \"guides to godliness\" to those who came after them. \"Who came into being,\" he goes on, \"by the only God through the Only-begotten.\" In these words he gathers up in one head all his blasphemy. Once more he calls the Father \"only God,\" who employs the Only-begotten as an instrument for the production of the Spirit. What shadow of such a notion did he find in Scripture, that he ventures upon this assertion? by deduction from what premises did he bring his profanity to such a conclusion as this?Which of the Evangelists says it? what apostle? what prophet? Nay, on the contrary every scripture divinely inspired, written by the afflatus of the Spirit, attests the Divinity of the Spirit. For example (for it is better to prove my position from the actual testimonies), those who receive power to become children of God bear witness to the Divinity of the Spirit. Who knows not that utterance of the Lord which tells us that they who are born of the Spirit are the children of God? For thus He expressly ascribes the birth of the children of God to the Spirit, saying, that as that which is born of the flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. But as many as are born of the Spirit are called the children of God[fn-12-P1238_672086:223-nf] . So also when the Lord by breathing upon His disciples had imparted to them the Holy Spirit, John says, \"Of His fulness have all we received[fn-12-P1239_672321:224-nf] .\" And that \"in Him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead[fn-12-P1240_672419:225-nf] ,\" the mighty Paul attests: yea, moreover, through the prophet Isaiah it is attested, as to the manifestation of the Divine appearance vouchsafed to him, when he saw Him that sat \"on the throne high and lifted up[fn-12-P1241_672651:226-nf] ;\" the older tradition, it is true, says that it was the Father Who appeared to him, but the evangelist John refers the prophecy to our Lord, saying, touching those of the Jews who did not believe the words uttered by the prophet concerning the Lord, \"These things said Esaias, when he saw His glory and spoke of Him[fn-12-P1242_672986:227-nf] .\" But the mighty Paul attributes the same passage to the Holy Spirit in his speech made to the Jews at Rome, when he says, \"Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet concerning you, saying, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand[fn-12-P1243_673333:228-nf] ,\" showing, in my opinion, by Holy Scripture itself, that every specially divine vision, every theophany, every word uttered in the Person of God, is to be understood to refer to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hence when David says, \"they provoked God in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert[fn-12-P1244_673719:229-nf] ,\" the apostle refers to the Holy Spirit the despite done by the Israelites to God, in these terms: \"Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me[fn-12-P1245_674004:230-nf] ,\" and goes on to refer all that the prophecy refers to God, to the Person of the Holy Ghost. Those who keep repeating against us the phrase \"three Gods,\" because we hold these views, have perhaps not yet learnt how to count. For if the Father and the Son are not divided into duality, (for they are, according to the Lord's words, One, and not Two[fn-12-P1246_674374:231-nf] ) and if the Holy Ghost is also one, how can one added to one be divided into the number of three Gods? Is it not rather plain that no one can charge us with believing in the number of three Gods, without himself first maintaining in his own doctrine a pair of Gods?

They will say of course that \"all things were made by Him[fn-12-P1248_675231:232-nf] ,\" and that in the term \"all things\" \"this Spirit also\" is included. Our answer to them shall be this, All things were made by Him, that were made. Now the things that were made, as Paul tells us, were things visible and invisible, thrones, authorities, dominions, principalities, powers, and among those included under the head of thrones and powers are reckoned by Paul the Cherubim and Seraphim[fn-12-P1249_675654:233-nf] : so far does the term \"all things\" extend. But of the Holy Spirit, as being above the nature of things that have come into being, Paul said not a word in his enumeration of existing things, not indicating to us by his words either His subordination or His coming into being; but just as the prophet calls the Holy Spirit \"good,\" and \"right,\" and \"guiding[fn-12-P1250_676074:234-nf] \" (indicating by the word \"guiding\" the power of control), even so the apostle ascribes independent authority to the dignity of the Spirit, when he affirms that He works all in all as He wills[fn-12-P1251_676555:235-nf] . Again, the Lord makes manifest the Spirit's independent power and operation in His discourse with Nicodemus, when He says, \"The Spirit breatheth where He willeth[fn-12-P1252_676746:236-nf] .\" How is it then that Eunomius goes so far as to define that He also is one of the things that came into being by the Son, condemned to eternal subjection. For he describes Him as \"once for all made subject,\" enthralling the guiding and governing Spirit in I know not what form of subjection. For this expression of \"subjection\" has many significations in Holy Scripture, and is understood and used with many varieties of meaning. For the Psalmist says that even irrational nature is put in subjection[fn-12-P1253_677272:237-nf] , and brings under the same term those who are overcome in war[fn-12-P1254_677368:238-nf] , while the apostle bids servants to be in subjection to their own masters[fn-12-P1255_677464:239-nf] , and that those who are placed over the priesthood should have their children in subjection[fn-12-P1256_677576:240-nf] , as their disorderly conduct brings discredit upon their fathers, as in the case of the sons of Eli the priest. Again, he speaks of the subjection of all men to God, when we all, being united to one another by the faith, become one body of the Lord Who is in all, as the subjection of the Son to the Father, when the adoration paid to the Son by all things with one accord, by things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, redounds to the glory of the Father; as Paul says elsewhere, \"To Him every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father[fn-12-P1257_678293:241-nf] .\" For when this takes place, the mighty wisdom of Paul affirms that the Son, Who is in all, is subject to the Father by virtue of the subjection of those in whom He is. What kind of \"subjection once for all\" Eunomius asserts of the Holy Spirit, it is thus impossible to learn from the phrase which he has thrown out,-whether he means the subjection of irrational creatures, or of captives, or of servants, or of children who are kept in order, or of those who are saved by subjection. For the subjection of men to God is salvation for those who are so made subject, according to the voice of the prophet, who says that his soul is subject to God, since of Him cometh salvation by subjection[fn-12-P1258_679098:242-nf] , so that subjection is the means of averting perdition. As therefore the help of the healing art is sought eagerly by the sick, so is subjection by those who are in need of salvation. But of what life does the Holy Spirit, that quickeneth all things, stand in need, that by subjection He should obtain salvation for Himself? Since then it is not on the strength of any Divine utterance that he asserts such an attribute of the Spirit, nor yet is it as a consequence of probable arguments that he has launched this blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, it must be plain at all events to sensible men that he vents his impiety against Him without any warrant whatsoever, unsupported as it is by any authority from Scripture or by any logical consequence.

That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.\"[fn-16-P1612_789512:1-nf] This entire passage, which I have here taken from the Gospel, contains in its earlier portions what is immutable and eternal, the contemplation of which makes us blessed; but in those which follow, eternal things are mentioned in conjunction with temporal things. And hence some things there belong to knowledge, some to wisdom, according to our previous distinction in the twelfth book. For the words,-\" In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not: \"-require a contemplative life, and must be discerned by the intellectual mind; and the more any one has profiled in this, the wiser without doubt will he become. But on account of the verse, \"The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not,\" faith certainly was necessary, whereby that which was not seen might be believed. For by \"darkness\" he intended to signify the hearts of mortals turned away from light of this kind, and hardly able to behold it; for which reason he subjoins. \"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through Him might believe.\" But here we come to a thing that was done in time, and belongs to knowledge, which is comprised in the cognizance of facts. And we think of the man John under that phantasy which is impressed on our memory from the notion of human nature. And whether men believe or not, they think this in the same manner. For both alike know what man is, the outer part of whom, that is, his body, they have learned through the eyes of the body; but of the inner, that is, the soul, they possess the knowledge in themselves, because they also themselves are men, and through intercourse with men; so that they are able to think what is said, \"There was a man, whose name was John,\" because they know the names also by interchange of speech. But that which is there also, viz. \"sent from God,\" they who hold at all, hold by faith; and they who do not hold it by faith, either hesitate through doubt, or deride it through unbelief. Yet both, if they are not in the number of those over-foolish ones, who say in their heart \"There is no God,\"[fn-16-P1613_791945:2-nf] when they, hear these words, think both things, viz. both what God is, and what it is to be sent from God; and if they do not do this as the things themselves really are, they do it at any rate as they can.","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_19_book_xiii_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"12. Whether human nature can receive this, which yet it confesses to be desirable, is no small question. But if faith be present, which is in those to whom Jesus has given power to become the sons of God, then there is no question. Assuredly, of those who endeavor to discover it from human reasonings, scarcely a few, and they endued with great abilities, and abounding in leisure, and learned with the most subtle learning, have been able to attain to the investigation of the immortality of the soul alone. And even for the soul they have not found a blessed life that is stable, that is, true; since they have said that it returns to the miseries of this life even after blessedness. And they among them who are ashamed of this opinion, and have thought that the purified soul is to be placed in eternal happiness without a body, hold such opinions concerning the past eternity of tim world, as to confute this opinion of theirs concerning the soul; a thing which here it is too long to demonstrate; but it has been, as I think, sufficiently explained by us in the twelfth book of the City of God.[fn-16-P1652_824826:13-nf] But that faith promises, not by human reasoning, but by divine authority, that the whole man, who certainly consists of soul and body, shall be immortal, and on this account truly blessed. And so, when it had been said in the Gospel, that Jesus has given \"power to become the sons of God to them who received Him;\" and what it is to have received Him had been shortly explained by saying, \"To them that believe on His name;\" and it was further added in what way they are to become sons of God, viz., \"Which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God;\"-lest that infirmity of men which we all see and bear should despair of attaining so great excellence, it is added in the same place, \"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us;\"[fn-16-P1653_825621:14-nf] that, on the contrary, men might be convinced of that which seemed incredible. For if He who is by nature the Son of God was made the Son of man through mercy for the sake of the sons of men,-for this is what is meant by \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us\" men,-how much more credible is it that the sons of men by nature should be made the sons of God by the grace of God, and should dwell in God, in whom alone and from whom alone the blessed can be made partakers of that immortality; of which that we might be convinced, the Son of God was made partaker of our mortality?","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_19_book_xiii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"22.There are many other things also in the incarnation of Christ, displeasing as it is to the proud, that are to be observed and thought of advantageously. And one ofthem is, that it has been demonstrated to man what place he has in the things which God has created; since human nature could so be joined to God, that one person could be made of two substances, and thereby indeed of three-God, soul, and flesh: so that those proud malignant spirits, who interpose themselves as mediators to deceive, although as if to help, do not therefore dare to place themselves above man because they have not flesh; and chiefly because the Son of God deigned to die also in the same flesh, lest they, because they seem to be immortal, should therefore succeed in getting themselves worshipped as gods. Further, that the grace of God might be commended to us in the man Christ without any precedent merits; because not even He Himself obtained by any precedent merits that He should be joined in such great unity with the true God, and should become the Son of God, one Person with Him; but from the time when He began to be man, from that time He is also God; whence it is said, \"The Word was made flesh.\"[fn-17-P1713_854897:48-nf] Then, again, there is this, that the pride of man, which is the chief hindrance against his cleaving to God, can be confuted and healed through such great humility of God. Man learns also how far he has gone away from God; and what it is worth to him as a pain to cure him, when he returns through such a Mediator, who both as God assists men by His divinity, and as man agrees with men by His weakness. For what greater example of obedience could be given to us, who had perished through disobedience, than God the Son obedient to God the Father, even to the death of the cross?[fn-17-P1714_855495:49-nf] Nay, wherein could the reward of obedience itself be better shown, than in the flesh of so great a Mediator, which rose again to eternal life?

And all these things which the Word made flesh did and bare for us in time and place, belong, according to the distinction which we have undertaken to demonstrate, to knowledge, not to wisdom. And as the Word is without time and without place, it is co-eternal with the Father, and in its wholeness everywhere; and if any one can, and as much as he can, speak truly concerning this Word, then his discourse will pertain to wisdom. And hence the Word made flesh, which is Christ Jesus, has the treasures both of wisdom and of knowledge. For the apostle, writing to the Colossians, says: \"For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God which is Christ Jesus: in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.\"[fn-17-P1723_860569:52-nf] To what extent the apostle knew all those treasures, how much of them he had penetrated, and in them to how great things he had reached, who can know? Yet, for my part, according to that which is written, \"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal; for to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;\"[fn-17-P1724_860978:53-nf] if these two are in such way to be distinguished from each other, that wisdom is to be assigned to divine things, knowledge to human, I acknowledge both in Christ, and so with me do all His faithful ones. And when I read, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,\" I understand by the Word the true Son of God, I acknowledge in the flesh the true Son of man, and both together joined into one Person of God and man, by an ineffable copiousness of grace. And on account of this, the apostle goes on to say, \"And we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\"[fn-17-P1725_861612:54-nf] If we refer grace to knowledge, and truth to wisdom, I think we shall not swerve from that distinction between these two things which we have commended. For in those things that have their origin in time, this is the highest grace, that man is joined with God in unity of person; but in things eternal the highest truth is rightly attributed to the Word of God. But that the same is Himself the Only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth,-this took place, in order that He Himself in things done for us in time should be the same for whom we are cleansed by the same faith, that we may contemplate Him steadfastly in things eternal. And those distinguished philosophers of the heathen who have been able to understand and discern the invisible things of God by those things which are made, have yet, as is said of them, \"held down the truth in iniquity;\"[fn-17-P1726_862494:55-nf] because they philosophized without a Mediator, that is, without the man Christ, whom they neither believed to be about to come at the word of the prophets, nor to have come at that of the apostles. For, placed as they were in these lowest things, they could not but seek some media through which they might attain to those lofty things which they had understood; and so they fell upon deceitful spirits, through whom it came to pass, that \"they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.\"[fn-17-P1727_863115:56-nf] For in such forms also they set up or worshipped idols. Therefore Christ is our knowledge, and the same Christ is also our wisdom. He Himself implants in us faith concerning temporal things, He Himself shows forth the truth concerning eternal things. Through Him we reach on to Himself: we stretch through knowledge to wisdom; yet we do not withdraw from one and the same Christ, \"in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.\" But now we speak of knowledge, and will hereafter speak of wisdom as much as He Himself shall grant. And let us not so take these two things, as if it were not allowable to speak either of the wisdom which is in human things, or of the knowledge which is in divine. For after a laxer custom of speech, both can be called wisdom, and both knowledge. Yet the apostle could not in any way have written,\"To one is given the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge,\" except also these several things had been properly called by the several names, of the distinction between which we are now treating.","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":37,"source_paragraph":"137","folder":"ANF-03","text":"However, it is not for you alone, (Simon), that the transmigration philosophy has fabricated this story. Carpocrates also makes equally good use of it, who was a magician and a fornicator like yourself, only he had not a Helen.[fn-29-P2912_1021636:239-nf] And why should he not? since he asserted that souls are reinvested with bodies, in order to ensure the overthrow by all means of divine and human truth. For, (according to his miserable doctrine, ) this life became consummated to no man until all those blemishes which are held to disfigure it have been fully displayed in its conduct; because there is nothing which is accounted evil by nature, but simply as men think of it. The transmigration of human souls, therefore, into any kind of heterogeneous bodies, he thought by all means indispensable, whenever any depravity whatever had not been fully perpetrated in the early stage of life's passage. Evil deeds (one may be sure) appertain to life. Moreover, as often as the soul has fallen short as a defaulter in sin, it has to be recalled to existence, until it \"pays the utmost farthing,\"[fn-29-P2913_1022565:240-nf] thrust out from time to time into the prison of the body. To this effect does he tamper with the whole of that allegory of the Lord which is extremely clear and simple in its meaning, and ought to be from the first understood in its plain and natural sense. Thus our \"adversary\" (therein mentioned[fn-29-P2914_1022883:241-nf] ) is the heathen man, who is walking with us along the same road of life which is common to him and ourselves. Now \"we must needs go out of the world,\"[fn-29-P2915_1023051:242-nf] if it be not allowed us to have conversation with them. He bids us, therefore, show a kindly disposition to such a man. \"Love your enemies,\" says He, \"pray for them that curse you,\"[fn-29-P2916_1023254:243-nf] lest such a man in any transaction of business be irritated by any unjust conduct of yours, and \"deliver thee to the judge\" of his own (nation[fn-29-P2917_1023417:244-nf] ), and you be thrown into prison, and be detained in its close and narrow cell until you have liquidated all your debt against him.[fn-29-P2918_1023569:245-nf] Then, again, should you be disposed to apply the term \"adversary\" to the devil, you are advised by the (Lord's) injunction, while you are in the way with him,\" to make even with him such a compact as may be deemed compatible with the requirements of your true faith. Now the compact you have made respecting him is to renounce him, and his pomp, and his angels. Such is your agreement in this matter. Now the friendly understanding you will have to carry out must arise from your observance of the compact: you must never think of getting back any of the things which you have abjured, and have restored to him, lest he should summon you as a fraudulent man, and a transgressor of your agreement, before God the Judge (for in this light do we read of him, in another passage, as \"the accuser of the brethren,\"[fn-29-P2919_1024395:246-nf] or saints, where reference is made to the actual practice of legal prosecution); and lest this Judge deliver you over to the angel who is to execute the sentence, and he commit you to the prison of hell, out of which there will be no dismissal until the smallest even of your delinquencies be paid off in the period before the resurrection.[fn-29-P2920_1024757:247-nf] What can be a more fitting sense than this? What a truer interpretation? If, however, according to Carpocrates, the soul is bound to the commission of all sorts of crime and evil conduct, what must we from his system understand to be its \"adversary\" and foe? I suppose it must be that better mind which shall compel it by force to the performance of some act of virtue, that it may be driven from body to body, until it be found in none a debtor to the claims of a virtuous life. This means, that a good tree is known by its bad fruit-in other words, that the doctrine of truth is understood from the worst possible precepts. I apprehend[fn-29-P2921_1025621:248-nf] that heretics of this school seize with especial avidity the example of Elias, whom they assume to have been so reproduced in John (the Baptist) as to make our Lord's statement sponsor for their theory of transmigration, when He said, \"Elias is come already, and they knew him not; \"[fn-29-P2922_1025919:249-nf] and again, in another passage, \"And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.\"[fn-29-P2923_1026040:250-nf] Well, then, was it really in a Pythagorean sense that the Jews approached John with the inquiry, \"Art thou Elias? \"[fn-29-P2924_1026177:251-nf] and not rather in the sense of the divine prediction, \"Behold, I will send you Elijah\" the Tisbite?[fn-29-P2925_1026297:252-nf] The fact, however, is, that their metempsychosis, or transmigration theory, signifies the recall of the soul which had died long before, and its return to some other body. But Elias is to come again, not after quitting life (in the way of dying), but after his translation (or removal without dying); not for the purpose of being restored to the body, from which he had not departed, but for the purpose of revisiting the world from which he was translated; not by way of resuming a life which he had laid aside, but of fulfilling prophecy,-really and truly the same man, both in respect of his name and designation, as well as of his unchanged humanity. How, therefore could John be Elias? You have your answer in the angel's announcement: \"And he shall go before the people,\" says he, \"in the spirit and power of Elias\"-not (observe) in his soul and his body. These substances are, in fact, the natural property of each individual; whilst \"the spirit and power\" are bestowed as external gifts by the grace of God and so may be transferred to another person according to the purpose and will of the Almighty, as was anciently the case with respect to the spirit of Moses.[fn-29-P2926_1027489:253-nf] ","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_14_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"If, when a man \"strives lawfully[fn-13-P1312_702598:1-nf] ,\" he finds a limit to his struggle in the contest by his adversary's either refusing the struggle, and withdrawing of his own accord in favour of his conqueror from his effort for victory, or being thrown according to the rules of wrestling in three falls (whereby the glory of the crown is bestowed with all the splendour of proclamation upon him who has proved victorious in the umpire's judgment), then, since Eunomius, though he has been already twice thrown in our previous arguments, does not consent that truth should hold the tokens of her victory over falsehood, but yet a third time raises the dust against godly doctrine in his accustomed arena of falsehood with his composition, strengthening himself for his struggle on the side of deceit, our statement of truth must also be now called forth to put his falsehood to rout, placing its hopes in Him Who is the Giver and the Judge of victory, and at the same time deriving strength from the very unfairness of the adversaries' tricks of wrestling. For we are not ashamed to confess that we have prepared for our contest no weapon of argument sharpened by rhetoric, that we can bring forward to aid us in the fight with those arrayed against us, no cleverness or sharpness of dialectic, such as with inexperienced judges lays even on truth the suspicion of falsehood. One strength our reasoning against falsehood has-first the very Word Himself, Who is the might of our word,[fn-13-P1313_704052:2-nf] and in the next place the rottenness of the arguments set against us, which is overthrown and falls by its own spontaneous action. Now in order that it may be made as clear as possible to all men, that the very efforts Of Eunomius serve as means for his own overthrow to those who contend with him, I will set forth to my readers his phantom doctrine (for so I think that doctrine may be called which is quite outside the truth), and I would have you all, who are present at our struggle, and watch the encounter now taking place between my doctrine and that which is matched with it, to be just judges of the lawful striving of our arguments, that by your just award the reasoning of godliness may be proclaimed as victor to the whole theatre of the Church, having won undisputed victory over ungodliness, and being decorated, in virtue of the three falls of its enemy, with the unfading crown of them that are saved. Now this statement is set forth against the truth by way of preface to his third discourse, and this is the fashion of it:-\"Preserving,\" he says, \"natural order, and abiding by those things which are known to us from above, we do not refuse to speak of the Son, seeing He is begotten, even by the name of `product of generation[fn-13-P1314_705372:3-nf] ,' since the generated essence and[fn-13-P1315_705419:4-nf] the appellation of Son make such a relation of words appropriate.\" I beg the reader to give his attention carefully to this point, that while he calls God both \"begotten\" and \"Son,\" he refers the reason of such names to \"natural order,\" and calls to witness to this conception the knowledge possessed from above: so that if anything should be found in the course of what follows contrary to the positions be has laid down, it is clear to all that he is overthrown by himself, refuted by his own arguments before ours are brought against him. And so let us consider his statement in the light of his own words. He confesses that the name of \"Son\" would by no means be properly applied to the Only-begotten God, did not \"natural order,\" as he says, confirm the appellation. If, then, one were to withdraw the order of nature from the consideration of the designation of \"Son,\" his use of this name, being deprived of its proper and natural significance, will be meaningless. And moreover the fact that he says these statements are confirmed, in that they abide by the knowledge possessed from above, is a strong additional support to the orthodox view touching the designation of \"Son,\" seeing that the inspired teaching of the Scriptures, which comes to us from above, confirms our argument on these matters. If these things are so, and this is a standard of truth that admits of no deception, that these two concur-the \"natural order,\" as he says, and the testimony of the knowledge given from above confirming the natural interpretation-it is clear, that to assert anything contrary to these, is nothing else than manifestly to fight against the truth itself. Let us hear again what this writer, who makes nature his instructor in the matter of this name, and says that he abides by the knowledge given to us from above by the instruction of the saints, sets out at length a little further on, after the passage I have just quoted. For I will pretermit for the time the continuous recital of what is set next in order in his treatise, that the contradiction in what he has written may not escape detection, being veiled by the reading of the intervening matter. \"The same argument,\" he says, \"will apply also in the case of what is made and created, as both the natural interpretation and the mutual relation of the things, and also the use of the saints, give us free authority for the use of the formula: wherefore one would not be wrong in treating the thing made as corresponding to the maker, and the thing created to the creator.\" Of what product of making or of creation does he speak, as having naturally the relation expressed in its name towards its maker and creator? If of those we contemplate in the creation, visible and invisible (as Paul recounts, when he says that by Him all things were created, visible and invisible)[fn-13-P1316_708420:5-nf] , so that this relative conjunction of names has a proper and special application, that which is made being set in relation to the maker, that which is created to the creator,-if this is his meaning, we agree with him. For in fact, since the Lord is the Maker of angels, the angel is assuredly a thing made by Him that made him: and since the Lord is the Creator of the world, clearly the world itself and all that is therein are called the creature of Him that created them. If however it is with this intention that he makes his interpretation of \"natural order,\" systematizing the appropriation of relative terms with a view to their mutual relation in verbal sense, even thus it would be an extraordinary thing, seeing that every one is aware of this, that he should leave his doctrinal statement to draw out for us a system of grammatical trivialities[fn-13-P1317_709296:6-nf] . But if it is to the Only-begotten God that he applies such phrases, so as to say that He is a thing made by Him that made Him, a creature of Him that created Him, and to refer this terminology to \"the use of the saints,\" let him first of all show us in his statement what saints he says there are who declared the Maker of all things to be a product and a creature, and whom he follows in this audacity of phrase. The Church knows as saints those whose hearts were divinely guided by the Holy Spirit,-patriarchs, lawgivers, prophets, evangelists, apostles. If any among these is found to declare in his inspired words that God over all, Who \"upholds all things with the word of His power,\" and grasps with His hand all things that are, and by Himself called the universe into being by the mere act of His will, is a thing created and a product, he will stand excused, as following, as he says, the \"use of the saints[fn-13-P1318_710274:7-nf] \" in proceeding to formulate such doctrines. But if the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures is freely placed within the reach of all, and nothing is forbidden to or hidden from any of those who choose to share in the divine instruction, how comes it that he endeavours to lead his hearers astray by his misrepresentation of the Scriptures, referring the term \"creature,\" applied to the Only-begotten, to \"the use of the saints\"? For that by Him all things were made, you may hear almost from the whole of their holy utterance, from Moses and the prophets and apostles who come after him, whose particular expressions it would be tedious here to set forth. Enough for our purpose, with the others, and above the others, is the sublime John, where in the preface to his discourse on the Divinity of the Only-begotten he proclaims aloud the fact that there is none of the things that were made which was not made through Him[fn-13-P1319_711386:8-nf] , a fact which is an incontestable and positive proof of His being Lord of the creation, not reckoned in the list of created things. For if all things that are made exist by no other but by Him (and John bears witness that nothing among the things that are, throughout the creation, was made without Him), who is so blinded in understanding as not to see in the Evangelist's proclamation the truth, that He Who made all the creation is assuredly something else besides the creation? For if all that is numbered among the things that were made has its being through Him, while He Himself is \"in the beginning,\" and is \"with God,\" being God, and Word, and Life, and Light, and express Image, and Brightness, and if none of the things that were made throughout creation is named by the same names-(not Word, not God, not Life, not Light, not Truthn not express Image, not Brightness, not any of the other names proper to the Deity is to be found employed of the creation)-then it is clear that He Who is these things is by nature something else besides the creation, which neither is nor is called any of these things. If, indeed, there existed in such phrases an identity of names between the creation and its Maker, he might perhaps be excused for making the name of \"creation\" also common to the thing created and to Him Who made it, on the ground of the community of the other names: but if the characteristics which are contemplated by means of the names, in the created and in the uncreated nature, are in no case reconcilable or common to both, how can the misrepresentation of that man fail to be manifest to all, who dares to apply the name of servitude to Him Who, as the Psalmist declares, \"ruleth with His power for ever[fn-13-P1320_713138:9-nf] ,\" and to bring Him Who, as the Apostle says, \"in all things hath the pre-eminence[fn-13-P1321_713245:10-nf] ,\" to a level with the servile nature, by means of the name and conception of \"creation\"? For that all[fn-13-P1322_713365:11-nf] the creation is in bondage the great Paul declares[fn-13-P1323_713472:12-nf] , - he who in the schools above the heavens was instructed in that knowledge which may not be spoken, learning these things in that place where every voice that conveys meaning by verbal utterance is still, and where unspoken meditation becomes the word of instruction, teaching to the purified heart by means of the silent illumination of the thoughts those truths which transcend speech. If then on the one hand Paul proclaims aloud \"the creation is in bondage,\" and on the other the Only-begotten God is truly Lord and God over all, and John bears witness to the fact that the whole creation of the things that were made is by Him, how can any one, who is in any sense whatever numbered among Christians, hold his peace when he sees Eunomius, by his inconsistent and inconsequent systematizing, degrading to the humble state of the creature, by means of an identity of name: that tends to servitude, that power of Lordship which surpasses all rule and all authority? And if he says that he has some of the saints who declared Him to be a slave, or created, or made, or any of these lowly and servile names, lo, here are the Scriptures. Let him, or some other on his behalf, produce to us one such phrase, and we will hold our peace. But if there is no such phrase (and there could never be found in those inspired Scriptures which we believe any such thought as to support this impiety), what need is there to strive further upon points admitted with one who not only misrepresents the words of the saints, but even contends against his own definitions? For if the \"order of nature,\" as he himself admits, bears additional testimony to the Son's name by reason of His being begotten, and thus the correspondence of the name is according to the relation of the Begotten to the Begetter, how comes it that he wrests the significance of the word \"Son\" from its natural application, and changes the relation to \"the thing made and its maker\"-a relation which applies not only in the case of the elements of the universe, but might also be asserted of a gnat or an ant-that in so far as each of these is a thing made, the relation of its name to its maker is similarly equivalent? The blasphemous nature of his doctrine is clear, not only from many other passages, but even from those quoted: and as for that \"use of the saints\" which he alleges that he follows in these expressions, it is clear that there is no such use at all.","title":"Book III","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_14_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Seeing then that all reasonable men admit that these expressions are to be read in such a sense as this, rather than in that which appears in the words at first sight, it is consequently probable that the phrase we are discussing, being written in close connection with them, is not received by prudent men absolutely and without examination. \"If I declare to you,\" she says, \"the things that happen day by day, I will remember to recount the things from everlasting: the Lord created me[fn-13-P1341_723145:25-nf] .\" What, pray, has the slave of the literal text, who sits listening closely to the sound of the syllables, like the Jews, to say to this phrase? Does not the conjunction, \"If I declare to you the things that happen day by day, the Lord created me,\" ring strangely in the ears of those who listen attentively? as though, if she did not declare the things that happen day by day, she will by consequence deny absolutely that she was created. For he who says, \"If I declare, I was created.\" leaves you by his silence to understand, \"I was not created, if I do not declare.\" \"The Lord created me,\" she says, \"in the beginning of His ways, for His works. He set me up from everlasting, in the beginning, before He made the earth, before He made the depths, before the springs of the waters came forth, before the mountains were settled, before all hills, He begetteth me[fn-13-P1342_724043:26-nf] .\" What new order of the formation of a creature is this? First it is created, and after that it is set up, and then it is begotten. \"The Lord made,\" she says, \"lands, even uninhabited, and the inhabited extremes of the earth under heaven[fn-13-P1343_724315:27-nf] .\" Of what Lord does she speak as the maker of land both uninhabited and inhabited? Of Him surely, who made wisdom. For both the one saying and the other are uttered by the same person; both that which says, \"the Lord created me,\" and that which adds, \"the Lord made land, even uninhabited.\" Thus the Lord will be the maker equally of both, of Wisdom herself, and of the inhabited and uninhabited land. What then are we to make of the saying, \"All things were made by Him, and without Him was riot anything made[fn-13-P1344_724855:28-nf] \"? For if one and the same Lord creates both Wisdom (which they advise us to understand of the Son), and also the particular things which are included in the Creation, how does the sublime John speak truly, when he says that all things were made by Him? For this Scripture gives a contrary sound to that of the Gospel, in ascribing to the Creator of Wisdom the making of land uninhabited and inhabited. So, too, with all that follows[fn-13-P1345_725308:29-nf] :-she speaks of a Throne of God set apart upon the winds, and says that the clouds above are made strong, and the fountains under the heaven sure; and the context contains many similar expressions, demanding in a marked degree that interpretation by a minute and clear-sighted intelligence, which is to be observed in the passages already quoted. What is the throne that is set apart upon the winds? What is the security of the fountains under theheaven? How are the clouds above made strong? If any one should interpret the passage with reference to visible objects[fn-13-P1346_725909:30-nf] , he will find that the facts are at considerable variance with the words. For who knows not that the extreme parts of the earth under heaven, by excess in one direction or in the other, either by being too close to the sun's heat, or by being too far removed from it, are uninhabitable; some being excessively dry and parched, other parts superabounding in moisture, and chilled by frost, and that only so much is inhabited as is equally removed from the extreme of each of the two opposite conditions? But if it is the midst of the earth that is occupied by man, how does the proverb say that the extremes of the earth under heaven are inhabited? Again, what strength could one perceive in the clouds, that that passage may have a true sense, according to its apparent intention, which says that the clouds above have been made strong? For the nature of cloud is a sort of rather slight vapour diffused through the air, which, being light, by reason of its great subtilty, is borne on the breath of the air, and, when forced together by compression, falls down through the air that held it up, in the form of a heavy drop of rain. What then is the strength in these, which offer no resistance to the touch? For in the cloud you may discern the slight and easily dissolved character of air. Again, how is the Divine throne set apart on the winds that are by nature unstable? And as for her saying at first that she is \"created,\" finally, that she is \"begotten,\" and between these two utterances that she is \"set up,\" what account of this could any one profess to give that would agree with the common and obvious sense? The point also on which a doubt was previously raised in our argument, the declaring, that is, of the things that happen day by day, and the remembering to recount the things from everlasting, is, as it were, a condition of Wisdom's assertion that she was created by God.","title":"Book III","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_14_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"After recounting these and the like matters, he proceeds to introduce also his teaching concerning the dispensation with regard to man, why the Word was made flesh.

But surely He Who is in the bosom of the Father does not permit us to conceive the bosom of the Father as ever void of Himself. He Who is in the beginning is surely not of the things which come to be in that bosom from without, but being the fulness of all good, He is conceived as being always in the Father, not waiting to arise in Him as the result of creation, so that the Father should not be conceived as at any time void of good, but He Who is conceived as being in the eternity of the Father's Godhead is always in Him, being Power, and Life, and Truth, and Wisdom, and the like. Accordingly the words \"created me\" do not proceed from the Divine and immortal nature, but from that which was commingled with it in the Incarnation from our created nature. How comes it then that the same, called wisdom, and understanding, and intelligence, establishes the earth, and prepares the heavens, and breaks up the deeps, and yet is here \"created for the beginning of His works[fn-13-P1359_734481:41-nf] \"? Such a dispensation, he tells us, is not set forward without great cause. But since men, after receiving the commandment of the things we should observe, cast away by disobedience the grace of memory, and became forgetful, for this cause, \"that I may declare to you the things that happen day by day for your salvation, and may put you in mind by recounting the things from everlasting, which you have forgotten (for it is no new gospel that I now proclaim, but I labour at your restoration to your first estate),-for this cause I was created, Who ever am, and need no creation in order to be; so that I am the beginning of ways for the works of God, that is for men. For the first way being destroyed, there must needs again be consecrated for the wanderers a new and living way[fn-13-P1360_735336:42-nf] , even I myself, Who am the way.\" And this view, that the sense of \"created me\" has reference to the Humanity, the divine apostle more clearly sets before us by his own words when he charges us, \"Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ[fn-13-P1361_735585:43-nf] ,\" and also where (using the same word) he says, \"Put on the new man which after God is created[fn-13-P1362_735701:44-nf] \" For if the garment of salvation is one, and that is Christ, one cannot say that \"the new man, which after God is created,\" is any other than Christ, but it is clear that he who has \"put on Christ\" has \"put on the new man which after God is created.\" For actually He alone is properly named \"the new man,\" Who did not appear in the life of man by the known and ordinary ways of nature, but in His case alone creation, in a strange and special form, was instituted anew.

For any one who either does not recollect, or does not sufficiently weigh, the language of sacred Scripture, may, on first hearing what we have said, suppose that the Epicurean philosophers live after the flesh, because they place man's highest good in bodily pleasure; and that those others do so who have been of opinion that in some form or other bodily good is man's supreme good; and that the mass of men do so who, without dogmatizing or philosophizing on the subject, are so prone to lust that they cannot delight in any pleasure save such as they receive from bodily sensations: and he may suppose that the Stoics, who place the supreme good of men in the soul, live after the spirit; for what is man's soul, if not spirit? But in the sense of the divine Scripture both are proved to live after the flesh.

For behold how in the very beginning of his Gospel he prepares our ears, how great forethought is shown by the teacher that none of his hearers should fall into low ideas on the subject, slipping by ignorance into any incongruous conceptions. For in order to lead the untrained hearing as far away as possible from passion, he does not speak in his opening words of \"Son,\" or \"Father,\" or \"generation,\" that no one should either, on hearing first of all of a \"Father,\" be hurried on to the obvious signification of the word, or, on learning the proclamation of a \"Son,\" should understand that name in the ordinary sense, or stumble, as at a \"stone of stumbling[fn-14-P1444_802201:6-nf] ,\" at the word \"generation\"; but instead of \"the Father,\" he speaks of \"the Beginning\": instead of \"was begotten,\" he says \"was\": and instead of \"the Son,\" he says \"the Word\": and declares \"In the Beginning was the Word[fn-14-P1445_802441:7-nf] .\" What passion, pray, is to be found in these words, \"beginning,\" and \"was,\" and \"Word\"? Is \"the beginning\" passion? does \"was\" imply passion? does \"the Word\" exist by means of passion? Or are we to say, that as passion is not to be found in the terms used, so neither is affinity expressed by the proclamation? Yet how could the Word's community of essence, and real relationship, and co eternity with the Beginning, be more strongly shown by other words than by these? For he does not say, \"Of the Beginning was begotten the Word,\" that he may not separate the Word from the Beginning by any conception of extension in time, but he proclaims together with the Beginning Him also Who was in the Beginning, making the word \"was\" common to the Beginning and to the Word, that the Word may not linger after the Beginning, but may, by entering in together with the faith as to the Beginning, by its proclamation forestall our hearing, before this admits the Beginning itself in isolation. Then he declares, \"And the Word was with God.\" Once more the Evangelist fears for our untrained state, once more he dreads our childish and untaught condition: he does not yet entrust to our ears the appellation of \"Father,\" lest any of the more carnally minded, learning of \"the Father,\" may be led by his understanding to imagine also by consequence a mother. Neither does he yet name in his proclamation the Son; for he still suspects our customary tendency to the lower nature, and fears lest any, hearing of the Son, should humanize the Godhead by an idea of passion. For this reason, resuming his proclamation, he again calls him \"the Word,\" making this the account of His nature to thee in thine unbelief. For as thy word proceeds from thy mind, without requiring the intervention of passion, so here also, in hearing of the Word, thou shalt conceive that which is from something, and shalt not conceive passion. Hence, once more resuming his proclamation, he says, \"And the Word was with God.\" O, how does he make the Word commensurate with God! rather, how does he extend the infinite in comparison with the infinite! \"The Word was with God\"-the whole being of the Word, assuredly, with the whole being of God. Therefore, as great as God is, so great, clearly, is the Word also that is with Him; so that if God is limited, then will the Word also, surely, be subject to limitation. But if the infinity of God exceeds limit, neither is the Word that is contemplated with Him comprehended by limits and measures. For no one would deny that the Word is contemplated together with the entire Godhead of the Father, so that he should make one part of the Godhead appear to be in the Word, and another destitute of the Word. Once more the spiritual voice of John speaks, once more the Evangelist in his proclamation takes tender care for the hearing of those who are in childhood: not yet have we so much grown by the hearing of his first words as to hear of \"the Son,\" and yet remain firm without being moved from our footing by the influence of the wonted sense. Therefore our herald, crying once more aloud, still proclaims in his third utterance \"the Word,\" and not \"the Son,\" saying, \"And the Word was God.\" First he declared wherein He was, then with whom He was, and now he says what He is, completing, by his third repetition, the object of his proclamation. For he says, \"It is no Word of those that are readily understood, that I declare to you, but God under the designation of the Word.\" For this Word, that was in the Beginning, and was with God, was not anything else besides God, but was also Himself God. And forthwith the herald, reaching the full height of his lofty speech, declares that this God Whom his proclamation sets forth is He by Whom all things were made, and is life, and the light of men, and the true light that shineth in darkness, yet is not obscured by the darkness, sojourning with His own, yet not received by His own: and being made flesh, and tabernacling, by means of the flesh, in man's nature. And when he has first gone through this number and variety of statements, he then names the Father and the Only-begotten, when there can be no danger that what has been purified by so many precautions should be allowed, in consequence of the sense of the word \"Father,\" to Sink down to any meaning tainted with pollution, for, \"we beheld His glory,\" he says, \"the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father.\"","title":"Book IV","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_15_book_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"We must, however, return to those who connect passion with the Divine generation, and on this account deny that the Lord is truly begotten, in order to avoid the conception of passion. To say that passion is absolutely linked with generation, and that on this account, in order that the Divine nature may continue in purity beyond the reach of passion, we ought to consider that the Son is alien to the idea of generation, may perhaps appear reasonable in the eyes of those who are easily deceived, but those who are instructed in the Divine mysteries[fn-14-P1489_831285:36-nf] have an answer ready to band, based upon admitted facts. For who knows not that it is generation that leads us back to the true and blessed life, not being the same with that which takes place \"of blood and of the will of the flesh[fn-14-P1490_831588:37-nf] ,\" in which are flux and change, and gradual growth to perfection, and all else that we observe in our earthly generation: but the other kind is believed to be from God, and heavenly, and, as the Gospel says, \"from above[fn-14-P1491_831829:38-nf] ,\" which excludes the passions of flesh and blood? I presume that they both admit the existence of this generation, and find no passion in it. Therefore not all generation is naturally connected with passion, but the material generation is subject to passion, the immaterial pure from passion. What constrains him then to attribute to the incorruptible generation of the Son what properly belongs to the flesh, and, by ridiculing the lower form of generation with his unseemly physiology, to exclude the Son from affinity with the Father? For if, even in our own case, it is generation that is the beginning of either life,-that generation which is through the flesh of a life of passion, that which is spiritual of a life of purity, (and no one who is in any sense numbered among Christians would contradict this statement,)-how is it allowable to entertain the idea of passion in thinking of generation as it concerns the incorruptible Nature? Let us moreover examine this point in addition to those we have mentioned. If they disbelieve the passionless character of the Divine generation on the ground of the passion that affects the flesh, let them also, from the same tokens, (those, I mean, to be found in ourselves,) refuse to believe that God acts as a Maker without passion. For if they judge of the Godhead by comparison of our own conditions, they must not confess that God either begets or creates; for neither of these operations is exercised by ourselves without passion. Let them therefore either separate from the Divine nature both creation and generation, that they may guard the impassibility of God on either side, and let them, that the Father may be kept safely beyond the range of passion, neither growing weary by creation, nor being defiled by generation, entirely reject front their doctrine the belief in the Only-begotten, or, if they agree[fn-14-P1492_833786:39-nf] that the one activity is exercised by the Divine power without passion, let them not quarrel about the other: for if He creates without labour or matter, He surely also begets without labour or flux.","title":"Book IV","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_20_book_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"2. Augustin replied: As regards what Faustus calls his principal reason for not receiving the genealogy of Jesus Christ, a complete refutation is found in the passages formerly quoted, where Christ declares Himself to be the Son of man, and in what we have said of the identity of the Son of man with the Son of God: that in His Godhead He has no earthly descent, while after the flesh He is of the seed of David, as the apostle teaches. We are to believe, therefore, that He came forth from the Father, that He descended from heaven, and also that the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst men. If the words, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?\"[fn-12-P1296_689691:1-nf] are quoted to show that Christ had no earthly mother or descent, it follows that we must believe that His disciples, whom He here teaches by His own example to set no value on earthly relationship, as compared with the kingdom of heaven, had no fathers, because Christ says to them, \"Call no man father upon earth; for one is your Father, even God.\"[fn-12-P1297_690059:2-nf] What He taught them to do with reference to their fathers, He Himself first did in reference to His own mother and brethren; as in many other things He condescended to set us an example, and to go before that we might follow in His footsteps. Faustus' principal objection to the genealogy fails completely; and after the defeat of this invincible force, the rest is easily routed. He says that the apostles who declared Christ to be the Son of man as well as the Son of God are not to be believed, because they were not present at the birth of Christ, whom they joined when He had reached manhood, nor heard of it from Christ Himself. Why then do they believe John when he says, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made,\"[fn-12-P1298_690947:3-nf] and such passages, which they agree to, without understanding them? Where did John see this, or did he ever hear it from the Lord Himself? In whatever way John learned this, those who narrate the nativity may have learned also. Again, how do they know that the Lord said, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?\" If on the authority of the evangelist, why do they not also believe that the mother and the brethren of Christ were seeking for Him? They believe that Christ said these words, which they misunderstand, while they deny a fact resting on the same authority. Once more, if Matthew could not know that Christ was born, because he knew Him only in His manhood, how could Manichaeus, who lived so long after, know that He was not born? They will say that Manichaeus knew this from the Holy Spirit which was in him. Certainly the Holy Spirit would make him speak the truth. But why not rather believe what Christ's own disciples tell us, who were personally acquainted with Him, and who not only had the gift of inspiration to supply defects in their knowledge, but in a purely natural way obtained information of the birth of Christ, and of His descent, when the event was fresh in memory? And yet he dares to call the apostles deaf and blind. Why were you not deaf and blind, to prevent you from learning such profane nonsense, and dumb too, to prevent you from uttering it?

For the thought that is formed by the thing which we know, is the word which we speak in the heart: which word is neither Greek nor Latin, nor of any other tongue. But when it is needful to convey this to the knowledge of those to whom we speak, then some sign is assumed whereby to signify it.

And Holy Scripture gives its testimony to this; for we read in the Gospel according to John: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.

And if some other reason may perhaps be given for this double gift of the Holy Spirit, at any rate we ought not to doubt that the same Holy Spirit was given when Jesus breathed upon them, of whom He by and by says, \"Go, baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,\" where this Trinity is especially commended to us. It is therefore He who was also given from heaven on the day of Pentecost, i.e. ten days after the Lord ascended into heaven. How, therefore, is He not God, who gives the Holy Spirit? Nay, how great a God is He who gives God! For no one of His disciples gave the HolySpirit, since they prayed that He might come upon those upon whom they laid their hands: they did not give Him themselves. And the Church preserves this custom even now in the case of her rulers. Lastly, Simon Magus also, when he offered the apostles money, does not say, \"Give me also this power, that I may give\" the Holy Spirit; but, \"that on whomsoever I may lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.\" Because neither had the Scriptures said before, And Simon, seeing that the apostles gave the Holy Spirit; but it had said,\" And Simon, seeing that the Holy Spirit was given by the laying on of the apostles' hands.\"[fn-21-P2125_1074760:122-nf] Therefore also the Lord Jesus Christ Himself not only gave the Holy Spirit as God, but also received it as man, and therefore He is said to be full of grace,[fn-21-P2126_1074944:123-nf] and of the Holy Spirit.[fn-21-P2127_1074987:124-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles it is more plainly written of Him, \"Because God anointed Him With the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-21-P2128_1075133:125-nf] Certainly not with visible oil but with the gift of grace which is signified by the visible ointment wherewith the Church anoints the baptized. And Christ was certainly not then anointed with the Holy Spirit, when He, as a dove, descended upon Him at His baptism.[fn-21-P2129_1075416:126-nf] For at that time He deigned to prefigure His body, i.e. His Church, in which especially the baptized receive the Holy Spirit. But He is to be understood to have been then anointed with that mystical and invisible unction, when the Word of God was made flesh,[fn-21-P2130_1075697:127-nf] i.e. when human nature, without any precedent merits of good works, was joined to God the Word in the womb of the Virgin, so that with it it became one person.

Both natures, too, as well the human as the divine, are shown in that also that is written of Him, that He received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, and shed forth the Holy Spirit:[fn-21-P2133_1076802:130-nf] seeing that He received as man, and shed forth as God.

They then in like manner rounded churches in every city, from which all the other churches, one after another, derived the tradition of the faith,[fn-33-P3394_1180697:205-nf] and the seeds of doctrine, and are every day deriving them,[fn-33-P3395_1180780:206-nf] that they may become churches.

Seeing that they, with their untrained and narrow intelligence, were disposed to look with wonder on the beauties of nature, not employing the things they beheld as a leader and guide to the beauty of the Nature that transcends them, they rather made their intelligence halt on arriving at the objects of its apprehension, and marvelled at each part of the creation severally-for this cause they did not stay their conception of the Deity at any single one of the things they beheld, but deemed everything they looked on in creation to be divine. And thus with the Egyptians, as the error developed its force more in respect of intellectual objects, the countless forms of spiritual beings were reckoned to be so many natures of Gods; while with the Babylonians the unerring circuit of the firmament was accounted a God, to whom they also gave the name of Bel. So, too, the foolishness of the heathen deifying individually the seven successive spheres, one bowed down to one, another to another, according to some individual form of error. For as they perceived all these circles moving in mutual relation, seeing that they had gone astray as to the most exalted, they maintained the same error by logical sequence, even to the last of them. And in addition to these, the aether itself, and the atmosphere diffused beneath it, the earth and sea and the subterranean region, and in the earth itself all things which are useful or needful for man's life,-of all these there was none which they held to be without part or lot in the Divine nature, but they bowed down to each of them, bringing themselves, by means of some one of the objects conspicuous in the creation, into bondage to all the successive parts of the creation, in such a way that, had the act of reverencing the creation been from the beginning even to them a thing evidently unlawful, they would not have been led astray into this deceit of polytheism. Let us look to it, then, lest we too share the same fate,-we who in being taught by Scripture to reverence the true Godhead, were trained to consider all created existence as external to the Divine nature, and to worship and revere that uncreated Nature alone, Whose characteristic and token is that it never either begins to be or ceases to be; since the great Isaiah thus speaks of the Divine nature with reference to these doctrines, in his exalted utterance,-who speaks in the person of the Deity, \"I am the first, and hereafter am I, and no God was before Me, and no God shall be after Me[fn-15-P1580_908359:4-nf] .\" For knowing more perfectly than all others the mystery of the religion of the Gospel, this great prophet, who foretold even that marvellous sign concerning the Virgin, and gave us the good tidings[fn-15-P1581_908957:5-nf] of the birth of the Child, and clearly pointed out to us that Name of the Son,-he, in a word, who by the Spirit includes in himself all the truth,-in order that the characteristic of the Divine Nature, whereby we discern that which really is from that which came into being, might be made as plain as possible to all, utters this saying in the person of God: \"I am the first, and hereafter am I, and before Me no God hath been, and after Me is none.\" Since, then, neither is that God which was before God, nor is that God which is after God, (for that which is after God is the creation, and that which is anterior to God is nothing, and Nothing is not God;-or one should rather say, that which is anterior to God is God in His eternal blessedness, defined in contradistinction to Nothing[fn-15-P1582_909766:6-nf] ;-since, I say, this inspired utterance was spoken by the mouth of the prophet, we learn by his means the doctrine that the Divine Nature is one, continuous with Itself and indiscerptible, not admitting in Itself priority and posteriority, though it be declared in Trinity, and with no one of the things we contemplate in it more ancient or more recent than another. Since, then, the saying is the saying of God, whether you grant that the words are the words of the Father or of the Son, the orthodox doctrine is equally upheld by either. For if it is the Father that speaks thus, He bears witness to the Son that He is not \"after\" Himself: for if the Son is God, and whatever is \"after\" the Father is not God, it is clear that the saying bears witness to the truth that the Son is in the Father, and not after the Father. If, on the other hand, one were to grant that this utterance is of the Son, the phrase, \"None hath been before Me,\" will be a clear intimation that He Whom we contemplate \"in the Beginning[fn-15-P1583_911186:7-nf] \" is apprehended together with the eternity of the Beginning. If, then, anything is \"after\" God, this is discovered, by the passages quoted, to be a creature, and not God: for He says, \"That which is after Me is not God[fn-15-P1584_911423:8-nf] .\"","title":"Book V","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_16_book_v","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"\"This, then, is what the man has to say who substitutes,-for we may not speak of it as `application,' lest any one should blame for such madness men holy and chosen for the preaching of godliness, so as to reproach their doctrine with a fall into such extravagance,-who substitutes his own mind[fn-15-P1599_915508:18-nf] for the intention of the Apostles! With what confusion are they not filled, who refer their own nonsense to the memory of the saints! With what absurdity do they not abound, who imagine that the man `emptied himself' to become man, and who maintain that He Who by obedience `humbled himself' to take the form of a servant was made conformable to men even before He took that form upon Him! Who, pray, ye most reckless of men, when he has the form of a servant, takes the form of a servant? and how can any one `empty himself' to become the very thing which he is? You will find no contrivance to meet this, bold as you are in saying or thinking things uncontrivable. Are you not verily of all men most miserable, who suppose that a man has suffered death for all men, and ascribe your own redemption to him? For if it is not of the Word Who was in the beginning and was God that the blessed Peter speaks, but of him who was `seen,' and who `emptied Himself,' as Basil says, and if the man who was seen `emptied Himself' to take `the form of a servant,' and He Who `emptied Himself' to take `the form of a servant,' emptied Himself to come into being as man, then the man who was seen emptied himself to come into being as man[fn-16-P1600_916875:19-nf] . The very nature of things is repugnant to this; and it is expressly contradicted by that writer[fn-16-P1601_918054:20-nf] who celebrates this dispensation in his discourse concerning the Divine Nature, when he says not that the man who was seen, but that the Word Who was in the beginning and was God took upon Him flesh, which is equivalent in other words to taking `the form of a servant.' If, then, you hold that these things are to be believed; depart from your error, and cease to believe that the man `emptied himself' to become man. And if you are not able to persuade those who will not be persuaded, destroy their incredulity by another saying, a second decision against them. Remember him who says, `Who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant.' There is none among men who will appropriate this phrase to himself. None of the saints that ever lived was the Only-begotten God and became man:-for that is what it means to `take the form of a servant,' `being in the form of God.' If, then, the blessed Peter speaks of Him Who `emptied Himself' to `take the form of a servant,' and if He Who was `in the form of God' did `empty Himself' to `take the form of a servant,' and if He Who in the beginning was God, being the Word and the Only-begotten God, is He Who was `in the form of God,' then the blessed Peter speaks to us of Him Who was in the beginning and was God, and expounds to us that it was He Who became Lord and Christ. This, then, is the conflict which Basil wages against himself, and he clearly appears neither to have `applied his own mind to the intention of the Apostles', nor to be able to preserve the sequence of his own arguments; for, according to them, he must, if he is conscious of their irreconcilable character, admit that the Word Who was in the beginning and was God became Lord; or if he tries to fit together statements that are mutually conflicting, and contentiously stands by them, he will add to them others yet more hostile, and maintain that there are two Christs and two Lords. For if the Word that was in the beginning and was God be one, and He Who `emptied Himself' and `took the form of a servant' be another, and if God the Word, by Whom are all things, be Lord, and this Jesus, Who was crucified after all things had come into being, be Lord also, there are, according to his view, two Lords and Christs. Our author, then, cannot by any argument clear himself from this manifest blasphemy. But if any one were to say in support of him that the Word Who was in the beginning is indeed the same Who became Lord, but that He became Lord and Christ in respect of His presence in the flesh, He will surely be constrained to say that the Son was not Lord before His presence in the flesh. At all events, even if Basil and his faithless followers falsely proclaim two Lords and two Christs, for us there is one Lord and Christ, by Whom all things were made, not becoming Lord by way of promotion, but existing before all creation and before all ages, the Lord Jesus, by Whom are all things, while all the saints with one harmonious voice teach us this truth and proclaim it as the most excellent of doctrines. Here the blessed John teaches us that God the Word, by Whom all things were made, has become incarnate, saying, `And the Word was made flesh[fn-16-P1602_921332:21-nf] '; here the most admirable Paul, urging those who attend to him to humility, speaks of Christ Jesus, Who was in the form of God, and emptied Himself to take the form of a servant, and was humbled to death, even the death of the Cross[fn-16-P1603_921584:22-nf] ; and again in another passage calls Him Who was crucified `the Lord of Glory': `for had they known it,' be says, `they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory[fn-16-P1604_921780:23-nf] '. Indeed, he speaks far more openly than this of the very essential nature by the name of `Lord,' where he says, `Now the Lord is the Spirit[fn-16-P1605_921941:24-nf] '. If, then, the Word Who was in the beginning, in that He is Spirit, is Lord, and the Lord of glory, and if God made Him Lord and Christ, it was the very Spirit and God the Word that God so made, and not some other Lord Whom Basil dreams about.\"","title":"Book V","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_16_book_v","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"The beginning of his accusation was that we are ashamed of the Cross of Him Who for our sakes underwent the Passion.

For it is clear that the reason why he sets the Father above the Son, and exalts Him with supreme honour, is this,-that in Him is not seen the shame of the Cross: and the reason why he asseverates that the nature of the Son varies in the sense of inferiority is this,-that the reproach of the Cross is referred to Him alone, and does not touch the Father. And let no one think that in saying this I am only following the general drift of his composition, for in going through all the blasphemy of his speech, which is there laboriously brought together, I found, in a passage later than that before us, this very blasphemy clearly expressed in undisguised language; and I propose to set forth, in the orderly course of my own argument, what they have written, which runs thus:-\"If,\" he says, \"he can show that the God Who is over all, Who is the unapproachable Light, was incarnate, or could be incarnate, came under authority, obeyed commands, came under the laws of men, bore the Cross, then let him say that the Light is equal to the Light.\" Who then is it who is ashamed of the Cross? he who, even after the Passion, worships the Son equally with the Father, or he who even before the Passion insults Him, not only by ranking Him with the creation, but by maintaining that He is of passible nature, on the ground that He could not have come to experience His sufferings had He not had a nature capable of such sufferings? We on our part assert that even the body in which He underwent His Passion, by being mingled with the Divine Nature, was made by that commixture to be that which the assuming[fn-16-P1610_927899:25-nf] Nature is. So far are we from entertaining any low idea concerning the Only-begotten God, that if anything belonging to our lowly nature was assumed in His dispensation of love for man, we believe that even this was transformed to what is Divine and incorruptible[fn-16-P1611_928232:26-nf] ; but Eunomius makes the suffering of the Cross to be a sign of divergence in essence, in the sense of inferiority, considering, I know not how, the surpassing act of power, by which He was able to perform this, to be an evidence of weakness; failing to perceive the fact that, while nothing which moves according to its own nature is looked upon as surprisingly wonderful, all things that overpass the limitations of their own nature become especially the objects of admiration, and to them every ear is turned, every mind is attentive, in wonder at the marvel. And hence it is that all who preach the word point out the wonderful character of the mystery in this respect,-that \"God was manifested in the flesh[fn-16-P1612_929216:27-nf] ,\" that \"the Word was made flesh[fn-16-P1613_929324:28-nf] ,\" that \"the Light shined in darkness[fn-16-P1614_929382:29-nf] ,\" \"the Life tasted death,\" and all such declarations which the heralds of the faith are wont to make, whereby is increased the marvellous character of Him Who manifested the superabundance of His power by means external to his own nature.

These are the things which we believe concerning Him Who was crucified, and for this cause we cease not to extol Him exceedingly, according to the measure of our powers, that He Who by reason of His unspeakable and unapproachable greatness is not comprehensible by any, save by Himself and the Father and the Holy Spirit, He, I say, was able even to descend to community with our weakness. But they adduce this proof of the Son's alienation in nature from the Father, that the Lord was manifested by the flesh and by the Cross, arguing on the ground that the Father's nature remained pure in impassibility, and could not in any way admit of a community which tended to passion, while the Son, by reason of the divergence of His nature by way of humiliation, was not incapable of being brought to experience the flesh and death, seeing that the change of condition was not great, but one which took place in a certain sense from one like state to another state kindred and homogeneous, because the nature of man is created, and the nature of the Only-begotten is created also.

For Jacob did not pour oil on the stone in an idolatrous way, as if making it a god; neither did he adore that stone, or sacrifice to it. But since the name of Christ comes from the chrism or anointing, something pertaining to the great mystery was certainly represented in this.

I must now resume the train of his complaints, that we may pass by none of the charges brought against us without an answer. And first I propose that we should examine this point, that he charges us with asserting that an ordinary man has wrought the salvation of the world. For although this point has been to some extent already cleared up by the investigations we have made, we shall yet briefly deal with it once more, that the mind of those who are acting as our judges on this slanderous accusation may be entirely freed from misapprehension. So far are we from referring to an ordinary man the cause of this great and unspeakable grace, that even if any should refer so great a boon to Peter and Paul, or to an angel from heaven, we should say with Paul, \"let him be anathema[fn-16-P1664_959817:2-nf] .\" For Paul was not crucified for us, nor were we baptized into a human name[fn-16-P1665_959923:3-nf] . Surely the doctrine which our adversaries oppose to the truth is not thereby strengthened when we confess that the saving power of Christ is more potent than human nature[fn-16-P1666_960112:4-nf] :-yet it may seem to be so, for their aim is to maintain at all points the difference of the essence of the Son from that of the Father, and they strive to show the dissimilarity of essence not only by the contrast of the Generated with the Ungenerate, but also by the opposition of the passible to the impassible. And while this is more openly maintained in the last part of their argument, it is also clearly shown in their present discourse[fn-16-P1667_961029:5-nf] . For if he finds fault with those who refer the Passion to the Human Nature, his intention is certainly to subject to the Passion the Godhead Itself. For our conception being twofold, and admitting of two developments, accordingly as the Divinity or the Humanity is held to have been in a condition of suffering, an attack on one of these views is clearly a maintaining of the other. Accordingly, if they find fault with those who look upon the Passion as concerning the Man, they will clearly approve those who say that the Godhead of the Son was subject to passion, and the position which these last maintain becomes an argument in favour of their own absurd doctrine. For if, according to their statement, the Godhead of the Son suffers, while that of the Father is preserved in absolute impassibility, then the impassible Nature is essentially different from that which admits passion. Seeing, therefore, that the dictum before us, though, so far as it is limited by number of words, it is a short one, yet affords principles and hypotheses for every kind ofdoctrinal pravity, it would seem right that ourreaders should require in our reply not so much brevity as soundness. We, then, neither attribute our own salvation to a man, nor admit that the incorruptible and Divine Nature is capable of suffering and mortality: but since we must assuredly believe the Divine utterances which declare to us that the Word that was in the beginning was God[fn-16-P1668_962564:6-nf] , and that afterward the Word made flesh was seen upon the earth and conversed with men[fn-16-P1669_962673:7-nf] , we admit in our creed those conceptions which are consonant with the Divine utterance. For when we hear that He is Light, and Power, and Righteousness, and Life, and Truth, and that by Him all things were made, we account all these and such-like statements as things to be believed, referring them to God the Word: but when we hear of pain, of slumber, of need, of trouble, of bonds, of nails, of the spear, of blood, of wounds, of burial, of the sepulchre, and all else of this kind, even if they are somewhat opposed to what has previously been stated, we none the less admit them to be things to be believed, and true, having regard to the flesh; which we receive by faith as conjoined with the Word. For as it is not possible to contemplate the peculiar attributes of the flesh as existing in the Word that was in the beginning, so also on the other hand we may not conceive those which are proper to the Godhead as existing in the nature of the flesh. As, therefore, the teaching of the Gospel concerning our Lord is mingled, partly of lofty and Divine ideas, partly of those which are lowly and human, we assign every particular phrase accordingly to one or other of these Natures which we conceive in the mystery, that which is human to the Humanity, that which is lofty to the Godhead, and say that, as God, the Son is certainly impassible and incapable of corruption: and whatever suffering is asserted concerning Him in the Gospel, He assuredly wrought by means of His Human Nature which admitted of such suffering. For verily the Godhead works the salvation of the world by means of that body which encompassed It, in such wise that the suffering was of the body, but the operation was of God; and even if some wrest to the support of the opposite doctrine the words of the Apostle, \"God spared not His own Sons,[fn-16-P1670_964521:8-nf] ,\" and, \"God sent His own Son[fn-16-P1671_964569:9-nf] ,\" and other similar phrases which seem to refer, in the matter of the Passion, to the Divine Nature, and not to the Humanity, we shall none the less refuse to abandon sound doctrine, seeing that Paul himself declares to us more clearly the mystery of this subject. For he everywhere attributes to the Human element in Christ the dispensation of the Passion, when he says, \"for since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead[fn-16-P1672_965040:10-nf] ,\" and, \"God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, condemned sin in the flesh[fn-16-P1673_965154:11-nf] \" (for he says, \"in the flesh,\" not \"in the Godhead\"); and \"He was crucified through weakness\" (where by \"weakness\" he means \"the flesh\"), \"yet liveth by power[fn-16-P1674_965337:12-nf] \" (while he indicates by \"power\" the Divine Nature); and, \"He died unto sin\" (that is, with regard to the body), \"but liveth unto God[fn-16-P1675_965492:13-nf] \" (that is, with regard to the Godhead, so that by these words it is established that, while the Man tasted death, the immortal Nature did not admit the suffering of death); and again; \"He made Him to be sin for us, Who knew no sin[fn-16-P1676_965742:14-nf] ,\" giving once more the name of \"sin\" to the flesh.","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_20_homily_xiv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But mark, I pray thee, how in every case when He is about to depart unto the Gentiles, He hath the occasion given Him by Jews.

For neither is it holy to worship the mere man, nor religious to say that He is God only without the Manhood. For if Christ is God, as indeed He is, but took not human nature upon Him, we are strangers to salvation. Let us then worship Him as God, but believe that He also was made Man. For neither is there any profit in calling Him man without Godhead nor any salvation in refusing to confess the Manhood together with the Godhead. Let us confess the presence of Him who is both King and Physician. For Jesus the King when about to become our Physician, girded Himself with the linen of humanity[fn-14-P1429_389375:8-nf] , and healed that which was sick. The perfect Teacher of babes[fn-14-P1430_389454:9-nf] became a babe among babes, that He might give wisdom to the foolish. The Bread of heaven came down on earth[fn-14-P1431_389578:10-nf] that He might feed the hungry.","title":"Lecture XII.","author":"Cyril"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_17_lecture_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"4.

Assuredly nay; from the very moment that He began to be man, He was nothing else than the Son of God, the only Son of God, the Word who was made flesh, and therefore He was God so that just as each individual man unites in one person a body and a rational soul, so Christ in one person unites the Word and man. Now wherefore was this unheard of glory conferred on human nature,-a glory which, as there was no antecedent merit, was of course wholly of grace,-except that here those who looked at the matter soberly and honestly might behold a clear manifestation of the power of God's free grace, and might understand that they are justified from their sins by the same grace which made the man Christ Jesus free from the possibility of sin?

Who will dare to say so? Nor is it necessary to show by reasoning how many other absurdities flow from this supposition, when it is itself so absurd that no believer's ears can bear to hear it. Hence, as we confess, \"Our Lord Jesus Christ, who of God is God, and as man was born of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, having both natures, the divine and the human, is the only Son of God the Father Almighty, from whom proceedeth the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-23-P2371_1164208:68-nf] Now in what sense do we say that Christ was born of the Holy Spirit, if the Holy Spirit did not beget Him?

Or is it that, when one of the Three is mentioned as the author of any work, the whole Trinity is to be understood as working? That is true, and can be proved by examples. But we need not dwell longer on this solution. For the puzzle is, in what sense it is said, \"born of the Holy Ghost,\" when He is in no sense the Son of the Holy Ghost? For though God made this world, it would not be right to say that it is the Son of God, or that it was born of God; we would say that it was created, or made, or framed, or ordered by Him, or whatever form of expression we can properly use. Here, then, when we make confession that Christ was born of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, it is difficult to explain how it is that He is not the Son of the Holy Ghost and is the Son of the Virgin Mary, when He was born both of Him and of her. It is clear beyond a doubt that He was not born of the Holy Spirit as His father, in the same sense that He was born of the Virgin as His mother.","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_23_introductory_notice","source_chapter":105,"source_paragraph":"344","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Accordingly, when we hear and read in Scripture that He \"will have all men to be saved,\"[fn-27-P2704_1260489:206-nf] although we know well that all men are not saved, we are not on that account to restrict the omnipotence of God, but are rather to understand the Scripture, \"Who will have all men to be saved,\" as meaning that no man is saved unless God wills his salvation: not that there is no man whose salvation He does not will, but that no man is saved apart from His will; and that, therefore, we should pray Him to will our salvation, because if He will it, it must necessarily be accomplished. And it was of prayer to God that the apostle was speaking when he used this expression. And on the same principle we interpret the expression in the Gospel: \"The true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world:\"[fn-27-P2705_1261223:207-nf] not that there is no man who is not enlightened, but that no man is enlightened except by Him. Or, it is said, \"Who will have all men to be saved;\" not that there is no man whose salvation He does not will (for how, then, explain the fact that He was unwilling to work miracles in the presence of some who, He said, would have repented if He had worked them?), but that we are to understand by \"all men,\" the human race in all its varieties of rank and circumstances,-kings, subjects; noble, plebeian, high, low, learned, and unlearned; the sound in body, the feeble, the clever, the dull, the foolish, the rich, the poor, and those of middling circumstances; males, females, infants, boys, youths; young, middle-aged, and old men; of every tongue, of every fashion, of all arts, of all professions, with all the innumerable differences of will and conscience, and whatever else there is that makes a distinction among men. For which of all these classes is there out of which God does not will that men should be saved in all nations through His only-begotten Son, our Lord, and therefore does save them; for the Omnipotent cannot will in vain, whatsoever He may will? Now the apostle had enjoined that prayers should be made for all men, and had especially added, \"For kings, and for all that are in authority,\" who might be supposed, in the pride and pomp of worldly station, to shrink from the humility of the Christian faith. Then saying, \"For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,\" thatis, that prayers should be made for such as these, he immediately adds, as if to remove any ground of despair, \"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.\"[fn-27-P2706_1262949:208-nf] God, then, in His great condescension has judged it good to grant to the prayers of the humble the salvation of the exalted; and assuredly we have many examples of this.

As, then, in this place we must understand by \"every herb,\" every kind of herbs, so in the former passage we may understand by \"all men,\" every sort of men. And we may interpret it in any other way we please, so long as we are not compelled to believe that the omnipotent God has willed anything to be done which was not done: for setting aside all ambiguities, if \"He hath done all that He pleased in heaven and in earth,\"[fn-27-P2708_1263872:210-nf] as the psalmist sings of Him, He certainly did not will to do anything that He hath not done.","title":"Introductory Notice","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_18_book_vii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But Peter and Paul, he says, were named by men, and hence it comes that it is possible in their case to change the appellations. Why, what existing thing has not been named by men? I call you to testify on behalf of my argument. For if you make change of names a sign of things having been named by men, you will thereby surely allow that every name has been imposed upon things by us, since the same appellations of objects have not obtained universally. For as in the case of Paul who was once Saul, and of Peter who was formerly Simon, so earth and sky and air and sea and all the parts of the creation have not been named alike by all, but are named in one way by the Hebrews, and in another way by us, and are denoted by every nation by different names. If then Eunomius' argument is valid when he maintains that it was for this reason, to wit, that their names had been imposed by men, that Peter and Paul were named afresh, our teaching will surely be valid also, starting as it does from like premises, which says that all things are named by us, on the ground that their appellations vary according to the distinctions of nations. Now if all things are so, surely the Generate and the Ungenerate are not exceptions, for even they are among the things that change their name. For when we gather, as it were, into the form of a name the conception of any subject that arises in us, we declare our concept by words that vary at different times, not making, but signifying, the thing by the name we give it. For the things remain in themselves as they naturally are, while the mind, touching on existing things, reveals its thought by such words as are available. And just as the essence of Peter was not changed with the change of his name, so neither is any other of the things we contemplate changed in the process of mutation of names. And for this reason we say that the term \"Ungenerate\" was applied by us to the true and first Father Who is the Cause of all, and that no harm would result as regards the signifying of the Subject, if we were to acknowledge the same concept under another name. For it is allowable instead of speaking of Him as \"Ungenerate,\" to call Him the \"First Cause\" or \"Father of the Only-begotten,\" or to speak of Him as \"existing without cause,\" and many such appellations which lead to the same thought; so that Eunomius confirms our doctrines by the very arguments in which he makes complaint against us, because we know no name significant of the Divine Nature. We are taught the fact of Its existence, while we assert that an appellation of such force as to include the unspeakable and infinite Nature, either does not exist at all, or at any rate is unknown to us. Let him then leave his accustomed language of fable, and show us the names which signify the essences, and then proceed further to divide the subject by the divergence of their names. But so long as the saying of the Scripture is true that Abraham and Moses were not capable of the knowledge of the Name, and that \"no man hath seen God at any time[fn-17-P1793_1046732:29-nf] ,\" and that \"no man hath seen Him, nor can see[fn-17-P1794_1046799:30-nf] ,\" and that the light around Him is unapproachable[fn-17-P1795_1046870:31-nf] , and \"there is no end of His greatness[fn-17-P1796_1046930:32-nf] \";-so long as we say and believe these things, how like is an argument that promises any comprehension and expression of the infinite Nature, by means of the significance of names; to one who thinks that he can enclose the whole sea in his own hand! for as the hollow of one's hand is to the whole deep, so is all the power of language in comparison with that Nature which is unspeakable and incomprehensible.","title":"Book VII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_19_dialogue_i_the_immutable_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Orth.-How then do you advance the statement in the gospel \"the word became flesh.\"[fn-28-P2843_873379:5-nf] and predicate mutation of the immutable nature?","title":"Dialogue I.-The Immutable.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_19_dialogue_i_the_immutable_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Eran.-But the word \"take\" is your own invention.

But just as the word, which tells us in reference to God of the \"generation\" of the creation, did not add the statement that it was generated by the aid of any material, declaring that its material substance, its place, its time, and all the like, had their existence in the power of His will, so here too, in speaking of the \"Son,\" it leaves out of sight both all other things which human nature sees in earthly generation (passions, I mean, and dispositions, and the co-operation of time and the need of place, and especially matter), without all which earthly generation as a result of nature does not occur. Now every such conception of matter and interval being excluded from the sense of the word \"Son,\" nature alone remains, and hereby in the word \"Son\" is declared concerning the Only-begotten the close and true character of His manifestation from the Father. And since this particular species of generation did not suffice to produce in us an adequate idea of the unspeakable existence of the Only-begotten, it employs also another species of generation, that which is the result of efflux, to express the Divine Nature of the Son, and calls Him \"the brightness of glory[fn-18-P1852_1084218:26-nf] ,\" the \"savour of ointment[fn-18-P1853_1084261:27-nf] ,\" the \"breath of God[fn-18-P1854_1084308:28-nf] ,\" which our accustomed use, in the scientific discussion we have already made, calls material efflux.

It runs thus:-\"While there are,\" he says, \"two statements which we have made, the one, that the essence of the Only-begotten was not before its own generation, the other, that, being generated, it was before all things-\" What kind of generation does our dogmatist propose to us? Is it one of which we may fittingly think and speak in regard to God? And who is so godless as to pre-suppose non-existence in God? But it is clear that he has in view this material generation of ours, and is making the lower nature the teacher of his conceptions concerning the Only-begotten God, and since an ox or an ass or a camel is not before its own generation, he thinks it proper to say even of the Only-begotten God that which the course of the lower nature presents to our view in the case of the animals, without thinking, corporeal theologian that he is, of this fact, that the predicate \"Only-begotten\", applied to God, signifies by the very word itself that which is not in common with all begetting, and is peculiar to Him. How could the term \"Only-begotten\" be used of this \"generation,\" if it had community and identity of meaning with other generation? That there is something unique and exceptional to be understood in His case, which is not to be remarked in other generation, is distinctly and suitably expressed by the appellation of \"Only-begotten\"; as, were any element of the lower generation conceived in it, He Who in respect of any of the attributes of His generation was placed on a level with other things that are begotten would no longer be \"Only-begotten.\" For if the same things are to be said of Him which are said of the other things that come into being by generation, the definition will transform the sense of \"Only-begotten\" to signify a kind of relationship involving brotherhood. If then the sense of \"Only-begotten\" points to absence of mixture and community with the rest. of generated things, we shall not admit that anything which we behold in the lower generation is also to be conceived in the case of that existence which the Son has from the Father. But non-existence before generation is proper to all things that exist by generation: therefore this is foreign to the special character of the Only-begotten, to which the name \"Only-begotten\" bears witness that there attaches nothing belonging to the mode of that form of common generation which Eunomius misapprehends. Let this materialist and friend of the senses be persuaded therefore to correct the error of his conception by the other forms of generation. What will you say when you hear of the \"brightness of glory\" or of the \"savour of ointment[fn-18-P1861_1090276:32-nf] ?\" That the \"brightness\" was not before its own generation? But if you answer thus, you will surely admit that neither did the \"glory\" exist, nor the \"ointment\": for it is not possible that the \"glory\" should be conceived as having existed by itself, dark and lustreless, or the \"ointment\" without producing its sweet breath: so that if the \"brightness\" \"was not,\" the \"glory\" also surely \"was not,\" and the \"savour\" being non-existent, there is also proved the non-existence of the \"ointment.\" But if these examples taken from Scripture excite any man's fear, on the ground that they do not accurately present to us the majesty of the Only-begotten, because neither is essentially the same with its substratum-neither the exhalation with the ointment, nor the beam with the sun-let the true Word correct his fear, Who was in the Beginning and is all that the Beginning is, and existent before all; since John so declares in his preaching, \"And the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-18-P1862_1091316:33-nf] .\" If then the Father is God and the Son is God, what doubt still remains with regard to the perfect Divinity of the Only-begotten, when by the sense of the word \"Son\" is acknowledged the close relationship of Nature, by \"brightness\" the conjunction and inseparability, and by the appellation of \"God,\" applied alike to the Father and the Son, their absolute equality, while the \"express image,\" contemplated in reference to the whole Person[fn-18-P1863_1091774:34-nf] of the Father, marks the absence of any defect in the Son's proper greatness, and the \"form of God\" indicates His complete identity by showing in itself all those marks by which the Godhead is betokened.","title":"Book VIII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_22_homily_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"For this cause He who had raised thousands of the dead with a word only, when He was calling Lazarus, added also a prayer; and then, lest this should make Him appear less than Him that begat Him, He, to correct this suspicion, added, \"I said these things, because of the people which standeth by, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.\"[fn-15-P1551_517748:8-nf] And neither doth He work all things as one who acted by His own power, that He might thoroughly correct their weakness; nor doth He all things with prayer, lest He should leave matter of evil suspicion to them that should follow, as though He were without strength or power: but He mingles the latter with the former, and those again with these. Neither doth He this indiscriminately, but with His own proper wisdom. For while He doeth the greater works authoritatively, in the less He looks up unto Heaven. Thus, when absolving sins, and revealing His secrets, and opening Paradise, and driving away devils, and cleansing lepers, and bridling death, and raising the dead by thousands, He did all by way of command: but when, what was much less than these, He was causing many loaves to spring forth out of few, then tie looked up to Heaven: signifying that not through weakness He doth this.

No, for the Spirit of prophecy recognises clearly in what respect we are the brethren of the Only-begotten God.

As a worm, which is born without the ordinary process of conception, or else comes up into the world, already living, from the depths of the earth, He speaks here in manifestation of the fact that He had assumed flesh and also brought it up, living, from Hades. Throughout the Psalm He is foretelling by the Spirit of prophecy the mysteries of His Passion: it is therefore in respect of the Dispensation, in which He suffered, that He has brethren.

I suppose he will not bring a charge of unconstitutional conduct against the great John, by whom, in his lofty proclamation, the Only-begotten is declared to be God, Who was with God and was God[fn-18-P1899_1117074:2-nf] . If he, then, the proclaimer of the Godhead of the Only-begotten, is worthy of credit, and if \"God is the most highly exalted of all goods,\" it follows that the Son is alleged by the enemies of His glory, to be \"the most highly exalted of all goods.\" And as this phrase is also applied to the Father, the superlative force of \"most highly exalted\" admits of no diminution or addition by way of comparison. But, now that we have obtained from the adversary's testimony these statements for the proof of the glory of the Only-begotten, we must add in support of sound doctrine his next statement too. He says, \"God, the most highly exalted of all goods, being without hindrance from nature, or constraint from cause, or impulse from need, begets and creates according to the supremacy of His own authority, having His will as power sufficient for the constitution of the things produced. If, then, all good is according to His will, He not only determines that which is made as good, but also the time of its being. good, if, that is to say, as one may assume, it is an indication of weakness to make what one does not will[fn-19-P1900_1118214:3-nf] .\" We shall borrow so far as this, for the confirmation of the orthodox doctrines, from our adversaries' statement, percolated as that statement is by vile and counterfeit clauses. Yes, He Who has, by the supremacy of His authority, power in His will that suffices for the constitution of the things that are made, He Who created all things without hindrance from nature or compulsion from cause, does determine not only that which is made as good, but also the time of its being good. But He Who made all things is, as the gospel proclaims, the Only-begotten God. He, at that time when He willed it, did make the creation; at that time, by means of the circumambient essence, He surrounded with the body of heaven all that universe that is shut off within its compass: at that time, when He thought it well that this should be, He displayed the dry land to view, He enclosed the waters in their hollow places; vegetation, fruits, the generation of animals, the formation of man, appeared at that time when each of these things seemed expedient to the wisdom of the Creator:-and He Who made all these things (I will once more repeat my statement) is the Only-begotten God Who made the ages. For if the interval of the ages has preceded existing things, it is proper to employ the temporal adverb, and to say \"He then willed\" and \"He then made\": but since the age was not, since no conception of interval is present to our minds in regard to that Divine Nature which is not measured by quantity or by interval, the force of temporal expressions must surely be void. Thus to say that the creation has had given to it a beginning in time, according to the good pleasure of the wisdom of Him Who made all things, does not go beyond probability: but to regard the Divine Nature itself as being in a kind of extension measured by intervals, belongs only to those who have been trained in the new wisdom. What a point is this, embedded in his words, which I intentionally passed by in my eagerness to reach the subject! I will now resume it, and read it to show our author's cleverness.","title":"Book IX","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":47,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_25_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"26. Who in the angel striving with Jacob, on the one hand is constrained to give him a blessing, as the weaker to the stronger, the conquered to the conqueror, and on the other hand puts his thigh-bone out of joint, but He who, when He suffered the people of Israel to prevail against Him, blessed those among them who believed, while the multitude, like Jacob's thigh-bone, halted in their carnality? Who is the stone placed under Jacob's head, but Christ the head of man? And in its anointing the very name of Christ is expressed, for, as all know, Christ means anointed. Christ refers to this in the Gospel, and declares it to be a type of Himself, when He said of Nathanael that he was an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile, and when Nathanael, resting his head, as it were, on this Stone, or on Christ, confessed Him as the Son of God and the King of Israel anointing the Stone by his confession, in which he acknowledged Jesus to be Christ. On this occasion the Lord made appropriate mention of what Jacob saw in his dream \"Verily I say unto you, Ye shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\"[fn-14-P1447_778322:44-nf] This Jacob saw, who in the blessing was called Israel, when he had the stone for a pillow, and had the vision of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, on which the angels of God were ascending and descending.[fn-14-P1448_778555:45-nf] The angels denote the evangelists, or preachers of Christ. They ascend when they rise above the created universe to describe the supreme majesty of the divine nature of Christ as being in the beginning God with God, by whom all things were made. They descend to tell of His being made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law. Christ is the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, or from the carnal to the spiritual: for by His assistance the carnal ascend to spirituality; and the spiritual may be said to descend to nourish the carnal with milk when they cannot speak to them as to spiritual, but as to carnal.[fn-14-P1449_779233:46-nf] There is thus both an ascent and a descent upon the Son of man. For the Son of man is above as our head, being Himself the Saviour; and He is below in His body, the Church. He is the ladder, for He says, \"I am the way.\" We ascend to Him to see Him in heavenly places; we descend to Him for the nourishment of His weak members. And the ascent and descent are by Him as well as to Him. Following His example, those who preach Him not only rise to behold Him exalted, but let themselves down to give a plain announcement of the truth. So the apostle ascends, \"Whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God;\" and descends, \"Whether we be sober, it is for your sake.\" And by whom did he ascend and descend? \"For the love of Christ constraineth us: for we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all died; and that He died for all, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto Him that died for them, and rose again.\"[fn-14-P1450_780193:47-nf] ","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_25_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"30. The Israelites are led through the wilderness, as those who are baptized are in the wilderness while on the way to the promised land, hoping and patiently waiting for that which they see not. In the wilderness are severe trials, lest they should in heart return to Egypt. Still Christ does not leave them; the pillar does not go away. The bitter waters are sweetened by wood, as hostile people become friendly by learning to honor the cross of Christ. The twelve fountains watering the seventy palm trees are a figure of apostolic grace watering the nations. As seven is mutiplied by ten, so the decalogue is fulfilled in the sevenfold operation of the Spirit. The enemy attempting to stop them in their way is overcome by Moses stretching out his hands in the figure of the cross. The deadly bites of serpents are healed by the brazen serpent, which was lifted up that they might look at it. The Lord Himself gives the explanation of this: \"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but have everlasting life.\"[fn-14-P1457_784411:50-nf] So in many other things we may find a protest against the obstinacy of unbelieving hearts. In the passover a lamb is killed, representing Christ, of whom it is said in the Gospel, \"Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world!\"[fn-14-P1458_784674:51-nf] In the passover the bones of the lamb were not to be broken; and on the cross the bones of the Lord were not broken. The evangelist, in reference to this, quotes the words, \"A bone of Him shall not be broken.\"[fn-14-P1459_784901:52-nf] The posts were marked with blood to keep away destruction, as people are marked on their foreheads with the sign of the Lord's passion for their salvation. The law was given on the fiftieth day after the passover; so the Holy Spirit came on the fiftieth day after the passion of the Lord. The law is said to have been written with the finger of God; and the Lord says of the Holy Spirit, \"With the finger of God I cast out devils.\"[fn-14-P1460_785352:53-nf] Such are the Scriptures in which Faustus, after shutting his eyes, declares that he can see no prediction of Christ. But we need not wonder that he should have eyes to read and yet no heart to understand, since, instead of knocking in devout faith at the door of the heavenly secret, he dares to act in profane hostility. So let it be, for so it ought to be. Let the gate of salvation be shut to the proud.

And so God Only-begotten, containing in Himself the form and image of the invisible God, in all things which are properties of God the Father is equal to Him by virtue of the fulness of true Godhead in Himself. For, as we have shewn in the former books, in respect of power and veneration He is as mighty and as worthy of honour as the Father: so also, inasmuch as the Father is always Father, He too, inasmuch as He is the Son, possesses the like property of being always the Son. For according to the words spoken to Moses, He Who is, hath sent Me unto you[fn-23-P2342_1493965:23-nf] , we obtain the unambiguous conception that absolute being belongs to God; since that which is, cannot be thought of or spoken of as not being. For being and not being are contraries, nor can these mutually exclusive descriptions be simultaneously true of one and the same object: for while the one is present, the other must be absent. Therefore, where anything is, neither conception nor language will admit of its not being. When our thoughts are turned backwards, and are continually carried back further and further to understand the nature of Him Who is, this sole fact about Him, that He is, remains ever prior to our thoughts; since that quality, which is infinitely present in God, always withdraws itself from the backward gaze of our thoughts, though they reach back to an infinite distance. The result is that the backward straining of our thoughts can never grasp anything prior to God's property of absolute existence; since nothing presents itself, to enable us to understand the nature of God, even though we go on seeking to eternity, save always the fact that God always is. That then which has both been declared about God by Moses, that of which our human intelligence can give no further explanation; that very quality the Gospels testify to be a property of God Only-begotten; since in the beginning was the Word, and since the Word was with God, and since He was the true Light, and since God Only-begotten is in the bosom of the Father[fn-23-P2343_1495453:24-nf] , and since Jesus Christ is God over all[fn-23-P2344_1495521:25-nf] .","title":"Book XII.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_21_dialogue_iii_the_impassible_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"189","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Orth.-And so with the text, \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God,\"[fn-46-P4626_1152201:20-nf] and the like.","title":"Dialogue III.-The Impassible.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_21_dialogue_iii_the_impassible_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"286","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Eran.-Because John called the Lord \"a lamb,\"[fn-47-P4755_1173609:52-nf] and Isaiah called Him \"lamb\" and \"sheep.\"[fn-47-P4756_1173680:53-nf] ","title":"Dialogue III.-The Impassible.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":36,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_21_dialogue_iii_the_impassible_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"286","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Eran.-Because John called the Lord \"a lamb,\"[fn-47-P4755_1173609:52-nf] and Isaiah called Him \"lamb\" and \"sheep.\"[fn-47-P4756_1173680:53-nf] ","title":"Dialogue III.-The Impassible.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":32,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"When, therefore, we read in the prophetical books that God is to come to do judgment at the last, from the mere mention of the judgment, and although there is nothing else to determine the meaning, we must gather that Christ is meant; for though the Father will judge, He will judge by the coming of the Son. For He Himself, by His own manifested presence, \"judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son;\"[fn-40-P4066_2224896:176-nf] for as the Son was judged as a man, He shall also judge in human form.

The Holy Spirit was given to Him, and was manifested, as the evangelist testifies, in the form of a dove.[fn-40-P4068_2226033:178-nf] He brought forth judgment to the Gentiles, because He predicted what was hidden from them. In His meekness He did not cry, nor did He cease to proclaim the truth. But His voice was not heard, nor is it heard, without, because He is not obeyed by those who are outside of His body. And the Jews themselves, who persecuted Him, He did not break, though as a bruised reed they had lost their integrity, and as smoking flax their light was quenched; for He spared them, having come to be judged and not yet to judge. He brought forth judgment in truth, declaring that they should be punished did they persist in their wickedness. His face shone on the Mount,[fn-40-P4069_2226707:179-nf] His fame in the world.

For this is the last judgment, which He will set in the earth when He comes from heaven. And it is in Him, too, we already see the concluding expression of the prophecy fulfilled: \"In His name shall the nations hope.\" And by this fulfillment, which no one can deny, men are encouraged to believe in that which is most impudently denied. For who could have hoped for that which even those who do not yet believe in Christ now see fulfilled among us, and which is so undeniable that they can but gnash their teeth and pine away? Who, I say, could have hoped that the nations would hope in the name of Christ, when He was arrested, bound, scourged, mocked, crucified, when even the disciples themselves had lost the hope which they had begun to have in Him?

Let us listen to his arrogant utterance:-\"Surely it would have been idle for the Lord to call Himself `the door,' if there were none to pass through to the understanding and contemplation of the Father, and it would have been idle for Him to call Himself `the way,' if He gave no facility to those who wish to come to the Father. And how could He be a light, without lightening men, without illuminating the eye of their soul to understand both Himself and the transcendent Light?\" Well, if he were here enumerating some arguments from his own head, that evade the understanding of the hearers by their subtlety, there would perhaps be a possibility of being deceived by the ingenuity of the argument, as his underlying thought frequently escapes the reader's notice. But since he alleges the Divine words, of course no one blames those who believe that their inspired teaching is the common property of all. \"Since then,\" he says, \"the Lord was named `a door,' it follows from hence that the essence of God may be comprehended by man.\" But the Gospel does not admit of this meaning. Let us hear the Divine utterance itself. \"I am the door,\" Christ says; \"by Me if any man enter in he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and find pasture[fn-19-P1942_1166647:1-nf] \" Which then of these is the knowledge of the essence? For as several things are here said, and each of them has its own special meaning, it is impossible to refer them all to the idea of the essence, lest the Deity should be thought to be compounded of different elements; and yet it is not easy to find which of the phrases just quoted can most properly be applied to that subject. The Lord is \"the door,\" \"By Me,\" He says, \"if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and shall find pasture.\" Are we to say[fn-19-P1943_1167193:2-nf] \"entrance\" of which he speaks in place of the essence of God, or \"salvation\" of those that enter in, or \"going out,\" or \"pasture,\" or \"finding\"?-for each of these is peculiar in its significance, and does not agree in meaning with the rest. For to get within appears obviously contrary to \"going out,\" and so with the other phrases. For \"pasture,\" in its proper meaning, is one thing, and \"finding\" another thing distinct from it. Which, then, of these is the essence of the Father supposed to be? For assuredly one cannot, by uttering all these phrases that disagree one with another in signification, intend to indicate by incompatible terms that Essence which is simple and uncompounded. And how can the word hold good, \"No man hath seen God at any time[fn-19-P1944_1168015:3-nf] \" and, \"Whom no man hath seen nor can see[fn-19-P1945_1168075:4-nf] \" and, \"There shall no man see the face of the Lord and live[fn-19-P1946_1168154:5-nf] \" if to be inside the door, or outside, or the finding pasture, denote the essence of the Father? For truly He is at the same time a \"door of encompassing[fn-19-P1947_1168334:6-nf] \" and a \"house of defence[fn-19-P1948_1168383:7-nf] \" as David calls Him, and through Himself He receives them that enter, and in Himself He saves those who have come within, and again by Himself He leads them forth to the pasture of virtues, and becomes all things to them that are in the way of salvation, that so He may make Himself that which the needs of each demand,-both way, and guide, and \"door of encompassing,\" and \"house of defence,\" and \"water of comfort[fn-19-P1949_1168815:8-nf] \" and \"green pasture[fn-19-P1950_1168853:9-nf] \" which in the Gospel He calls \"pasture\": but our new divine says that the Lord has been called \"the door\" because of the knowledge of the essence of the Father. Why then does he not force into the same significance the titles, \"Rock,\" and \"Stone,\" and \"Fountain,\" and \"Tree,\" and the rest, that so he might obtain evidence for his own theory by the multitude of strange testimonies, as he is well able to apply to each of these the same account which he has given of the Way, the Door, and the Light? But, as I am so taught by the inspired Scripture, I boldly affirm that He Who is above every name has for us many names, receiving them in accordance with the variety of His gracious dealings with us[fn-19-P1951_1169573:10-nf] \"tower of strength[fn-19-P1952_1169826:11-nf] \" and a \"city of encompassing[fn-19-P1953_1169873:12-nf] ,\" and a fountain, and a rock, and a vine, and a physician, and resurrection, and all the like, with reference to us, imparting Himself under various aspects by virtue of His benefits to us-ward. But those who are keen-sighted beyond human power, who see the incomprehensible, but overlook what may be comprehended, when they use such titles to expound the essences, are positive that they not only see, but measure Him Whom no man hath seen nor can see, but do not with the eye of their soul discern the Faith, which is the only thing within the compass of our observation, valuing before this the knowledge which they obtain from ratiocination. Just so I have heard the sacred record laying blame upon the sons of Benjamin who did not regard the law, but could shoot within a hair's breadth[fn-19-P1954_1170691:13-nf] , wherein, methinks, the word exhibited their eager pursuit of an idle object, that they were far darting and dexterous aimers at things that were useless and unsubstantial, but ignorant and regardless of what was manifestly for their benefit. For after what I have quoted, the history goes on to relate what befel them, how, when they had run madly after the iniquity of Sodom, and the people of Israel had taken up arms against them in full force, they were utterly destroyed. And it seems to me to be a kindly thought to warn young archers not to wish to shoot within a hair's-breadth, while they have no eyes for the door of the faith, but rather to drop their idle labour about the incomprehensible, and not to lose the gain that is ready to their hand, which is found by faith alone.

For he wishes to show that the Son is something different from eternal life, while, unless eternal life is found in the Son, our faith will be proved to be idle, and our preaching to be vain, baptism a superfluity, the agonies of the martyrs all for nought, the toils of the Apostles useless and unprofitable for the life of men. For why did they preach Christ, in Whom, according to Eunomius, there does not reside the power of eternal life? Why do they make mention of those who had believed in Christ, unless it was through Him that they were to be partakers of eternal life? \"For the intelligence,\" he says, \"of those who have believed in the Lord, overleaping all sensible and intellectual existence, cannot stop even at the generation of the Son, but speeds beyond even this in its yearning for eternal life, eager to meet the First.\" What ought I most to bewail in this passage? that the wretched men do not think that eternal life is in the Son, or that they conceive of the Person of the Only-begotten in so grovelling and earthly a fashion, that they fancy they can mount in their reasonings upon His beginning, and so look by the power of their own intellect beyond the life of the Son, and, leaving the generation of the Lord somewhere beneath them, can speed onward beyond this in their yearning for eternal life? For the meaning of what I have quoted is nothing else than this, that the human mind, scrutinizing the knowledge of real existence, and lifting itself above the sensible and intelligible creation, will leave God the Word, Who was in the beginning, below itself, just as it has left below it all other things, and itself comes to be in Him in Whom God the Word was not, treading, by mental activity, regions which lie beyond the life of the Son, there searching for eternal life, where the Only-begotten God is not. \"For in its yearning for eternal life,\" he says, \"it is borne in thought, beyond the Son\"-clearly as though it had not in the Son found that which it was seeking.If the eternal life is not in the Son, then assuredly He Who said, \"I am the life[fn-19-P1958_1173966:14-nf] ,\" will be convicted of falsehood, or else He is life, it is true. but not eternal life. But that which is not eternal is of course limited in duration. And such a kind of life is common to the irrational animals as well as to men. Where then is the majesty of the very life, if even the irrational creation share it? and how will the Word or Divine Reason[fn-19-P1959_1174344:15-nf] be the same as the Life, if this finds a home, in virtue of the life which is but temporary, in irrational creatures? For if, according to the great John, the Word is Life[fn-19-P1960_1174626:16-nf] , but that life is temporary and not eternal, as their heresy holds, and if, moreover, the temporary life has place in other creatures, what is the logical consequence? Why, either that irrational animals are rational, or that the Reason must be confessed to be irrational. Have we any further need of words to confute their accursed and malignant blasphemy? Do such statements even pretend to conceal their intention of denying the Lord? For if the Apostle plainly says that what is not eternal is temporary[fn-19-P1961_1175158:17-nf] , and if these people see eternal life in the essence of the Father alone, and if by alienating the Son from the Nature of the Father they also cut Him off from eternal life, what is this but a manifest denial and rejection of the faith in the Lord? while the Apostle clearly says that those who \"in this life only have hope in Christ are of all men most miserable[fn-19-P1962_1175571:18-nf] .\" If then the Lord is life, but not eternal life, assuredly the life is temporal, and but for a day, that which is operative only for the present time, or else[fn-19-P1963_1175756:19-nf] the Apostle bemoans those who have hope, as having missed the true life.","title":"Book X","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_21_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But that our statement may not be thought to be unfair to our opponents, I will set side by side with it the language of the impious persons, which runs as follows:-\"He Who is in the bosom of the Existent, and Who is in the beginning and is with God, not being, or at all events not being in a strict sense, even though Basil, neglecting this distinction and addition, uses the title of `Existent' interchangeably, contrary to the truth-\"What do you say? that He Who is in the Father is not, and that He Who is in the beginning, and Who is in the bosom of the Father, is not, for this very reason, that He is in the beginning and is in the Father, and is discerned in the bosom of the Existent, and hence does not in a strict sense exist, because He is in the Existent?

In the same prophet the inquirer would find clear proof that Christ is not merely one of the great men that have appeared in the world. For Jeremiah goes on to say: \"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord: for he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places of the wilderness, in a salt land not inhabited. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is: for he shall be as a tree beside the water, that spreadeth out its roots by the river: he shall not fear when heat cometh, but his leaf shall be green; he shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.\"[fn-15-P1536_833342:13-nf] On hearing this curse pronounced in the figurative language of prophecy on him that trusts in man, and the blessing in similar style on him that trusts in God, the inquirer might have doubts about our doctrine, in which we teach not only that Christ is God, so that our trust is not in man, but also that He is man because He took, our nature. So some err by denying Christ's humanity, while they allow His divinity. Others, again, assert His humanity, but deny His divinity, and so either become infidels or incur the guilt of trusting in man. The inquirer, then, might say that the prophet says only that Christ is God, without any reference to His human nature; whereas, in our apostolic doctrine, Christ is not only God in whom we may safely trust, but the Mediator between God and man-the man Jesus. The prophet explains this in the words in which he seems to check himself, and to supply the omission: \"His heart,\" he says \"is sorrowful throughout; and He is man, and who shall know Him?\"[fn-15-P1537_834359:14-nf] He is man, in order that in the form of a servant He might heal the hard in heart, and that they might acknowledge as God Him who became man for their sakes, that their trust might be not in man, but in God-man. He is man taking the form of a servant. And who shall know Him? For \"He was in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal to God.\"[fn-15-P1538_834734:15-nf] He is man, for \"the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\" And who shall know Him? For \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-15-P1539_834924:16-nf] And truly His heart was sorrowful throughout. For even as regards His own disciples His heart was sorrowful, when He said, \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet have ye not known me?\" \"Have I been so long time with you\" answers to the words \"He is man,\" and \"Have ye not known me?\" to \"Who shall know Him?\" And the person is none other but He who says, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\"[fn-15-P1540_835344:17-nf] So that our trust is not in man, to be under the curse of the prophet, but in God-man, that is, in the Son of God, the Saviour Jesus Christ, the Mediator between God and man.

Once let these be made clear, and there will be no ambiguity left about the passion. We will therefore first, to those who endeavour to contradict us, put this enquiry. Which of the names given to the only begotten Son of God are anterior to the incarnation, and which posterior, or rather, connected with the operation of the oeconomy? They will reply that the terms anterior are, \"God the Word,\" \"only begotten Son,\" \"Almighty,\" and \"Lord of all creation\"; and that the names \"Jesus Christ\" belong to the incarnation. For, after the incarnation, God the Word, the only begotten Son of God is called Jesus Christ; for \"Behold\" He says \"unto you is born this day Christ the Lord\"[fn-61-P6156_1547539:330-nf] and because others had been called christs, priests, kings, and prophets, lest any one should suppose Him to be like unto them, the angels conjoined the title Lord with that of Christ, in order to prove the supreme dignity of Him that was born. And, again, Gabriel says to the blessed Virgin, \"Behold thou shall conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son and shalt call His name Jesus\"[fn-61-P6157_1547947:331-nf] \"for He shall save His people from their sins.\"[fn-61-P6158_1548014:332-nf] Before the incarnation, however, He was never called either Christ or Jesus. For truly the divine Prophets, in their predictions of things to come, used the words, just as they prophesied about the birth, the cross, and the passion, when the events had not yet come to pass. Nevertheless, even after the incarnation He is called God the Word, Lord, Almighty, only begotten Son,Maker, and Creator. For He was not made man by mutation, but, remaining just what He was, assumed what we are, for \"Being in the form of God,\" to use the words of the divine Apostle \"He took the form of a servant.\"[fn-61-P6159_1548662:333-nf] On this account, therefore, even after the incarnation, He is called also by the titles which are anterior to the incarnation, since His nature is invariable and immutable. But when relating the passion the divine Scripture nowhere uses the term God, since that is the name of the absolute nature. No one on hearing the words \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\"[fn-61-P6160_1549088:334-nf] and similar expressions, would suppose that the flesh existed before the ages, or is of one substance with the God of the universe, or was Creator of the world. Every one knows that these terms are proper to the Godhead. Nor would any one on reading the genealogy of St. Matthew suppose that David and Abraham according to nature were forefathers of God, for it is the assumed nature which is derived from them.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"447","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"And after the immortality and incorruptibility of His body He called Himself Son of Man, naming Himself from the nature which was seen, inasmuch as the divine nature is indeed invisible to angels, as the Lord Himself had said \"No one hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-64-P6439_1654591:515-nf] And to the great Moses He said \"There shall no man see me and live.\"[fn-64-P6440_1654741:516-nf] ","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"470","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"In his fourth chapter he denies the distinction of the terms of evangelists and apostles, and refuses to allow, as the teaching of the orthodox Father's has allowed, the terms of divine dignity to be understood of the divine nature, while the terms of humility, spoken in human sense, are applied to the nature assumed; whence the rightminded can easily detect the kinship with impiety.

And how is it that he also fails to observe this, that he who looked on the incarnate Word, Who was both Light and Life and God, recognized, through the glory which he saw, the Father of glory, and says, \"We beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father[fn-21-P2122_1286157:30-nf] \"?","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_23_book_xii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But he has reached the irrefutable argument which we long ago detected lurking in the sequel of his statements[fn-21-P2124_1286290:31-nf] , but which is here proclaimed aloud without disguise.

But \"Light,\" he says, \"is not equal to Light,\" because the one he calls \"true,\" and the other \"unapproachable.\" Is then the true considered to be a diminution of the unapproachable?

They judge that which is ineffective for a benevolent purpose to be superior to that which is operative. But such a notion as this neither exists nor ever will be found amongst Christians,-a notion by which it is made out that every good that is in existent things has not its origin from the Father. But of goods that pertain to us men, the crowning blessing is held by all right-minded men to be the return to life; and it is secured by the dispensation carried out by the Lord in His human nature; not that the Father remained aloof, as heresy will have it, ineffective and inoperative during the time of this dispensation.

And the four and twenty elders, failing down before the throne, adored God.\"] The four and twenty elders arethe twenty-four books of the prophets and of the law, which give testimonies of the judgment. Moreover, also, they are the twenty-four fathers-twelve apostles and twelve patriarchs.And in that the living creatures are different in appearance, this is the reason: the living creature like to a lion designates Mark, in whom is heard the voice of the lion roaring in the desert. And in the figure of a man, Matthew strives to declareto us the genealogy of Mary, from whom Christ took flesh. Therefore, in enumerating from Abraham to David, and thence to Joseph, he spoke of Him as if of a man: therefore his announcement sets forth the image of a man. Luke, in narrating the priesthood of Zacharias as he offers a sacrifice for the people, and the angel that appears to him with respect of the priesthood, and the victim in the same description bore the likeness of a calf. John the evangelist, like to an eagle hastening on uplifted wings to greater heights, argues about the Word of God. Mark, therefore, as an evangelist thus beginning, \"The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet; \"[fn-46-P4629_1764220:24-nf] The voice of one crying in the wilderness,\"[fn-46-P4630_1764313:25-nf] -has the effigy of a lion. And Matthew, \"The hook of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: \"[fn-46-P4631_1764455:26-nf] this is the form of a man. But Luke said, \"There was a priest, by name Zachariah, of the course of Abia, and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron: \"[fn-46-P4632_1764623:27-nf] this is the likeness of a calf. But John, when he begins, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,\"[fn-46-P4633_1764779:28-nf] sets forth the likeness of a flying eagle. Moreover, not only do the evangelists express their four similitudes in their respective openings of the Gospels, but also the Word itself of God the Father Omnipotent, which is His Son our Lord Jesus Christ, bears the same likeness in the time of His advent. When He preaches to us, He is, as it were, a lion and a lion's whelp. And when for man's salvation He was made man to overcome death, and to set all men free, and that He offered Himself a victim to the Father on our behalf, He was called a calf. And that He overcame death and ascended into the heavens, extending His wings and protecting His people, He was named a flying eagle. Therefore these announcements, although they are four, yet are one, because it proceeded from one mouth. Even as the river in paradise, although it is one, was divided into four heads. Moreover, that for the announcement of the New Testament those bring creatures had eyes within and without, shows the spiritual providence which both looks into the secrets of the heart, and beholds the things which are coming after that are within and without.","title":"Commentary on the Apocalypse of the Blessed John","author":"Victorinus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":59,"source_paragraph":"180","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Now observe what follows, as he goes on to say: \"If, before sin, God created a source from which men should be born, but the devil a source from which parents were disturbed, then beyond a doubt holiness must be ascribed to those that are born, and guilt to those that produce.

He who wounds a limb does not, of course, create it, but he injures it.[fn-44-P4403_1671576:143-nf] Those wounds, indeed, which are inflicted on the body produce lameness in a limb, or difficulty of motion; but they do not affect the virtue whereby a man becomes righteous: that wound, however, which has the name of sin, wounds the very life, which was being righteously lived. This wound was at that fatal moment of the fall inflicted by the devil to a vastly wider and deeper extent than are the sins which are known amongst men. Whence it came to pass, that our nature having then and there been deteriorated by that great sin of the first man, not only was made a sinner, but also generates sinners; and yet the very weakness, under which the virtue of a holy life has drooped and died, is not really nature, but corruption; precisely as a bad state of health is not a bodily substance or nature, but disorder; very often, indeed, if not always, the ailing character of parents is in a certain way implanted, and reappears in the bodies of their children.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_28_book_ii_","source_chapter":62,"source_paragraph":"186","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"As I said, however, let him entertain what views he likes of this lust; let him proclaim it as he pleases, praise it as much as he chooses (and he pleases much, as several of his extracts show), that the Pelagians may gratify themselves, if not with its uses, at all events with its praises, as many of them as fail to enjoy the limitation of continence enjoined in wedlock.

Luke, on the other hand, details those generations not at the commencement of his Gospel, but at the point of Christ's baptism, and gives them not in the descending, but in the ascending order, ascribing to Him preferentially the character of a priest in the expiation of sins, as where the voice from heaven declared Him, and where John himself delivered his testimony in these terms: \"Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!\"[fn-14-P1401_562367:40-nf] Besides, in the process by which he traces the genealogy upwards, he passes Abraham and carries us back to God, to whom, purified and atoned for, we are reconciled. Of merit, too, He has sustained in Himself the origination of our adoption; for we are made the sons of God through adoption, by believing on the Son of God. Moreover, on our account the Son of God was pleased to be made the son of man by the generation which is proper to the flesh. And the evangelist has shown clearly enough that he did not name Joseph the son of Hell on the ground that he was begotten of him, but only on the ground that he was adopted by him. For he has spoken of Adam also as the son of God, who, strictly speaking, was made by God, but was also, as it may be said, constituted a son in paradise by the grace which afterwards he lost through his transgression.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"107","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"Now[fn-14-P1444_584843:74-nf] Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered, and she brought forth a son. And her neighbours and her relatives[fn-14-P1445_584983:75-nf] heard that the Lord magnified His mercy with her; and they congratulated her. And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called[fn-14-P1446_585170:76-nf] him Zacharias, after the name of his father. And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name. And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all. And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake and praised God. And fear came on all them that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What manner of child, thinkest thou, shall this be? For the hand of the Lord was with him. And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of lsrael; for He hath visited and redeemed His people, and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David; as He spake by the mouth of His holy prophets, which have been since the world began; (to give) salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us: to perform mercy with our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant, the oath which He sware to Abraham our father that He would give to us; in order that, being saved out of the hand of our enemies, we might serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him, all our days. And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways; to give knowledge of salvation unto His people, for the remission[fn-14-P1447_586896:77-nf] of their sins, through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us, to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts until the day of his showing unto Israel. And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.[fn-14-P1448_587369:78-nf] This first taxing[fn-14-P1449_587463:79-nf] was made when Syrinus[fn-14-P1450_587595:80-nf] was governor of Syria. And all went to be taxed,[fn-14-P1451_587748:81-nf] every one into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be taxed[fn-14-P1452_588017:82-nf] with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped Him in swaddling-clothes, and laid Him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. And there were in the same country shepherds watching and keeping the virgils of the night over their flock. And, lo, the angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you: Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of goodwill.[fn-14-P1453_589080:83-nf] And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they understood[fn-14-P1454_589493:84-nf] the saying which had been told them concerning this child. And all they that heard it, wondered also at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, His name was called Jesus, which was so named of the angel before He was conceived in the womb.[fn-14-P1455_590031:85-nf] And then it proceeds thus:[fn-14-P1456_590082:86-nf] Behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying. Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him. Now when Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor that shall rule my people Israel. Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently the time of the star which appeared unto them. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star which they had seen in the east went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they found[fn-14-P1457_591714:87-nf] the child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshipped Him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto Him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return unto Herod, they departed into their town country another way.[fn-14-P1458_592027:88-nf] Then, after this account of their return, the narrative goes on thus:[fn-14-P1459_592119:89-nf] When the days of her (His mother's) purification, according to the law of Moses, were accomplished, they brought Him to Jerusalem, to present Him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord), and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons. And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was in him.

Now at this point commences the account of the preaching of John, which is presented by all the four. For after the words which I have placed last in the order of his narrative thus far,-the words with which he introduces the testimony from the prophet, namely, He shall be called a Nazarene,-Matthew proceeds immediately to give us this recital: \"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,\"[fn-14-P1478_598487:104-nf] etc. And Mark, who has told us nothing of the nativity or infancy or youth of the Lord, has made his Gospel begin with the same event,-that is to say, with the preaching of John. For it is thus that he sets out: The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; as it is written in the prophet Isaiah,[fn-14-P1479_598821:105-nf] Behold, I send a messenger[fn-14-P1480_598947:106-nf] before Thy face, which shall prepare Thy way before Thee. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight. John was in the wilderness baptizing, and preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,[fn-14-P1481_599226:107-nf] etc. Luke, again, follows up the passage in which he says, \"And Jesus increased in wisdom and age,[fn-14-P1482_599345:108-nf] and in favour with God and man,\" by a section in which he speaks of the preaching of John in these terms: Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness,[fn-14-P1483_599834:109-nf] etc. The Apostle John, too, the most eminent of the four evangelists, after discoursing of the Word of God, who is also the Son, antecedent to all the ages of creaturely existence, inasmuch as all things were made by Him, has introduced in the immediate context his account of the preaching and testimony of John, and proceeds thus: There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.[fn-14-P1484_600242:110-nf] This will be enough at once to make it plain that the narratives concerning John the Baptist given by the four evangelists are not at variance with one another. And there will be no occasion for requiring or demanding that to be done in all detail in this instance which we have already done in the case of the genealogies of the Christ who was born of Mary, to the effect of proving how Matthew and Luke are in harmony with each other, of showing how we might construct one consistent narrative out of the two, and of demonstrating on behoof of those of less acute perception, that although one of these evangelists may mention what the other omits, or omit what the other mentions, he does not thereby make it in any sense difficult to accept the veracity of the account given by the other. For when a single example [of this method of harmonizing] has been set before us, whether in the way in which it has been presented by me, or in some other method in which it may more satisfactorily be exhibited, every man can understand that, in all other similar passages, what he has seen done here may be done again.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"123","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"25.

For it ought to create no difficulty against this latter view, that he does not say, \"For I am He that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah,\" but employs the phraseology, \"For this is He that was spoken of.\" For that, indeed, is a mode of speech[fn-15-P1521_617920:128-nf] which the evangelists Matthew and John are in the habit of using in reference to themselves.

Matthew then proceeds with his narrative, and says: Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance; and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. For now the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be hewn down and cast into the fire. I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that is to come after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire: whose fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor, and gather His wheat into the garner; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.[fn-15-P1530_621093:136-nf] This whole passage is also given by Luke, who ascribes almost the same words to John. And where there is any variation in the words, there is nevertheless no real departure from the sense.Thus, for example, Matthew tells us that John said, \"And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father,\" where Luke puts it thus: \"And begin not to say, We have Abraham to our father.\" Again, in the former we have the words, \"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance;\" whereas the latter brings in the questions put by the multitudes as to what they should do, and represents John to have replied to them with a statement of good works as the fruits of repentance,-all which is omitted by Matthew. So, when Luke tells us what reply the Baptist made to the people when they were musing in their hearts concerning Him, and thinking whether He were the Christ, he gives us simply the words, \"I indeed baptize you with water,\" and does not add the phrase, \"unto repentance.\" Further,in Matthew the Baptist says, \"But he that is to come after me is mightier than I;\" while in Luke he is exhibited as saying, \"But one mightier than I cometh.\" In like manner, according to Matthew, he says, \"whose shoes I am not worthy to bear;\" but according to the other, his words are, \"the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose.\" The latter sayings are recorded also by Mark, although he makes no mention of those other matters. For, after noticing his attire and his mode of living, he goes on thus: \"And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose: I have baptized you with water, but He shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.\" In the notice of the shoes, therefore, he differs from Luke in so far as he has added the words, \"to stoop down;\" and in the account of the baptism he differs from both these others in so far as he does not say, \"and in fire,\" but only, \"in the Holy Spirit.\" For as in Matthew, so also in Luke, the words are the same, and they are given in the same order, \"He shall baptize you in the Spirit and in fire,\"-with this single exception, that Luke has not added the adjective \"Holy,\"[fn-15-P1531_623321:137-nf] while Matthew has given it thus: \"in the Holy Spirit and in fire.\"[fn-15-P1532_623513:138-nf] The statements made by these three are attested by the evangelist John, when he says: \"John bears witness[fn-15-P1533_623672:139-nf] of Him, and cries, saying, This was He of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me; for He was before me.\"[fn-15-P1534_623816:140-nf] For thus he indicates that the thing was spoken by John at the time at which those other evangelists record him to have uttered the words.

For he does not say, \"After this, walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw two brethren,\" but, without any indication of the strict consecution of time, simply, \"And walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw two brethren,\"[fn-15-P1593_651996:176-nf] and so forth: consequently it is quite possible that he has recorded at this later period not something which took place actually at that later time, but only something which he had omitted to introduce before; so that the men may be understood in this way to have come along with Him to Capharnaum, to which place John states that He did come, He and His mother and His disciples:or should we rather suppose that these were a different body of disciples, as He [may already have] had a follower in Philip, whom He called in this particular manner, by saying to him, \"Follow me\"? For in what order all the twelve apostles were called is not apparent from the narratives of the evangelists. Indeed, not only is the succession of the various callings left unrecorded; but even the fact of the calling is not mentioned in the case of all of them, the only vocations specified being those of Philip, and Peter and Andrew, and the sons of Zebedee, and Matthew the publican, who was also called Levi.[fn-15-P1594_653012:177-nf] The first and only person, however, who received a separate name from Him was Peter.[fn-15-P1595_653181:178-nf] For He did not give the sons of Zebedee their names individually, but He called them both together the sons of thunder.[fn-15-P1596_653320:179-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":42,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":55,"source_paragraph":"248","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"109. I recollect having already stated that no one should suppose that Peter received that name for the first time on the occasion when He said to Him, \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church.\" For the time at which he did obtain this name was that referred to by John, when he mentions that he was addressed in these terms: \"Thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, Peter.\"[fn-19-P1991_823970:432-nf] Hence, too, we are as little to think that Peter got this designation on the occasion to which Mark alludes, when he recounts the twelve apostles individually by name, and tells us how James and John were called the sons of thunder, merely on the ground that in that passage he has recorded the fact that He surnamed him Peter.[fn-19-P1992_824317:433-nf] For that circumstance is noticed there simply because it was suggested to the writer's recollection at that particular point, and not because it took place in actual fact at that specific time.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_29_book_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"15. I still hold that there is a reference to Christ in the passage which you select for refutation, where God says to Moses, \"I will raise up unto them from among their brethren a prophet like unto thee.\"[fn-16-P1687_944664:17-nf] The string of showy antitheses with which you try to ornament your dull discourse does not at all affect my belief of this truth. You attempt to prove, by a comparison of Christ and Moses, that they are unlike, and that therefore the words. \"I will raise up a prophet like unto thee,\" cannot be understood of Christ. You specify a number of particulars in which you find a diversity: that the one is man, and the other God; that one is a sinner, the other sinless; that one is born of ordinary generation, the other, as we hold, of a virgin, and, as you hold, not even of a virgin; the one incurs God's anger, and is put to death on a mountain, the other suffers voluntarily, having throughout the approval of His Father. But surely things may be said to be like, although they are not like in every respect. Besides the resemblance between things of the same nature, as between two men, or between parents and children, or between men in general, or any species of animals, or in trees, between one olive and another, or one laurel and another, there is often a resemblance in things of a different nature, as between a wild and a tame olive, or between wheat and barley. These things are to some extent allied. But there is the greatest possible distance between the Son of God, by whom all things were made, and a beast or a stone. And yet in the Gospel we read, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\"[fn-16-P1688_946079:18-nf] and in the apostle, \"That rock was Christ.\"[fn-16-P1689_946140:19-nf] This could not be said except on the supposition of some resemblance. What wonder, then, if Christ condescended to become like Moses, when He was made like the lamb which God by Moses commanded His people to eat as a type of Christ, enjoining that its blood should be used as a means of protection, and that it should be called the Passover, which every one must admit to be fulfilled in Christ? The Scripture, I acknowledge, shows points of difference; and the Scripture also, as I call on you to acknowledge, shows points of resemblance. There are points of both kinds, and one can be proved as well as the other. Christ is unlike man, for He is God; and it is written of Him that He is \"over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-16-P1690_946881:20-nf] Christ is also like man, for He is man; and it is likewise written of Him, that He is the \"Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.\"[fn-16-P1691_947042:21-nf] Christ is unlike a sinner, for He is ever holy; and He is like a sinner, for \"God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh.\"[fn-16-P1692_947237:22-nf] Christ is unlike a man born in ordinary generation, for He was born of a virgin; and yet He is like, for He too was born of a woman, to whom it was said, \"That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-16-P1693_947488:23-nf] Christ is unlike a man, who dies on account of his own sin, for He died without sin, and of His own free-will; and again, He is like, for He too died a real death of the body.","title":"Book XVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_113_letter_lix_to_epictetus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"8. These things being thus demonstrated, it is superfluous to touch upon the other points, or to enter upon any discussion relating to them, since the body in which the Word was is not coessential with the Godhead, but was truly born of Mary, while the Word Himself was not, changed into bones and flesh, but came in the flesh. For what John said, `The Word was made flesh[fn-100-P10058_3600290:26-nf] ,' has this meaning, as we may see by a similar passage; for it is written in Paul:`Christ has become a curse for us[fn-100-P10059_3600424:27-nf] .' And just as He has not Himself become a curse, but is said to have done so because He took upon Him the curse on our behalf, so also He has become flesh not by being changed into flesh, but because He assumed on our behalf living flesh, and has become Man. For to say `the Word became flesh,' is equivalent to saying `the Word has become man;' according to what is said in Joel: `I will pour forth of My Spirit upon all flesh[fn-100-P10060_3600871:28-nf] ;' for the promise did not extend to the irrational animals, but is for men, on whose account the Lord is become Man. As then this is the sense of the above text, they all will reasonably condemn themselves who have thought that the flesh derived from Mary existed before her, and that the Word, prior to her, had a human soul, and existed in it always even before His coming. And they too will cease who have said that the Flesh was not accessible to death, but belonged to the immortal Nature. For if it did not die, how could Paul deliver to the Corinthians `that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures[fn-100-P10061_3601510:29-nf] ,' or how did He rise at all if He did not also die? Again, they will blush deeply who have even entertained the possibility of a Tetrad instead of a Triad resulting, if it were said that the Body was derived from Mary. For if (they argue) we say the Body is of one Essence with the Word, the Triad remains a Triad; for then the Word imports no foreign element into it; but if we admit that the Body derived from Mary is human, it follows, since the Body is foreign in Essence, and the Word is in it, that the addition of the Body causes a Tetrad instead of a Triad.","title":"Letter LIX.

Consequently, let us now take up the subject which we had postponed, and inquire what mystical meaning may underlie the report given by Matthew and Mark, namely, that on rising He made this statement, \"I will go before you into Galilee: there shall ye see me.\" For this announcement, if it was fulfilled at all, was certainly not fulfilled till a considerable interval had elapsed; whereas it is couched in terms which seem to lead us (although such a conclusion is not an absolute necessity) most naturally to expect that the appearance referred to would be either the only one or the first that would ensue. We observe, however, that the words in question are not given as the words of the evangelist himself, in the form of a narrative of a past occurrence, but as the words of the angel, who spoke according to the Lord's commission, and subsequently also as the words of the Lord Himself; that is to say, the words are used by the evangelist in his narrative, but they are presented by him as a direct statement of what was spoken by the angel and by the Lord. This, therefore, unquestionably compels us to accept them as uttered prophetically.[fn-27-P2724_1210862:350-nf] Now Galilee may be interpreted to mean either \"Transmigration\" or \"Revelation.\" Consequently, if we adopt the idea of \"Transmigration,\" what other sense occurs to us to put upon the sentence,\" He goeth before you into Galilee, there shall you see Him,\" but just this, that the grace of Christ was to be transferred from the people of Israel to the Gentiles? That in preaching the gospel to these Gentiles, the apostles would meet with no acceptance unless the Lord prepared a way for them in the hearts of men,-this may be what is to be understood by the sentence, \"He goeth before you into Galilee.\" And, again, that they would look with joy and wonder at the breaking down and removing of difficulties, and at the opening of a door for them in the Lord through the enlightenment of the believing,-this is what is to be understood by the words, \"there shall ye see Him;\" that is to say, there shall ye find His members, there shall ye recognise His living body in the person of those who shall receive you. Or, if we follow the second view which takes Galilee to signify \"Revelation,\" the idea may be, that He was now no more to be in the form of a servant, but in that form in which He is equal with the Father;[fn-27-P2725_1212260:351-nf] as He promised to those who loved Him when He said, according to the testimony of John, \"And I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\"[fn-27-P2726_1212427:352-nf] That is to say, He was afterwards to manifest Himself, not merely as they saw Him before, nor merely in the way in which, rising as He did with His wounds upon Him, He was to give Himself to be touched as well as seen by them, but in the character of that ineffable light, wherewith He enlightens every man that cometh into this world, and in virtue of which He shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehends Him not.[fn-27-P2727_1212869:353-nf] Thus has He gone before us to something from which He withdraws not, although He comes to us, and which does not involve His leaving us, although He has preceded us thither. That will be a revelation which may be spoken of as a true Galilee, when we shall be like Him; there shall we see Him as He is.[fn-27-P2728_1213191:354-nf] Then, also, will there be for us the more blessed transmigration, from this world into that eternity, if we embrace His precepts so as to be counted worthy of being set apart on His right hand. For there, those on the left hand shall go away into eternal burning, but the righteous into life eternal.[fn-27-P2729_1213514:355-nf] Hence they shall pass thither, and there, shall they see Him, as the wicked do not see Him. For the wicked shall be taken away, so that he shall not see the brightness of the Lord;[fn-27-P2730_1213720:356-nf] and the unrighteousness shall not see the light. For He says, \"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent;\"[fn-27-P2731_1213917:357-nf] even as He shall be known in that eternity to which He will bring His servants by the form of a servant, in order that in liberty they may contemplate the form of the Lord.

Faustus requires to be told that the law is fulfilled by living as it enjoins. \"Love is the fulfilling of the law,\"[fn-17-P1778_1004820:13-nf] as the apostle says. The Lord has vouchsafed both to manifest and to impart this love, by sending the Holy Spirit to His believing people.

Grace is the fulfillment of love, and truth is the accomplishment of the prophecies. And as both grace and truth are by Christ, it follows that He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it; not by supplying any defects in the law, but by obedience to what is written in the law. Christ's own words declare this.

Mark, on the other hand, has introduced the matter in the form of a recapitulation in this passage, when he says, \"And Simon He surnamed Peter.\" For, as it was his intention to enumerate the names of the twelve apostles here, and it was necessary for him thus to mention Peter, he decided briefly to intimate the fact that the said name was not borne by that disciple all along, but was given him by the Lord, not, however, at the time with which Mark was immediately dealing, but on the occasion in connection with which John has introduced the very words employed by the Lord. The other matters embraced within this paragraph, present nothing inconsistent with any of the other Gospels, and they have also been discussed previously.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_15_book_iv_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"11.

Again, how weighty are the things which this evangelist reports Jesus to have spoken, when He came back to the temple from Mount Olivet, and after the forgiveness which He extended to the adulteress, who had been brought before Him by His tempters, as one deserving to be stoned: on which occasion He wrote with His finger upon the ground, as if He would indicate that people of the character of these men would be written on earth, and not in heaven, as He also admonished His disciples to rejoice that their names were written in heaven![fn-28-P2837_1255716:62-nf] Or, it may be that He meant to convey the idea that it was by humbling Himself (which He expressed by bending down His head) that He wrought signs upon the earth; or, that the time was now come when His law should be written, not, as formerly, on the sterile stone, but on a soil which would yield fruit.

But some one will say to me that it is one thing to live after man, another thing to live after the flesh; because man forsooth is a rational creature, and there is in him a rational soul, whereby he differs from the beast: but the flesh is the lowest and earthly part of man, and thus to live after it is faulty: and for this reason, he who lives after man, assuredly lives not after the flesh, but rather after that part of man, whereby he is man, that is, after the spirit of the mind whereby he excels the beasts. But this discussion is perhaps of some force in the schools of philosophers: but we, in order to understand the Apostle of Christ, ought to observe in what manner the Christian books are used to speak; at any rate it is the belief of all of us, to whom to live is Christ, that Man was taken unto Himself by the Word of God, not surely without a rational soul, as certain heretics will have it; and yet we read, \"The Word was made flesh.\"[fn-36-P3617_1708524:33-nf] What is to be here understood by \"flesh,\" but Man? \"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\"[fn-36-P3618_1708640:34-nf] What can be understood, but all men? \"Unto Thee shall all flesh come.\"[fn-36-P3619_1708728:35-nf] What is it, but all men? \"Thou hast given unto Him power over all flesh.\"[fn-36-P3620_1708819:36-nf] What is it, but all men? \"Of the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.\"[fn-36-P3621_1708918:37-nf] What is it, but no man shall be justified? And this the same Apostle in another place confessing more plainly saith, \"Man shall not be justified of the works of the Law.\"[fn-36-P3622_1709108:38-nf] The Corinthians also he rebukes, saying, \"Are ye not carnal, and walk after man?\"[fn-36-P3623_1709208:39-nf] After he had called them carnal, he saith not, ye walk after the flesh, but after man, forasmuch as by this also what would he have understood, but after the flesh? For surely if to walk, that is, to live, after the flesh deserved blame, but after man deserved praise, he would not say by way of rebuke, \"ye walk after man.\" Let man recognize the reproach; let him change his purpose, let him shun destruction. Hear thou man: walk not thou after man, but after Him Who made man. Fall not thou away from Him Who made thee, even unto thyself. For a man said, who yet lived not after man, \"Not that we are sufficient to think any thing from ourselves, as though of ourselves: but our sufficiency is of God.\"[fn-36-P3624_1709933:40-nf] Consider if he lived after man, who spake these things with truth. Therefore the Apostle, admonishing man not to live after man, restores man to God. But whoso liveth not after man, but after God, assuredly liveth not even after himself, because himself also is a man. But he is therefore said also to live after the flesh, when he so lives; because also when the flesh alone hath been named, man is understood, as we have already shown: just as when the soul alone hath been named, man is understood: whence it is said, \"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers,\"[fn-36-P3625_1710526:41-nf] that is, every man; and, \"Seventy-five souls went down into Egypt with Jacob,\"[fn-36-P3626_1710624:42-nf] that is, seventy-five men.

All that is wanted is, that they should support their opinion of the propagation of souls on passages which are unambiguous; just as other passages of Scripture show us that Christ possesses a human soul. On precisely the same principle we advise the other side also, who do away with the opinion of the propagation of souls, that they should produce certain proofs for their assertion that souls are created by God in every fresh case by insufflation, and that they should then maintain the position that the saying, \"This is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh,\" was not spoken figuratively as a part for the whole, including the soul in its signification, but in a bare literal sense of the flesh alone.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_32_book_i","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"12.

The old man of Ithaca, according to the legend of the Greeks, when he wished to hear the song of the Sirens, on account of the charm of their voluptuous voice, sailed to Sicily in bonds, and stopped up the ears of his companions; not that he grudged them the hearing, or desired to load himself with bonds, but because the consequence of those singers' music to those who heard it was death. For such, in the opinion of the Greeks, are the charms of the Sirens. Now I am not within hearing of any such song as this; nor have I any desire to hear the Sirens who chant men's dirges, and whose silence is more profitable to men than their voice; but I pray to enjoy the pleasure of a divine voice, which, though it be often beard, I long to hear again; not that I am overcome with the charm of a voluptuous voice, bat I am being taught divine mysteries, and expect as the result, not death but eternal salvation. For the singers are not the deadly Sirens of the Greeks, but a divine choir of prophets, with whom there is no need to stop the ears of one's companions, nor to load one's-self with bonds, in fear of the penalty of hearing. For, in the one case, the hearer, with the entrance of the voice, ceases to live; in the other, the more he hears, the better life will he enjoy, being led onwards by a divine Spirit. Let every one come, then, and hear the divine song without any fear. There are not with us the Sirens from the shore of Sicily, nor the bonds of Ulysses, nor the wax poured melting into men's ears; but a loosening of all bonds, and liberty to listen to every one that approaches. For it is worthy of us to hear such a song as this; and to hear such singers as these, seems to me to be a thing to be prayed for. But if one wishes to hear the choir of the apostles as well, he will find the same harmony of song. For the others sang beforehand the divine plan in a mystical manner; but these sing an interpretation of what has been mystically announced by the former. Oh, concordant harmony, composed by the Divine Spirit! Oh, the comeliness of those who sing of the mysteries of God? Oh. that I also may join in these songs in my prayer.

This shall now be proved even by the apostle, when he says: \"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; which is come unto you, as it is unto all the world.\"[fn-80-P8067_2292629:866-nf] For if, even at that time, the tradition of the gospel had spread everywhere, how much more now! Now, if it is our gospel which has spread everywhere, rather than any heretical gospel, much less Marcion's, which only dates from the reign of Antoninus,[fn-80-P8068_2292902:867-nf] then ours will be the gospel of the apostles. But should Marcion's gospel succeed in filling the whole world, it would not even in that case be entitled to the character of apostolic. For this quality, it will be evident, can only belong to that gospel which was the first to fill the world; in other words, to the gospel of that God who of old declared this of its promulgation: \"Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"[fn-80-P8069_2293434:868-nf] He calls Christ \"the image of the invisible God.\"[fn-80-P8070_2293503:869-nf] We in like manner say that the Father of Christ is invisible, for we know that it was the Son who was seen in ancient times (whenever any appearance was vouchsafed to men in the name of God) as the image of (the Father) Himself. He must not be regarded, however, as making any difference between a visible and an invisible God; because long before he wrote this we find a description of our God to this effect: \"No man can see the Lord, and live.\"[fn-80-P8071_2293970:870-nf] If Christ is not \"the first-begotten before every creature,\"[fn-80-P8072_2294054:871-nf] as that \"Word of God by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made; \"[fn-80-P8073_2294295:872-nf] if \"all things were\" not \"in Him created, whether in heaven or on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities, or powers; \"if \"all things were\" not \"created by Him and for Him\" (for these truths Marcion ought not to allow concerning Him), then the apostle could not have so positively laid it down, that \"He is before all.\"[fn-80-P8074_2294679:873-nf] For how is He before all, if He is not before all things?[fn-80-P8075_2294756:874-nf] How, again, is He before all things, if He is not \"the first-born of every creature\"-if He is not the Word of the Creator?[fn-80-P8076_2294898:875-nf] Now how will he be proved to have been before all things, who appeared after all things? Who can tell whether he had a prior existence, when he has found no proof that he had any existence at all? In what way also could it have \"pleased (the Father) that in Him should all fulness dwell? \"[fn-80-P8077_2295227:876-nf] For, to begin with, what fulness is that which is not comprised of the constituents which Marcion has removed from it,-even those that were \"created in Christ, whether in heaven or on earth,\" whether angels or men? which is not made of the things that are visible and invisible? which consists not of thrones and dominions and principalities and powers? If, on the other hand,[fn-80-P8078_2295623:877-nf] our false apostles and Judaizing gospellers[fn-80-P8079_2295682:878-nf] have introduced all these things out of their own stores, and Martian has applied them to constitute the fulness of his own god, (this hypothesis, absurd though it be, alone would justify him; ) for how, on any other supposition,[fn-80-P8080_2295937:879-nf] could the rival and the destroyer of the Creator have been willing that His fulness should dwell in his Christ? To whom, again, does He \"reconcile all things by Himself, making peace by the blood of His cross,\"[fn-80-P8081_2296170:880-nf] but to Him whom those very things had altogether[fn-80-P8082_2296238:881-nf] offended, against whom they had rebelled by transgression, (but) to whom they had at last returned?[fn-80-P8083_2296397:882-nf] Conciliated they might have been to a strange god; but reconciled they could not possibly have been to any other than their own God. Accordingly, ourselves \"who were sometime alienated and enemies in our mind by wicked works\"[fn-80-P8084_2296655:883-nf] does He reconcile to the Creator, against whom we had committed offence-worshipping the creature to the prejudice of the Creator. As, however, he says elsewhere,[fn-80-P8085_2296836:884-nf] that the Church is the body of Christ, so here also (the apostle) declares that he \"fills up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in his flesh for His body's sake, which is the Church.\"[fn-80-P8086_2297054:885-nf] But you must not on this account suppose that on every mention of His body the term is only a metaphor, instead of meaning real flesh. For he says above that we are \"reconciled in His body through death; \"[fn-80-P8087_2297279:886-nf] meaning, of course, that He died in that body wherein death was possible through the flesh: (therefore he adds, ) not through the Church[fn-80-P8088_2297435:887-nf] (per ecclesiam), but expressly for the sake of the Church (proper ecclesiam), exchanging body for body-one of flesh for a spiritual one. When, again, he warns them to \"beware of subtle words and philosophy,\" as being \"a vain deceit,\" such as is \"after the rudiments of the world\" (not understanding thereby the mundane fabric of sky and earth, but worldly learning, and \"the tradition of men,\" subtle in their speech and their philosophy),[fn-80-P8089_2297958:888-nf] it would be tedious, and the proper subject of a separate work, to show how in this sentence (of the apostle's) all heresies are condemned, on the ground of their consisting of the resources of subtle speech and the rules of philosophy. But (once for all) let Marcion know that the principle term of his creed comes from the school of Epicurus, implying that the Lord is stupid and indifferent;[fn-80-P8090_2298372:889-nf] wherefore he refuses to say that He is an object to be feared. Moreover, from the porch of the Stoics he brings out matter, and places it on a par with the Divine Creator.[fn-80-P8091_2299157:890-nf] He also denies the resurrection of the flesh,-a truth which none of the schools of philosophy agreed together to hold.[fn-80-P8092_2299442:891-nf] But how remote is our (Catholic) verity from the artifices of this heretic, when it dreads to arouse the anger of God, and firmly believes that He produced all things out of nothing, and promises to us a restoration from the grave of the same flesh (that died) and holds without a blush that Christ was born of the virgin's womb! At this, philosophers, and heretics, and the very heathen, laugh and jeer. For \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise\"[fn-80-P8093_2300031:892-nf] -that God, no doubt, who in reference to this very dispensation of His threatened long before that He would \"destroy the wisdom of the wise.\"[fn-80-P8094_2300194:893-nf] Thanks to this simplicity of truth, so opposed to the subtlety and vain deceit of philosophy, we cannot possibly have any relish for such perverse opinions. Then, if God \"quickens us together with Christ, forgiving us our trespasses,\"[fn-80-P8095_2300510:894-nf] we cannot suppose that sins are forgiven by Him against whom, as having been all along unknown, they could not have been committed. Now tell me, Marcion, what is your opinion of the apostle's language, when he says, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath, which is a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ? \"[fn-80-P8096_2300924:895-nf] We do not now treat of the law, further than (to remark) that the apostle here teaches clearly how it has been abolished, even by passing from shadow to substance-that is, from figurative types to the reality, which is Christ. The shadow, therefore, is His to whom belongs the body also; in other words, the law is His, and so is Christ. If you separate the law and Christ, assigning one to one god and the other to another, it is the same as if you were to attempt to separate the shadow from the body of which it is the shadow. Manifestly Christ has relation to the law, if the body has to its shadow. But when he blames those who alleged visions of angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats-\"you must not touch, you must not taste\"-in a voluntary humility, (at the same time) \"vainly puffed up in the fleshly mind, and not holding the Head,\"[fn-80-P8097_2301822:896-nf] (the apostle) does not in these terms attack the law or Moses, as if it was at the suggestion of superstitious angels that he had enacted his prohibition of sundry aliments. For Moses had evidently received the law from God. When, therefore, he speaks of their \"following the commandments and doctrines of men,\"[fn-80-P8098_2302162:897-nf] he refers to the conduct of those persons who \"held not the Head,\" even Him in whom all things are gathered together;[fn-80-P8099_2302300:898-nf] for they are all recalled to Christ, and concentrated in Him as their initiating principle[fn-81-P8100_2302423:899-nf] -even the meats and drinks which were indifferent in their nature. All the rest of his precepts,[fn-81-P8101_2302536:900-nf] as we have shown sufficiently, when treating of them as they occurred in another epistle,[fn-81-P8102_2302664:901-nf] emanated from the Creator, who, while predicting that \"old things were to pass away,\" and that He would \"make all things new,\"[fn-81-P8103_2302902:902-nf] commanded men \"to break up fresh ground for themselves,\"[fn-81-P8104_2303013:903-nf] and thereby taught them even then to put off the old man and put on the new.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"7. Augustin replied: If you allow, in consideration of the authority of the Gospel, that Christ said that He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them, you should show the same consideration to the authority of the apostle, when he says, \"All these things were our examples;\" and again of Christ, \"He was not yea and nay, but in Him was yea; for all the promises of God are in Him yea;\"[fn-18-P1826_1029214:9-nf] that is, they are set forth and fulfilled in Him. In this way you will see in the clearest light both what law Christ fulfilled, and how He fulfilled it. It is a vain attempt that you make to escape by your three kinds of law and your three kinds of prophets. It is quite plain, and the New Testament leaves no doubt on the matter, what law and what prophets Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill. The law given by Moses is that which by Jesus Christ became grace and truth.[fn-18-P1827_1029716:10-nf] The law given by Moses is that of which Christ says, \"He wrote of me.\"[fn-18-P1828_1029804:11-nf] For undoubtedly this is the law which entered that the offence might abound;[fn-18-P1829_1029898:12-nf] words which you often ignorantly quote as a reproach to the law. Read what is there said of this law: \"The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good.\"[fn-18-P1830_1030220:13-nf] The entrance of the law made the offense abound, not because the law required what was wrong, but because the proud and self-confident incurred additional guilt as transgressors after their acquaintance with the holy, and just, and good commandments of the law; so that, being thus humbled, they might learn that only by grace through faith could they be freed from subjection to the law as transgressors, and be reconciled to the law as righteous. So the same apostle says: \"For before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which was afterwards revealed. Therefore the law was our schoolmaster in Christ Jesus; but after faith came, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.\"[fn-18-P1831_1030943:14-nf] That is, we are no longer subject to the penalty of the law, because we are set free by grace. Before we received in humility the grace of the Spirit, the letter was only death to us, for it required obedience which we could not render. Thus Paul also says: \"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.\"[fn-18-P1832_1031274:15-nf] Again, he says: \"For if a law had been given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law; but the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\"[fn-18-P1833_1031546:16-nf] And once more: \"What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\"[fn-18-P1834_1031861:17-nf] Here we see Christ coming not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. As the law brought the proud under the guilt of transgression, increasing their sin by commandments which they could not obey, so the righteousness of the same law is fulfilled by the grace of the Spirit in those who learn from Christ to be meek and lowly in heart; for Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. Moreover, because even for those who are under grace it is difficult in this mortal life perfectly to keep what is written in the law, Thou shall not covet, Christ, by the sacrifice of His flesh, as our Priest obtains pardon for us. And in this also He fulfills the law; for what we fail in through weakness is supplied by His perfection, who is the Head, while we are His members. Thus John says: \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not; and if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: He is the propitiation for our sins.\"[fn-18-P1835_1032867:18-nf] ","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"8. Christ also fulfilled the prophecies, because the promises of God were made good in Him. As the apostle says in the verse quoted above, \"The promises of God are in Him yea.\" Again, he says: \"Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.\"[fn-18-P1837_1033216:19-nf] Whatever, then, was promised in the prophets, whether expressly or in figure, whether by words or by actions, was fulfilled in Him who came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them. You do not perceive that if Christians were to continue in the use of acts and observances by which things to come were prefigured, the only meaning would be that the things prefigured had not yet come. Either the thing prefigured has not come, or if it has, the figure becomes superfluous or misleading. Therefore, if Christians do not practise some things enjoined in the Hebrews by the prophets, this, so far from showing, as you think, that Christ did not fulfill the prophets, rather shows that He did. So completely did Christ fulfill what these types prefigured, that it is no longer prefigured. So the Lord Himself says: \"The law and the prophets were until John.\"[fn-18-P1838_1034108:20-nf] For the law which shut up transgressors in increased guilt, and to the faith which was afterwards revealed, became grace through Jesus Christ, by whom grace superabounded. Thus the law, which was not fulfilled in the requirement of the letter, was fulfilled in the liberty of grace. In the same way, everything in the law that was prophetic of the Saviour's advent, whether in words or in typical actions, became truth in Jesus Christ. For \"the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.\"[fn-18-P1839_1034639:21-nf] At Christ's advent the kingdom of God began to be preached; for the law and the prophets were until John: the law, that its transgressors might desire salvation; the prophets, that they might foretell the Saviour. No doubt there have been prophets in the Church since the ascension of Christ. Of these prophets Paul says: \"God hath set some in the Church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers,\" and so on.[fn-18-P1840_1035080:22-nf] It is not of these prophets that it was said, \"The law and the prophets were until John,\" but of those who prophesied the first coming of Christ, which evidently cannot be prophesied now that it has taken place.","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"16","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"14.

Do not Christians observe the precept of Scripture \"Hear, O Israel; the Lord thy God is one God;\" \"Thou shalt not image,\" and so on? Do make Christians not observe the precept, \"Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain?\" Do Christians not observe the Sabbath, even in the sense of a true rest? Do Christians not honor their parents, according to the commandment? Do Christians not abstain from fornication, and murder. and theft, and false witness, from coveting their neighbor's wife, and from coveting his property,-all of which things are written in the law? These moral precepts are distinct from typical sacraments: the former are fulfilled by the aid of divine grace, the latter by the accomplishment of what they promise. Both are fulfilled in Christ, who has ever been the bestower of this grace, which is also now revealed in Him, and who now makes manifest the accomplishment of what He in former times promised; for \"the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.\"[fn-18-P1866_1054316:38-nf] Again, these things which concern the keeping of a good conscience are fulfilled in the faith which worketh by love;[fn-18-P1867_1054450:39-nf] while types of the future pass away when they are accomplished. But even the types are not destroyed, but fulfilled; for Christ, in bringing to light what the types signified, does not prove them vain or illusory.19. Faustus, therefore, is wrong in supposing that the Lord Jesus fulfilled some precepts of righteous men who lived before the law of Moses, such as, \"Thou shall not kill,\" which Christ did not oppose, but rather confirmed by His prohibition of anger and abuse; and that He destroyed some things apparently peculiar to the Hebrew law, such as, \"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,\" which Christ. seems rather to abolish than to confirm, when He says, \"But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil; but if any one smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also,\"[fn-18-P1868_1055260:40-nf] and so on.

So likewise, if it had been said, \"soul of my soul,\" the flesh would not be denied, of course, which evidently had been taken out of the man. Constantly does Holy Scripture indicate the whole by a part, and a part by the whole. For certainly, if in the passage which this man has quoted as his proof it had been said that the human race had been made, not \"of one blood,\" but \"of one man,\" it could not have prejudiced the opinion of those who deny the propagation of souls, although man is not soul alone, nor only flesh, but both. For they would have their answer ready to this effect, that the Scripture here might have meant to indicate a part by the whole, that is to say, the flesh only by the entire human being. In like manner, they who maintain the propagation of souls contend that in the passage where it is said, \"of one blood,\" the human being is implied by the term \"blood,\" on the principle of the whole being expressed by a part. For just as the one party seems to be assisted by the expression, \"of one blood,\" instead of the phrase, \"of one man,\" so the other side evidently gets countenance from the statement being so plainly written, \"By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for in him all sinned,\"[fn-47-P4708_1821635:34-nf] instead of its being said, \"in whom the flesh of all sinned.\" Similarly, as one party seems to receive assistance from the fact that Scripture says, \"This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,\" on the ground that a part covers the whole; so, again, the other side derives some advantage from what is written in the immediate sequel of the passage, \"She shall be called woman, because she was taken out of her husband.\" For,according to their contention, the latter clauseshould have run, \"Because her flesh was takenout of her husband,\" if it was not true that the entire woman, soul and all, but only her flesh, was taken out of man. The fact, however, of the whole matter is simply this, that after hearing both sides, anybody whose judgment is free from party prejudice sees at once that loose quotation is unavailing in this controversy; for against one party, which maintains the opinion of the propagation of souls, those passages must not be adduced which mention only a part, inasmuch as the Scripture might mean by the part to imply the whole in all such passages; as, for instance, when we read, \"The Word was made flesh,\"[fn-47-P4709_1822795:35-nf] we of course understand not the flesh only, but the entire human being; nor against the other party, who deny this doctrine of the soul's propagation, is it of any avail to quote those passages which do not mention a part of the human being, but the whole; because in these the Scripture might possibly mean to imply a part by the whole; as we confess that Christ was buried, whereas it was only His flesh that was laid in the sepulchre. We therefore say, that on such grounds there is no ground on the one hand for rashly constructing, nor on the other hand for, with equal rashness, demolishing the theory of propagation; but we add this advice, that other passages be duly looked out, such as admit of no ambiguity.[fn-47-P4710_1823531:36-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Isaiah: \"Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken; I have begotten and brought up children, but they have rejected me.

He says that Origen holds these opinions which he refutes. And there may be a doubt concerning Lazarus and the rich man. The simpler persons think that these things were spoken as though both were receiving their due for the things which they had done in life in their bodies; but the more accurate think that, since no one is left in life after the resurrection, these things do not happen at the resurrection. For the rich man says: \"I have five brethren; ... lest they also come into this place of torment, \"[fn-59-P5929_1807173:114-nf] send Lazarus, that he may tell them of those things which are here. And, therefore, if we ask respecting the \"tongue,\" and the \"finger,\" and \"Abraham's bosom,\" and the reclining there, it may perhaps be that the soul receives in the change a form similar in appearance to its gross and earthly body. If, then, any one of those who have fallen asleep is recorded as having appeared, in the same way he has been seen in the form which he had when he was in the flesh. Besides, when Samuel appeared, it is clear that, being seen, he was clothed in a body;[fn-59-P5930_1807747:115-nf] and this must especially be admitted, if we are pressed by arguments which prove that the essence of the soul is incorporeal, and is manifested by itself.[fn-59-P5931_1807972:116-nf] But the rich man in torment, and the poor man who was comforted in the bosom of Abraham, are said, the one to be punished in Hades, and the other to be comforted in Abraham's bosom, before the appearing of the Saviour, and before the end of the world, and therefore before the resurrection; teaching that now already, at the change, the soul rises a body. Wherefore, the saint says as follows: Setting forth that the soul, after its removal hence, has a form similar in appearance to this sensitive body; does Origen represent the soul, after Plato, as being incorporeal? And how should that which, after removal from the world, is said to have need of a vehicle and a clothing, so that it might not be found naked, be in itself other than incorporeal? But if it be incorporeal, must it not also be incapable of passion? For it follows, from its being incorporeal, that it is also impassible and imperturbable. If, then, it was not distracted by any irrational desire, neither was it changed by a pained or suffering body. For neither can that which is incorporeal sympathize with a body, nor a body with that which is incorporeal, if,[fn-59-P5932_1809174:117-nf] indeed, the soul should seem to be incorporeal, in accordance with what has been said. But if it sympathize with the body, as is proved by the testimony of those who appear, it cannot be incorporeal. Therefore God alone is celebrated, as the unbegotten, independent, and unwearied nature; being incorporeal, and therefore invisible; for \"no man hath seen God.\"[fn-59-P5933_1809558:118-nf] But souls, being rational bodies, are arranged by the Maker and Father of all things into members which are visible to reason, having received this impression. Whence, also, in Hades, as in the case of Lazarus and the rich man, they are spoken of as having a tongue, and a finger, and the other members; not as though they had with them another invisible body, but that the souls themselves, naturally, when entirely stripped of their covering, are such according to their essence.","title":"From the Discourse on the Resurrection.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_12_tractate_vii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"1.

But I imagine, beloved brethren, that you remember that this Gospel is read in order in suitable portions; and I think that it has not escaped you what has lately been treated of, specially the recent matters concerning John and the dove. Concerning John, namely, what new thing he learned concerning the Lord by means of the dove, although he had already known the Lord. And this was discovered by the inspiration of the Spirit of God, that John indeed already knew the Lord, but that the Lord Himself was to baptize, that the power of baptizing He would not transfer from Himself to any one, this he learned by means of the dove, because it was said to him, \"On whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending as a dove, and abiding upon Him, this is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-5-P505_210647:4-nf] What is \"This is He\"? Not another, although by means of another. But why by means of a dove? Many things were said, and I am not able, nor is there need that I should go over all;-principally, however, to denote peace, because also the trees which were baptized outside, because the dove found in them fruit, it brought to the ark, as you remember the dove sent out by Noah from the ark, which floated on the flood and was washed by baptism, was not submerged. When, then, it was sent forth, it brought an olive branch; but it had not leaves alone, it had also fruit.[fn-5-P506_211230:5-nf] This, then, we ought to wish for our brethren who are baptized outside, that they may have fruit; the dove will not permit them to remain outside, but bring them back to the ark. For the whole of fruit is charity, without which a man is nothing, whatever else he have. And this, which is most fully said by the apostle, we have mentioned and recounted. For he says, \"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal; and though I should have all knowledge, and know all mysteries, and have all prophecy, and should have all faith\" (but in what sense did he say all faith?), \"so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I should distribute all my goods to the poor, and though I should give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-5-P507_212125:6-nf] But in no manner are they able to say that they have charity who divide unity.

For example, if our faith that God will not bring any charges against His elect, and that Christ will not condemn His elect, did not stand in the way, this passage, \"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?\" might be pronounced in such a way as to make what follows an answer to this question, \"God who justifieth,\" and to make a second question, \"Who is he that condemneth?\" with the answer, \"Christ Jesus who died.\"[fn-50-P5067_2722147:11-nf] But as it would be the height of madness to believe this, the passage will be pronounced in such a way as to make the first part a question of inquiry,[fn-50-P5068_2722323:12-nf] and the second a rhetorical interrogative.[fn-50-P5069_2722385:13-nf] Now the ancients said that the difference between an inquiry and an interrogative was this, that an inquiry admits of many answers, but loan interrogative the answer must be either \"No\" or \"Yes.\"[fn-50-P5070_2722600:14-nf] The passage will be pronounced, then, in such a way that after the inquiry, \"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?\" what follows will be put as an interrogative: \"Shall God who justifieth?\"-the answer\" No\" being understood. And in the same way we shall have the inquiry, \"Who is he that condemneth?\" and the answer here again in the form of an interrogative, \"Is it Christ who died? yea, rather, who is risen again? who is even at the right hand of God? who also maketh intercession forus?\"-the answer \"No\" being understood to every one of these questions. On the other hand, in that passage where the apostle says, \"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness;\"[fn-50-P5071_2723490:15-nf] unless after the inquiry, \"What shall we say then?\" what follows were given as the answer to this question: \"That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness;\" it would not be in harmony with the succeeding context.

For if that, which from its being inherent in the Lord[fn-83-P8395_2370920:176-nf] was of Him and in Him, was yet not without a beginning,-I mean[fn-83-P8396_2371005:177-nf] His wisdom, which was then born and created, when in the thought of God It began to assume motion[fn-83-P8397_2371120:178-nf] for the arrangement of His creative works,-how much more impossible[fn-83-P8398_2371211:179-nf] is it that anything should have been without a beginning which was extrinsic to the Lord![fn-83-P8399_2371331:180-nf] But if this same Wisdom is the Word of God, in the capacity[fn-84-P8400_2371413:181-nf] of Wisdom, and (as being He) without whom nothing was made, just as also (nothing) was set in order without Wisdom, how can it be that anything, except the Father, should be older, and on this account indeed nobler, than the Son of God, the only-begotten and first-begotten Word? Not to say that[fn-84-P8401_2371723:182-nf] what is unbegotten is stronger than that which is born, and what is not made more powerful than that which is made. Because that which did not require a Maker to give it existence, will be much more elevated in rank than that which had an author to bring it into being.

They are incapable of being found out or investigated, except by God alone. Otherwise, if they were traceable or discoverable in Matter, they would be capable of investigation. Therefore, in as far as it has become evident that Matter had no prior existence (even from this circumstance, that it is impossible[fn-87-P8780_2447849:481-nf] for it to have had such an existence as is assigned to it), in so far is it proved that all things were made by God out of nothing. It must be admitted, however,[fn-87-P8781_2448032:482-nf] that Hermogenes, by describing for Matter a condition like his own-irregular, confused, turbulent, of a doubtful and precipate and fervid impulse-has displayed a specimen of his own art, and painted his own portrait.

Now it is clear that that is called new which is not from everlasting, and on the contrary, that is called everlasting which is not new. He, then, who does not believe that the Only-begotten God is from everlasting of the Father does not deny that He is new, for that which is not everlasting is confessedly new; and that which is new is not God, according to the saying of Scripture, \"there shall not be in thee any new God[fn-26-P2612_1787017:2-nf] .\" Therefore he who says that the Son \"once was not[fn-26-P2613_1787105:3-nf] ,\" denies His Godhead. Again, He Who says \"thou shalt never worship a strange God[fn-26-P2614_1787302:4-nf] \" forbids us to worship another God; and the strange God is so called in contradistinction to our own God. Who, then, is our own God? Clearly, the true God. And who is the strange God? Surely, he who is alien from the nature of the true God. If, therefore, our own God is the true God, and if, as the heretics say, the Only-begotten God is not of the nature of the true God, He is a strange God, and not our God. But the Gospel says, the sheep \"will not follow a stranger[fn-26-P2615_1787792:5-nf] .\" He that says He is created will make Him alien from the nature of the true God. What then will they do, who say that He is created? Do they worship that same created being as God[fn-26-P2616_1787991:6-nf] , or do they not? For if they do not worship Him, they follow the Jews in denying the worship of Christ: and if they do worship Him, they are idolaters, for they worship one alien from the true God. But surely it is equally impious not to worship the Son, and to worship the strange God. We must then say that the Son is the true Son of the true Father, that we may both worship Him, and avoid condemnation as worshipping a strange God. But to those who quote from the Proverbs the passage, \"the Lord created me[fn-26-P2617_1788562:7-nf] ,\" and think that they hereby produce a strong argument that the Creator and Maker of all things was created, we must answer that the Only-begotten God was made for us many things. For He was the Word, and was made flesh; and He was God, and was made man; and He was without body, and was made a body; and besides, He was made \"sin,\" and \"a curse,\" and \"a stone,\" and \"an axe,\" and \"bread,\" and \"a lamb,\" and \"a way,\" and \"a door,\" and \"a rock,\" and many such things; not being by nature any of these, but being made these things for our sakes, by way of dispensation. As, therefore, being the Word, He was for our sakes made flesh, and as, being God, He was made man, so also, being the Creator, He was made for our sakes a creature; for the flesh is created. As, then, He said by the prophet, \"Thus saith the Lord, He that formed me from the womb to be His servant[fn-26-P2618_1789448:8-nf] ;\" so He said also by Solomon, \"The Lord created me as the beginning of His ways, for His works[fn-26-P2619_1789559:9-nf] .\" For all creation, as the Apostle says, is in servitude[fn-26-P2620_1789637:10-nf] . Therefore both He Who was formed in the Virgin's womb, according to the word of the prophet, is the servant, and not the Lord (that is to say, the man according to the flesh, in whom God was manifested), and also, in the other passage, He Who was created as the beginning of His ways is not God, but the man in whom God was manifested to us for the renewing again of the ruined way of man's salvation. So that, since we recognize two things in Christ, one Divine, the other human (the Divine by nature, but the human in the Incarnation), we accordingly claim for the Godhead that which is eternal, and that which is created we ascribe to His human nature. For as, according to the prophet, He was formed in the womb as a servant, so also, according to Solomon, He was manifested in the flesh by means of this servile creation. But when they say, \"if He was, He was not begotten, and if He was begotten He was not,\" let them learn that it is not fitting to ascribe to His Divine nature the attributes which belong to His fleshly origin[fn-26-P2621_1790745:11-nf] . For bodies which do not exist, are generated, and God makes those things to be which are not, but does not Himself come into being from that which is not. And for this reason also Paul calls Him \"the brightness of glory[fn-26-P2622_1791088:12-nf] ,\" that we may learn that as the light from the lamp is of the nature of that which sheds the brightness, and is united with it (for as soon as the lamp appears the light that comes from it shines out simultaneously), so in this place the Apostle would have us consider both that the Son is of the Father, and that the Father is never without the Son; for it is impossible that glory should be without radiance, as it is impossible that the lamp should be without brightness. But it is clear that as His being brightness is a testimony to His being in relation with the glory (for if the glory did not exist, the brightness shed from it would not exist), so, to say that the brightness \"once was not[fn-26-P2623_1791804:13-nf] \" is a declaration that the glory also was not, when the brightness was not; for it is impossible that the glory should be without the brightness. As therefore it is not possible to say in the case of the brightness, \"If it was, it did not come into being, and if it came into being it was not,\" so it is in vain to say this of the Son, seeing that the Son is the brightness. Let those also who speak of \"less\" and \"greater,\" in the case of the Father and the Son, learn from Paul not to measure things immeasurable. For the Apostle says that the Son is the express image of the Person of the Father[fn-26-P2624_1792464:14-nf] . It is clear then that however great the Person of the Father is, so great also is the express image of that Person; for it is not possible that the express image should be less than the Person contemplated in it. And this the great John also teaches when he says, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God[fn-26-P2625_1792804:15-nf] .\" For in saying that he was \"in the beginning\" and not \"after the beginning,\" he showed that the beginning was never without the Word; and in declaring that \"the Word was with God,\" he signified the absence of defect in the Son in relation to the Father; for the Word is contemplated as a whole together with the whole being of God. For if the Word were deficient in His own greatness so as not to be capable of relation with the whole being of God, we are compelled to suppose that that part of Godwhich extends beyond the Word is without the Word. But in fact the whole magnitude of the Word is contemplated together with the whole magnitude of God: and consequently in statements concerning the Divine nature, it is not admissible to speak of \"greater\" and \"less.\"","title":"On the Faith","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_31_the_oration_of_the_emperor_constantine","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"God, who is ever above all existence, and the good which all things desire, has no origin, and therefore no beginning, being himself the originator[fn-81-P8139_3334212:10-nf] of all things which receive existence.

But the life of business must be forced upon them.

To this we must reply that it is the conviction of men who are wise in Christ, who have profited by those epistles which are current, and who see them to be vouched for by the testimonies deposited in the law and the prophets,[fn-61-P6118_933756:11-nf] that the apostolic writings are to be pronounced wise and worthy of belief, and that they have great authority, but that they are not on the same level with that \"Thus sayeth the Lord Almighty.\"[fn-61-P6119_933996:12-nf] Consider on this point the language of St. Paul. When he declares that[fn-61-P6120_934087:13-nf] \"Every Scripture is inspired of God and profitable,\" does he include his own writings? Or does he not include his dictum,[fn-61-P6121_934230:14-nf] \"I say, and not the Lord,\" and[fn-61-P6122_934282:15-nf] \"So I ordain in all the churches,\" and[fn-61-P6123_934342:16-nf] \"What things I suffered at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra,\" and similar things which he writes in virtue of his own authority, and which do not quite possess the character of words flowing from divine inspiration. Must we also show that the old Scripture is not Gospel, since it does not point out the Coming One, but only foretells Him and heralds His coming at a future time; but that all the new Scripture is the Gospel. It not only says as in the beginning of the Gospel,[fn-61-P6124_934839:17-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world; \"it also contains many praises of Him, and many of His teachings, on whose account the Gospel is a Gospel. Again, if God set in the Church[fn-61-P6125_935060:18-nf] apostles and prophets and evangelists (gospellers), pastors and teachers, we must first enquire what was the office of the evangelist, and mark that it is not only to narrate how the Saviour cured a man who was blind from his birth,[fn-61-P6126_935313:19-nf] or raised up a dead man who was already stinking,[fn-61-P6127_935380:20-nf] or to state what extraordinary works he wrought; and the office of the evangelist being thus defined, we shall not hesitate to find Gospel in such discourse also as is not narrative but hortatory and intended to strengthen belief in the mission of Jesus; and thus we shall arrive at the position that whatever was written by the Apostles is Gospel. As to this second definition, it might be objected that the Epistles are not entitled \"Gospel,\" and that we are wrong in applying the name of Gospel to the whole of the New Testament. But to this we answer that it happens not unfrequently in Scripture when two or more persons or things are named by the same name, the name attaches itself most significantly to one of those things or persons. Thus the Saviour says,[fn-61-P6128_936164:21-nf] \"Call no man Master upon the earth; \"while the Apostle says that Masters[fn-61-P6129_936260:22-nf] have been appointed in the Church. These latter accordingly will not be Masters in the strict sense of the dictum of the Gospel. In the same way the Gospel in the Epistles will not extend to every word of them, when it is compared with the narrative of Jesus' actions and sufferings and discourses. No: the Gospel is the first fruits of all Scripture, and to these first fruits of the Scriptures we devote the first fruits of all those actions of ours which we trust to see turn out as we desire.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Now the Gospels are four. These four are, as it were, the elements of the faith of the Church, out of which elements the whole world which is reconciled to God in Christ is put together; as Paul says,[fn-61-P6133_937094:23-nf] \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself; \"of which world Jesus bore the sin; for it is of the world of the Church that the word is written,[fn-61-P6134_937266:24-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.\" The Gospels then being four, I deem the first fruits of the Gospels to be that which you[fn-61-P6135_937437:25-nf] have enjoined me to search into according to my powers, the Gospel of John, that which speaks of him whose genealogy had already been set forth, but which begins to speak of him at a point before he had any genealogy. For Matthew, writing for the Hebrews who looked for Him who was to come of the line of Abraham and of David, says:[fn-61-P6136_937786:26-nf] \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.\" And Mark, knowing what he writes, narrates the beginning of the Gospel; we may perhaps find what he aims at in John; in the beginning the Word, God the Word. But Luke, though he says at the beginning of Acts, \"The former treatise did I make about all that Jesus began to do and to teach,\" yet leaves to him who lay on Jesus' breast the greatest and completest discourses about Jesus. For none of these plainly declared His Godhead, as John does when he makes Him say, \"I am the light of the world,\" \"I am the way and the truth and the life,\" \"I am the resurrection, \"I am the door,\" \"I am the good shepherd; \"and in the Apocalypse, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.\" We may therefore make bold to say that the Gospels are the first fruits of all the Scriptures, but that of the Gospels that of John is the first fruits. No one can apprehend the meaning of it except he have lain on Jesus' breast and received from Jesus Mary to be his mother also. Such an one must he become who is to be another John, and to have shown to him, like John, by Jesus Himself Jesus as He is. For if Mary, as those declare who with sound mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to His mother, \"Woman, behold thy son,\"[fn-61-P6137_939156:27-nf] and not \"Behold you have this son also,\" then He virtually said to her, \"Lo, this is Jesus, whom thou didst bear.\" Is it not the case that every one who is perfect lives himself no longer,[fn-61-P6138_939364:28-nf] but Christ lives in him; and if Christ lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary, \"Behold thy son Christ.\" What a mind, then, must we have to enable us to interpret in a worthy manner this work, though it be committed to the earthly treasure-house of common speech, of writing which any passer-by can read, and which can be heard when read aloud by any one who lends to it his bodily ears? What shall we say of this work? He who is accurately to apprehend what it contains should be able to say with truth,[fn-61-P6139_939891:29-nf] \"We have the mind of Christ, that we may know those things which are bestowed on us by God.\" It is possible to quote one of Paul's sayings in support of the contention that the whole of the New Testament is Gospel. He writes in a certain place:[fn-61-P6140_940160:30-nf] \"According to my Gospel.\" Now we have no written work of Paul which is commonly called a Gospel. But all that he preached and said was the Gospel; and what he preached and said he was also in the habit of writing, and what he wrote was therefore Gospel. But if what Paul wrote was Gospel, it follows that what Peter wrote was also Gospel, and in a word all that was said or written to perpetuate the knowledge of Christ's sojourn on earth, and to prepare for His second coming, or to bring it about as a present reality in those souls which were willing to receive the Word of God as He stood at the door and knocked and sought to come into them.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":42,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"57","folder":"ANF-10","text":"But it is time we should inquire what is the meaning of the designation \"Gospel,\" and why these books have this title.

We have now to ask which of them we should adopt for our text, \"In the beginning was the Word.\" It is plain that we may at once dismiss the meaning which connects it with transition or with a road and its length. Nor, it is pretty plain, will the meaning connected with an origin serve our purpose. One might, however, think of the sense in which it points to the author, to that which brings about the effect, if, as we read,[fn-62-P6242_975400:83-nf] \"God commanded and they were created.\" For Christ is, in a manner, the demiurge, to whom the Father says, \"Let there be light,\" and \"Let there be a firmament.\" But Christ is demiurge as a beginning (arche), inasmuch as He is wisdom. It is in virtue of His being wisdom that He is called arche. For Wisdom says in Solomon:[fn-62-P6243_975743:84-nf] \"God created me the beginning of His ways, for His works,\" so that the Word might be in an arche, namely, in wisdom. Considered in relation to the structure of contemplation and thoughts about the whole of things, it is regarded as wisdom; but in relation to that side of the objects of thought, in which reasonable beings apprehend them, it is considered as the Word. And there is no wonder, since, as we have said before, the Saviour is many good things, if He comprises in Himself thoughts of the first order, and of the second, and of the third. This is what John suggested when he said about the Word:[fn-62-P6244_976371:85-nf] \"That which was made was life in Him.\" Life then came in the Word. And on the one side the Word is no other than the Christ, the Word, He who was with the Father, by whom all things were made; while, on the other side, the Life is no other than the Son of God, who says:[fn-62-P6245_976661:86-nf] \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" As, then, life came into being in the Word, so the Word in the arche. Consider, however, if we are at liberty to take this meaning of arche for our text: \"In the beginning was the Word,\" so as to obtain the meaning that all things came into being according to wisdom and according to the models of the system which are present in his thoughts. For I consider that as a house or a ship is built and fashioned in accordance with the sketches of the builder or designer, the house or the ship having their beginning (arche) in the sketches and reckonings in his mind, so all things came into being in accordance with the designs of what was to be, clearly laid down by God in wisdom. And we should add that having created, so to speak, ensouled[fn-62-P6246_977465:87-nf] wisdom, He left her to hand over, from the types which were in her, to things existing and to matter, the actual emergence of them, their moulding and their forms.[fn-62-P6247_977652:88-nf] But I consider, if it be permitted to say this, that the beginning (arche) of real existence was theSon of God, saying:[fn-62-P6248_978034:89-nf] \"I am the beginning and the end, the A and the W, the first and the last.\" We must, however, remember that He is not the arche in respect of every name which is applied to Him. For how can He be the beginning in respect of His being life, when life came in the Word, and the Word is manifestly the arche of life? It is also tolerably evident that He cannot be the arche in respect of His being the first-born from the dead. And if we go through all His titles carefully we find that He is the arche only in respect of His being wisdom. Not even as the Word is He the arche, for the Word was in the arche. And so one might venture to say that wisdom is anterior to all the thoughts that are expressed in the titles of the first-born of every creature. Now God is altogether one and simple; but our Saviour, for many reasons, since God[fn-62-P6249_978889:90-nf] set Him forth a propitiation and a first fruits of the whole creation, is made many things, or perhaps all these things; the whole creation, so far as capable of redemption, stands in need of Him.[fn-62-P6250_979105:91-nf] And, hence, He is made the light of men, because men, being darkened by wickedness, need the light that shines in darkness, and is not overtaken by the darkness; had not men been in darkness, He would not have become the light of men. The same thing may be observed in respect of His being the first-born of the dead. For supposing the woman had not been deceived, and Adam had not fallen, and man created for incorruption had obtained it, then He would not have descended into the grave, nor would He have died, there being no sin, nor would His love of men have required that He should die, and if He had not died, He could not have been the first-born of the dead. We may also ask whether He would ever have become a shepherd, had man not been thrown together with the beasts which are devoid of reason, and made like to them. For if God saves man and beasts, He saves those beasts which He does save, by giving them a shepherd, since they cannot have a king. Thus if we collect the titles of Jesus, the question arises which of them were conferred on Him later, and would never have assumed such importance if the saints had begun and had also persevered in blessedness. Perhaps Wisdom would be the only remaining one, or perhaps the Word would remain too, or perhaps the Life, or perhaps the Truth, not the others, which He took for our sake. And happy indeed are those who in their need for the Son of God have yet become such persons as not to need Him in His character as a physician healing the sick, nor in that of a shepherd, nor in that of redemption, but only in His characters as wisdom, as the word and righteousness, or if there be any other title suitable for those who are so perfect as to receive Him in His fairest characters. So much for the phrase \"In the beginning.\"","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Let us consider, however, a little more carefully what is the Word which is in the beginning. I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but tropically. But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term \"Word.\" I wonder at the stupidity of the general run of Christians in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity. The Son of God says in one passage, \"I am the light of the world,\" and in another, \"I am the resurrection,\" and again, \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" It is also written, \"I am the door,\" and we have the saying, \"I am the good shepherd,\" and when the woman of Samaria says, \"We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,\" Jesus answers, \"I that speak unto thee am He.\" Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared Himself in these words[fn-62-P6254_982473:92-nf] to be their Master and Lord: \"You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.\" He also distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says,[fn-62-P6255_982654:93-nf] \"He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? \"and[fn-62-P6256_982806:94-nf] \"Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.\" We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate's question,[fn-62-P6257_982993:95-nf] \"Art Thou the King of the Jews? \"by saying, \"My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence.\" We have also read the words,[fn-62-P6258_983272:96-nf] \"I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman,\" and again, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" Add to these testimonies also the saying,[fn-62-P6259_983437:97-nf] \"I am the bread of life, that came down from heaven and giveth life to the world.\" These texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son of God. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says,[fn-62-P6260_983747:98-nf] \"I am the first and the last, and the living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.\" And again,[fn-62-P6261_983876:99-nf] \"I am the A and the W, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" The careful student of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as where He calls Himself[fn-62-P6262_984111:100-nf] a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,[fn-62-P6263_984170:101-nf] and a light of the Gentiles.[fn-62-P6264_984225:102-nf] Isaiah also says,[fn-62-P6265_984264:103-nf] \"From my mother's womb hath He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.\" And a little farther on: \"And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of Israel. Behold I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" And in Jeremiah too[fn-62-P6266_984857:104-nf] He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: \"I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.\" These and other similar sayings He applies to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets proclaim in advance His coining advent and announce the things concerning Him under various names. Thus John calls Him the Lamb of God, saying,[fn-62-P6267_985471:105-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world,\" and in these words he declares Him as a man,[fn-62-P6268_985601:106-nf] \"This is He about whom I said, that there cometh after me a man who is there before me; for He was before me.\" And in his Catholic Epistle John says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus:[fn-62-P6269_985836:107-nf] \"And if any one sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,\" and he adds that He is a propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a propitiation:[fn-62-P6270_986050:108-nf] \"Whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast sins, in the forbearance of God.\" According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:[fn-62-P6271_986344:109-nf] \"Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: \"He was made to us of God,\" he says, \"wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\" But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest:[fn-62-P6272_986654:110-nf] \"Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.\" And the prophets have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons[fn-62-P6273_986898:111-nf] says, \"Judah, thy brethren shall extol thee; thy hands are on the necks of thine enemies. A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art thou sprung up; thou hast lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him? \"We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. What may be quoted against this view, viz., \"A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved; \"this can better be cleared up on another occasion . But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel, when he says,[fn-62-P6274_987528:112-nf] \"Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted Him. He shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break. and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope.\" That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says:[fn-62-P6275_988040:113-nf] \"That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry,\" etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God:[fn-62-P6276_988248:114-nf] \"I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd.\" For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower:[fn-62-P6277_988483:115-nf] \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of tits root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel slid of might, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as follows:[fn-62-P6278_988887:116-nf] \"The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the comer. It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.\" And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows:[fn-62-P6279_989155:117-nf] \"Have ye never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.\" And Luke writes in Acts:[fn-62-P6280_989407:118-nf] \"This is the stone, which was set at naught of you the builders, which has become the head of the corner.\" And one of the names applied to the Saviour is that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records;-the Word who was in the beginning with God, God the Word. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and ask, What is the Son of God when called the Word? The passage they employ most is that in the Psalms,[fn-62-P6281_990132:119-nf] \"My heart hath produced a good Word; \"and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are they clear about His essence. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said to be \"Word\" can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an essence of His own. We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it suggests slid apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course. To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have to say on the question, how the Son of God is the Word, we must begin with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him. This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression, but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these matters will clear the way for what is coming. And once we have entered upon the theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what diligence we can and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall necessarily understand more about Him not only in His character as the Word, but in His other characters also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":30,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Let us consider, however, a little more carefully what is the Word which is in the beginning. I am often led to wonder when I consider the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest in their belief in Him. Though there is a countless number of names which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be understood in their proper sense, but tropically. But when they come to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the Word of God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term \"Word.\" I wonder at the stupidity of the general run of Christians in this matter. I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity. The Son of God says in one passage, \"I am the light of the world,\" and in another, \"I am the resurrection,\" and again, \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" It is also written, \"I am the door,\" and we have the saying, \"I am the good shepherd,\" and when the woman of Samaria says, \"We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,\" Jesus answers, \"I that speak unto thee am He.\" Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared Himself in these words[fn-62-P6254_982473:92-nf] to be their Master and Lord: \"You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.\" He also distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says,[fn-62-P6255_982654:93-nf] \"He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? \"and[fn-62-P6256_982806:94-nf] \"Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.\" We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate's question,[fn-62-P6257_982993:95-nf] \"Art Thou the King of the Jews? \"by saying, \"My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence.\" We have also read the words,[fn-62-P6258_983272:96-nf] \"I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman,\" and again, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" Add to these testimonies also the saying,[fn-62-P6259_983437:97-nf] \"I am the bread of life, that came down from heaven and giveth life to the world.\" These texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son of God. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says,[fn-62-P6260_983747:98-nf] \"I am the first and the last, and the living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.\" And again,[fn-62-P6261_983876:99-nf] \"I am the A and the W, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" The careful student of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as where He calls Himself[fn-62-P6262_984111:100-nf] a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,[fn-62-P6263_984170:101-nf] and a light of the Gentiles.[fn-62-P6264_984225:102-nf] Isaiah also says,[fn-62-P6265_984264:103-nf] \"From my mother's womb hath He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.\" And a little farther on: \"And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of Israel. Behold I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" And in Jeremiah too[fn-62-P6266_984857:104-nf] He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: \"I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.\" These and other similar sayings He applies to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets proclaim in advance His coining advent and announce the things concerning Him under various names.

He is the true light, and the light of the Gentiles. In the opening of the Gospel now before us He is the light of men: \"That which was made,\"[fn-62-P6285_992535:120-nf] it says, \"was life in Him, and the life was the light of men; and the light shines in darkness, and the darkness did not overtake it.\" A little further on, in the same passage, He is called the true light:[fn-62-P6286_992761:121-nf] \"The true light, which lightens every man, was coming into the world.\" In Isaiah, He is the light of the Gentiles, as we said before. \"Behold,[fn-62-P6287_992922:122-nf] I have set Thee for a light of the Gentiles, that Thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" Now the sensible light of the world is the sun, and after it comes very worthily the moon, and the same title may be applied to the stars; but those lights of the world are said in Moses to have come into existence on the fourth day, and as they shed light on the things on the earth, they are not the true light. But the Saviour shines on creatures which have intellect and sovereign reason, that their minds may behold their proper objects of vision, and so he is the light of the intellectual world, that is to say, of the reasonable souls which are in the sensible world, and if there be any beings beyond these in the world from which He declares Himself to be our Saviour. He is, indeed, the most determining and distinguished part of that world, and, as we may say, the sun who makes the great day of the Lord. In view of this day He says to those who partake of His light, \"Work[fn-62-P6288_993938:123-nf] while it is day; the night cometh when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\" Then He says to His disciples,[fn-62-P6289_994107:124-nf] \"Ye are the light of the world,\" and \"Let your light shine before men.\" Thus we see the Church, the bride, to present an analogy to the moon and stars, and the disciples have a light, which is their own or borrowed from the true sun, so that they are able to illuminate those who have no command of any spring of light in themselves. We may say that Paul and Peter are the light of the world, and that those of their disciples who are enlightened themselves, but are not able to enlighten others, are the world of which the Apostles were the light. But the Saviour, being the light of the world, illuminates not bodies, but by His incorporeal power the incorporeal intellect, to the end that each of us, enlightened as by the sun, may be able to discern the rest of the things of the mind. And as when the sun is shining the moon and the stars lose their power of giving light, so those who are irradiated by Christ and receive His beams have no need of the ministering apostles and prophets-we must have courage to declare this truth-nor of the angels; I will add that they have no need even of the greater powers when they are disciples of that first-born light. To those who do not receive the solar beams of Christ. the ministering saints do afford an illumination much less than the former; this illumination is as much as those persons can receive, and it completely fills them. Christ, again, the light of the world, is the true light as distinguished from the light of sense; nothing that is sensible is true. Yet though the sensible is other than the true, it does not follow that the sensible is false, for the sensible may have an analogy with the intellectual, and not everything that is not true can correctly be called false. Now I ask whether the light of the world is the same thing with the light of men, and I conceive that a higher power of light is intended by the former phrase than by the latter, for the world in one sense is not only men. Paul shows that the world is something more than men when he writes to the Corinthians in his first Epistle:[fn-62-P6290_996203:125-nf] \"We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\" In one sense, too, it may be considered,[fn-62-P6291_996334:126-nf] the world is the creation which is being delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God, whose earnest expectation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. We also draw attention to the comparison which may be drawn between the statement, \"I am the light of the world,\" and the words addressed to the disciples, \"Ye are the light of the world.\" Some suppose that the genuine disciples of Jesus are greater than other creatures, some seeking the reason of this ill the natural growth of these disciples, others inferring it from their harder struggle. For those beings which are in flesh and blood have greater labours and a life more full of dangers than those which are in an ethereal body, and the lights of heaven might not, if they had put on bodies of earth, have accomplished this life of ours free from danger and from error. Those who incline to this argument may appeal to those texts of Scripture which say the most exalted things about men, and to the fact that the Gospel is addressed directly to men; not so much is said about the creation, or, as we understand it, about the world. We read,[fn-62-P6292_997524:127-nf] \"As I and Thou are one, that they also may be one in Us,\" and[fn-62-P6293_997608:128-nf] \"Where I am, there will also My servant be.\" These sayings, plainly, are about men; while about the creation it is said that it is delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. It might be added that not even when it is delivered will it take part in the glory of the sons of God. Nor will those who hold this view forget that the first-born of every creature, honouring man above all else, became man, and that it was not any of the constellations existing in the sky, but one of another order, appointed for this purpose and in the service of the knowledge of Jesus, that was made to be the Star of the East, whether it was like the other stars or perchance better than they, to be the sign of Him who is the most excellent of all. And if the boasting of the saints is in their tribulations, since[fn-62-P6294_998478:129-nf] \"tribulation worketh patience, and patience probation, and probation hope, and hope maketh not ashamed,\" then the afflicted creation cannot have the like patience with man, nor the like probation, nor the like hope, but another degree of these, since[fn-62-P6295_998749:130-nf] \"the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it. for hope.\" Now he who shrinks from conferring such great attributes on man will turn to another direction and say that the creature being subjected to vanity groans and suffers greater affliction than those who groan in this tabernacle, for has she not suffered for the utmost extent of time in her service of vanity-nay, many times as long as man? For why does she do this not willingly, but that it is against her nature to be subject to vanity, and not to have the best arrangement of her life, that which she shall receive when she is set free, when the world is destroyed and released even from the vanity of bodies. Here, however, we may appear to be stretching too far, and aiming at more than the question now before us requires. We may return, therefore, to the point from which we set out, and ask for what reason the Saviour is called the light of the world, the true light, and the light of men. Now we saw that He is called the true light with reference to the sensible light of the world, and that the light of the world is the same thing as the light of men, or that we may at least enquire whether they are the same. This discussion is not superfluous. Some students do not take anything at all out of the statement that the Saviour is the Word; and it is important for us to assure ourselves that we are not chargeable with caprice in fixing our attention on that notion. If it admits of being taken in a metaphorical sense we ought not to take it literally.[fn-62-P6296_1000345:131-nf] When we apply the mystical and allegorical method to the expression \"light of the world\" and the many analogous terms mentioned above, we should surely do so with this expression also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"ANF-10","text":"He said, then, that He was the light of the world; and we have to examine, along with this title, those which are parallel to it; and, indeed, are thought by some to be not merely parallel, but identical with it.

And as when the sun is shining the moon and the stars lose their power of giving light, so those who are irradiated by Christ and receive His beams have no need of the ministering apostles and prophets-we must have courage to declare this truth-nor of the angels; I will add that they have no need even of the greater powers when they are disciples of that first-born light. To those who do not receive the solar beams of Christ. the ministering saints do afford an illumination much less than the former; this illumination is as much as those persons can receive, and it completely fills them. Christ, again, the light of the world, is the true light as distinguished from the light of sense; nothing that is sensible is true. Yet though the sensible is other than the true, it does not follow that the sensible is false, for the sensible may have an analogy with the intellectual, and not everything that is not true can correctly be called false. Now I ask whether the light of the world is the same thing with the light of men, and I conceive that a higher power of light is intended by the former phrase than by the latter, for the world in one sense is not only men. Paul shows that the world is something more than men when he writes to the Corinthians in his first Epistle:[fn-62-P6290_996203:125-nf] \"We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\" In one sense, too, it may be considered,[fn-62-P6291_996334:126-nf] the world is the creation which is being delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God, whose earnest expectation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. We also draw attention to the comparison which may be drawn between the statement, \"I am the light of the world,\" and the words addressed to the disciples, \"Ye are the light of the world.\" Some suppose that the genuine disciples of Jesus are greater than other creatures, some seeking the reason of this ill the natural growth of these disciples, others inferring it from their harder struggle. For those beings which are in flesh and blood have greater labours and a life more full of dangers than those which are in an ethereal body, and the lights of heaven might not, if they had put on bodies of earth, have accomplished this life of ours free from danger and from error. Those who incline to this argument may appeal to those texts of Scripture which say the most exalted things about men, and to the fact that the Gospel is addressed directly to men; not so much is said about the creation, or, as we understand it, about the world. We read,[fn-62-P6292_997524:127-nf] \"As I and Thou are one, that they also may be one in Us,\" and[fn-62-P6293_997608:128-nf] \"Where I am, there will also My servant be.\" These sayings, plainly, are about men; while about the creation it is said that it is delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. It might be added that not even when it is delivered will it take part in the glory of the sons of God. Nor will those who hold this view forget that the first-born of every creature, honouring man above all else, became man, and that it was not any of the constellations existing in the sky, but one of another order, appointed for this purpose and in the service of the knowledge of Jesus, that was made to be the Star of the East, whether it was like the other stars or perchance better than they, to be the sign of Him who is the most excellent of all. And if the boasting of the saints is in their tribulations, since[fn-62-P6294_998478:129-nf] \"tribulation worketh patience, and patience probation, and probation hope, and hope maketh not ashamed,\" then the afflicted creation cannot have the like patience with man, nor the like probation, nor the like hope, but another degree of these, since[fn-62-P6295_998749:130-nf] \"the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it. for hope.\" Now he who shrinks from conferring such great attributes on man will turn to another direction and say that the creature being subjected to vanity groans and suffers greater affliction than those who groan in this tabernacle, for has she not suffered for the utmost extent of time in her service of vanity-nay, many times as long as man? For why does she do this not willingly, but that it is against her nature to be subject to vanity, and not to have the best arrangement of her life, that which she shall receive when she is set free, when the world is destroyed and released even from the vanity of bodies. Here, however, we may appear to be stretching too far, and aiming at more than the question now before us requires. We may return, therefore, to the point from which we set out, and ask for what reason the Saviour is called the light of the world, the true light, and the light of men. Now we saw that He is called the true light with reference to the sensible light of the world, and that the light of the world is the same thing as the light of men, or that we may at least enquire whether they are the same. This discussion is not superfluous. Some students do not take anything at all out of the statement that the Saviour is the Word; and it is important for us to assure ourselves that we are not chargeable with caprice in fixing our attention on that notion. If it admits of being taken in a metaphorical sense we ought not to take it literally.[fn-62-P6296_1000345:131-nf] When we apply the mystical and allegorical method to the expression \"light of the world\" and the many analogous terms mentioned above, we should surely do so with this expression also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":29,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Again, let any one consider how Jesus was to His disciples, not as He who sits at meat, but as He who serves, and how though the Son of God He took on Him the form of a servant for the sake of the freedom of those who were enslaved in sin, and he will be at no loss to account for the Father's saying to Him:[fn-63-P6367_1019967:163-nf] \"Thou art My servant,\" and a little further on: \"It is a great thing that thou shouldst be called My servant.\" For we do not hesitate to say that the goodness of Christ appears in a greater and more divine light, and more according to the image of the Father, because[fn-63-P6368_1020258:164-nf] \"He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the cross,\" than if He had judged it a thing to be grasped to be equal with God, and had shrunk from becoming a servant for the salvation of the world. Hence He says,[fn-63-P6369_1020519:165-nf] desiring to teach us that in accepting this state of servitude He had received a great gift from His Father: \"And My God shall be My strength. And He said to Me, It is a great thing for Thee to be called My servant.\" For if He had not become a servant, He would not have raised up the tribes of Jacob, nor have turned the heart of the diaspora of Israel, and neither would He have become a light of the Gentiles to be for salvation to the ends of the earth. And it is no great thing for Him to become a servant, even if it is called a great thing by His Father, for this is in comparison with His being called with an innocent sheep and with a lamb. For the Lamb of God became like an innocent sheep being led to the slaughter, that He may take away the sin of the world. He who supplies reason (logoj to all is made like a lamb which is dumb before her shearer, that we might be purified by His death, which is given as a sort of medicine against the opposing power, and also against the sin of those who open their minds to the truth. For the death of Christ reduced to impotence those powers which war against the human race, and it set free from sin by a power beyond our words the life of each believer. Since, then, He takes away sin until every enemy shall be destroyed and death last of all, in order that the whole world may be free from sin, therefore John points to Him and says:[fn-63-P6370_1021935:166-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.\" It is not said that He will take it away in the future, nor that He is at present taking it, nor that He has taken it, but is not taking it away now. His taking away sin is still going on, He is taking it away from every individual in the world, till sin be taken away from the whole world, and the Saviour deliver the kingdom prepared and completed to the Father, a kingdom in which no sin is left at all, and which, therefore, is ready to accept the Father as its king, and which on the other hand is waiting to receive all God has to bestow, fully, and in every part, at that time when the saying[fn-63-P6371_1022619:167-nf] is fulfilled, \"That God may be all in all.\" Further, we hear of a man who is said to be coming after John, who was made before him and was before him. This is to teach us that the man also of the Son of God, the man who was mixed with His divinity, was older than His birth from Mary. John says he does not know this man, but must he not have known Him when he leapt for joy when yet a babe unborn in Elisabeth's womb, as soon as the voice of Mary's salutation sounded in the ears of the wife of Zacharias? Consider, therefore, if the words \"I know Him not\" may have reference to the period before the bodily existence. Though he did not know Him before He assumed His body, yet he knew Him when yet in his mother's womb, and perhaps he is here learning something new about Him beyond what was known to him before, namely, that on whomsoever the Holy Spirit shall descend and abide on him, that is he who is to baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire. He knew him from his mother's womb, but not all about Him. He did not know perhaps that this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with fire, when he saw the Spirit descending and abiding on Him. Yet that He was indeed a man, and the first man, John did not know.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"ANF-10","text":"But none of the names we have mentioned expresses His representation of us with the Father, as He pleads for human nature, and makes atonement for it; the Paraclete, and the propitiation, and the atonement.

But some man will say, Would then those midwives and Rahab have done better if they had shown no mercy, by refusing to lie? Nay verily, those Hebrew women, if they were such as that sort of persons of whom we ask whether they ought ever to tell a lie, would both eschew to say aught false, and would most frankly refuse that foul service of killing the babes. But, thou wilt say, themselves would die. Yea, but see what follows. They would die with an heavenly habitation for their incomparably more ample reward than those houses which they made them on earth could be: they would die, to be in eternal felicity, after enduring of death for most innocent truth. What of her in Jericho? Could she do this? Would she not, if she did not by telling a lie deceive the inquiring citizens, by speaking truth betray the lurking guests? Or could she say[fn-44-P4489_2197333:72-nf] to their questionings, I know where they are; but I fear God, I will not betray them? She could indeed say this, were she already a true Israelites in whom was no guile:[fn-44-P4490_2197592:73-nf] which thing she was about to be, when through the mercy of God passing over into the city of God. But they, hearing this (thou wilt say), would slay her, would search the house. But did it follow that they would also find them, whom she had diligently concealed? For in the foresight of this, that most cautious woman had placed them where they would have been able to remain undiscovered if she, telling a lie, should not be believed. So both she, if after all she had been slain by her countrymen for the work of mercy, would have ended this life, which must needs come to an end, by a death precious in the sight of the Lord,[fn-44-P4491_2198238:74-nf] and towards them her benefit had not been in vain. But, thou wilt say, \"What if the men who sought them, in their thorough-going search had come to the place where he had concealed them?\" In this fashion it may be said: What if a most vile and base woman, not only telling, but swearing a lie, had not got them to believe her? Of course even so would the things have been like to come to pass, through fear of which she lied. And where do we put the will and power of God? or haply was He not able to keep both her, neither telling a lie to her own townsmen, nor betraying men of God, and them. being His, safe from all harm? For by Whom also after the woman's lie they were guarded, by Him could they, even if she had not lied, have in any wise been guarded. Unless perchance we have forgotten that this did come to pass in Sodom, where males burning rewards males with hideous lust could not so much as find the door of the house in which were the men they sought; when that just man, in a case altogether most similar, would not tell a lie for his guests, whom he knew not to be Angels, and feared lest they should suffer a violence worse than death. And doubtless, he might have given the seekers the like answer as that woman gave in Jericho. For itwas in precisely the like manner that they sought by interrogating. But that just person was not willing that for the bodies of his guests his soul should be spotted by his own telling of a lie, for which bodies he was willing that the bodies of his daughters by iniquity of others' lust should be deforced.[fn-44-P4492_2199819:75-nf] Let then a man do even for the temporal safety of men what he can; but when it comes to that point that to consult for such saving of them except by sinning is not in his power, thenceforth let him esteem himself not to have what he may do, when he shall perceive that only to be left him which he may not rightly do. Therefore, touching Rahab in Jericho, because she entertained strangers, men of God, because in entertaining of them she put herself in peril, because she believed on their God, because she diligently hid them where she could, because she gave them most faithful counsel of returning by another way, let her be praised as meet to be imitated even by the citizens of Jerusalem on high. But in that she lied, although somewhat therein as prophetical be intelligently expounded, yet not as meet to be imitated is it wisely pro-pounded: albeit that God hath those good things memorably honored, this evil thing mercifully overlooked.","title":"Against Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Now, that we may give a simpler answer, it was not fit that the Son of God should be born of a human father's seed, lest, if He were wholly the Son of a man, He should fail to be also the Son of God, and have nothing more than \"a Solomon\" or \"a Jonas,\"[fn-95-P9542_2619874:248-nf] -as Ebion[fn-95-P9543_2619910:249-nf] thought we ought to believe concerning Him. In order, therefore, that He who was already the Son of God-of God the Father's seed, that is to say, the Spirit-might also be the Son of man, He only wanted to assume flesh, of the flesh of man[fn-95-P9544_2620178:250-nf] without the seed of a man;[fn-95-P9545_2620221:251-nf] for the seed of a man was unnecessary[fn-95-P9546_2620272:252-nf] for One who had the seed of God. As, then, before His birth of the virgin, He was able to have God for His Father without a human mother, so likewise, after He was born of the virgin, He was able to have a woman for His mother without a human father. He is thus man with God, in short, since He is man's flesh with God's Spirit[fn-95-P9547_2620616:253-nf] -flesh (I say) without seed from man, Spirit with seed from God. For as much, then, as the dispensation of God's purpose[fn-95-P9548_2620882:254-nf] concerning His Son required that He should be born[fn-95-P9549_2620961:255-nf] of a virgin, why should He not have received of the virgin the body which He bore from the virgin? Because, (forsooth) it is something else which He took from God, for \"the Word \"say they, \"was made flesh.\"[fn-95-P9550_2621188:256-nf] Now this very statement plainly shows what it was that was made flesh; nor can it possibly be that[fn-95-P9551_2621306:257-nf] anything else than the Word was made flesh. Now, whether it was of the flesh that the Word was made flesh, or whether it was so made of the (divine) seed itself, the Scripture must tell us. As, however, the Scripture is silent about everything except what it was that was made (flesh), and says nothing of that from which it was so made, it must be held to suggest that from something else, and not from itself, was the Word made flesh. And if not from itself, but from something else, from what can we more suitably suppose that the Word became flesh than from that flesh in which it submitted to the dispensation?[fn-95-P9552_2621953:258-nf] And (we have a proof of the same conclusion in the fact) that the Lord Himself sententiously and distinctly pronounced, \"that which is born of the flesh is flesh,\"[fn-95-P9553_2622163:259-nf] even because it is born of the flesh. But if He here spoke of a human being simply, and not of Himself, (as you maintain) then you must deny absolutely that Christ is man, and must maintain that human nature was not suitable to Him. And then He adds, \"That which is born of the Spirit is spirit,\"[fn-95-P9554_2622480:260-nf] because God is a Spirit, and He was born of God. Now this description is certainly even more applicable to Him than it is to those who believe in Him. But if this passage indeed apply to Him, then why does not the preceding one also? For you cannot divide their relation, and adapt this to Him, and the previous clause to all other men, especially as you do not deny that Christ possesses the two substances, both of the flesh and of the Spirit. Besides, as He was in possession both of flesh and of Spirit, He cannot possibly, when speaking of the condition of the two substances which He Himself bears, be supposed to have determined that the Spirit indeed was His own, but that the flesh was not His own.

The expression is in the singular number, as referring to the Lord, \"He was born of God.\" And very properly, because Christ is the Word of God, and with the Word the Spirit of God, and by the Spirit the Power of God, and whatsoever else appertains to God. As flesh, however, He is not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of man, because it was by the will of God that the Word was made flesh. To the flesh, indeed, and not to the Word, accrues the denial of the nativity which is natural to us all as men,[fn-95-P9563_2625365:266-nf] because it was as flesh that He had thus to be born, and not as the Word. Now, whilst the passage actually denies that He was born of the will of the flesh, how is it that it did not also deny (that He was born) of the substance of the flesh? For it did not disavow the substance of the flesh when it denied His being \"born of blood\" but only the matter of the seed, which, as all know, is the warm blood as convected by ebullition[fn-95-P9564_2625834:267-nf] into the coagulum of the woman's blood. In the cheese, it is from the coagulation that the milky substance acquires that consistency,[fn-95-P9565_2625989:268-nf] which is condensed by infusing the rennet.[fn-95-P9566_2626044:269-nf] We thus understand that what is denied is the Lord's birth after sexual intercourse (as is suggested by the phrase, \"the will of man and of the flesh\"), not His nativity from a woman's womb. Why, too, is it insisted on with such an accumulation of emphasis that He was not born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor (of the will) of man, if it were not that His flesh was such that no man could have any doubt on the point of its being born from sexual intercourse? Again, although denying His birth from such cohabitation, the passage did not deny that He was born of real flesh; it rather affirmed this, by the very fact that it did not deny His birth in the flesh in the same way that it denied His birth from sexual intercourse. Pray, tell me, why the Spirit of God[fn-95-P9567_2626943:270-nf] descended into a woman's womb at all, if He did not do so for the purpose of partaking of flesh from the womb. For He could have become spiritual flesh[fn-95-P9568_2627124:271-nf] without such a process,-much more simply, indeed, without the womb than in it. He had no reason for enclosing Himself within one, if He was to bear forth nothing from it. Not without reason, however, did He descend into a womb. Therefore He received (flesh) therefrom; else, if He received nothing therefrom, His descent into it would have been without a reason, especially if He meant to become flesh of that sort which was not derived from a womb, that is to say, a spiritual one.[fn-95-P9569_2627660:272-nf] ","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But to what shifts you resort, in your attempt to rob the syllable ex (of)[fn-95-P9573_2627976:273-nf] of its proper force as a preposition, and to substitute another for it in a sense not found throughout the Holy Scriptures! You say that He was born through[fn-95-P9574_2628189:274-nf] a virgin, not of[fn-95-P9575_2628218:275-nf] a virgin, and in a womb, not of a womb, because the angel in the dream said to Joseph, \"That which is born in her\" (not of her) \"is of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-95-P9576_2628381:276-nf] But the fact is, if he had meant \"of her,\" he must have said \"in her; \"for that which was of her, was also in her. The angel's expression, therefore, \"in her,\" has precisely the same meaning as the phrase \"of her.\" It is, however, a fortunate circumstance that Matthew also, when tracing down the Lord's descent from Abraham to Mary, says, \"Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Christ.\"[fn-95-P9577_2628808:277-nf] But Paul, too, silences these critics[fn-95-P9578_2628866:278-nf] when he says, \"God sent forth His Son, made of a woman.\"[fn-95-P9579_2628943:279-nf] Does he mean through a woman, or in a woman? Nay more, for the sake of greater emphasis, he uses the word \"made\" rather than born, although the use of the latter expression would have been simpler. But by saying \"made,\" he not only confirmed the statement, \"The Word was made flesh,\"[fn-95-P9580_2629246:280-nf] but he also asserted the reality of the flesh which was made of a virgin We shall have also the support of the Psalms on this point, not the \"Psalms\" indeed of Valentinus the apostate, and heretic, and Platonist, but the Psalms of David, the most illustrious saint and well-known prophet. He sings to us of Christ, and through his voice Christ indeed also sang concerning Himself. Hear, then, Christ the Lord speaking to God the Father: \"Thou art He that didst draw[fn-95-P9581_2629731:281-nf] me out of my mother's womb.\"[fn-95-P9582_2629779:282-nf] Here is the first point. \"Thou art my hope from my mother's breasts; upon Thee have I been cast from the womb.\"[fn-95-P9583_2629911:283-nf] Here is another point. \"Thou art my God from my mother's belly.\"[fn-95-P9584_2629996:284-nf] Here is a third point. Now let us carefully attend to the sense of these passages. \"Thou didst draw me,\" He says, \"out of the womb.\" Now what is it which is drawn, if it be not that which adheres, that which is firmly fastened to anything from which it is drawn in order to be sundered? If He clove not to the womb, how could He have been drawn from it? If He who clove thereto was drawn from it, how could He have adhered to it, if it were not that, all the while He was in the womb, He was tied to it, as to His origin,[fn-95-P9585_2630534:285-nf] by the umbilical cord, which communicated growth to Him from the matrix? Even when one strange matter amalgamates with another, it becomes so entirely incorporated[fn-95-P9586_2630724:286-nf] with that with which it amalgamates, that when it is drawn off from it, it carries with it some part of the body from which it is torn, as if in consequence of the severance of the union and growth which the constituent pieces had communicated to each other. But what were His \"mother's breasts\" which He mentions? No doubt they were those which He sucked. Midwives, and doctors, and naturalists, can tell us, from the nature of women's breasts, whether they usually flow at any other time than when the womb is affected with pregnancy, when the veins convey therefrom the blood of the lower parts[fn-95-P9587_2631401:287-nf] to the mammilla, and in the act of transference convert the secretion into the nutritious[fn-95-P9588_2631532:288-nf] substance of milk. Whence it comes to pass that during the period of lactation the monthly issues are suspended. But if the Word was made flesh of Himself without any communication with a womb, no mother's womb operating upon Him with its usual function and support, how could the lacteal fountain have been conveyed (from the womb) to the breasts, since (the womb) can only effect the change by actual possession of the proper substance? But it could not possibly have had blood for transformation into milk, unless it possessed the causes of blood also, that is to say, the severance (by birth)[fn-95-P9589_2632147:289-nf] of its own flesh from the mother's womb. Now it is easy to see what was the novelty of Christ's being born of a virgin. It was simply this, that (He was born) of a virgin in the real manner which we have indicated, in order that our regeneration might have virginal purity,-spiritually cleansed from all pollutions through Christ, who was Himself a virgin, even in the flesh, in that He was born of a virgin's flesh.","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_39_on_the_flesh_of_christ_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"ANF-03","text":"For when Isaiah hurls denunciation against our very heretics, especially in his \"Woe to them that call evil good, and put darkness for light,\"[fn-96-P9643_2644149:331-nf] he of course sets his mark upon those amongst you[fn-96-P9644_2644218:332-nf] who preserve not in the words they employ the light of their true significance, (by taking care) that the soul should mean only that which is so called, and the flesh simply that which is confest to our view and God none other than the One who is preached.[fn-96-P9645_2644489:333-nf] Having thus Marcion in his prophetic view, he says, \"I am God, and there is none else; there is no God beside me.\"[fn-96-P9646_2644624:334-nf] And when in another passage he says, in like manner, \"Before me there was no God,\"[fn-96-P9647_2644727:335-nf] he strikes at those inexplicable genealogies of the Valentinian ¦ons.

But the penetrating and scientific mind will not trust to the eyes alone the task of taking the measure of reality; it will not stop at appearances, nor count that which is not seen amongst unrealities. It inquires into the qualities of the man's soul. It takes those of its characteristics which have been developed by his bodily constitution, both in combination and singly; first singly, by analysis, and then in that living combination which makes the personality of the subject.

But the other, whose mind's eye is clear, and who can inspect such appearances, will neglect those elements which are the material only upon which the Form of Beauty works; to him they will be but the ladder by which he climbs to the prospect of that Intellectual Beauty, in accordance with their share in which all other beauties get their existence and their name. But for the majority, I take it, who live all their lives with such obtuse faculties of thinking, it is a difficult thing to perform this feat of mental analysis and of discriminating the material vehicle from the immanent beauty, and thereby of grasping the actual nature of the Beautiful; and if any one wants to know the exact source of all the false and pernicious conceptions of it, he would find it in nothing else but this, viz. the absence, in the soul's faculties of feeling, of that exact training which would enable them to distinguish between true Beauty and the reverse. Owing to this men give up all search after the true Beauty. Some slide into mere sensuality. Others incline in their desires to dead metallic coin. Others limit their imagination of the beautiful to worldly honours, fame, and power. There is another class which is enthusiastic about art and science. The most debased make their gluttony the test of what is good. But he who turns from all grosser thoughts and all passionate longings after what is seeming, and explores the nature of the beauty which is simple, immaterial, formless, would never make a mistake like that when he has to choose between all the objects of desire; he would never be so misled by these attractions as not to see the transient character of their pleasures and not to win his way to an utter contempt for every one of them. This, then, is the path to lead us to the discovery of the Beautiful. All other objects that attract men's love, be they never so fashionable, be they prized never so much and embraced never so eagerly, must be left below us, as too low, too fleeting, to employ the powers of loving which we possess; not indeed that those powers are to be locked up within us unused and motionless; but only that they must first be cleansed from all lower longings; then we must lift them to that height to which sense can never reach. Admiration even of the beauty of the heavens, and of the dazzling sunbeams, and, indeed, of any fair phenomenon, will then cease. The beauty noticed there will be but as the hand to lead us to the love of the supernal Beauty whose glory the heavens and the firmament declare, and whose secret the whole creation sings. The climbing soul, leaving all that she has grasped already as too narrow for her needs, will thus grasp the idea of that magnificence which is exalted far above the heavens. But how can any one reach to this, whose ambitions creep below? How can any one fly up into the heavens, who has not the wings of heaven and is not already buoyant and lofty-minded by reason of a heavenly calling? Few can be such strangers to evangelic mysteries as not to know that there is but one vehicle on which man's soul can mount into the heavens, viz. the self-made likeness in himself to the descending Dove, whose wings[fn-27-P2739_1869111:59-nf] David the Prophet also longed for. This is the allegorical name used in Scripture for the power of the Holy Spirit; whether it be because not a drop of gall[fn-27-P2740_1869284:60-nf] is found in that bird, or because it cannot bear any noisome smell, as close observers tell us. He therefore who keeps away from all bitterness and all the noisome effluvia of the flesh, and raises himself on the aforesaid wings above all low earthly ambitions, or, more than that, above the whole universe itself, will be the man to find that which is alone worth loving, and to become himself as beautiful as the Beauty which he has touched and entered, and to be made bright and luminous himself in the communion of the real Light. We are told by those who have studied the subject, that those gleams which follow each other so fast through the air at night and which some call shooting stars[fn-27-P2741_1870214:61-nf] , are nothing but the air itself streaming into the upper regions of the sky under stress of some particular blasts. They say that the fiery track is traced along the sky when those blasts ignite in the ether. In like manner, then, as this air round the earth is forced upwards by some blast and changes into the pure splendour of the ether, so the mind of man leaves this murky miry world, and under the stress of the spirit becomes pure and luminous in contact with the true and supernal Purity; in such an atmosphere it even itself emits light, and is so filled with radiance, that it becomes itself a Light, according to the promise of our Lord that \"the righteous should shine forth as the sun[fn-27-P2742_1871704:62-nf] .\" We see this even here, in the case of a mirror, or a sheet of water, or any smooth surface that can reflect the light; when they receive the sunbeam they beam themselves; but they would not do this if any stain marred their pure and shining surface. We shall become then as the light, in our nearness to Christ's true light, if we leave this dark atmosphere of the earth and dwell above; and we shall be light, as our Lord says somewhere to His disciples[fn-27-P2743_1872186:63-nf] , if the true Light that shineth in the dark comes down even to us; unless, that is, any foulness of sin spreading over our hearts should dim the brightness of our light. Perhaps these examples have led us gradually on to the discovery that we can be changed into something better than ourselves; and it has been proved as well that this union of the soul with the incorruptible Deity can be accomplished in no other way but by herself attaining by her virgin state to the utmost purity possible,-a state which, being like God, will enable her to grasp that to which it is like, while she places herself like a mirror beneath the purity of God, and moulds her own beauty at the touch and the sight of the Archetype of all beauty.

Well, the Divine books are full of such instruction for our guidance; and besides that many of the Saints cast the refulgence of their own lives, like lamps, upon the path for those who are \"walking with God[fn-27-P2746_1875295:66-nf] .\" But each may gather in abundance for himself suggestions towards this end out of either Covenant in the inspired writings; the Prophets and the Law are full of them; and also the Gospel and the Traditions of the Apostles. What we ourselves have conjectured in following out the thoughts of those inspired utterances is this.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But seeing that Paradise is the home of living spirits, and will not admit those who are dead in sin, and that we on the other hand are fleshly, subject to death, and sold under sin[fn-27-P2773_1886870:87-nf] , how is it possible that one who is a subject of death's empire should ever dwell in this land where all is life? What method of release from this jurisdiction can be devised? Here too the Gospel teaching is abundantly sufficient. We hear our Lord saying to Nicodemus, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit[fn-27-P2774_1887343:88-nf] .\" We know too that the flesh is subject to death because of sin, but the Spirit of God is both incorruptible, and life-giving, and deathless. As at our physical birth there comes into the world with us a potentiality of being again turned to dust, plainly the Spirit also imparts a life-giving potentiality to the children begotten by Himself. What lesson, then, results from these remarks? This: that we should wean ourselves from this life in the flesh, which has an inevitable follower, death; and that we should search for a manner of life which does not bring death in its train. Now the life of Virginity is such a life. We will add a few other things to show how true this is. Every one knows that the propagation of mortal frames is the work which the intercourse of the sexes has to do; whereas for those who are joined to the Spirit, life and immortality instead of children are produced by this latter intercourse; and the words of the Apostle beautifully suit their case, for the joyful mother of such children as these \"shall be saved in child-bearing[fn-27-P2775_1888430:89-nf] ;\" as the Psalmist in his divine songs thankfully cries, \"He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children[fn-27-P2776_1888588:90-nf] .\" Truly a joyful mother is the virgin mother who by the operation of the Spirit conceives the deathless children, and who is called by the Prophet barren because of her modesty only. This life, then, which is stronger than the power of death, is, to those who think, the preferable one. The physical bringing of children into the world-I speak without wishing to offend-is as much a starting-point of death as of life; because from the moment of birth the process of dying commences. But those who by virginity have desisted from this process have drawn within themselves the boundary line of death, and by their own deed have checked his advance; they have made themselves, in fact, a frontier between life and death, and a barrier too, which thwarts him. If, then, death cannot pass beyond virginity, but finds his power checked and shattered there, it is demonstrated that virginity is a stronger thing than death; and that body is rightly named undying which does not lend its service to a dying world, nor brook to become the instrument of a succession of dying creatures. In such a body the long unbroken career of decay and death, which has intervened between[fn-27-P2777_1889775:91-nf] the first man and the lives of virginity which have been led, is interrupted. It could not be indeed that death should cease working as long as the human race by marriage was working too; he walked the path of life with all preceding generations; he started with every new-born child and accompanied it to the end: but he found in virginity a barrier, to pass which was an impossible feat. Just as, in the age of Mary the mother of God, he who had reigned from Adam to her time found, when he came to her and dashed his forces against the fruit of her virginity as against a rock, that he was shattered to pieces upon her, so in every soul which passes through this life in the flesh under the protection of virginity, the strength of death is in a manner broken and annulled, for he does not find the places upon which he may fix his sting. If you do not throw into the fire wood, or straw, or grass, or something that it can consume, it has not the force to last by itself; so the power of death cannot go on working, if marriage does not supply it with material and prepare victims for this executioner. If you have any doubts left, consider the actual names of those afflictions which death brings upon mankind, and which were detailed in the first part of this discourse. Whence do they get their meaning? \"Widowhood,\" \"orphanhood,\" \"loss of children,\" could they be a subject for grief, if marriage did not precede? Nay, all the dearly-prized blisses, and transports, and comforts of marriage end in these agonies of grief, The hilt of a sword is smooth and handy, and polished and glittering outside; it seems to grow to the outline of the hand[fn-27-P2778_1891533:92-nf] ; but the other part is steel and the instrument of death, formidable to look at, more formidable still to come across. Such a thing is marriage. It offers for the grasp of the senses a smooth surface of delights, like a hilt of rare polish and beautiful workmanship; but when a man has taken it up and has got it into his hands, he finds the pain that has been wedded to it is in his hands as well; and it becomes to him the worker of mourning and of loss. It is marriage that has the heartrending spectacles to show of children left desolate in the tenderness of their years, a mere prey to the powerful, yet smiling often at their misfortune from ignorance of coming woes. What is the cause of widowhood but marriage? And retirement from this would bring with it an immunity from the whole burden of these sad taxes on our hearts. Can we expect it otherwise? When the verdict that was pronounced on the delinquents in the beginning is annulled, then too the mothers' \"sorrows[fn-27-P2779_1892575:93-nf] \" are no longer \"multiplied,\" nor does \"sorrow\" herald the births of men; then all calamity has been removed from life and \"tears wiped from off all faces[fn-27-P2780_1892748:94-nf] ;\" conception is no more an iniquity, nor child-bearing a sin; and births shall be no more \"of bloods,\" or \"of the will of man,\" or \"of the will of the flesh[fn-27-P2781_1892922:95-nf] \", but of God alone. This is always happening whenever any one in a lively heart conceives all the integrity of the Spirit, and brings forth wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption too. It is possible for any one to be the mother of such a son; as our Lord says, \"He that doeth my will is my brother, my sister, and my mother[fn-27-P2782_1893288:96-nf] .\" What room is there for death in such parturitions? Indeed in them death is swallowed up by life. In fact, the Life of Virginity seems to be an actual representation of the blessedness in the world to come, showing as it does in itself so many signs of the presence of those expected blessings which are reserved for us there. That the truth of this statement may be perceived, we will verify it thus. It is so, first, because a man who has thus died once for all to sin lives for the future to God; he brings forth no more fruit unto death; and having so far as in him lies made an end[fn-27-P2783_1893900:97-nf] of this life within him according to the flesh, he awaits thenceforth the expected blessing of the manifestation[fn-27-P2784_1894069:98-nf] of the great God, refraining from putting any distance between himself and this coming of God by an intervening posterity: secondly, because he enjoys even in this present life a certain exquisite glory of all the blessed results of our resurrection. For our Lord has announced that the life after our resurrection shall be as that of the angels. Now the peculiarity of the angelic nature is that they are strangers to marriage; therefore the blessing of this promise has been already received by him who has not only mingled his own glory with the halo of the Saints, but also by the stainlessness of his life has so imitated the purity of these incorporeal beings. If virginity then can win us favours such as these, what words are fit to express the admiration of so great a grace? What other gift of the soul can be found so great and precious as not to suffer by comparison with this perfection?","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_36_book_i_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But in defending free will they hasten to confide rather in it for doing righteousness than in God's aid, and to glory every one in himself, and not in the Lord.[fn-50-P5042_1990525:2-nf] But who of us will say that by the sin of the first man free will perished from the human race? Through sin freedom indeed perished, but it was that freedom which was in Paradise, to have a full righteousness with immortality; and it is on this account that human nature needs divine grace, since the Lord says, \"If the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free indeed\"[fn-50-P5043_1990917:3-nf] -free of course to live well and righteously. For free will in the sinner up to this extent did not perish,-that by it all sin, especially they who sin with delight and with love of sin; what they are pleased to do gives them pleasure. Whence also the apostle says, \"When ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.\"[fn-50-P5044_1991270:4-nf] Behold, they are shown to have been by no means able to serve sin except by another freedom. They are not, then, free from righteousness except by the choice of the will, but they do not become free from sin save by the grace of the Saviour. For which reason the admirable Teacher also distinguished these very words: \"For when ye were the servants,\" says he, \"of sin, ye were free from righteousness.

And the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-64-P6461_1077104:22-nf] \"At the end of the days He spoke to us in His Son, whom He made the heir of all things, 'through whom' also He made the ages,\" showing us that God made the ages through His Son, the\" through whom\" belonging, when the ages were being made, to the Only-begotten. Thus, if all things were made, as in this passage also, through the Logos, then they were not made by the Logos, but by a stronger and greater than He. And who else could this be but the Father? Now if, as we have seen, all things were made through Him, we have to enquire if the Holy Spirit also was made through Him. it appears to me that those who hold the Holy Spirit to be created, and who also admit that \"all things were made through Him,\" must necessarily assume that the Holy Spirit was made through the Logos, the Logos accordingly being older than He. And he who shrinks from allowing the Holy Spirit to have been made through Christ must, if he admits the truth of the statements of this Gospel, assume the Spirit to be uncreated. There is a third resource besides these two (that of allowing the Spirit to have been made by the Word, and that of regarding it as uncreated), namely, to assert that the Holy Spirit has no essence of His own beyond the Father and the Son. But on further thought one may perhaps see reason to consider that the Son is second beside the Father, He being the same as the Father, while manifestly a distinction is drawn between the Spirit and the Son in the passage,[fn-64-P6462_1078585:23-nf] \"Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man. it shall be forgiven him, but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, he shall not have forgiveness, either in this world or in the world to come.\" We consider, therefore, that there are three hypostases, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; and at the same thee we believe nothing to be uncreated but the Father. We therefore, as the more pious and the truer course, admit that all things were made by the Logos, and that the Holy Spirit is the most excellent and the first in order[fn-64-P6463_1079161:24-nf] of all that was made by the Father through Christ. And this, perhaps, is the reason why the Spirit is not said to be God's own Son. The Only-begotten only is by nature and from the beginning a Son, and the Holy Spirit seems to have need of the Son, to minister to Him His essence, so as to enable Him not only to exist, but to be wise and reasonable and just, and all that we must think of Him as being. All this He has by participation of the character of Christ, of which we have spoken above. And I consider that the Holy Spirit supplies to those who, through Him and through participation in Him, are called saints, the material of the gifts, which come from God; so that the said material of the gifts is made powerful by God, is ministered by Christ, and owes its actual existence in men to the Holy Spirit. I am led to this view of the charisms by the words of Paul which he writes somewhere,[fn-64-P6464_1080100:25-nf] \"There are diversities of gifts but the same Spirit, and diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord. And there are diversities of workings, but it is the same God that worketh all in all.\" The statement that all things were made by Him, and its seeming corollary, that the Spirit must have been called into being by the Word, may certainly raise some difficulty. There are some passages in which the Spirit is placed above Christ; in Isaiah, for example, Christ declares that He is sent, not by the Father only, but also by the Holy Spirit. \"Now the Lord hath sent Me,\" He says,[fn-64-P6465_1080706:26-nf] \"and His Spirit.\" and in the Gospel He declares that there is forgiveness for the sin committed against Himself, but that for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit there is no forgiveness, either in this age or in the age to come. What is the reason of this? Is it because the Holy Spirit is of more value than Christ that the sin against Him cannot be forgiven? May it not rather be that all rational beings have part in Christ, and that forgiveness is extended to them when they repent of their sins, while only those have part in the Holy Spirit who have been found worthy of it, and that there cannot well be any forgiveness for those who fall away to evil in spite of such great and powerful cooperation, and who defeat the counsels of the Spirit who is in them. When we find the Lord saying, as He does in Isaiah, that He is sent by the Father and by His Spirit, we have to point out here also that the Spirit is not originally superior to the Saviour, but that the Saviour takes a lower place than He in order to carry out the plan which has been made that the Son of God should become man. Should any one stumble at our saying that the Saviour in becoming man was made lower than the Holy Spirit, we ask him to consider the words used in the Epistle to the Hebrews,[fn-64-P6466_1081998:27-nf] where Jesus is shown by Paul to have been made less than the angels on account of the suffering of death. \"We behold Him,\" he says, \"who hath been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour.\" And this, too, has doubtless to be added, that the creation, in order to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and not least of all the human race, required the introduction into human nature of a happy and divine power, which should set right what was wrong upon the earth, and that this action fell to the share, as it were, of the Holy Spirit; but the Spirit, unable to support such a task, puts forward the Saviour as the only one able to endure such a conflict. The Father therefore, the principal, sends the Son, but the Holy Spirit also sends Him and directs Him to go before, promising to descend, when the thee comes, to the Son of God, and to work with Him for the salvation of men. This He did. when, in a bodily shape like a dove, He flew to Him after the baptism. He remained on Him, and did not pass Him by, as He might have done with men not able continuously to bear His glory. Thus John, when explaining how he knew who Christ was, spoke not only of the descent of the Spirit on Jesus, but also of its remaining upon him. For it is written that John said:[fn-64-P6467_1083348:28-nf] \"He who sent me to baptize said, On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit and with fire.\" It is not said only, \"On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending,\" for the Spirit no doubt descended on others too, but \"descending and abiding on Him.\" Our examination of this point has been somewhat extended, since we were anxious to make it clear that if all things were made by Him, then the Spirit also was made through the Word, and is seen to be one of the \"all things\" which are inferior to their Maker. This view is too firmly settled to be disturbed by a few words which may be adduced to the opposite effect. If any one should lend credence to the Gospel according to the Hebrews, where the Saviour Himself says, \"My mother, the Holy Spirit took me just now by one of my hairs and carried me off to the great mount Tabor,\" he will have to face the difficulty of explaining how the Holy Spirit can be the mother of Christ when it was itself brought into existence through the Word. But neither the passage nor this difficulty is hard to explain. For if he who does the will of the Father in heaven[fn-64-P6468_1084554:29-nf] is Christ's brother and sister and mother, and if the name of brother of Christ may be applied, not only to the race of men, but to beings of diviner rank than they, then there is nothing absurd in the Holy Spirit's being His mother, every one being His mother who does the will of the Father in heaven.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":32,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"All things were made through Him.\" The \"through[fn-64-P6459_1076059:20-nf] whom \"is never found in the first place but always in the second, as in the Epistle to the Romans,[fn-64-P6460_1076192:21-nf] \"Paul a servant of Christ Jesus, a called Apostle, separated to the Gospel of God which He promised before by His prophets in Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh, deter mined the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we received grace and apostleship, for obedience of the faith among all the nations, for His name's sake.\" For God promised aforehand by the prophets His own Gospel, the prophets being His ministers, and having their word to speak about Him \"through whom.\" And again God gave grace and apostleship to Paul and to the others for the obedience of the faith among all the nations, and this He gave them through Jesus Christ the Saviour, for the \"through whom\" belonged to Him.

The \"whither\" is quite plain on the face of the story; he was sent to Israel, and to those who were willing to hear him when he was staying in the wilderness of Judaea and baptizing by the banks of the Jordan. According to the deeper sense, however, he was sent into the world, the world being understood as this earthly place where men are; and the careful student will have this in view in enquiring from where John was sent. Examining the words more closely, he will perhaps declare that as it is written of Adam,[fn-65-P6584_1132489:90-nf] \"And the Lord sent him forth out of the Paradise of pleasure to till the earth, out of which he was taken,\" so also John was sent, either from heaven or from Paradise, or from some other quarter to this place on the earth. He was sent that he might bear witness of the light. There is, however, an objection to this interpretation, which is not to be lightly dismissed. It is written in Isaiah:[fn-65-P6585_1132902:91-nf] \"Whom shall I send, and who will go to the people? \"The prophet answers: \"Here am I,-send me.\" He, then, who objects to that rendering of our passage which appears to be the deeper may say that Isaiah was sent not to this world from another place, but after having seen \"the Lord sitting on a throne high and lifted up,\" was sent to the people, to say, \"Hearing, ye shall hear and shall not understand,\" and so on; and that in the same manner John, the beginning of his mission not being narrated, is sent after the analogy of the mission of Isaiah, to baptize,[fn-65-P6586_1133480:92-nf] and to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for Him, and to bear witness of the light. So much we have said of the first sense; and now we adduce certain solutions which help to confirm the deeper meaning about John. In the same passage it is added, \"He came for witness, to bear witness of the light.\" Now, if he came, where did he come from? To those who find it difficult to follow us, we point to what John says afterwards of having seen the Holy Spirit as a dove descending on the Saviour. \"He that sent me,\" he says,[fn-65-P6587_1134025:93-nf] \"to baptize with water, He said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shall see the Holy Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit and with fire.\" When did He send him and give him this injunction? The answer to titlE question will probably be that when He sent him to begin to baptize, then He who was dealing with him uttered this word. But a more convincing argument for the view that John was sent from another region when he entered into the body, the one object of his entry into this life being that he should bear witness of the truth, may be drawn from the narrative of his birth. Gabriel, when announcing to Zacharias the birth of John, and to Mary the advent of our Saviour among men, says:[fn-65-P6588_1134785:94-nf] That John is to be \"filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb.\" And we have also the saying, \"For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.\" He who sedulously guards himself in his dealings with Scripture against forced, or casual, or capricious procedure, must necessarily assume that John's soul was older than his body, and subsisted by itself before it was sent on the ministry of the witness of the light. Nor must we overlook the text, \"This is Elijah which is to come.\"[fn-65-P6589_1135353:95-nf] For if that general doctrine of the soul is to be received, namely, that it is not sown at the same time with the body, but is before it, and is then, for various causes, clothed with flesh and blood; then the words \"sent from God\" will not appear to be applicable to John alone. The most evil of all, the man of sin, the son of perdition, is said by Paul to be sent by God:[fn-65-P6590_1135747:96-nf] \"God sendeth them a working of error that they should believe a lie; that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\" But our present question may, perhaps, be solved in this way, that as every man is a man of God, simply because God created him, but not every man is called a man of God, but only he who has devoted himself to God, such as Elijah and those who are called men of God in the Scriptures, thus every man might be said in ordinary language to be sent from God, but in the absolute sense no one is to be spoken of in this way who has not entered this life for a divine ministry and in the service of the salvation of mankind. We do not find it said of any one but the saints that he is sent by God. It is said of Isaiah as we showed before; it is also said of Jeremiah, \"To whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go\";[fn-65-P6591_1136651:97-nf] and it is said of Ezekiel,[fn-65-P6592_1136694:98-nf] \"I send thee to nations that are rebellious and have not believed in Me.\" The examples, however, do not expressly speak era mission from the region outside life into life, and as it is a mission into life that we are enquiring about, they may seem to have little bearing on our subject.

Then they say: If Moses is believed on account of his word and his works, and has no need of any witnesses to announce him beforehand, and if the prophets were received, every one of them, by these people, as messengers from God, how should not one who is much greater than Moses and the prophets accomplish His mission and benefit the human race, without prophets to bear witness about Him? They regard it as superfluous that He should have been foretold by the prophets, since the prophets were concerned, as these opponents would say, that those who believed in Christ should not receive Him as a new God, and therefore did what they could to bring them to that same God whom Moses and the prophets taught before Jesus. To this we must say that as there are many causes which may lead men to believe, since men who are not moved by one argument may be by another, so God is able to provide for men a number of occasions, any of which may cause their minds to open to the truth that God, who is over all, has taken on Himself human nature. It is manifest to all, how some are brought by the prophetic writings to the admiration of Christ. They are astounded at the voices of so many prophets before Him, which establish the place of His birth, the country of His upbringing, the power of His teaching, His working of wonderful works, and His human passion brought to a close by His resurrection. We must notice, too, that Christ's stupendous acts of power were able to bring to the faith those of Christ's own time, but that they lost their demonstrative force with the lapse of years and began to be regarded as mythical. Greater evidential value than that of the miracles then performed attaches to the comparison which we now make between these miracles and the prophecy of them; this makes it impossible for the student to cast any doubt on the former. The prophetic testimonies do not declare merely the advent of the Messiah; it is by no means the case that they teach this and nothing else. They teach a great deal of theology. The relation of the Father to the Son and of the Son to the Father may be learned not less from what the prophets announce about Christ, than from the Apostles narrating the splendours of the Son of God. A parallel case, which we may venture to adduce, is that of the martyrs, who were honoured by the witness they bore Him, and by no means conferred any favour on Him by their witnessing for the Son of God. And how is it if, as many of Christ's true disciples were honoured by having thus to witness for Him, so the prophets received from God as their special gift that of understanding about Christ and announcing Him before, and that they taught not only those living after Christ's advent how they should regard the Son of God, but those also who lived in the generations before Him? As he who in these times does not know the Son has not the Father either,[fn-66-P6610_1148110:104-nf] so also we are to understand it was in these earlier times. Hence \"Abraham rejoiced to see the day of Christ, and he saw it and was glad.\"[fn-66-P6611_1148271:105-nf] He, therefore, who declares that they are not to testify about Christ is seeking to deprive the chorus of the prophets of the greatest gift they have; for what office of equal importance would be left to prophecy, inspired as it is by the Holy Spirit, if all connection with the economy of our Lord and Master were taken away from it? For as these have their faith well ordered who approach the God of the universe through Mediator and High-Priest and Paraclete, and as his religion is a halting one who does not go in through the door to the Father, so also in the case of men of old time. Their religion was sanctified and made acceptable to God by their knowledge and faith and expectation of Christ. For we have observed that God declares Himself to be a witness and exhorts them all to declare the same about Christ, and to be imitators of Him, bearing witness of Him to all who require it. For he says,[fn-66-P6612_1149202:106-nf] \"Be witnesses for Me, and I am witness, saith the Lord God, and My servant whom I have chosen.\" Now every one who bears witness to the truth, whether he support it by words or deeds, or in whatever way, may properly be called a witness (martyr); but it has come to be the custom of the brotherhood, since they are struck with admiration of those who have contended to the death for truth and valour, to keep the name of martyr more properly for those who have borne witness to the mystery of godliness by shedding their blood for it. The Saviour gives the name of martyr to every one who bears witness to the truth He declares; thus at the Ascension He says to His disciples:[fn-66-P6613_1149901:107-nf] \"You shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judaea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth.\" The leper who was cleansed[fn-66-P6614_1150059:108-nf] had still to bring the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony to those who did not believe in the Christ. In the same way the martyrs bear witness for a testimony to the unbelieving, and so do all the saints whose deeds shine before men. They spend their life rejoicing in the cross of Christ and bearing witness to the true light.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_126_oration_on_the_psalms_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"ANF-06","text":"III.

But when thou hearest me say the city, understand the ancient and disorderly multitude of the synagogue.

For who hath known the mind of the Lord[fn-29-P2927_1970992:12-nf] ?\" But seeing on the other hand that that Apostle declares it to be a peculiarity of him that is spiritual to \"judge all things[fn-29-P2928_1971151:13-nf] ,\" and commends those who have been \"enriched[fn-29-P2929_1971217:14-nf] \" by the Divine grace \"in all utterance and in all knowledge,\" I venture to assert that it is not right to omit the examination which is within the range of our ability, nor to leave the question here raised without making any inquiries, or having any ideas about it; lest, like the actual subject of our proposed discussion, this essay should have an ineffectual ending, spoilt before its maturity by the fatal indolence of those who will not nerve themselves to search out the truth, like a new-born infant ere it sees the light and acquires any strength. I assert, too, that it is not well at once to confront and meet objections, as if we were pleading in court, but to introduce a certain order into the discussion and to lead the view on from one point to another. What, then, should this order be? First, we want to know the whence of human nature, and the wherefore of its ever having come into existence. If we hit the answer to these questions, we shall not fail in getting the required explanation. Now, that everything that exists, after God, in the intellectual or sensible world of beings owes that existence to Him, is a proposition which it is superfluous to prove; no one, with however little insight into the truth of things, would gainsay it. For every one agrees that the Universe is linked to one First Cause; that nothing in it owes its existence to itself, so as to be its own origin and cause; but that there is on the other hand a single uncreate eternal Essence, the same for ever, which transcends all our ideas of distance, conceived of as without increase or decrease, and beyond the scope of any definition; and that time and space with all their consequences, and anything previous to these that thought can grasp in the intelligible supramundane world, are all the productions of this Essence. Well, then, we affirm that human nature is one of these productions; and a word of the inspired Teaching helps us in this, which declares that when God had brought all things else upon the scene of life, man was exhibited upon the earth, a mixture from Divine sources, the godlike intellectual essence being in him united with the several portions of earthly elements contributed towards his formation, and that he was fashioned by his Maker to be the incarnate likeness of Divine transcendent Power. It would be better however to quote the very words: \"And God created man, in the image of God created He him[fn-29-P2930_1973672:15-nf] .\" Now the reason of the making of this animate being has been given by certain writers previous to us as follows. The whole creation is divided into two parts; that \"which is seen,\" and that \"which is not seen,\" to use the Apostle's words (the second meaning the intelligible and immaterial, the first, the sensible and material); and being thus divided, the angelic and spiritual natures, which are among \"the things not seen,\" reside in places above the world, and above the heavens, because such a residence is in correspondence with their constitution; for an intellectual nature is a fine, clear, unencumbered, agile kind of thing, and a heavenly body is fine and light, and perpetually moving, and the earth on the contrary, which stands last in the list of things sensible, can never be an adequate and congenial spot for creatures intellectual to sojourn in. For what correspondence can there possibly be between that which is light and buoyant, on the one hand, and that which is heavy and gravitating on the other? Well, in order that the earth may not be completely devoid of the local indwelling of the intellectual and the immaterial, man (these writers tell us) was fashioned by the Supreme forethought, and his earthy parts moulded over the intellectual and godlike essence of his soul; and so this amalgamation with that which has material weight enables the soul to live on this element of earth, which possesses a certain bond of kindred with the substance of the flesh. The design of all that is being born[fn-29-P2931_1975216:16-nf] , then, is that the Power which is above both the heavenly and the earthly universe may in all parts of the creation be glorified by means of intellectual natures, conspiring to the same end by virtue of the same faculty in operation in all, I mean that of looking upon God. But this operation of looking upon God is nothing less than the life-nourishment appropriate, as like to like, to an intellectual nature. For just as these bodies, earthy as they are, are preserved by nourishment that is earthy, and we detect in them all alike, whether brute or reasoning, the operations of a material kind of vitality, so it is right to assume that there is an intellectual life-nourishment as well, by which such natures[fn-29-P2932_1976033:17-nf] are maintained in existence. But if bodily food, coming and going as it does in circulation, nevertheless imparts a certain amount of vital energy to those who get it, how much more does the partaking of the real thing, always remaining and always the same, preserve the eater in existence? If, then, this is the life-nourishment of an intellectual nature, namely, to have a part in God, this part will not be gained by that which is of an opposite quality; the would-be partaker must? some degree be akin to that which is to be partaken of. The eye enjoys the light by virtue of having light within itself to seize its kindred light, and the finger or any other limb cannot effect the act of vision because none of this natural light is organized in any of them. The same necessity requires that in our partaking of God there should be some kinship in the constitution of the partaker with that which is partaken of. Therefore, as the Scripture says, man was made in the image of God; that like, I take it, might be able to see like; and to see God is, as was said above, the life of the soul. But seeing that ignorance of the true good is like a mist that obscures the visual keenness of the soul, and that when that mist grows denser a cloud is formed so thick that Truth's ray cannot pierce through these depths of ignorance, it follows further that with the total deprivation of the light the soul's life ceases altogether; for we have said that the real life of the soul is acted out in partaking of the Good; but when ignorance hinders this apprehension of God, the soul which thus ceases to partake of God, ceases also to live. But no one can force us to give the family history[fn-29-P2933_1978013:18-nf] of this ignorance, asking whence and from what father it is; let him be given to understand from the word itself that \"ignorance\" and \"knowledge\" indicate one of the relations of the soul;[fn-29-P2934_1978220:19-nf] but no relation, whether expressed or not, conveys the idea of substance; a relation and a substance are quite of different descriptions. If, then, knowledge is not a substance, but a perfected[fn-29-P2935_1978452:20-nf] operation of the soul, it must be conceded that ignorance must be much farther removed still from anything in the way of substance; but that which is not in that way does not exist at all; and so it would be useless to trouble ourselves about where it comes from. Now seeing that the Word[fn-29-P2936_1978836:21-nf] declares that the living in God is the life of the soul, and seeing that this living is knowledge according to each man's ability, and that ignorance does not imply the reality of anything, but is only the negation of the operation of knowing, and seeing that upon this partaking in God being no longer effected there follows at once the cancelling of the soul's life, which is the worst of evils,-because of all this the Producer of all Good would work in us the cure of such an evil. A cure is a good thing, but one who does not look to the evangelic mystery would still be ignorant of the manner of the cure. We have shown that alienation from God, Who is the Life, is an evil; the cure, then, of this infirmity is, again to be made friends with God, and so to be in life once more. When such a life, then, is always held up in hope before humanity, it cannot be said that the winning of this life is absolutely a reward of a good life, and that the contrary is a punishment (of a bad one); but what we insist on resembles the case of the eyes. We do not say that one who has clear eyesight is rewarded as with a prize by being able to perceive the objects of sight; nor on the other hand that he who has diseased eyes experiences a failure of optic activity as the result of some penal sentence. With the eye in a natural state sight follows necessarily; with it vitiated by disease failure of sight as necessarily follows. In the same way the life of blessedness is as a familiar second nature to those who have kept clear the senses of the soul; but when the blinding stream of ignorance prevents our partaking in the real light, then it necessarily follows that we miss that, the enjoyment of which we declare to be the life of the partaker.","title":"On Infants' Early Deaths","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_41_the_epistle_of_barnabas","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"ANF-01","text":"When, therefore, He has fulfilled the commandment, what saith He? \"Who is he that will contend with Me? let him oppose Me: or who is he that will enter into judgment with Me? let him draw near to the servant of the Lord.\"[fn-32-P3200_538882:50-nf] \"Woe unto you, for ye shall all wax old, like a garment, and the moth shall eat you up.\"[fn-32-P3201_538987:51-nf] And again the prophet says, \"Since[fn-32-P3202_539038:52-nf] as a mighty stone He is laid for crushing, behold I cast down for the foundations of Zion a stone, precious, elect, a corner-stone, honourable.\" Next, what says He? \"And he who shall trust[fn-32-P3203_539295:53-nf] in it shall live for ever.\" Is our hope, then, upon a stone?

The heretics, therefore, challenged us to use our rhetoric no less than our philosophy. Respecting, then, this frail and poor, worthless body, which they do not indeed hesitate to call evil, even if it had been the work of angels, as Menander and Marcus are pleased to think, or the formation of some fiery being, an angel, as Apelles teaches, it would be quite enough for securing respect for the body, that it had the support and protection of even a secondary deity. The angels, we know, rank next to God. Now, whatever be the supreme God of each heretic, I should not unfairly derive the dignity of the flesh likewise from Him to whom was present the will for its production. For, of course, if He had not willed its production, He would have prohibited it, when He knew it was in progress. It follows, then, that even on their principle the flesh is equally the work of God. There is no work but belongs to Him who has permitted it to exist. It is indeed a happy circumstance, that most of their doctrines, including even the harshest, accord to our God the entire formation of man. How mighty He is, you know full well who believe that He is the only God. Let, then, the flesh begin to give you pleasure, since the Creator thereof is so great. But, you say, even the world is the work of God, and yet \"the fashion of this world passeth away,\"[fn-97-P9727_2669331:33-nf] as the apostle himself testifies; nor must it be predetermined that the world will be restored, simply because it is the work of God. And surely if the universe, after its ruin, is not to be formed again, why should a portion of it be? You are right, if a portion is on an equality with the whole. But we maintain that there is a difference. In the first place, because all things were made by the Word of God, and without Him was nothing made.[fn-97-P9728_2669797:34-nf] Now the flesh, too, had its existence from the Word of God, because of the principle,[fn-97-P9729_2669899:35-nf] that here should be nothing without that Word. \"Let us make man,\"[fn-97-P9730_2669978:36-nf] said He, before He created him, and added, \"with our hand,\" for the sake of his pre-eminence, that so he might not be compared with the rest of creation.[fn-97-P9731_2670149:37-nf] And \"God,\" says (the Scripture), \"formed man.\"[fn-97-P9732_2670215:38-nf] There is undoubtedly a great difference in the procedure, springing of course from the nature of the case. For the creatures which were made were inferior to him for whom they were made; and they were made for man, to whom they were afterwards made subject by God. Rightly, therefore, had the creatures which were thus intended for subjection, come forth into being at the bidding and command and sole power of the divine voice; whilst man, on the contrary, destined to be their lord, was formed by God Himself, to the intent that he might be able to exercise his mastery, being created by the Master the Lord Himself. Remember, too, that man is properly called flesh, which had a prior occupation in man's designation: \"And God formed man the clay of the ground.\"[fn-97-P9733_2670997:39-nf] He now became man, who was hitherto clay. \"And He breathed upon his face the breath of life, and man (that is, the clay) became a living soul; and God placed the man whom He had formed in the garden.\"[fn-97-P9734_2671231:40-nf] So that man was clay at first, and only afterwards man entire. I wish to impress this on your attention, with a view to your knowing, that whatever God has at all purposed or promised to man, is due not to the soul simply, but to the flesh also; if not arising out of any community in their origin, yet at all events by the privilege possessed by the latter in its name.[fn-97-P9735_2671622:41-nf] ","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":39,"source_paragraph":"141","folder":"ANF-03","text":"He says, it is true, that \"the flesh profiteth nothing; \"[fn-100-P10032_2787133:242-nf] but then, as in the former case, the meaning must be regulated by the subject which is spoken of. Now, because they thought His discourse was harsh and intolerable, supposing that He had really and literally enjoined on them to eat his flesh, He, with the view of ordering the state of salvation as a spiritual thing, set out with the principle, \"It is the spirit that quickeneth; \"and then added, \"The flesh profiteth nothing,\"-meaning, of course, to the giving of life. He also goes on to explain what He would have us to understand by spirit: \"The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.\" In a like sense He had previously said: \"He that heareth my words, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but shall pass from death unto life.\"[fn-100-P10033_2787971:243-nf] Constituting, therefore, His word as the life-giving principle, because that word is spirit and life, He likewise called His flesh by the same appellation; because, too, the Word had become flesh,[fn-100-P10034_2788187:244-nf] we ought therefore to desire Him in order that we may have life, and to devour Him with the ear, and to ruminate on Him with the understanding, and to digest Him by faith.

As if there might not reasonably enough be something which, although it\" profiteth nothing\" itself, might yet be capable of being profited by something else. The spirit \"profiteth,\" for it imparts life. The flesh profiteth nothing, for it is subject to death. Therefore He has rather put the two propositions in a way which favours our belief: for by showing what \"profits,\" and what \"does not profit,\" He has likewise thrown light on the object which receives as well as the subject which gives the \"profit.\" Thus, in the present instance, we have the Spirit giving life to the flesh which has been subdued by death; for \"the hour,\" says He, \"is coming, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.\"[fn-100-P10037_2789677:247-nf] Now, what is \"the dead\" but the flesh? and what is \"the voice of God\" but the Word? and what is the Word but the Spirit,[fn-100-P10038_2789817:248-nf] who shall justly raise the flesh which He had once Himself become, and that too from death, which He Himself suffered, and from the grave, which He Himself once entered? Then again, when He says, \"Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and shall come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation,\"[fn-100-P10039_2790365:249-nf] -none will after such words be able to interpret the dead \"that are in the graves\" as any other than the bodies of the flesh, because the graves themselves are nothing but the resting-place of corpses: for it is incontestable that even those who partake of \"the old man,\" that is to say, sinful men-in other words, those who are dead through their ignorance of God (whom our heretics, forsooth, foolishly insist on understanding by the word \"graves\"[fn-100-P10040_2790838:250-nf] )-are plainly here spoken of as having to come from their graves for judgment.

These pertain to the old testament, which genders to bondage; because carnal fear and desire make them servants, gospel faith and hope and love do not make them children. But they who are placed under grace, whom the Spirit quickens, do these things of faith which worketh by love in the hope of good things, not carnal but spiritual, not earthly but heavenly, not temporal but eternal; especially believing on the Mediator, by whom they do not doubt but that a Spirit of grace is ministered to them, so that they may do these things well, and that they may be pardoned when they sin.

Therefore the faith is the same as well in those who, although not yet in name, were in fact previously Christians, as in those who not only are so but are also called so; and in both there is the same grace by the Holy Spirit.

Perhaps He took this way of giving importance and honor to both the sexes which He had created, taking the form of a man, and being born of a woman; or there may have been some other reason, we cannot tell.

For if our argument has proved that the gods of the poets are no gods, and has convicted of error those that deify creation, and in general has shewn that the idolatry of the heathen is godlessness and impiety, it strictly follows from the elimination of these that the true religion is with us, and that the God we worship and preach is the only true One, Who is Lord of Creation and Maker of all existence. 2. Who then is this, save the Father of Christ, most holy and above all created existence[fn-17-P1759_640895:9-nf] , Who like an excellent pilot, by His own Wisdom and His own Word, our Lord and Saviour Christ, steers and preserves and orders all things, and does as seems to Him best? But that is best which has been done, and which we see taking place, since that is what He wills; and this a man can hardly refuse to believe. 3. For if the movement of creation were irrational, and the universe were borne along without plan, a man might fairly disbelieve what we say. But if it subsist in reason and wisdom and skill, and is perfectly ordered throughout, it follows that He that is over it and has ordered it is none other than the [reason or] Word of God. 4.

But the reason why the Word, the Word of God, has united Himself[fn-17-P1768_644161:15-nf] with created things is truly wonderful, and teaches us that the present order of things is none otherwise than is fitting. For the nature of created things, inasmuch as it is brought into being out of nothing, is of a fleeting sort, and weak and mortal, if composed of itself only.

By reason of Him and His power, fire does not fight with cold nor wet with dry, but principles mutually opposed, as if friendly and brotherly combine together, and give life to the things we see, and form the principles by which bodies exist.

The first begins with \"This was He of whom I said, He that cometh after me,\" and goes down to \"The only-begotten Son of God who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared him.\" Heracleon supposes the words, \"No one has seen God at any time,\" etc., to have been spoken, not by the Baptist, but by the disciple. But in this he is not sound. He himself allows the words, \"Of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace; for the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,\" to have been spoken by the Baptist. And does it not follow that the person who received of the fulness of Christ, and a second grace in addition to that he had before, and who declared the law to have been given by Moses, but grace and truth to have come through Jesus Christ, is it not clear that this is the person who understood, from what he received from the fulness of Christ, how \"no one hath seen God at any time,\" and how \"the only-begotten who is in the bosom of the Father\" had delivered the declaration about God to him and to all those who had received of His fulness? He was not declaring here for the first time Him that is in the bosom of the Father, as if there had never before been any one fit to receive what he told His Apostles. Does he not teach us that he was before Abraham, and that Abraham rejoiced and was glad to see his day? The words \"Of his fulness all we received,\" and \"Grace for grace,\" show, as we have already made clear, that the prophets also received their gift from the fulness of Christ and received a second grace in place of that they had before; for they also, led by the Spirit, advanced from the introduction they had in types to the vision of truth. Hence not all the prophets, but many of them,[fn-67-P6703_1183785:7-nf] desired to see the things, which the Apostles saw. For if there was a difference among the prophets, those who were perfect and more distinguished of them did not desire to see what the Apostles saw, but actually beheld them, while those who rose less fully than these to the height of the Word were filled with longing for the things which the Apostles knew through Christ. The word \"saw\" we have not taken in a physical sense, and the word \"heard\" we have taken to refer to a spiritual communication; only he who has ears is prepared to hear the words of Jesus-a thing which does not happen too frequently. There is the further point, that the saints before the bodily advent of Jesus had an advantage over most believers in their insight into the mysteries of divinity, since the Word of God was their teacher before He became flesh, for He was always working , in imitation of His Father, of whom He says, \"My father worketh hitherto.\" On this point we may adduce the words He addresses to the Sadducees, who do not believe the doctrine of the resurrection. \"Have you not read,\" He says,[fn-67-P6704_1184897:8-nf] \"what is said by God at the Bush, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\" If, then, God is not ashamed to be called the God of these men, and if they are counted by Christ among the living, and if all believers are sons of Abraham,[fn-67-P6705_1185225:9-nf] since all the Gentiles are blessed with faithful Abraham, who is appointed by God to be a father of the Gentiles, can we hesitate to admit that those living persons made acquaintance with the learning of living men, and were taught by Christ who was born before the daystar,[fn-67-P6706_1185517:10-nf] before He became flesh? And for this cause they lived, because they had part in Him who said, \"I am the life,\" and as the heirs of so great promises received the vision, not only of angels, but of God in Christ. For they saw, it may be, the image of the invisible God,[fn-67-P6707_1185802:11-nf] since he who hath seen the Son hath seen the Father, and so they are recorded to have known God, and to have heard God's words worthily, and, therefore, to have seen God and heard Him. Now, I consider that those who are fully and really sons of Abraham are sons of his actions, spiritually understood, and of the knowledge which was made manifest to him. What he knew and what he did appears again in those who are his sons, as the Scripture teaches those who have ears to hear,[fn-67-P6708_1186315:12-nf] \"If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham.\" And if it is a true proverb[fn-67-P6709_1186435:13-nf] which says, \"A wise man will understand that which proceeds from his own mouth, and on his lips he will bear prudence,\" then we must at once repudiate some things which have been said about the prophets, as if they were not wise men, and did not understand what proceeded from their own mouths. We must believe what is good and true about the prophets, that they were sages, that they did understand what proceeded from their mouths, and that they bore prudence on their lips. It is clear indeed that Moses understood in his mind the truth (real meaning) of the law, and the higher interpretations of the stories recorded in his books. Joshua, too, understood the meaning of the allotment of the land after the destruction of the nine and twenty kings, and could see better than we can the realities of which his achievements were the shadows. It is clear, too, that Isaiah saw the mystery of Him who sat upon the throne, and of the two seraphim, and of the veiling of their faces and their feet, and of their wings, and of the altar and of the tongs. Ezekiel, too, understood the true significance of the cherubim and of their goings, and of the firmament that was above them, and of Him that sat on the throne, than all which what could be loftier or more splendid? I need not enter into more particulars; the point I aim at establishing is clear enough already, namely, that those who were made perfect in earlier generations knew not less than the Apostles did of what Christ revealed to them, since the same teacher was with them as He who revealed to the Apostles the unspeakable mysteries of godliness. I will add but a few points, and then leave it to the reader to judge and to form what views he pleases on this subject. Paul says in his Epistle to the Romans,[fn-67-P6710_1188226:14-nf] \"Now, to him who is able to establish you according to my Gospel, according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal, but is now made manifest by the prophetic Scriptures and the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" For if the mystery concealed of old is made manifest to the Apostles through the prophetic writings, and if the prophets, being wise men, understood what proceeded from their own mouths, then the prophets knew what was made manifest to the Apostles. But to many it was not revealed, as Paul says,[fn-67-P6711_1188800:15-nf] \"In other generations it was not made known to the sons of men as it hath now been revealed unto His holy Apostles and prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs and members of the same body.\" Here an objection may be raised by those who do not share the view we have propounded; and it becomes of importance to define what is meant by the word \"revealed.\" It is capable of two meanings: firstly, that the thing in question is understood, but secondly, if a prophecy is spoken of, that it is accomplished. Now, the fact that the Gentiles were to be fellow-heirs and members of the same body, and partakers of the promise, was known to the prophets to this extent, that they knew the Gentiles were to fellow-heirs and members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ. When this should be, and why, and what Gentiles were spoken of, and how, though strangers from the covenants. and aliens to the promises, they were yet to be members of one body and sharers of the blessings; all this was known to the prophets, being revealed to them. But the things prophesied belong to the future, and are not revealed to those who know them, but do not witness their fulfilment, as they are to those who have the event before their eyes. And this was the position of the Apostles. Thus, I conceive. they knew the events no more than the fathers and the prophets did; and yet it is truly said of them that \"what to other generations was not revealed was now revealed to the Apostles and prophets, that the Gentiles were fellow-heirs and members of the same body, and partakers in the promise of Christ.\" For, in addition to knowing these mysteries, they saw the power at work in the accomplished fact. The passage, \"Many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things ye see and did not see them; and to hear the things ye hear and did not hear them,\" may be interpreted in the same way. They also desired to see the mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God, and of His coming down to carry out the design of His suffering for the salvation of many, actually put in operation. This may be illustrated from another quarter. Suppose one of the Apostles to have understood the \"unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,\"[fn-67-P6712_1191085:16-nf] but not to witness the glorious bodily appearing of Jesus to the faithful. which is promised, although He desired to see it and suppose another had not only not[fn-67-P6713_1191266:17-nf] marked and seen what that Apostle marked and saw, but had a much feebler grasp of the divine hope, and yet is present at the second coming of our Saviour, which the Apostle, as in the parallel above, had desired, but had not seen. We shall not err from the truth if we say that both of these have seen what the Apostle, or indeed the Apostles, desired to see, and yet that they are not on that account to be deemed wiser or more blessed than the Apostles. In the same way, also, the Apostles are not to be deemed wiser than the fathers, or than Moses and the prophets, than those in fact who, for their virtue, were found worthy of epiphanies and ofdivine manifestations and of revelations of mysteries.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Now let us consider John's second testimony.

In all these answers John's second testimony to Christ was not yet completed; he had still to give his questioners the answer they were to take back to those who sent them, and to declare himself in the terms of the prophecy of Isaiah, which says, \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.\"","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":25,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Here the enquiry suggests itself whether the second testimony is concluded, and whether there is a third, addressed to those who were sent from the Pharisees.

As far as the words allow me to conjecture I should say that the word to the emissaries of the Pharisees was a third testimony. It is to be observed, however, that the first testimony asserts the divinity of the Saviour, while the second disposes of the suspicion of those who were in doubt whether John could be the Christ, and the third declares one who was already present with men although they saw Him not, and whose coming was no longer in the future. Before going on to the subsequent testimonies in which he points out Christ and witnesses to Him, let us look at the second and third, word for word, and let us, in the first place, observe that there are two embassies to the Baptist, one \"from Jerusalem\" from the Jews, who send priests and levites, to ask him, \"Who art thou? \"the second sent by the Pharisees,[fn-67-P6735_1201394:30-nf] who were in doubt about the answer which had been made to the priests and levites.

What sayest thou of thyself? \"There is nothing harsh or arrogant in the enquiries of these men; everything agrees well with the character of true and careful servants of God; and they raise no difficulties about the replies made to them. Those, on the contrary, who are sent from the Pharisees assail the Baptist, as it were, with arrogant and unsympathetic words: \"Why then baptizest thou if thou be not the Christ nor Elijah nor the prophet? \"This mission is sent scarcely for the sake of information, as in the former case of the priests and levites, but rather to debar the Baptist from baptizing, as if it were thought that no one was entitled to baptize but Christ and Elijah and the prophet. The student who desires to understand the Scripture must always proceed in this careful way; he must ask with regard to each speech, who is the speaker and on what occasion it was spoken. Thus only can we discern how speech harmonizes with the character of the speaker, as it does all through the sacred books.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Then the Jews sent priests and levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou And he confessed and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.[fn-67-P6739_1203011:31-nf] What legates should have been sent from the Jews to John, and where should they have been sent from? Should they not have been men held to stand by the election of God above their fellows, and should they not have come from that place which was chosen out of the whole of the earth, though it is all called good, from Jerusalem where was the temple of God? With such honour, then, do they enquire of John. In the case of Christ nothing of this sort is reported to have been done by the Jews; but what the Jews do to John, John does to Christ, sending his own disciples to ask him,[fn-67-P6740_1203613:32-nf] \"Art thou He that should come, or do we look for another? \"John confesses to those sent to him, and denies not, and he afterwards declares, \"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness; \"but Christ, as having a greater testimony than John the Baptist, makes His answer by words and deeds, saying. \"Go and tell John those things which ye do hear and see; the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the poor have the Gospel preached to them.\" On this passage I shall, if God permit, enlarge in its proper place. Here, however, it might be asked reasonably enough why John gives such an answer to the question put to him. The priests and levites do not ask him, \"Art thou the Christ? \"but \"Who art thou? \"and the Baptist's reply to this question should have been, \"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness.\" The proper reply to the question, \"Art thou the Christ? \"is, \"I am not the Christ; \"and to the question, \"Who art thou? \"-\"The voice of one crying in the wilderness.\" To this we may say that he probably discerned in the question of the priests and levites a cautious reverence, which led them to hint the idea in their minds that he who was baptizing might be the Christ, but withheld them from openly saying so, which might have been presumptuous. He quite naturally, therefore, proceeds in the first place to remove any false impressions they might have taken up about him, and declares publicly the true state of the matter, \"I am not the Christ.\" Their second question, and also their third, show that they had conceived some such surmise about him. They supposed that he might be that second in honour to whom their hopes pointed, namely, Elijah, who held with them the next position after Christ; and so when John had answered, \"I am not the Christ,\" they asked, \"What then? Art thou Elijah? \"And he said, \"I am not.\" They wish to know, in the third place, if he is the prophet, and on his answer,\" No,\" they have no longer any name to give the personage whose advent they expected, and they say, \"Who art thou, then, that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? \"Their meaning is: \"You are not, you say, any of those personages whose advent Israel hopes and expects, and who you are, to baptize as you do, we do not know; tell us, therefore, so that we may report to those who sent us to get light ripen this point.\" We add, as it has some bearing on the context, that the people were moved by the thought that the period of Christ's advent was near. It was in a manner imminent in the years from the birth of Jesus and a little before, down to the publication of the preaching. Hence it was, in all likelihood, that as the scribes and lawyers had deduced the time from Holy Scripture and were expecting the Coming One, the idea was taken up by Theudas, who came forward as the Messiah and brought together a considerable multitude, and after him by the famous Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing.[fn-67-P6741_1206645:33-nf] Thus the coming of the Messiah was more warmly expected and discussed, and it was natural enough for the Jews to send priests and levites from Jerusalem to John, to ask him, \"Who art thou? \"and learn if he professed to be the Christ.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"53","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"And[fn-67-P6745_1207006:34-nf] they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? and he said, I am not.\" No one can fail to remember in this connection what Jesus says of John,[fn-67-P6746_1207163:35-nf] \"If ye will receive it, this is Elijah which is to come.\" How, then, does John come to say to those who ask him, \"Art thou Elijah? \"-\"I am not.\" And how can it be true at the same time that John is Elijah who is to come, according to the words of Malachi,[fn-67-P6747_1207438:36-nf] \"And behold I send unto you Elijah the Tishbite, before the great and notable day of the Lord come, who shall restore the heart of the father to the Sod, and the heart of a man to his neighbour, lest I come, and utterly smite the earth.\" The words of the angel of the Lord, too, who appeared to Zacharias, as he stood at the right hand of the altar of incense, are somewhat to the same effect as the prophecy of Malachi: \"And[fn-67-P6748_1207884:37-nf] thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.\" And a little further on:[fn-67-P6749_1208004:38-nf] \"And he shall go before His face in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for Him.\" As for the first point, one might say that John did not know that he was Elijah. This will be the explanation of those who find in our passage a support for their doctrine of transcorporation, as if the soul clothed itself in a fresh body and did not quite remember its former lives. These thinkers will also point out that some of the Jews assented to this doctrine when they spoke about the Saviour as if He was one of the old prophets, and had risen not from the tomb but from His birth. His mother Mary was well known, and Joseph the carpenter was supposed to be His father, add it could readily be supposed that He was one of the old prophets risen from the dead. The same person will adduce the text in Genesis.[fn-67-P6750_1208959:39-nf] \"I will destroy the whole resurrection,\" and will thereby reduce those who give themselves to finding in Scripture solutions of false probabilities to a great difficulty in respect of this doctrine. Another, however, a churchman, who repudiates the doctrine of transcorporation as a false one, and does not admit that the soul of John ever was Elijah, may appeal to the above-quoted words of the angel, and point out that it is not the soul of Elijah that is spoken of at John's birth, but the spirit and power of Elijah. \"He shall go before him,\" it is said, \"in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children.\" Now it can be shown from thousands of texts that the spirit is a different thing from the soul, and that what is called the power is a different thing from both the soul and the spirit. On these points I cannot now enlarge; this work must not be unduly expanded. To establish the fact that power is different from spirit. it will be enough to cite the text,[fn-67-P6751_1209978:40-nf] \"The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.\" As for the spirits of the prophets, these are given to them by God, and are spoken of as being in a manner their property (slaves), as \"The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.\"[fn-67-P6752_1210281:41-nf] and \"The spirit of Elijah rested upon Elisha.\"[fn-67-P6753_1210349:42-nf] Thus, it is said, there is nothing absurd in supposing that John, \"in the spirit and power of Elijah,\" turned the hearts of the fathers to the children, and that it was on account of this spirit that he was called \"Elijah who was to come.\" And to reinforce this view it may be argued that if the God of the universe identified Himself with His saints to such an extent as to be called the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, much more might the Holy Spirit so identify Himself with the prophets as to be called their spirit, so that when the spirit is spoken of it might be the spirit of Elijah or the spirit of Isaiah. Our churchman, to go on with his views, may further say that those who supposed Jesus to be one of the prophets risen from the dead were probably misled, partly by the doctrine above mentioned, and partly by supposing Him to be one of the prophets, and that as for this misconception that He was one of the prophets, these persons probably fell into their error from not knowing about Jesus' supposed father and actual mother, and considering that He had risen from the tombs. As for the text in Genesis about the resurrection, the churchman will rejoin with a text to an opposite effect, \"God hath raised up for me another seed in place of Abel whom Cain slew; \"[fn-67-P6754_1211676:43-nf] showing that the resurrection occurs in Genesis. As for the first difficulty which was raised, our churchman will meet the view of the believers in transcorporation by saying that John is no doubt, in a certain sense, as he has already shown, Elijah who is to come; and that the reason why he met the enquiry of the priests and levites with \"I am not,\" was that he divined the object they had in view in making it. For the enquiry laid before John by the priests and levites was not intended to bring out whether the same spirit was in both, but whether John was that very Elijah who was taken up, and who now appeared according to the expectation of the Jews without being born (for the emissaries, perhaps, did not know about John's birth); and to such all enquiry he naturally answered, \"I am not; \"for he who was called John was not Elijah who was taken up, and had not changed his body for his present appearance. Our first scholar, whose view of transcorporation we have seen based upon our passage, may go on with a close examination of the text, and urge against his antagonist, that if John was the son of such a man as the priest Zacharias, and if he was born when his parents were both aged, contrary to all human expectation, then it is not likely that so many Jews at Jerusalem would be so ignorant about him, or that the priests and levites whom they sent would not be acquainted with the facts of his birth. Does not Luke declare[fn-67-P6755_1213139:44-nf] that \"fear came upon all those who lived round about,\"-clearly round about Zacharias and Elisabeth-and that \"all these things were noised abroad throughout the whole hill country of Judaea\"? And if John's birth from Zacharias was a matter of common knowledge, and the Jews of Jerusalem yet sent priests and levites to ask, \"Art thou Elijah? \"then it is clear that in saying this they assumed the doctrine of transcorporation to be true, and that it was a current doctrine of their country, and not foreign to their secret teaching. John therefore says, I am not Elijah, because he does not know about his own former life. These thinkers, accordingly, entertain an opinion which is by no means to be despised. Our churchman, however, may return to the charge, and ask if it is worthy of a prophet, who is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, who is predicted by Isaiah, and whose birth was foretold before it took place by so great an angel, one who has received of the fulness of Christ, who shares in such a grace, who knows truth to have come through Jesus Christ, and has taught such deep things about God and about the only-begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father, is it worthy of such a one to lie, or even to hesitate, out of ignorance of what he was. For with respect to what was obscure, he ought to have refrained from confessing, and to have neither affirmed nor denied the proposition put before him. If the doctrine in question really was widely current, ought not John to have hesitated to pronounce upon it, lest his soul had actually been in Elijah? And here our churchman will appeal to history, and will bid his antagonists ask experts of the secret doctrines of the Hebrews, if they do really entertain such a belief. For if it should appear that they do not, then the argument based on that supposition is shown to be quite baseless. Our churchman, however, is still free to have recourse to the solution given before, and to insist that attention be paid to the meaning with which the question was put. For if, as I showed, the senders knew John to be the child of Zacharias and Elisabeth, and if the messengers still more, being men of priestly race, could not possibly be ignorant of the remarkable manner in which their kinsman Zacharias had received his son, then what could be the meaning of their question, \"Art thou Elijah? \"Had they not read that Elijah had been taken up into heaven, and did they not expect him to appear? Then, as they expect Elijah to come at the consummation before Christ, and Christ to follow him, perhaps their question was meant less in a literal than in a tropical sense: Are you he who announces beforehand the word which is to come before Christ, at the consummation? To this he very properly answers, \"I am not.\" The adversary, however, tries to show that the priests could not be ignorant that the birth of John had taken place in so remarkable a manner, because \"all these things had been much spoken of in the hill country of Judaea; \"and the churchman has to meet this. He does so by showing that a similar mistake was widely current about the Saviour Himself; for \"some said that He was John the Baptist, others Elijah, others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\"[fn-67-P6756_1216379:45-nf] So the disciples told the Lord when He was in the parts of Caesarea Philippi, and questioned them on that subject. And Herod, too, said,[fn-67-P6757_1216540:46-nf] \"John whom I beheaded, he is risen from the dead; \"so that he appears not to have known what was said about Christ, as reported in the Gospel,[fn-67-P6758_1216701:47-nf] \"Is not this the son of the carpenter, is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? And His sisters, are they not all with us? \"Thus in the case of the Saviour, while many knew of His birth from Mary, others were under a mistake about Him; and so in the case of John, there is no wonder if, while some knew of his birth from Zacharias, others were in doubt whether the expected Elijah had appeared in him or not. There was not more room for doubt about John, whether he was Elijah, than about the Saviour, whether He was John. Of the two, the question of the outward form of Elijah could be disposed of from the words of Scripture, though not from actual observation, for we read,[fn-67-P6759_1217447:48-nf] \"He was a hairy man, and girt with a leather girdle about his loins.\" John's outward appearance, on the contrary, was well known, and was not like that of Jesus; and yet there were those who surmised that John had risen from the dead, and taken the name of Jesus. As for the change of name, a thing which reminds us of mysteries, I do not know how the Hebrews came to tell about Phinehas, son of Eleazar, who admittedly prolonged his life to the time of many of the judges, as we read in the Book of Judges,[fn-67-P6760_1217974:49-nf] to tell about him what I now mention. They say that he was Elijah, because he had been promised immortality (in Numbers[fn-67-P6761_1218112:50-nf] ), on account of the covenant of peace granted to him because he was jealous with a divine jealousy, and in a passion of anger pierced the Midianitish woman and the Israelite, and stayed the wrath of God as it is called, as it is written, \"Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them.\" No wonder, then, if those who conceived Phinehas and Elijah to be the same person, whether they judged soundly in this or not. for that is not now the question, considered John and Jesus also to be the same. This, then, they doubted, and desired to know if John and Elijah were the same. At another time than this, the point would certainly call for a careful enquiry, and the argument would have to be well weighed as to the essence of the soul, as to the principle of her composition, and as to her entering into this body of earth. We should also have to enquire into the distributions of the life of each soul, and as to her departure from this life, and whether it is possible for her to enter into a second life in a body or not, and whether that takes place at the same period, and after the same arrangement in each case, or not; and whether she enters the same body, or a different one, and if the same, whether the subject remains the same while the qualities are changed, or if both subject and qualities remain the same, and if the soul will always make use of the same body or will change it. Along with these questions, it would also be necessary to ask what transcorporation is, and how it differs from incorporation, and if he who holds transcorporation must necessarily hold the world to be eternal. The views of these scholars must also be taken into account, who consider that, according to the Scriptures, the soul is sown along with the body, and the consequences of such a view must also be looked at. In fact the subject of the soul is a wide one, and hard to be unravelled, and it has to be picked out of scattered expressions of Scripture. It requires, therefore, separate treatment. The brief consideration we have been led to give to the problem in connection with Elijah and John may now suffice; we go on to what follows in the Gospel.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"Art thou that prophet?

His father Zacharias, indeed, says, filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesying,[fn-67-P6767_1220686:53-nf] \"And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest, for thou shalt go before the Lord to prepare His ways.\" (One might indeed get past this passage by laying stress on the word called: he is to be called, he is not said to be, a prophet.) And still more weighty is it that the Saviour said to those who considered John to be a prophet,[fn-67-P6768_1221049:54-nf] \"But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.\" The words, Yea, I say unto you, manifestly affirm that John is a prophet, and that is nowhere denied afterwards. If, then, he is said by the Saviour to be not only a prophet but \"more than a prophet,\" how is it that when the priests and levites come and ask him, \"Art thou the Prophet? \"he answers No! On this we must remark that it is not the same thing to say, \"Art thou the Prophet? \"and \"Art thou a prophet? \"The distinction between the two expressions has already been observed, when we asked what was the difference between the God and God, and between the Logos and Logos.[fn-67-P6769_1221735:55-nf] Now it is written in Deuteronomy,[fn-67-P6770_1221782:56-nf] \"A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like me; Him shall ye hear, and it shall be that every soul that will not hear that prophet shall be cut off from among His people,\" There was, therefore, an expectation of one particular prophet having a resemblance to Moses in mediating between God and the people and receiving a new covenant from God to give to those who accepted his teaching; and in the case of each of the prophets, the people of Israel recognized that he was not the person of whom Moses spoke. As, then, they doubted about John, whether he were not the Christ,[fn-67-P6771_1222391:57-nf] so they doubted whether he could not be the prophet. And there is no wonder that those who doubted about John whether he were the Christ, did not understand that the Christ and the prophet are the same person; their doubt as to John necessarily implied that they were not clear on this point. Now the difference between \"the prophet\" and \"a prophet\" has escaped the observation of most students; this is the case with Heracleon, who says, in these very words: \"As, then, John confessed that he was not the Christ, and not even a prophet, nor Elijah.\" If he interpreted the words before us in such a way, he ought to have examined the various passages to see whether in saying that he is not a prophet nor Elijah he is or is not saying what is true. He devotes no attention, however, to these passages, and in his remaining commentaries he passes over such points without any enquiry. In the sequel, too, his remarks, of which we shall have to speak directly, are very scanty, and do not testify to careful study.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.\" As He who is peculiarly the Son of God, being no other than the Logos, yet makes use of Logos (reason)-for He was the Logos in the beginning, and was with God, the Logos of God-so John, the servant of that Logos, being, if we take the Scripture to mean what it says, no other than a voice, yet uses his voice to point to the Logos. He, then, understanding in this way the prophecy about himself spoken by Isaiah the prophet, says he is a voice, not crying in the wilderness, but \"of one crying in the wilderness,\" of Him, namely, who stood and cried,[fn-67-P6778_1224548:58-nf] \"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink.\" He it was. too, who said,[fn-67-P6779_1224646:59-nf] \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight. Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and all the crooked shall be made straight.\" For as we read in Exodus that God said to Moses,[fn-67-P6780_1224895:60-nf] \"Behold I have given thee for a God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet; \"so we are to understand-the cases are at least analogous if not altogether similar-it is with the Word in the beginning, who is God, and with John. For John's voice points to that word and demonstrates it. It is therefore a very appropriate punishment that falls on Zacharias on his saying to the angel,[fn-67-P6781_1225305:61-nf] \"Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man and my wife well stricken in years.\" For his want of faith with regard to the birth of the voice, he is himself deprived of his voice, as the angel Gabriel says to him, \"Behold, thou shall be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.\" And afterwards when he had \"asked for a writing tablet and written, His name is John; and they all marvelled,\" he recovered his voice; for \"his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue, and he spake, blessing God.\" We discussed above how it is to be understood that the Logos is the Son of God, and went over the ideas connected with that; and a similar sequence of ideas is to be observed at this point. John came for a witness; he was a man sent from God to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe; he was that voice, then, we are to understand, which alone was fitted worthily to announce the Logos. We shall understand this aright if we call to mind what was adduced in our exposition of the texts: \"That all might believe through Him,\" and \"This is he of whom it is written, Behold I send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.\"[fn-67-P6782_1226620:62-nf] There is fitness, too, in his being said to be the voice, not of one saying in the wilderness, but of one crying in the wilderness. He who cries, \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord,\" also says it; but he might say it without crying it. But he cries and shouts it, that even those may hear who are at a distance from the speaker, and that even the deaf may understand the greatness of the tidings, since it is announced in a great voice; and he thus brings help, both to those who have departed from God and to those who have lost the acuteness of their hearing. This, too, was the reason why \"Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink.\" Hence, too,[fn-67-P6783_1227324:63-nf] \"John beareth witness of Him, and cried, saying,\" \"Hence also God commands Isaiah to cry, with the voice of one saying, Cry. And I said, What shall I cry? \"The physical voice we use in prayer need not be great nor startling; even should we not lift up any great cry or shout, God will yet hear us. He says to Moses,[fn-67-P6784_1227657:64-nf] \"Why criest thou unto Me? \"when Moses had not cried audibly at all. It is not recorded in Exodus that he did so; but Moses had cried mightily to God in prayer with that voice which is heard by God alone. Hence David also says,[fn-67-P6785_1227904:65-nf] \"With my voice I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me.\" And one who cries in the desert has need of a voice, that the soul which is deprived of God and deserted of truth-and what more dreadful desert is there than a soul deserted of God and of all virtue, since it still goes crookedly and needs instruction-may be exhorted to make straight the way of the Lord. And that way is made straight by the man who, far from copying the serpent's crooked journey: while he who is of the contrary disposition perverts his way. Hence the rebuke directed to a man of this kind and to all who resemble him, \"Why pervert ye the right ways of the Lord? \"[fn-67-P6786_1228564:66-nf] ","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"ANF-10","text":"And they that were sent were of the Pharisees.

But the Pharisees being, as their name indicates, a divided and seditious set of people, show that they do not agree with the Jews of the metropolis and with the ministers of the service of God, the priests and levites.

For this they are rebuked by John, who has the zeal of Elijah according to the communication of the Holy Spirit. For that is a rebuking word, \"Think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father,\" and that is the word of a teacher, when he speaks of those who for their stony hearts are called unbelieving stones, and says that by the power of God these stones may be changed into children of Abraham; for they were present to the eyes of the prophet and did not shrink from his divine glance. Hence his words: \"I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.\" And since they came to his baptism without having done fruits meet for repentance, he says to them most appropriately, \"Already is the axe laid to the root of the tree; every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.\" This is as much as to say to them: Since you have come to baptism without having done fruits meet for repentance, you are a tree that does not bring forth good fruit and which has to be cut down by the most sharp and piercing axe of the Word which is living and powerful and sharper than every two-edged sword. The estimation in which the Pharisees held themselves is also set forth by Luke in the passage:[fn-68-P6814_1241110:85-nf] \"Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a publican. And the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself: God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.\" The result of this speech is that the publican goes down to his house justified rather than the Pharisee, and the lesson is drawn, that every one who exalts himself is abased. They came, then, in the character in which the Saviour's reproving words described them, as hypocrites to John's baptism, nor does it escape the Baptist's observation that they have the poison of vipers under their tongue and the poison of asps, for \"the poison of asps is under their tongue,\"[fn-68-P6815_1241854:86-nf] The figure of serpents rightly indicates their temper, and it is plainly revealed in their better question: \"Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet? \"To these I would fain reply, if it be the case that the Christ and Elijah and the prophet baptize, but that the voice crying in the wilderness has no authority to do so, \"Most harshly, my friends, do you question the messenger sent before the face of Christ to prepare His way before Him. The mysteries which belong to this point are all hidden to you; for Jesus being, whether you will or not, the Christ, did not Himself baptize but His disciples, He who was Himself the prophet. And how have you come to believe that Elijah who is to come will baptize? \"He did not baptize the logs upon the altar in the times of Ahab,[fn-68-P6816_1242685:87-nf] though they needed such a bath to be burned up, what time the Lord appeared in fire. No, he commands the priests to do this for him, and that not only once; for he says, \"Do it a second time,\" upon which they did it a second time, and \"Do it a third time,\" and they did it a third time. If, then, he did not at that time himself baptize but left the work to others, how was he to baptize at the time spoken of by Malachi? Christ, then, does not baptize with water, but His disciples. He reserves for Himself to baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire. Now Heracleon accepts the speech of the Pharisees as distinctly implying that the office of baptizing belonged to the Christ and Elijah and to every prophet, for he uses these words, \"Whose office alone it is to baptize.\" He is refuted by what we have just said, and especially by the consideration that he takes the word \"prophet\" in a general sense;[fn-68-P6817_1243619:88-nf] for he cannot show that any of the prophets baptized. He adds, not incorrectly, that the Pharisees put the question from malice, and not from a desire to learn.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"ANF-10","text":"We deem it necessary to compare with the expression of the passage we are considering the similar expressions found elsewhere in the Gospels. This we shall continue to do point by point to the end of this work, so that terms which appear to disagree may be shown to be in harmony, and that the peculiar meanings present in each may be explained. This we shall do in the present passage. The words, \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord,\" are placed by John, who was a disciple, in the mouth of the Baptist. In Mark, on the other hand, the same words are recorded at the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in accordance with the Scripture of Isaiah, as thus: \"The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" Now the words, \"Make straight the way of the Lord,\" added by John, are not found in the prophet.Perhaps John was seeking to compress the \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God,\" and so wrote, \"Make straight the way of the Lord; \"while Mark combined two prophecies spoken by two different prophets in different places, and made one prophecy out of them, \"As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold I send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way. The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" The words, \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness,\" are written immediately after the narrative of Hezekiah's recovery from his sickness,[fn-68-P6821_1245760:89-nf] while the words, \"Behold I send My messenger before thy face,\" are written by Malachi.[fn-68-P6822_1245864:90-nf] What John does here, abbreviating the text he quotes, we find done by Mark also at another point. For while the words of the prophet are, \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God,\" Mark writes, \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" And John practises a similar abbreviation in the text, \"Behold I send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee,\" when he does not add the words \"before thee,\" as in the original. Coming now to the statement, \"They were sent from the Pharisees and they asked Him,\"[fn-68-P6823_1246448:91-nf] we have been led by our examination of the passage to prefix the enquiry of the Pharisees-which Matthew does not mention-to the occurrence recorded in Matthew, when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, and said to them, \"Ye generations of vipers,\" etc. For the natural sequence is that they should first enquire and then come. And we have to observe how, when Matthew reports that there went out to John Jerusalem and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, to be baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins, it was not these people who heard from the Baptist any word of rebuke or refutation, but only those many Pharisees and Sadducees whom he saw coming. They it was who were greeted with the address, \"Ye offspring of vipers,\" etc.[fn-68-P6824_1247248:92-nf] Mark, again, does not record any words of reproof as having been used by John to those who came to him, being all the country of Judaea and all of them of Jerusalem, who were baptized by him in the Jordan and confessed their sins. This is because Mark does not mention the Pharisees and Sadducees as having come to John. A further circumstance which we must mention is that both Matthew and Mark state that, in the one case, all Jerusalem and all Judaea, and the whole region round about Jordan, in the other, the whole land of Judaea and all they of Jerusalem, were baptized, confessing their sins; but when Matthew introduces the Pharisees and Sadducees as coming to the baptism, he does not say that they confessed their sins, and this might very likely and very naturally be the reason why they were addressed as \"offspring of vipers.\" Do not suppose, reader, that there is anything improper in our adducing m our discussion of the question of those who were sent from the Pharisees and put questions to John, the parallel passages from the other Gospels too. For if we have indicated the proper connection between the enquiry of the Pharisees, recorded by the disciple John, and their baptism which is found in Matthew, we could scarcely avoid inquiring into the passages in question, nor recording the observations made on them. Luke, like Mark, remembers the passage, \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness,\" but lie for his part treats it as follows:[fn-68-P6825_1248731:93-nf] \"The word of God came unto John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness. And he came into all the region round about Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins; as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" Luke, however, added the continuation of the prophecy: \"Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked shall become straight, and the rough ways smooth, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\" He writes, like Mark, \"Make His ways straight; \"curtailing, as we saw before, the text, \"Make straight the ways of our God.\" In the phrase, \"And all the crooked shall become straight,\" he leaves out the \"all,\" and the word \"straight\" he converts from a plural into a singular. Instead of the phrase, moreover, \"The rough laud into a plain,\" he gives, \"The rough ways into smooth ways,\" and he leaves out \"And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,\" and gives what follows, \"And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.\" These observations are of use as showing how the evangelists are accustomed to abbreviate the sayings of the prophets. It has also to be observed that the speech, \"Offspring of vipers,\" etc., is said by Matthew to have been spoken to the Pharisees and Sadducees when coming to baptism, they being a different set of people from those who confessed their sins, and to whom no words of this kind were spoken. With Luke, on the contrary, these words were addressed to the multitudes who came out to be baptized by John, and there were not two divisions of those who were baptized, as we found in Matthew. But Matthew, as the careful observer will see, does not speak of the multitudes in the way of praise, and he probably means the Baptist's address, Offspring of vipers, etc., to be understood as addressed to them also. Another point is, that to the Pharisees and Sadducees he says, \"Bring forth a fruit,\" in the singular, \"worthy of repentance,\" but to the multitudes he uses the plural, \"Bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.\" Perhaps the Pharisees are required to yield the special fruit of repentance, which is no other than the Son and faith in Him, while the multitudes, who have not even a beginning of good things, are asked for all the fruits of repentance, and so the plural is used to them. Further, it is said to the Pharisees, \"Think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father.\" For the multitudes now have a beginning, appearing as they do to be introduced into the divine Word, and to approach the truth; and thus they begin to say within themselves, \"We have Abraham for our father.\" The Pharisees, on the contrary, are not beginning to this, but have long held it to be so. But both classes see John point to the stones aforesaid and declare that even from these children can be raised up to Abraham, rising up out of unconsciousness and deadness. And observe how it is said to the Pharisees,[fn-68-P6826_1251803:94-nf] according to the word of the prophet,[fn-68-P6827_1251861:95-nf] \"Ye have eaten false fruit,\" and they have false fruit,-\" Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire,\" while to the multitudes which do not bear fruit at all,[fn-68-P6828_1252077:96-nf] \"Every tree which bringethnot forth fruit is hewn down.\" For that which has no fruit at all has not good fruit, and, therefore, it is worthy to be hewn down. But that which bears fruit has by no means good fruit, whence it also calls for the axe to lay it low. But, if we look more closely into this about the fruit, we shall find that it is impossible that that which has just begun to be cultivated, even should it not prove fruitless, should bear the first good fruits. The husbandman is content that the tree just coming into cultivation should bear him at first such fruits as it may; afterwards, when he has pruned and trained it according to his art, he will receive, not the fruits it chanced to bear at first, but good fruits. The law itself favours this interpretation, for it says[fn-68-P6829_1252887:97-nf] that the planter is to wait for three years, having the trees pruned and not eating the fruit of them. \"Three years.\" it says, \"the fruit shall be unpurified to you, and shall not be eaten, but in the fourth year all the fruit shall be holy, for giving praise unto the Lord.\" This explains how the word \"good\" is omitted from the address to the multitudes, \"Every tree, therefore, which bears not fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.\" The tree which goes on bearing such fruit as it did at first, is a tree which does not bear good fruit, and is, therefore, cut down, and cast into the fire, since, when the three years have passed and the fourth comes round, it does not bear good fruit, for praise unto the Lord. In thus adducing the passages from the other Gospels I may appear to be digressing, but I cannot think it useless, or without bearing on our present subject. For the Pharisees send to John, after the priests and levites who came from Jerusalem, men who came to ask him who he was, and enquire, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet? After making this enquiry they straightway come for baptism, as Matthew records, and then they hear words suited to their quackery and hypocrisy. But the words addressed to them were very similar to those spoken to the multitudes, and hence the necessity to look carefully at both speeches, and to compare them together. It was while we were so engaged that various points arose in the sequence of the matter, which we had to consider. To what has been said we must add the following. We find mention made in John of two orders of persons sending: the one, that of the Jews from Jerusalem sending priests and levites; the other, that of the Pharisees who want to know why he baptizes. And we found that, after the enquiry, the Pharisees present themselves for baptism. May it not be that the Jews, who had sent the earlier mission from Jerusalem, received John's words before those who sent the second mission, namely, the Pharisees, and hence arrived before them? For Jerusalem and all Judaea, and, in consequence, the whole region round about Jordan, were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins; or, as Mark says. \"There went out to him the whole land of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.\" Now, neither does Matthew introduce the Pharisees and Sadducees, to whom the words, \"Offspring of vipers,\" etc., are addressed; nor does Luke introduce the multitudes who meet with the same rebuke, as confessing their sins. And the question may be raised how, if the whole city of Jerusalem, and the whole of Judaea, and the whole region round about Jordan, were baptized of John in Jordan, the Saviour could say,[fn-68-P6830_1255706:98-nf] \"John the Baptist came neither eating nor drinking, and ye say he hath a devil; \"and how could He say to those who asked Him,[fn-68-P6831_1255851:99-nf] \"By what authority doest thou these things? I also will ask you one word, which if ye tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or of men? And they reason, and say, If we shall say, From heaven, He will say, Why did ye not believe him? \"The solution of the difficulty is this. The Pharisees, addressed by John, as we saw before, with his \"Offspring of vipers,\" etc., came to the baptism, without believing in him, probably because they feared the multitudes, and, with their accustomed hypocrisy towards them, deemed it right to undergo the washing, so as not to appear hostile to those who did so. Their belief was, then, that he derived his baptism from men, and not from heaven, but, on account of the multitude, lest they should be stoned, they are afraid to say what they think. Thus there is no contradiction between the Saviour's speech to the Pharisees and the narratives in the Gospels about the multitudes who frequented' John's baptism. It was part of the effrontery of the Pharisees that they declared John to have a devil, as, also, that they declared Jesus to have performed His wonderful works by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":26,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"ANF-10","text":"John[fn-68-P6835_1257237:100-nf] answered them, saying, \"I baptize with water, but in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not, even He who cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.\" Heracleon considers that John's answers to those sent by the Pharisees refer not to what they asked, but to what he wished, not observing that he accuses the prophet of a want of manners, by making him, when asked about one thing, answer about another; for this is a fault to be guarded against in conversation. We assert, on the contrary, that the reply accurately takes up the question. It is asked,\" Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not the Christ? \"And what other answer could be given to this than to show that his baptism was in its nature a bodily thing? I, he says, \"baptize with water; \"this is his answer to, \"Why baptizest thou.\" And to the second part of their question, \"If thou art not the Christ,\" he answers by exalting the superior nature of Christ, that He has such virtue as to be invisible in His deity, though present to every man and extending over the whole universe. This is what is indicated in the words, \"There standeth one among you.\" The Pharisees, moreover, though expecting the advent of Christ, saw nothing in Him of such a nature as John speaks of; they believed Him to be simply a perfect and holy man. John, therefore, rebukes their ignorance of His superiority, and adds to the words, \"There standeth one among you,\" the clause, \"whom ye know not.\" And, lest any one should suppose the invisible One who extends to every man, or, indeed, to the whole world, to be a different person from Him who became man, and appeared upon the earth and con versed with men, he adds to the words, \"There standeth one among you whom you know not,\" the further words, \"Who cometh after me,\" that is, He who is to be manifested after me. By whose surpassing excellence he well understood that his own nature was far surpassed, though some doubted whether he might be the Christ; and, therefore, desiring to show how far he is from attaining to the greatness of the Christ, that no one should think of him beyond what he sees or hears of him, he goes on: \"The latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.\" By which lie conveys, as in a riddle, that he is not fit to solve and to explain the argument about Christ's assuming a human body, an argument tied up and hidden (like a shoe-tie) to those who do not understand it,-so as to say anything worthy of such an advent, compressed, as it was, into so short a space.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"These things were done in Bethabara, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.\"[fn-68-P6877_1280856:115-nf] We are aware of the reading which is found in almost all the copies, \"These things were done in Bethany.\" This appears, moreover, to have been the reading at an earlier time; and in Heracleon we read \"Bethany.\" We are convinced, however, that we should not read \"Bethany,\" but \"Bethabara.\" We have visited the places to enquire as to the footsteps of Jesus and His disciples, and of the prophets. Now, Bethany, as the same evangelist tells us,[fn-68-P6878_1281319:116-nf] was the town of Lazarus, and of Martha and Mary; it is fifteen stadia from Jerusalem, anti the river Jordan is about a hundred and eighty stadia distant from it. Nor is there any other place of the same name in the neighbourhood of the Jordan, but they say that Bethabara is pointed out on the banks of the Jordan, and that John is said to have baptized there. The etymology of the name, too, corresponds with the baptism of him who made ready for the Lord a people prepared for Him; for it yields the meaning \"House of preparation,\" while Bethany means \"House of obedience.\" Where else was it fitting that he should baptize, who was sent as a messenger before the face of the Christ, to prepare His way before Him, but at the House of preparation? And what more fitting home for Mary, who chose the good part,[fn-68-P6879_1282154:117-nf] which was not taken away from her, and for Martha, who was cumbered for the reception of Jesus, and for their brother, who is called the friend of the Saviour, than Bethany, the House of obedience? Thus we see that he who aims at a complete understanding of the Holy Scriptures must not neglect the careful examination of the proper names in it. In the matter of proper names the Greek copies are often incorrect, and in the Gospels one might be misled by their authority. The transaction about the swine, which were driven down a steep place by the demons and drowned in the sea, is said to have taken place in the country of the Gerasenes.[fn-68-P6880_1282819:118-nf] Now, Gerasa is a town of Arabia, and has near it neither sea nor lake. And the Evangelists would not have made a statement so obviously and demonstrably false; for they were men who informed themselves carefully of all matters connected with Judaea. But in a few copies we have found, \"into the country of the Gadarenes; \"and, on this reading, it is to be stated that Gadara is a town of Judaea, in the neighbourhood of which are the well-known hot springs, and that there is no lake there with overhanging banks, nor any sea. But Gergesa, from which the name Gergesenes is taken, is an old town in the neighbourhood of the lake now called Tiberias, and on the edge of it there is a steep place abutting on the lake, from which it is pointed out that the swine were cast down by the demons. Now, the meaning of Gergesa is \"dwelling of the casters-out,\" and it contains a prophetic reference to the conduct towards the Saviour of the citizens of those places, who \"besought Him to depart out of their coasts.\" The same inaccuracy with regard to proper names is also to be observed in many passages of the law and the prophets, as we have been at pains to learn from the Hebrews, comparing our own copies with theirs which have the confirmation of the versions, never subjected to corruption, of Aquila and Theodotion and Symmachus. We add a few instances to encourage students to pay more attention to such points. One of the sons of Levi,[fn-68-P6881_1284318:119-nf] the first, is called Geson in most copies, instead of Gerson. His name is the same as that of the first-born of Moses;[fn-68-P6882_1284471:120-nf] it was given appropriately in each case, both children being born, because of the sojourn in Egypt, in a strange land. The second son of Juda,[fn-68-P6883_1284633:121-nf] again, has with us the name Annan, but with the Hebrews Onan, \"their labour.\" Once more, in the departures of the children of Israel in Numbers,[fn-68-P6884_1284802:122-nf] we find, \"They departed from Sochoth and pitched in Buthan; \"but the Hebrew, instead of Buthan, reads Aiman. And why should I add more points like these, when any one who desires it can examine into the proper names and find out for himself how they stand? The place-names of Scripture are specially to be suspected where many of them occur in a catalogue, as in the account of the partition of the country in Joshua, and in the first Book of Chronicles from the beginning down to, say, the passage about Dan,[fn-68-P6885_1285330:123-nf] and similarly in Ezra. Names are not to be neglected, since indications may be gathered from them which help in the interpretation of the passages where they occur. We cannot, however, leave our proper subject to examine in this place into the philosophy of names.","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_129_some_other_fragments_of_the_same_methodius_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"ANF-06","text":"But Methodius: The Holy Spirit, who of God is given to all men, and of whom Solomon said, \"For Thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things,\"[fn-62-P6277_1927783:9-nf] He receives for the conscience, which condemns the offending soul.","title":"Some Other Fragments of the Same Methodius.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_129_some_other_fragments_of_the_same_methodius_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"ANF-06","text":"But Methodius: The Holy Spirit, who of God is given to all men, and of whom Solomon said, \"For Thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things,\"[fn-62-P6277_1927783:9-nf] He receives for the conscience, which condemns the offending soul.","title":"Some Other Fragments of the Same Methodius.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Then, therefore, does the Word also Himself assume His own form and glorious garb,[fn-104-P10456_2930596:58-nf] His own sound and vocal utterance, when God says, \"Let there be light.\"[fn-104-P10457_2930682:59-nf] This is the perfect nativity of the Word, when He proceeds forth from God-formed[fn-104-P10458_2930779:60-nf] by Him first to devise and think out all things under the name of Wisdom-\"The Lord created or formed[fn-104-P10459_2931078:61-nf] me as the beginning of His ways; \"[fn-104-P10460_2931128:62-nf] then afterward begotten, to carry all into effect-\"When He prepared the heaven, I was present with Him.\"[fn-104-P10461_2931254:63-nf] Thus does He make Him equal to Him: for by proceeding from Himself He became His first-begotten Son, because begotten before all things;[fn-104-P10462_2931405:64-nf] and His only-begotten also, because alone begotten of God, in a way peculiar to Himself, from the womb of His own heart-even as the Father Himself testifies: \"My heart,\" says He, \"hath emitted my most excellent Word.\"[fn-104-P10463_2931640:65-nf] The father took pleasure evermore in Him, who equally rejoiced with a reciprocal gladness in the Father's presence: \"Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten Thee; \"[fn-104-P10464_2931926:66-nf] even before the morning star did I beget Thee. The Son likewise acknowledges the Father, speaking in His own person, under the name of Wisdom: \"The Lord formed Me as the beginning of His ways, with a view to His own works; before all the hills did He beget Me.\"[fn-104-P10465_2932205:67-nf] For if indeed Wisdom in this passage seems to say that She was created by the Lord with a view to His works, and to accomplish His ways, yet proof is given in another Scripture that \"all things were made by the Word, and without Him was there nothing made; \"[fn-104-P10466_2932489:68-nf] as, again, in another place (it is said), \"By His word were the heavens established, and all the powers thereof by His Spirit\"[fn-104-P10467_2932632:69-nf] -that is to say, by the Spirit (or Divine Nature) which was in the Word: thus is it evident that it is one and the same power which is in one place described under the name of Wisdom, and in another passage under the appellation of the Word, which was initiated for the works of God[fn-104-P10468_2932935:70-nf] which \"strengthened the heavens; \"[fn-104-P10469_2932991:71-nf] \"by which all things were made,\"[fn-104-P10470_2933038:72-nf] \"and without which nothing was made.\"[fn-104-P10471_2933092:73-nf] Nor need we dwell any longer on this point, as if it were not the very Word Himself, who is spoken of under the name both of Wisdom and of Reason, and of the entire Divine Soul and Spirit. He became also the Son of God, and was begotten when He proceeded forth from Him. Do you then, (you ask, ) grant that the Word is a certain substance, constructed by the Spirit and the communication of Wisdom? Certainly I do. But you will not allow Him to be really a substantive being, by having a substance of His own; in such a way that He may be regarded as an objective thing and a person, and so be able (as being constituted second to God the Father, ) to make two, the Father and the Son, God and the Word. For you will say, what is a word, but a voice and sound of the mouth, and (as the grammarians teach) air when struck against,[fn-104-P10472_2933938:74-nf] intelligible to the ear, but for the rest a sort of void, empty, and incorporeal thing. I, on the contrary, contend that nothing empty and void could have come forth from God, seeing that it is not put forth from that which is empty and void; nor could that possibly be devoid of substance which has proceeded from so great a substance, and has produced such mighty substances: for all things which were made through Him, He Himself (personally) made. How could it be, that He Himself is nothing, without whom nothing was made?

But still the tree is not severed from the root, nor the river from the fountain, nor the ray from the sun; nor, indeed, is the Word separated from God. Following, therefore, the form of these analogies, I confess that I call God and His Word-the Father and His Son-two. For the root and the tree are distinctly two things, but correlatively joined; the fountain and the river are also two forms, but indivisible; so likewise the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones. Everything which proceeds from something else must needs be second to that from which it proceeds, without being on that account separated: Where, however, there is a second, there must be two; and where there is a third, there must be three. Now the Spirit indeed is third from God and the Son; just as the fruit of the tree is third from the root, or as the stream out of the river is third from the fountain, or as the apex of the ray is third from the sun. Nothing, however, is alien from that original source whence it derives its own properties. In like manner the Trinity, flowing down from the Father through intertwined and connected steps, does not at all disturb the Monarchy,[fn-104-P10495_2940894:94-nf] whilst it at the same time guards the state of the Economy.[fn-104-P10496_2940992:95-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If the number of the Trinity also offends you, as if it were not connected in the simple Unity, I ask you how it is possible for a Being who is merely and absolutely One and Singular, to speak in plural phrase, saying, \"Let us make man in our own image, and after our own likeness; \"[fn-105-P10541_2957168:128-nf] whereas He ought to have said, \"Let me make man in my own image, and after my own likeness,\" as being a unique and singular Being?

If you are so venturesome and harsh, reflect a while; and that you may think the better and more deliberately, listen to the psalm in which Two are described as God: \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of Thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee or made Thee His Christ.\"[fn-105-P10556_2961814:140-nf] Now, since He here speaks to God, and affirms that God is anointed by God, He must have affirmed that Two are God, by reason of the sceptre's royal power. Accordingly, Isaiah also says to the Person of Christ: \"The Sabµans, men of stature, shall pass over to Thee; and they shall follow after Thee, bound in fetters; and they shall worship Thee, because God is in Thee: for Thou art our God, yet we knew it not; Thou art the God of Israel.\"[fn-105-P10557_2962277:141-nf] For here too, by saying, \"God is in Thee, and \"Thou art God,\" he sets forth Two who were God: (in the former expression in Thee, he means) in Christ, and (in the other he means) the Holy Ghost. That is a still grander statement which you will find expressly made in the Gospel: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-105-P10558_2962669:142-nf] There was One \"who was,\" and there was another \"with whom\" He was. But I find in Scripture the name Lord also applied to them Both: \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.\"[fn-105-P10559_2962876:143-nf] And Isaiah says this: \"Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? \"[fn-105-P10560_2963000:144-nf] Now he would most certainly have said Thine Arm, if he had not wished us to understand that the Father is Lord, and the Son also is Lord. A much more ancient testimony we have also in Genesis: \"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.\"[fn-105-P10561_2963315:145-nf] Now, either deny that this is Scripture; or else (let me ask) what sort of man you are, that you do not think words ought to be taken and understood in the sense in which they are written, especially when they are not expressed in allegories and parables, but in determinate and simple declarations? If, indeed, you follow those who did not at the time endure the Lord when showing Himself to be the Son of God, because they would not believe Him to be the Lord, then (I ask you)call to mind along with them the passage where it is written, \"I have said, Ye are gods, and ye are children of the Most High; \"[fn-105-P10562_2963944:146-nf] and again, \"God standeth in the congregation of gods; \"[fn-105-P10563_2964022:147-nf] in order that, if the Scripture has not been afraid to designate as gods human beings, who have become sons of God by faith, you may be sure that the same Scripture has with greater propriety conferred the name of the Lord on the true and one-only Son of God. Very well! you say, I shall challenge you to preach from this day forth (and that, too, on the authority of these same Scriptures) two Gods and two Lords, consistently with your views. God forbid, (is my reply.) For we, who by the grace of God possess an insight into both the times and the occasions of the Sacred Writings, especially we who are followers of the Paraclete, not of human teachers, do indeed definitively declare that Two Beings are God, the Father and the Son, and, with the addition of the Holy Spirit, even Three, according to the principle of the divine economy, which introduces number, in order that the Father may not, as you perversely infer, be Himself believed to have been born and to have suffered, which it is not lawful to believe, forasmuch as it has not been so handed down. That there are, however, two Gods or two Lords, is a statement which at no time proceeds out of our mouth: not as if it were untrue that the Father is God, and the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and each is God; but because in earlier times Two were actually spoken of as God, and two as Lord, that when Christ should come He might be both acknowledged as God and designated as Lord, being the Son of Him who is both God and Lord. Now, if there were found in the Scriptures but one Personality of Him who is God and Lord, Christ would justly enough be inadmissible to the title of God and Lord: for (in the Scriptures) there was declared to be none other than One God and One Lord, and it must have followed that the Father should Himself seem to have come down (to earth), inasmuch as only One God and One Lord was ever read of (in the Scriptures), and His entire Economy would be involved in obscurity, which has been planned and arranged with so clear a foresight in His providential dispensation as matter for our faith. As soon, however, as Christ came, and was recognised by us as the very Being who had from the beginning[fn-105-P10564_2966241:148-nf] caused plurality[fn-105-P10565_2966272:149-nf] (in the Divine Economy), being the second from the Father, and with the Spirit the third, and Himself declaring and manifesting the Father more fully (than He had ever been before), the title of Him who is God and Lord was at once restored to the Unity (of the Divine Nature), even because the Gentiles would have to pass from the multitude of their idols to the One Only God, in order that a difference might be distinctly settled between the worshippers of One God and the votaries of polytheism. For it was only right that Christians should shine in the world as \"children of light,\" adoring and invoking Him who is the One God and Lord as \"the light of the world.\" Besides, if, from that perfect knowledge[fn-105-P10566_2966998:150-nf] which assures us that the title of God and Lord is suitable both to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, we were to invoke a plurality of gods and lords, we should quench our torches, and we should become less courageous to endure the martyr's sufferings, from which an easy escape would everywhere lie open to us, as soon as we swore by a plurality of gods and lords, as sundry heretics do, who hold more gods than One. I will therefore not speak of gods at all, nor of lords, but I shall follow the apostle; so that if the Father and the Son, are alike to be invoked, I shall call the Father \"God,\" and invoke Jesus Christ as \"Lord.\"[fn-105-P10567_2967668:151-nf] But when Christ alone (is mentioned), I shall be able to call Him \"God,\" as the same apostle says: \"Of whom is Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-105-P10568_2967845:152-nf] For I should give the name of\" sun\" even to a sunbeam, considered in itself; but if I were mentioning the sun from which the ray emanates, I certainly should at once withdraw the name of sun from the mere beam. For although I make not two suns, still I shall reckon both the sun and its ray to be as much two things and two forms[fn-105-P10569_2968195:153-nf] of one undivided substance, as God and His Word, as the Father and the Son.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If I fail in resolving this article (of our faith) by passages which may admit of dispute[fn-105-P10593_2975800:171-nf] out of the Old Testament, I will take out of the New Testament a confirmation of our view, that you may not straightway attribute to the Father every possible (relation and condition) which I ascribe to the Son. Behold, then, I find both in the Gospels and in the (writings of the) apostles a visible and an invisible God (revealed to us), under a manifest and personal distinction in the condition of both. There is a certain emphatic saying by John: \"No man hath seen God at any time; \"[fn-105-P10594_2976311:172-nf] meaning, of course, at any previous time But he has indeed taken away all question of time, by saying that God had never been seen. The apostle confirms this statement; for, speaking of God, he says, \"Whom no man hath seen, nor can see; \"[fn-105-P10595_2976569:173-nf] because the man indeed would die who should see Him.[fn-105-P10596_2976644:174-nf] But the very same apostles testify that they had both seen and \"handled\" Christ.[fn-105-P10597_2976777:175-nf] Now, if Christ is Himself both the Father and the Son, how can He be both the Visible and the Invisible? In order, however, to reconcile this diversity between the Visible and the Invisible, will not some one on the other side argue that the two statements are quite correct: that He was visible indeed in the flesh, but was invisible before His appearance in the flesh; so that He who as the Father was invisible before the flesh, is the same as the Son who was visible in the flesh? If, however, He is the same who was invisible before the incarnation, how comes it that He was actually seen in ancient times before (coming in) the flesh? And by parity of reasoning, if He is the same who was visible after (coming in) the flesh, how happens it that He is now declared to be invisible by the apostles? How, I repeat, can all this be, unless it be that He is one, who anciently was visible only in mystery and enigma, and became more clearly visible by His incarnation, even the Word who was also made flesh; whilst He is another whom no man has seen at any time, being none else than the Father, even Him to whom the Word belongs? Let us, in short, examine who it is whom the apostles saw. \"That,\" says John, \"which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.\"[fn-105-P10598_2978120:176-nf] Now the Word of life became flesh, and was heard, and was seen, and was handled, because He was flesh who, before He came in the flesh, was the \"Word in the beginning with God\" the Father,[fn-105-P10599_2978329:177-nf] and not the Father with the Word. For although the Word was God, yet was He with God, because He is God of God; and being joined to the Father, is with the Father.[fn-106-P10600_2978514:178-nf] \"And we have seen His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father; \"[fn-106-P10601_2978630:179-nf] that is, of course, (the glory) of the Son, even Him who was visible, and was glorified by the invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the Word of God was God, in order that he might give no help to the presumption of the adversary, (which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself and in order to draw a distinction between the invisible Father and the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, ex abundanti as it were: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-106-P10602_2979142:180-nf] What God does he mean? The Word? But he has already said: \"Him we have seen and heard, and our hands have handled the Word of life.\" Well, (I must again ask, ) what God does he mean?

For although the Word was God, yet was He with God, because He is God of God; and being joined to the Father, is with the Father.[fn-106-P10600_2978514:178-nf] \"And we have seen His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father; \"[fn-106-P10601_2978630:179-nf] that is, of course, (the glory) of the Son, even Him who was visible, and was glorified by the invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the Word of God was God, in order that he might give no help to the presumption of the adversary, (which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself and in order to draw a distinction between the invisible Father and the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, ex abundanti as it were: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-106-P10602_2979142:180-nf] What God does he mean? The Word? But he has already said: \"Him we have seen and heard, and our hands have handled the Word of life.\" Well, (I must again ask, ) what God does he mean? It is of course the Father, with whom was the Word, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, and has Himself declared Him.[fn-106-P10603_2979484:181-nf] He was both heard and seen and, that He might not be supposed to be a phantom, was actually handled. Him, too, did Paul behold; but yet he saw not the Father. \"Have I not,\" he says, \"seen Jesus Christ our Lord? \"[fn-106-P10604_2979716:182-nf] Moreover, he expressly called Christ God, saying: \"Of whom are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-106-P10605_2979902:183-nf] He shows us also that the Son of God, which is the Word of God, is visible, because He who became flesh was called Christ. Of the Father, however, he says to Timothy: \"Whom none among men hath seen, nor indeed can see; \"and he accumulates the description in still ampler terms: \"Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto.\"[fn-106-P10606_2980285:184-nf] It was of Him, too, that he had said in a previous passage: \"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to the only God; \"[fn-106-P10607_2980435:185-nf] so that we might apply even the contrary qualities to the Son Himself-mortality, accessibility-of whom the apostle testifies that \"He died according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-106-P10608_2980625:186-nf] and that \"He was seen by himself last of all,\"[fn-106-P10609_2980693:187-nf] -by means, of course, of the light which was accessible, although it was not without imperilling his sight that he experienced that light.[fn-106-P10610_2980847:188-nf] A like danger to which also befell Peter, and John, and James, (who confronted not the same light) without risking the loss of their reason and mind; and if they, who were unable to endure the glory of the Son,[fn-106-P10611_2981080:189-nf] had only seen the Father, they must have died then and there: \"For no man shall see God, and live.\"[fn-106-P10612_2981214:190-nf] This being the case, it is evident that He was always seen from the beginning, who became visible in the end; and that He, (on the contrary, ) was not seen in the end who had never been visible from the beginning; and that accordingly there are two-the Visible and the Invisible. It was the Son, therefore, who was always seen, and the Son who always conversed with men, and the Son who has always worked by the authority and will of the Father; because \"the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do\"[fn-106-P10613_2981760:191-nf] -\"do\" that is, in His mind and thought.[fn-106-P10614_2981819:192-nf] For the Father acts by mind and thought; whilst the Son, who is in the Father's mind and thought,[fn-106-P10615_2981934:193-nf] gives effect and form to what He sees. Thus all things were made by tile Son, and without Him was not anything made.[fn-106-P10616_2982167:194-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But you must not suppose that only the works which relate to the (creation of the) world were made by the Son, but also whatsoever since that time has been done by God. For \"the Father who loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand,\"[fn-106-P10620_2982560:195-nf] loves Him indeed from the beginning, and from the very first has handed all things over to Him. Whence it is written, \"From the beginning the Word was with God, and the Word was God; \"[fn-106-P10621_2982873:196-nf] to whom \"is given by the Father all power in heaven and on earth.\"[fn-106-P10622_2982958:197-nf] \"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son\"[fn-106-P10623_2983054:198-nf] -from the very beginning even. For when He speaks of all power and all judgment, and says that all things were made by Him, and all things have been delivered into His hand, He allows no exception (in respect) of time, because they would not be all things unless they were the things of all time. It is the Son, therefore, who has been from the beginning administering judgment, throwing down the haughty tower, and dividing the tongues, punishing the whole world by the violence of waters, raining upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone, as the Lord from the Lord. For He it was who at all times came down to hold converse with men, from Adam on to the patriarchs and the prophets, in vision, in dream, in mirror, in dark saying; ever from the beginning laying the foundation of the course of His dispensations, which He meant to follow out to the very last. Thus was He ever learning even as God to converse with men upon earth, being no other than the Word which was to be made flesh. But He was thus learning (or rehearsing), in order to level for us the way of faith, that we might the more readily believe that the Son of God had come down into the world, if we knew that in times past also something similar had been done.[fn-106-P10624_2984308:199-nf] For as it was on our account and for our learning that these events are described in the Scriptures, so for our sakes also were they done-(even ours, I say), \"upon whom the ends of the world are come.\"[fn-106-P10625_2984562:200-nf] In this way it was that even then He knew full well what human feelings and affections were, intending as He always did to take upon Him man's actual component substances, body and soul, making inquiry of Adam (as if He were ignorant),[fn-106-P10626_2984825:201-nf] \"Where art thou, Adam? \"[fn-106-P10627_2984907:202-nf] -repenting that He had made man, as if He had lacked foresight;[fn-106-P10628_2984991:203-nf] tempting Abraham, as if ignorant of what was in man; offended with persons, and then reconciled to them; and whatever other (weaknesses and imperfections) the heretics lay hold of (in their assumptions) as unworthy of God, in order to discredit the Creator, not considering that these circumstances are suitable enough for the Son, who was one day to experience even human sufferings-hunger and thirst, and tears, and actual birth and real death, and in respect of such a dispensation \"made by the Father a little less than the angels.\"[fn-106-P10629_2985547:204-nf] But the heretics, you may be sure, will not allow that those things are suitable even to the Son of God, which you are imputing to the very Father Himself, when you pretend[fn-106-P10630_2985740:205-nf] that He made Himself less (than the angels) on our account; whereas the Scripture informs us that He who was made less was so affected by another, and not Himself by Himself. What, again, if He was One who was \"crowned with glory and honour,\" and He Another by whom He was so crowned,[fn-106-P10631_2986039:206-nf] -the Son, in fact, by the Father? Moreover, how comes it to pass, that the Almighty Invisible God, \"whom no man hath seen nor can see; He who dwelleth in light unapproachable; \"[fn-106-P10632_2986237:207-nf] \"He who dwelleth not in temples made with hands; \"[fn-106-P10633_2986310:208-nf] \"from before whose sight the earth trembles, and the mountains melt like wax; \"[fn-106-P10634_2986412:209-nf] who holdeth the whole world in His hand \"like a nest; \"[fn-106-P10635_2986501:210-nf] \"whose throne is heaven, and earth His footstool; \"[fn-106-P10636_2986572:211-nf] in whom is every place, but Himself is in no place; who is the utmost bound of the universe;-how happens it, I say, that He (who, though) the Most High, should yet have walked in paradise towards the cool of the evening, in quest of Adam; and should have shut up the ark after Noah had entered it; and at Abraham's tent should have refreshed Himself under an oak; and have called to Moses out of the burning bush; and have appeared as \"the fourth\" in the furnace of the Babylonian monarch (although He is there called the Son of man),-unless all these events had happened as an image, as a mirror, as an enigma (of the future incarnation)? Surely even these things could not have been believed even of the Son of God, unless they had been given us in the Scriptures; possibly also they could not have been believed of the Father, even if they had been given in the Scriptures, since these men bring Him down into Mary's womb, and set Him before Pilate's judgment-seat, and bury Him in the sepulchre of Joseph. Hence, therefore, their error becomes manifest; for, being ignorant that the entire order of the divine administration has from the very first had its course through the agency of the Son, they believe that the Father Himself was actually seen, and held converse with men. and worked, and was athirst, and suffered hunger (in spite of the prophet who says: \"The everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, shall never thirst at all, nor be hungry; \"[fn-106-P10637_2988074:212-nf] much more, shall neither die at any time, nor be buried!), and therefore that it was uniformly one God, even the Father, who at all times did Himself the things which were really done by Him through the agency of the Son.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But this very declaration of His they will hastily pervert into an argument of His singleness. \"I have,\" says He, \"stretched out the heaven alone.\" Undoubtedly alone as regards all other powers; and He thus gives a premonitory evidence against the conjectures of the heretics, who maintain that the world was constructed by various angels and powers, who also make the Creator Himself to have been either an angel or some subordinate agent sent to form external things, such as the constituent parts of the world, but who was at the same time ignorant of the divine purpose.

And first of all there comes at once to hand the preamble of John to his Gospel, which shows us what He previously was who had to become flesh. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-106-P10683_3001318:243-nf] Now, since these words may not be taken otherwise than as they are written, there is without doubt shown to be One who was from the beginning, and also One with whom He always was: one the Word of God, the other God although the Word is also God, but God regarded as the Son of God, not as the Father); One through whom were all things, Another by whom were all things. But in what sense we call Him Another we have already often described. In that we called Him Another, we must needs imply that He is not identical-not identical indeed, yet not as if separate; Other by dispensation, not by division. He, therefore, who became flesh was not the very same as He from whom the Word came. \"His glory was beheld-the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father;\"[fn-106-P10684_3002098:244-nf] not, (observe, ) as of the Father. He \"declared\" (what was in) \"the bosom of the Father alone; \"[fn-106-P10685_3002214:245-nf] the Father did not divulge the secrets of His own bosom. For this is preceded by another statement: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-106-P10686_3002449:246-nf] Then, again, when He is designated by John (the Baptist) as \"the Lamb of God,\"[fn-106-P10687_3002561:247-nf] He is not described as Himself the same with Him of whom He is the beloved Son. He is, no doubt, ever the Son of God, but yet not He Himself of whom He is the Son. This (divine relationship) Nathanµl at once recognised in Him,[fn-106-P10688_3002807:248-nf] even as Peter did on another occasion: \"Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-106-P10689_3002892:249-nf] And He affirmed Himself that they were quite right in their convictions; for He answered Nathanµl: \"Because I said, I saw thee under the fig-tree, therefore dose thou believe?\"[fn-106-P10690_3003091:250-nf] And in the same manner He pronounced Peter to be \"blessed,\" inasmuch as \"flesh and blood had not revealed it to him\"-that he had perceived the Father-\"but the Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-106-P10691_3003297:251-nf] By asserting all this, He determined the distinction which is between the two Persons: that is, the Son then on earth, whom Peter had confessed to be the Son of God; and the Father in heaven, who had revealed to Peter the discovery which he had made, that Christ was the Son of God. When He entered the temple, He called it \"His Father's house,\"[fn-106-P10692_3003666:252-nf] speaking as the Son. In His address to Nicodemus He says: \"So God loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"[fn-106-P10693_3003884:253-nf] And again: \"For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He that believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.\"[fn-106-P10694_3004192:254-nf] Moreover, when John (the Baptist) was asked what he happened to know of Jesus, he said: \"The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.\"[fn-106-P10695_3004518:255-nf] Whom, indeed, did He reveal to the woman of Samaria? Was it not \"the Messias which is called Christ? \"[fn-106-P10696_3004646:256-nf] And so lie showed, of course, that He was not the Father, but the Son; and elsewhere He is expressly called \"the Christ, the Son of God,\"[fn-106-P10697_3004804:257-nf] and not the Father. He says, therefore,\" My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work; \"[fn-106-P10698_3004938:258-nf] whilst to the Jews He remarks respecting the cure of the impotent man, \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\"[fn-106-P10699_3005071:259-nf] \"My Father and I\"-these are the Son's words. And it was on this very account that \"the Jews sought the more intently to kill Him, not only because He broke the Sabbath, but also because He said that God was His Father, thus making Himself equal with God. Then indeed did He answer and say unto them, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do; for what things soever He doeth these also doeth the Son likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that He Himself doeth; and He will also show Him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son also quickeneth whom He will.

Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my words, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. Verily I say unto you, that the hour is coming, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and when they have heard it, they shall live. For as the Father hath eternal life in Himself, so also hath He given to the Son to have eternal life in Himself; and He hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man\"[fn-107-P10700_3006548:260-nf] -that is, according to the flesh, even as He is also the Son of God through His Spirit.[fn-107-P10701_3006658:261-nf] Afterwards He goes on to say: \"But I have greater witness than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to finish-those very works bear witness of me that the Father hath sent me. And the Father Himself, which hath sent me, hath also borne witness of me.\"[fn-107-P10702_3006963:262-nf] But He at once adds, \"Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape; \"[fn-107-P10703_3007075:263-nf] thus affirming that in former times it was not the Father, but the Son, who used to be seen and heard. Then He says at last: \"I am come in my Father's name, and ye have not received me.\"[fn-107-P10704_3007278:264-nf] It was therefore always the Son (of whom we read) under the designation of the Almighty and Most High God, and King, and Lord. To those also who inquired \"what they should do to work the works of God,\"[fn-107-P10705_3007496:265-nf] He answered, \"This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.\"[fn-107-P10706_3007598:266-nf] He also declares Himself to be \"the bread which the Father sent from heaven; \"[fn-107-P10707_3007693:267-nf] and adds, that \"all that the Father gave Him should come to Him, and that He Himself would not reject them,[fn-107-P10708_3007817:268-nf] because He had come down from heaven not to do His own will, but the will of the Father; and that the will of the Father was that every one who saw the Son, and believed on Him, should obtain the life (everlasting, ) and the resurrection at the last day. No man indeed was able to come to Him, except the Father attracted him; whereas every one who had heard and learnt of the Father came to Him.\"[fn-107-P10709_3008287:269-nf] He goes on then expressly to say, \"Not that any man hath seen the Father; \"[fn-107-P10710_3008386:270-nf] thus showing us that it was through the Word of the Father that men were instructed and taught. Then, when many departed from Him,[fn-107-P10711_3008534:271-nf] and He turned to the apostles with the inquiry whether \"they also would go away,\"[fn-107-P10712_3008632:272-nf] what was Simon Peter's answer? \"To whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life, and we believe that Thou art the Christ.\"[fn-107-P10713_3008780:273-nf] (Tell me now, did they believe) Him to be the Father, or the Christ of the Father?","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":49,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"82","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Again, when Martha in a later passage acknowledged Him to be the Son of God,[fn-107-P10750_3017310:304-nf] she no more made a mistake than Peter[fn-107-P10751_3017368:305-nf] and Nathanµl[fn-107-P10752_3017403:306-nf] had; and yet, even if she had made a mistake, she would at once have learnt the truth: for, behold, when about to raise her brother from the dead, the Lord looked up to heaven, and, addressing the Father, said-as the Son, of course: \"Father, I thank Thee that Thou always hearest me; it is because of these crowds that are standing by that I have spoken to Thee, that they may believe that Thou hast sent me.\"[fn-107-P10753_3017832:307-nf] But in the trouble of His soul, (on a later occasion, ) He said: \"What shall I say?

(At another time) He said: \"I am come in my Father's name.\"[fn-107-P10755_3018185:309-nf] Accordingly, the Son's voice was indeed alone sufficient, (when addressed) to the Father. But, behold, with an abundance (of evidence)[fn-107-P10756_3018339:310-nf] the Father from heaven replies, for the purpose of testifying to the Son: \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.\"[fn-107-P10757_3018510:311-nf] So, again, in that asseveration, \"I have both glorified, and will glorify again,\"[fn-107-P10758_3018614:312-nf] how many Persons do you discover, obstinate Praxeas? Are there not as many as there are voices? You have the Son on earth, you have the Father in heaven. Now this is not a separation; it is nothing but the divine dispensation. We know, however, that God is in the bottomless depths, and exists everywhere; but then it is by power and authority. We are also sure that the Son, being indivisible from Him, is everywhere with Him. Nevertheless, in the Economy or Dispensation itself, the Father willed that the Son should be regarded[fn-107-P10759_3019166:313-nf] as on earth, and Himself in heaven; whither the Son also Him. self looked up, and prayed, and made supplication of the Father; whither also He taught us to raise ourselves, and pray, \"Our Father which art in heaven,\" etc.,[fn-107-P10760_3019414:314-nf] -although, indeed, He is everywhere present. This heaven the Father willed to be His own throne; while He made the Son to be \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-107-P10761_3019593:315-nf] by sending Him down to the earth, but meaning at the same time to \"crown Him with glory and honour,\"[fn-107-P10762_3019714:316-nf] even by taking Him back to heaven. This He now made good to Him when He said: \"I have both glorified Thee, and will glorify Thee again.\" The Son offers His request from earth, the Father gives His promise from heaven. Why, then, do you make liars of both the Father and the Son? If either the Father spake from heaven to the Son when He Himself was the Son on earth, or the Son prayed to the Father when He was Himself the Son in heaven, how happens it that the Son made a request of His own very self, by asking it of the Father, since the Son was the Father? Or, on the other hand, how is it that the Father made a promise to Himself, by making it to the Son, since the Father was the Son? Were we even to maintain that they are two separate gods, as you are so fond of throwing out against us, it would be a more tolerable assertion than the maintenance of so versatile and changeful a God as yours! Therefore it was that in the passage before us the Lord declared to the people present: \"Not on my own account has this voice addressed me, but for your sakes,\"[fn-107-P10763_3020795:317-nf] that these likewise may believe both in the Father and in the Son, severally, in their own names and persons and positions. \"Then again, Jesus exclaims, and says, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me; \"[fn-107-P10764_3021052:318-nf] because it is through the Son that men believe in the Father, while the Father also is the authority whence springs belief in the Son. \"And he that seeth me, seeth Him that sent me.\"[fn-107-P10765_3021256:319-nf] How so? Even because, (as He afterwards declares, ) \"I have not spoken from myself, but the Father which sent me: He hath given me a commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.\"[fn-107-P10766_3021462:320-nf] For \"the Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know when I ought to speak\"[fn-107-P10767_3021584:321-nf] the word which I actually speak. \"Even as the Father hath said unto me, so do I speak.\"[fn-107-P10768_3021690:322-nf] Now, in what way these things were said to Him, the evangelist and beloved disciple John knew better than Praxeas; and therefore he adds concerning i his own meaning: \"Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God, and was going to God.\"[fn-107-P10769_3022035:323-nf] Praxeas, however, would have it that it was the Father who proceeded forth from Himself, and had returned to Himself; so that what the devil put into the heart of Judas was the betrayal, not of the Son, but of the Father Himself. But for the matter of that, things have not turned out well either for the devil or the heretic; because, even in the Son's case, the treason which the devil wrought against Him contributed nothing to his advantage. It was, then, the Son of God, who was in the Son of man, that was betrayed, as the Scripture says afterwards: \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.\"[fn-107-P10770_3022679:324-nf] Who is here meant by \"God? \"Certainly not the Father, but the Word of the Father, who was in the Son of man-that is in the flesh, in which Jesus had been already glorified by the divine power and word. \"And God,\" says He, \"shall also glorify Him in Himself; \"[fn-107-P10771_3022955:325-nf] that is to say, the Father shall glorify the Son, because He has Him within Himself; and even though prostrated to the earth, and put to death, He would soon glorify Him by His resurrection, and making Him conqueror over death.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"88","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In addition to Philip's conversation, and the Lord's reply to it, the reader will observe that we have run through John's Gospel to show that many other passages of a clear purport, both before and after that chapter, are only in strict accord with that single and prominent statement, which must be interpreted agreeably to all other places, rather than in opposition to them, and indeed to its own inherent and natural sense. I will not here largely use the support of the other Gospels, which confirm our belief by the Lord's nativity: it is sufficient to remark that He who had to be born of a virgin is announced in express terms by the angel himself as the Son of God: \"The Spirit of God shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also the Holy Thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10814_3033851:359-nf] On this passage even they will wish to raise a cavil; but truth will prevail. Of course, they say, the Son of God is God, and the power of the highest is the Most High. And they do not hesitate to insinuate[fn-108-P10815_3034077:360-nf] what, if it had been true, would have been written. Whom was he[fn-108-P10816_3034156:361-nf] so afraid of as not plainly to declare, \"God shall come upon thee, and the Highest shall overshadow thee? \"Now, by saying \"the Spirit of God\" (although the Spirit of God is God, ) and by not directly naming God, he wished that portion[fn-108-P10817_3034435:362-nf] of the whole Godhead to be understood, which was about to retire into the designation of \"the Son.\" The Spirit of God in this passage must be the same as the Word. For just as, when John says, \"The Word was made flesh,\"[fn-108-P10818_3034811:363-nf] we understand the Spirit also in the mention of the Word: so here, too, we acknowledge the Word likewise in the name of the Spirit. For both the Spirit is the substance of the Word, and the Word is the operation of the Spirit, and the Two are One (and the same).[fn-108-P10819_3035093:364-nf] Now John must mean One when he speaks of Him as \"having been made flesh,\" and the angel Another when he announces Him as \"about to be born,\" if the Spirit is not the Word, and the Word the Spirit. For just as the Word of God is not actually He whose Word He is, so also the Spirit (although He is called God) is not actually He whose Spirit He is said to be. Nothing which belongs to something else is actually the very same thing as that to which it belongs. Clearly, when anything proceeds from a personal subject,[fn-108-P10820_3035989:365-nf] and so belongs to him, since it comes from him, it may possibly be such in quality exactly as the personal subject himself is from whom it proceeds, and to whom it belongs. And thus the Spirit is God, and the Word is God, because proceeding from God, but yet is not actually the very same as He from whom He proceeds. Now that which is God of God, although He is an actually existing thing,[fn-108-P10821_3036396:366-nf] yet He cannot be God Himself[fn-108-P10822_3036449:367-nf] (exclusively), but so far God as He is of the same substance as God Himself, and as being an actually existing thing, and as a portion of the Whole. Much more will \"the power of the Highest\" not be the Highest Himself, because It is not an actually existing thing, as being Spirit-in the same way as the wisdom (of God) and the providence (of God) is not God: these attributes are not substances, but the accidents of the particular substance. Power is incidental to the Spirit, but cannot itself be the Spirit. These things, therefore, whatsoever they are-(I mean) the Spirit of God, and the Word and the Power-having been conferred on the Virgin, that which is born of her is the Son of God. This He Himself, in those other Gospels also, testifies Himself to have been from His very boyhood: \"Wist ye not,\" says He, \"that I must be about my Father's business? \"[fn-108-P10823_3037397:368-nf] Satan likewise knew Him to be this in his temptations: \"Since Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10824_3037505:369-nf] This, accordingly, the devils also acknowledge Him to be: \"we know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy Son of God.\"[fn-108-P10825_3037637:370-nf] His \"Father\" He Himself adores.[fn-108-P10826_3037704:371-nf] When acknowledged by Peter as the \"Christ (the Son) of God,\"[fn-108-P10827_3037815:372-nf] He does not deny the relation. He exults in spirit when He says to the Father, \"I thank Thee, O Father, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent.\"[fn-108-P10828_3038004:373-nf] He, moreover, affirms also that to no man is the Father known, but to His Son;[fn-108-P10829_3038104:374-nf] and promises that, as the Son of the Father, He will confess those who confess Him, and deny those who deny Him, before His Father.[fn-108-P10830_3038269:375-nf] He also introduces a parable of the mission to the vineyard of the Son (not the Father), who was sent after so many servants,[fn-108-P10831_3038419:376-nf] and slain by the husbandmen, and avenged by the Father. He is also ignorant of the last day and hour, which is known to the Father only.[fn-108-P10832_3038582:377-nf] He awards the kingdom to His disciples, as He says it had been appointed to Himself by the Father.[fn-108-P10833_3038704:378-nf] He has power to ask, if He will, legions of angels from the Father for His help.[fn-108-P10834_3038807:379-nf] He exclaims that God had forsaken Him.[fn-108-P10835_3038869:380-nf] He commends His spirit into the hands of the Father.[fn-108-P10836_3038946:381-nf] After His resurrection He promises in a pledge to His disciples that He will send them the promise of His Father;[fn-108-P10837_3039083:382-nf] and lastly, He commands them to baptize into the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, not into a unipersonal God.[fn-108-P10838_3039221:383-nf] And indeed it is not once only, but three times, that we are immersed into the Three Persons, at each several mention of Their names.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Perhaps you ask whether we ever read in the Sacred Scriptures of \"grace for grace.\" Well you possess the Gospel according to John, which is perfectly clear in its very great light. Here John the Baptist says of Christ: \"Of His fulness have we all received, even grace for grace.\"[fn-60-P6061_2353277:116-nf] So that out of His fulness we have received, according to our humble measure, our particles of ability as it were for leading good lives-\"according as God hath dealt to every man his measure of faith;\"[fn-60-P6062_2353498:117-nf] because \"every man hath his proper gift of God; one after this manner, and another after that.\"[fn-60-P6063_2353614:118-nf] And this is grace. But, over and above this, we shall also receive \"grace for grace,\" when we shall have awarded to us eternal life, of which the apostle said: \"The grace of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord,\"[fn-60-P6064_2353862:119-nf] having just said that \"the wages of sin is death.\" Deservedly did he call it \"wages,\" because everlasting death is awarded as its proper due to diabolical service. Now, when it was in his power to say, and rightly to say: \"But the wages of righteousness is eternal life,\" he yet preferred to say: \"The grace of God is eternal life;\" in order that we may hence understand that God does not, for any merits of our own, but from His own divine compassion, prolong our existence to everlasting life. Even as the Psalmist says to his soul, \"Who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.\"[fn-60-P6065_2354464:120-nf] Well, now, is not a crown given as the reward of good deeds? It is, however, only because He works good works in good men, of whom it is said, \"It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure,\"[fn-60-P6066_2354705:121-nf] that the Psalm has it, as just now quoted: \"He crowneth thee with mercy and compassion,\" since it is through His mercy that we perform the good deeds to which the crown is awarded. It is not, however, to be for a moment supposed, because he said, \"It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his own good pleasure,\" that free will is taken away. If this, indeed, had been his meaning, he would not have said just before, \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.\"[fn-60-P6067_2355214:122-nf] For when the command is given \"to work,\" their free will is addressed; and when it is added, \"with fear and trembling,\" they are warned against boasting of their good deeds as if they were their own, by attributing to themselves the performance of anything good. It is pretty much as if the apostle had this question put to him: \"Why did you use the phrase, `with fear and trembling'?\" And as if he answered the inquiry of his examiners by telling them, \"For it is God which worketh in you.\" Because if you fear and tremble, you do not boast of your good works-as if they were your own, since it is God who works within you.","title":"A Treatise on Grace and Free Will.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_40_a_treatise_on_grace_and_free_will_","source_chapter":41,"source_paragraph":"133","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"The apostle also says to Timothy, \"For God hath not given to us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.\"[fn-62-P6222_2397773:223-nf] Now in respect of this passage of the apostle, we must be on our guard against supposing that we have not received the spirit of the fear of God, which is undoubtedly a great gift of God, and concerning which the prophet Isaiah says, \"The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon thee, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and piety, the spirit of the fear of the Lord.\"[fn-62-P6223_2398218:224-nf] It is not the fear with which Peter denied Christ that we have received the spirit of, but that fear concerning which Christ Himself says, \"Fear Him who hath power to destroy both soul and body in hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear Him.\"[fn-62-P6224_2398472:225-nf] This, indeed, He said, lest we should deny Him from the same fear which shook Peter; for such cowardice he plainly wished to be removed from us when He, in the preceding passage, said, \"Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.\"[fn-62-P6225_2398767:226-nf] It is not of this fear that we have received the spirit, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.

For there is no one blinded by such ignorance of this matter and the Faith as to dare to say that, although born of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary the Son of man, yet of His own free will by righteous living and by doing good works, without sin, He deserved to be the Son of God; in opposition to the gospel, which says, \"The Word was made flesh.\"[fn-65-P6525_2491957:115-nf] For where was this made flesh except in the Virginal womb, whence was the beginning of the man Christ?

For when it is said, \"Judgment without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy,\" it is plainly shown that in those in whom are found the good works of mercy, judgment shall be executed with mercy; and thus even that mercy itself shall be returned to the merits of good works. It is not so now; when not only no good works, but many bad works precede, His mercy anticipates a man so that he is delivered from evils,-as well from evils which he has done, as from those which he would have done if he were not controlled by the grace of God; and from those, too, which he would have suffered for ever if he were not plucked from the power of darkness, and transferred into the kingdom of the Son of God's love.[fn-65-P6595_2517951:152-nf] Nevertheless, since even that life eternal itself, which, it is certain, is given as due to good works, is called by so great an apostle the grace of God, although grace is not rendered to works, but is given freely, it must be confessed without any doubt, that eternal life is called grace for the reason that it is rendered to those merits which grace has conferred upon man.

But perhaps these declarations may seem to have less weight with those who wish to be instructed in divine things out of the holy Scriptures, and who seek to have it proved to them from that source how the nature of God surpasses the nature of bodies. See, therefore, if the apostle does not say the same thing, when, speaking of Christ, he declares, that\" He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature.\"[fn-62-P6271_1118211:17-nf] Not, as some suppose, that the nature of God is visible to some and invisible to others: for the apostle does not say \"the image of God invisible\" to men or \"invisible\" to sinners, but with unvarying constancy pronounces on the nature of God in these words: \"the image of the invisible God.\" Moreover, John, in his Gospel, when asserting that \"no one hath seen God at any time,\"[fn-62-P6272_1118607:18-nf] manifestly declares to all who are capable of understanding, that there is no nature to which God is visible: not as if, He were a being who was visible by nature, and merely escaped or baffled the view of a frailer creature, but because by the nature of His being it is impossible for Him to be seen. And if you should ask of me what is my opinion regarding the Only-begotten Himself, whether the nature of God, which is naturally invisible, be not visible even to Him, let not such a question appear to you at once to be either absurd or impious, because we shall give you a logical reason. It is one thing to see, and another to know: to see and to be seen is a property of bodies; to know and to be known, an attribute of intellectual being. Whatever, therefore, is a property of bodies, cannot be predicated either of the Father or of the Son; but what belongs to the nature of deity is common to the Father and the Son.[fn-62-P6273_1119550:19-nf] Finally, even He Himself, in the Gospel, did not say that no one has seen the Father, save the Son, nor any one the Son, save the Father; but His words are: \"No one knoweth the Son, save the Father; nor any one the Father, save the Son.\"[fn-62-P6274_1119827:20-nf] By which it is clearly shown, that whatever among bodily natures is called seeing and being seen, is termed, between the Father and the Son, a knowing and being known, by means of the power of knowledge, not by the frailness of the sense of sight. Because, then, neither seeing nor being seen can be properly applied to an incorporeal and invisible nature, neither is the Father, in the Gospel, said to be seen by the Son, nor the Son by the Father, but the one is said to be known by the other.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_45_book_i_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"ANF-04","text":"10. Let us now examine the expression, \"Wisdom is the purest efflux of the glory of the Almighty; \"and let us first consider what the glory of the omnipotent God is, and then we shall also understand what is its efflux. As no one can be a father without having a son, nor a master without possessing a servant, so even God cannot be called omnipotent unless there exist those over whom He may exercise His power; and therefore, that God may be shown to be almighty, it is necessary that all things should exist. For if any one would have some ages or portions of time, or whatever else he likes to call them, to have passed away, while those things which were afterwards made did not yet exist, he would undoubtedly show that during those ages or periods God was not omnipotent, but became so afterwards, viz., from the time that He began to have persons over whom to exercise power; and in this way He will appear to have received a certain increase, and to have risen from a lower to a higher condition; since there can be no doubt that it is better for Him to be omnipotent than not to be so. And now how can it appear otherwise than absurd, that when God possessed none of those things which it was befitting for Him to possess, He should afterwards, by a kind of progress, come into the possession of them? But if there never was a time when He was not omnipotent, of necessity those things by which He receives that title must also exist; and He must always have had those over whom He exercised power, and which were governed by Him either as king or prince, of which we shall speak more fully in the proper place, when we come to discuss the subject of the creatures. But even now I think it necessary to drop a word, although cursorily, of warning, since the question before us is, how wisdom is the purest efflux of the glory of the Almighty, lest any one should think that the title of Omnipotent was anterior in God to the birth of Wisdom, through whom He is called Father, seeing that Wisdom, which is the Son of God, is the purest efflux of the glory of the Almighty. Let him who is inclined to entertain this suspicion hear the undoubted declaration of Scripture pronouncing, \"In wisdom hast Thou made them all,\"[fn-63-P6317_1146264:48-nf] and the teaching of the Gospel, that \"by Him were all things made, and without Him nothing was made; \"[fn-63-P6318_1146385:49-nf] and let him understand from this that the title of Omnipotent in God cannot be older than that of Father; for it is through the Son that the Father is almighty. But from the expression \"glory of the Almighty,\" of which glory Wisdom is the efflux, this is to be understood, that Wisdom, through which God is called omnipotent, has a share in the glory of the Almighty. For through Wisdom, which is Christ, God has power over all things, not only by the authority of a ruler, but also by the voluntary obedience of subjects. And that you may understand that the omnipotence of Father and Son is one and the same, as God and the Lord are one and the same with the Father, listen to the manner in which John speaks in the Apocalypse: \"Thus saith the Lord God, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.\"[fn-63-P6319_1147219:50-nf] For who else was \"He which is to come\" than Christ? And as no one ought to be offended, seeing God is the Father, that the Saviour is also God; so also, since the Father is called omnipotent, no one ought to be offended that the Son of God is also cared omnipotent. For in this way will that saying be true which He utters to the Father, \"All Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine, and I am glorified in them.\"[fn-63-P6320_1147643:51-nf] Now, if all things which are the Father's are also Christ's, certainly among those things which exist is the omnipotence of the Father; and doubtless the only-begotten Son ought to be omnipotent, that the Son also may have all things which the Father possesses. \"And I am glorified in them,\" He declares. For \"at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and every tongue shall confess that the Lord Jesus is in the glory of God the Father.\"[fn-63-P6321_1148173:52-nf] Therefore He is the efflux of the glory of God in this respect, that He is omnipotent-the pure and limpid Wisdom herself-glorified as the efflux of omnipotence or of glory. And that it may be more clearly understood what the glory of omnipotence is, we shall add the following. God the Father is omnipotent, because He has power over all things, i.e., over heaven and earth, sun, moon, and stars, and all things in them. And He exercises His power over them by means of His Word, because at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, both of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth. And if every knee is bent to Jesus, then, without doubt, it is Jesus to whom all things are subject, and He it is who exercises power over all things, and through whom all things are subject to the Father; for through wisdom, i.e., by word and reason, not by force and necessity, are all things subject. And therefore His glory consists in this very thing, that He possesses all things, and this is the purest and most limpid glory of omnipotence, that by reason and wisdom, not by force and necessity, all things are subject. Now the purest and most limpid glory of wisdom is a convenient expression to distinguish it from that glory which cannot be called pure and sincere. But every nature which is convertible and changeable, although glorified in the works of righteousness or wisdom, yet by the fact that righteousness or wisdom are accidental qualifies, and because that which is accidental may also fall away, its glory cannot be called sincere and pure. But the Wisdom of God, which is His only-begotten Son, being in all respects incapable of change or alteration, and every good quality in Him being essential, and such as cannot be changed and converted, His glory is therefore declared to be pure and sincere.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_45_book_i_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"ANF-04","text":"1.

We have now to ascertain what those matters are which it is proper to treat in the following pages according to our dogmatic belief, i.e., in agreement with the creed of the Church. All souls and all rational natures, whether holy or wicked, were formed or created, and all these, according to their proper nature, are incorporeal; but although incorporeal, they were nevertheless created, because all things were made by God through Christ, as John teaches in a general way in his Gospel, saying, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

Without the power of the Word the Magi would not have adored the Child that a new star had pointed out to them: and without the reality of the flesh that Child would not have been ordered to be carried away into Egypt and withdrawn from Herod's persecution.

Lastly, without the power of the Word, the Lord would not have professed Himself equal to the Father, and without the reality of the flesh He would not also have said that the Father was greater than He: for the catholic Faith upholds and defends both positions, believing the only Son of God to be both Man and the Word according to the distinctive properties of His divine and human substance.","title":"Letter CXXIV.

Of course \"in the form of God\" the Son was equal to the Father, and between the Father and the Only-begotten there was no distinction in point of essence, no diversity in point of majesty: nor through the mystery[fn-22-P2213_530101:31-nf] of the Incarnation had the Word been deprived of anything which should be restored Him by the Father's gift. But \"the form of a slave\" by which the impassible Godhead fulfilled a pledge of mighty loving-kindness[fn-22-P2214_530383:32-nf] , is human weakness which was lifted up into the glory of the divine power, the Godhead and the manhood being right from the Virgin's conception so completely united that without the manhood the divine acts, and without the Godhead the human acts were not performed. For which reason as the Lord of majesty is said to have been crucified, so He who from eternity is equal with God is said to have been exalted. Nor does it matter by which substance Christ is spoken of, since the unity of His person inseparably remaining He is at once both wholly Son of man according to the flesh and wholly Son of God according to His Godhead, which is one with the Father. Whatever therefore Christ received in time, He received in virtue of His manhood, on which are conferred whatsoever it had not. For according to the power of the Word, \"all things that the Father hath\" the Son also hath indiscriminately, and what \"in the form of a slave\" He received from the Father, He also Himself gave in the form of the Father. He is in Himself at once both rich and poor; rich, because \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. This was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him was made nothing:\" and poor because \"the Word became flesh and dwelt in us[fn-22-P2215_531763:33-nf] .\" But what is that emptying of Himself, or that poverty except the receiving of the form of a slave by which the majesty of the Word was veiled, and the scheme for man's redemption carried out? For as the original chains of our captivity could not be loosed, unless a man of our race and of our nature appeared who was not under the prejudice of the old debt, and who with his untainted blood might blot out the bond of death[fn-22-P2216_532215:34-nf] , as it had from the beginning been divinely fore-ordained, so it came to pass in the fulness of the appointed time that the promise which had been proclaimed in many ways might reach its long expected fulfilment, and that thus, what had been frequently announced by one testimony after another, might have all doubtfulness removed.","title":"Letter CXXIV.

But as those who uphold this heresy are sometimes accustomed to mislead the hearts of the simple by certain deceptive sophisms, I do not consider it improper to bring forward the assertions which they are in the habit of making, and to refute their deceit and falsehood. The following, then, are their declarations. It is written, that \"no man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-65-P6540_1289485:48-nf] But that God whom Moses preaches was both seen by Moses himself, and by his fathers before him; whereas He who is announced by the Saviour has never been seen at all by any one. Let us therefore ask them and ourselves whether they maintain that He whom they acknowledge to be God, and allege to be a different God from the Creator, is visible or invisible. And if they shall say that He is visible, besides being proved to go against the declaration of Scripture, which says of the Saviour, \"He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature,\"[fn-65-P6541_1290067:49-nf] they will fall also into the absurdity of asserting that God is corporeal. For nothing can be seen except by help of form, and size, and colour, which are special properties of bodies. And if God is declared to be a body, then He will also be found to be material, since every body is composed of matter. But if He be composed of matter, and matter is undoubtedly corruptible, then, according to them, God is liable to corruption! We shall put to them a second question. Is matter made, or is it uncreated, i.e., not made? And if they shall answer that it is not made, i.e., uncreated, we shall ask them if one portion of matter is God, and the other part the world? But if they shall say of matter that it is made, it will undoubtedly follow that they confess Him whom they declare to be God to have been made!-a result which certainly neither their reason nor ours can admit. But they will say, God is invisible. And what will you do? If you say that He is invisible by nature, then neither ought He to be visible to the Saviour. Whereas, on the contrary, God, the Father of Christ, is said to be seen, because \"he who sees the Son,\" he says, \"sees also the Father.\"[fn-65-P6542_1291253:50-nf] This certainly would press us very hard, were the expression not understood by us more correctly of understanding, and not of seeing. For he who has understood the Son will understand the Father also. In this way, then, Moses too must be supposed to have seen God, not beholding Him with the bodily eye, but understanding Him with the vision of the heart and the perception of the mind, and that only in some degree. For it is manifest that He, viz., who gave answers to Moses, said, \"You shall not see My face, but My hinder parts.\"[fn-65-P6543_1291805:51-nf] These words are, of course, to be understood in that mystical sense which is befitting divine words, those old wives' fables being rejected and despised which are invented by ignorant persons respecting the anterior and posterior parts of God. Let no one indeed suppose that we have indulged any feeling of impiety in saying that even to the Saviour the Father is not visible. Let him consider the distinction which we employ in dealing with heretics. For we have explained that it is one thing to see and to be seen, and another to know and to be known, or to understand and to be understood.[fn-65-P6544_1292428:52-nf] To see, then, and to be seen, is a property of bodies, which certainly will not be appropriately applied either to the Father, or to the Son, or to the Holy Spirit, in their mutual relations with one another. For the nature of the Trinity surpasses the measure of vision, granting to those who are in the body, i.e., to all other creatures, the property of vision in reference to one another. But to a nature that is incorporeal and for the most part intellectual, no other attribute is appropriate save that of knowing or being known, as the Saviour Himself declares when He says, \"No man knoweth the Son, save the Father; nor does any one know the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him.\"[fn-65-P6545_1293230:53-nf] It is clear, then, that He has not said, \"No one has seen the Father, save the Son; \"but, \"No one knoweth the Father, save the Son.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_46_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"69","folder":"ANF-04","text":"4. Seeing, then, that all things which have been created are said to have been made through Christ, and in Christ, as the Apostle Paul most clearly indicates, when he says, \"For in Him and by Him were all things created, whether things in heaven or things on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or powers, or principalities, or dominions; all things were created by Him, and in Him; \"[fn-66-P6695_1366634:164-nf] and as in his Gospel John indicates the same thing, saying, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God: the same was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made; \"[fn-66-P6696_1366905:165-nf] and as in the Psalm also it is written,\" In wisdom hast Thou made them all; \"[fn-66-P6697_1367004:166-nf] -seeing, then, Christ is, as it were, the Word and Wisdom, and so also the Righteousness, it will undoubtedly follow that those things which were created in the Word and Wisdom are said to be created also in that righteousness which is Christ; that in created things there may appear to be nothing unrighteous or accidental, but that all things may be shown to be in conformity with the law of equity and righteousness. How, then, so great a variety of things, and so great a diversity, can be understood to be altogether just and righteous, I am sure no human power or language can explain, unless as prostrate suppliants we pray to the Word, and Wisdom, and Righteousness Himself, who is the only-begotten Son of God, and who, pouring Himself by His graces into our senses, may deign to illuminate what is dark, to lay open what is concealed, and to reveal what is secret; if, indeed, we should be found either to seek, or ask, or knock so worthily as to deserve to receive when we ask, or to find when we seek, or to have it opened to us when we knock. Not relying, then, on our own powers, but on the help of that Wisdom which made all things, and of that Righteousness which we believe to be in all His creatures, although we are in the meantime unable to declare it, yet, trusting in His mercy, we shall endeavour to examine and inquire how that great variety and diversity in the world may appear to be consistent with all righteousness and reason.

If, then, he should say that he understands what the Logos of God is according to the analogy of things with us, he will thus be led on to a loftier idea, it being an absolute necessity for him to believe that the utterance, just as everything else, corresponds with the nature. Though, that is, there is a certain sort of force, and life, and wisdom, observed in the human subject, yet no one from the similarity of the terms would suppose that the life, or power, or wisdom, were in the case of God of such a sort as that, but the significations of all such terms are lowered to accord with the standard of our nature. For since our nature is liable to corruption and weak, therefore is our life short, our strength unsubstantial, our word unstable[fn-38-P3845_2512394:9-nf] . But in that transcendent nature, through the greatness of the subject contemplated, every thing that is said about it is elevated with it. Therefore though mention be made of God's Word it will not be thought of as having its realization in the utterance of what is spoken, and as then vanishing away, like our speech, into the nonexistent. On the contrary, as our nature, liable as it is to come to an end, is endued with speech which likewise comes to an end, so that, imperishable and ever-existing nature has eternal, and substantial speech. If, then, logic requires him to admit this eternal subsistence of God's Word, it is altogether necessary to admit also that the subsistence[fn-38-P3846_2513429:10-nf] of that word consists in a living state; for it is an impiety to suppose that the Word has a soulless subsistence after the manner of stones. But if it subsists, being as it is something with intellect and without body, then certainly it lives, whereas if it be divorced from life, then as certainly it does not subsist; but this idea that the Word of God does not subsist, has been shown to be blasphemy. By consequence, therefore, it has also been shown that the Word is to be considered as in a living condition. And since the nature of the Logos is reasonably believed to be simple, and exhibits in itself no duplicity or combination, no one would contemplate the existence of the living Logos as dependent on a mere participation of life, for such a supposition, which is to say that one thing is within another, would not exclude the idea of compositeness; but, since the simplicity has been admitted, we are compelled to think that the Logos has an independent life, and not a mere participation of life. If, then, the Logos, as being life, lives[fn-38-P3847_2517220:11-nf] , it certainly has the faculty of will, for no one of living creatures is without such a faculty. Moreover that such a will has also capacity to act must be the conclusion of a devout mind. For if you admit not this potency, you prove the reverse to exist. But no; impotence is quite removed from our conception of Deity. Nothing of incongruity is to be observed in connection with the Divine nature, but it is absolutely necessary to admit that the power of that word is as great as the purpose, lest mixture, or concurrence, of contradictions be found in an existence that is incomposite, as would be the case if, in the same purpose, we were to detect both impotence and power, if, that is, there were power to do one thing, but no power to do something else. Also we must suppose that this will in its power to do all things will have no tendency to anything that is evil (for impulse towards evil is foreign to the Divine nature), but that whatever is good, this it also wishes, and, wishing, is able to perform, and, being able, will not fail to perform[fn-38-P3848_2522546:12-nf] ; but that it will bring all its proposals for good to effectual accomplishment. Now the world is good, and all its contents are seen to be wisely and skilfully ordered. All of them, therefore, are the works of the Word, of one who, while He lives and subsists, in that He is God's Word, has a will too, in that He lives; of one too who has power to effect what He wills, and who wills what is absolutely good and wise and all else that connotes superiority. Whereas, then, the world is admitted to be something good, and from what has been said the world has been shown to be the work of the Word, who both wills and is able to effect the good, this Word is other than He of whom He is the Word. For this, too, to a certain extent is a term of \"relation,\" inasmuch as the Father of the Word must needs be thought of with the Word, for it would not be word were it not a word of some one. If, then, the mind of the hearers, from the relative meaning of the term, makes a distinction between the Word and Him from whom He proceeds, we should find that the Gospel mystery, in its contention with the Greek conceptions, would not be in danger of coinciding with those who prefer the beliefs of the Jews. But it will equally escape the absurdity of either party, by acknowledging both that the living Word of God is an effective and creative being, which is what the Jew refuses to receive, and also that the Word itself,and He from whom He is, do not differ in their nature. As in our own case we say that the word is from the mind, and no more entirely the same as the mind, than altogether other than it (for, by its being from it, it is something else, and not it; still by its bringing the mind in evidence it can no longer be considered as something other than it; and so it is in its essence one with mind, while as a subject it is different), in like manner, too, the Word of God by its self-subsistence is distinct from Him from whom it has its subsistence; and yet by exhibiting in itself those qualities which are recognized in God it is the same in nature with Him who is recognizable by the same distinctive marks. For whether one adopts goodness[fn-38-P3849_2524822:13-nf] , or power, or wisdom, or eternal existence, or the incapability of vice, death, and decay, or an entire perfection, or anything whatever of the kind, to mark one's conception of the Father, by means of the same marks he will find the Word that subsists from Him.","title":"The Great Catechism","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_39_the_great_catechism","source_chapter":48,"source_paragraph":"150","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"For, while all things else that are born are subject to the impulse of those that beget them, the spiritual birth is dependent on the power of him who is being born.

For we ought, in my opinion, to take into consideration the sequel of this matter; which many of those who come to the grace of baptism[fn-40-P4072_2704620:118-nf] overlook, being led astray, and self-deceived, and indeed only seemingly, and not really, regenerate. For that change in our life which takes place through regeneration will not be change, if we continue in the state in which we were. I do not see how it is possible to deem one who is still in the same condition, and in whom there has been no change in the distinguishing features of his nature, to be any other than he was, it being palpable to every one that it is for a renovation and change of our nature that the saving birth is received. And yet human nature does not of itself admit of any change in baptism; neither the reason, nor the understanding, nor the scientific faculty, nor any other peculiar characteristic of man is a subject for change. Indeed the change would be for the worse if any one of these properties of our nature were exchanged away[fn-40-P4073_2705905:119-nf] for something else. If, then, the birth from above is a definite refashioning of the man, and yet these properties do not admit of change, it is a subject for inquiry what that is in him, by the changing of which the grace of regeneration is perfected. It is evident that when those evil features which mark our nature have been obliterated a change to a better state takes place. If, then, by being \"washed,\" as says the Prophet[fn-40-P4074_2706395:120-nf] , in that mystic bath we become \"clean\" in our wills and \"put away the evil\" of our souls, we thus become better men, and are changed to a better state. But if, when the bath has been applied to the body, the soul has not cleansed itself from the stains of its passions and affections, but the life after initiation keeps on a level with the uninitiate life, then, though it may be a bold thing to say, yet I will say it and will not shrink; in these cases the water is but water, for the gift of the Holy Ghost in no ways appears in him who is thus baptismally born; whenever, that is, not only the deformity of anger[fn-40-P4075_2707032:121-nf] , or the passion of greed, or the unbridled and unseemly thought, with pride, envy, and arrogance, disfigures the Divine image, but the gains, too, of injustice abide with him, and the woman he has procured by adultery still even after that ministers to his pleasures. If these and the like vices, after, as before, surround the life of the baptized, I cannot see in what respects he has been changed; for I observe him the same man as he was before. The man whom he has unjustly treated, the man whom he has falsely accused, the man whom he has forcibly deprived of his property, these, as far as they are concerned, see no change in him though he has been washed in the laver of baptism. They do not hear the cry of Zacchaeus from him as well: \"If I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore fourfold[fn-40-P4076_2708002:122-nf] .\" What they said of him before his baptism, the same they now more fully declare; they call him by the same names, a covetous person, one who is greedy of what belongs to others, one who lives in luxury at the cost of men's calamities. Let such an one, therefore, who remains in the same moral condition as before, and then babbles to himself of the beneficial change he has received from baptism, listen to what Paul says: \"If a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself[fn-40-P4077_2708532:123-nf] .\" For what you have not become, that you are not. \"As many as received Him,\" thus speaks the Gospel of those who have been born again, \"to them gave He power to become the sons of God[fn-40-P4078_2708736:124-nf] .\" Now the child born of any one is entirely of a kindred nature with his parent. If, then, you have received God, if you have become a child of God, make manifest in your disposition the God that is in you, manifest in yourself Him that begot you. By the same marks whereby we recognize God, must this relationship to God of the son so born be exhibited. \"He openeth His hand and filleth every living thing with His good pleasure.\" \"He passeth over transgressions.\" \"He repenteth Him of the evil.\" \"The Lord is good to all, and bringeth not on us His anger every day.\" \"God is a righteous Lord, and there isno injustice in Him[fn-40-P4079_2709386:125-nf] ;\" and all other sayings of the like kind which are scattered for our instruction throughout the Scripture;-if you live amidst such things as these, you are a child of God indeed; but if you continue with the characteristic marks of vice in you, it is in vain that you babble to yourself of your birth from above.

Consider whether the Apostle does not say the same thing when he speaks thus of Christ:[fn-86-P8668_2177702:32-nf] \"Who is the image of the invisible God, the first born of every creature.\" The nature of God is not, as some think, visible to some and not to others, for the Apostle does not say The image of God who is invisible to men, or to sinners; but he speaks quite distinctly of the nature of God in itself, where he says \"The image of the invisible God.\" John also says in his Gospel,[fn-86-P8669_2178097:33-nf] \"No man hath seen God at any time,\" by which he distinctly declares: to all who can understand, that there is no being to whom God is visible; not as if he were naturallyvisible and, like a being of attenuated substance.escaped and eluded our glance; but that, in his own nature it is impossible for him to be seen. But perhaps you will ask me my opinion as to the Only begotten himself. Well, if I should say that even to him the nature of God is invisible, since it is its very nature to be invisible, do not dismiss my answer as if it were impious or absurd, for I will at once give you my reason for it. Observe that seeing is a different thing from knowing. Seeing and being seen belong to bodies; to know and to be known belong to the intellectual nature. Whatever then is merely a property of bodies, this we must not attribute to the Father or the Son; but that which belongs to the nature of Deity governs the relations of the Father and the Son. Moreover, Christ himself in the Gospel[fn-86-P8670_2179109:34-nf] did not say \"No man seeth the Son but the Father nor the Father but the Son,\" but \"No man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither doth any one know the Father but the Son.\" By this it is clearly shown that what is called seeing and being seen in the case of bodily existence is called knowledge in the case of the Father and the Son: their intercourse is maintained through the power of knowledge not through the weakness of visibility. Since, therefore, an incorporeal nature cannot properly be said to see or to be seen, therefore in the Gospel it is not said either that the Father is seen by the Son or the Son by the Father but that each is known by the other. And if any one should ask how it is that it is said[fn-86-P8671_2179846:35-nf] \"Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God,\" I think that this text wilt confirm my assertion still more.

Let us abide in our\nnature, that in the day of judgment He may cause us to partake of His nature. Our Lord took from us a\npledge when He went, and He left us a pledge of His own when he ascended.

He needs nothing from us, but that we should adorn\nour temples for Him; that when the time is accomplished and He goes to His Father, He may give thanks\nto Him because of us, because we have honoured Him.

Therefore, if the mere nature of water, in that it is the appropriate material for washing away, leads men to flatter themselves with a belief in omens of purification, how much more truly will waters render that service through the authority of God, by whom all their nature has been constituted! If men think that water is endued with a medicinal virtue by religion, what religion is more effectual than that of the living God? Which fact being acknowledged, we recognise here also the zeal of the devil rivalling the things of God,[fn-115-P11513_3257652:30-nf] while we find him, too, practising baptism in his subjects. What similarity is there? The unclean cleanses! the ruiner sets free! the damned absolves! He will, forsooth, destroy his own work, by washing away the sins which himself inspires! These (remarks) have been set down by way of testimony against such as reject the faith; if they put no trust in the things of God, the spurious imitations of which, in the case of God's rival, they do trust in. Are there not other cases too, in which, without any sacrament, unclean spirits brood on waters, in spurious imitation of that brooding[fn-115-P11514_3258269:31-nf] of the Divine Spirit in the very beginning? Witness all shady founts, and all unfrequented brooks, and the ponds in the baths, and the conduits[fn-115-P11515_3258431:32-nf] in private houses, or the cisterns and wells which are said to have the property of \"spiriting away,\"[fn-115-P11516_3258546:33-nf] through the power, that is, of a hurtful spirit. Men whom waters have drowned[fn-115-P11517_3258637:34-nf] or affected with madness or with fear, they call nymph-caught,[fn-115-P11518_3258717:35-nf] or \"lymphatic,\" or\" hydro-phobic.\" Why have we adduced these instances? Lest any think it too hard for belief that a holy angel of God should grant his presence to waters, to temper them to man's salvation; while the evil angel holds frequent profane commerce with the selfsame element to man's ruin. If it seems a novelty for an angel to be present in waters, an example of what was to come to pass has forerun. An angel, by his intervention, was wont to stir the pool at Bethsaida.[fn-115-P11519_3259258:36-nf] They who were complaining of ill-health used to watch for him; for whoever had been the first to descend into them, after his washing, ceased to complain. This figure of corporeal healing sang of a spiritual healing, according to the rule by which things carnal are always antecedent[fn-115-P11520_3259728:37-nf] as figurative of things spiritual. And thus, when the grace of God advanced to higher degrees among men,[fn-115-P11521_3259861:38-nf] an accession of efficacy was granted to the waters and to the angel. They who[fn-115-P11522_3259960:39-nf] were wont to remedy bodily defects,[fn-115-P11523_3260034:40-nf] now heal the spirit; they who used to work temporal salvation[fn-115-P11524_3260108:41-nf] now renew eternal; they who did set free but once in the year, now save peoples in a body[fn-115-P11525_3260225:42-nf] daily, death being done away through ablution of sins. The guilt being removed, of course the penalty is removed too. Thus man will be restored for God to His \"likeness,\" who in days bygone had been conformed to \"the image\" of God; (the \"image\" is counted (to be) in his form: the \"likeness\" in his eternity: ) for he receives again that Spirit of God which he had then first received from His afflatus, but had afterward lost through sin.","title":"On Baptism.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_49_on_baptism_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The baptism announced by John formed the subject, even at that time, of a question, proposed by the Lord Himself indeed to the Pharisees, whether that baptism were heavenly, or truly earthly:[fn-115-P11595_3269976:96-nf] about which they were unable to give a consistent[fn-115-P11596_3270071:97-nf] answer, inasmuch as they understood not, because they believed not.

Every day she was intent on fasting except on the Sabbath and the Lord's Day and the times of holy days, not as yielding to desire of refreshment, but out of respect for religion. For this is that which is said: \"Whether ye eat or drink, all is to be done in the name of Jesus Christ,\"[fn-74-P7446_1927965:47-nf] that even the very refreshment of the body is to have respect to the worship of holy religion. So then, holy Judith,[fn-74-P7447_1928101:48-nf] strengthened by lengthened mourning and by daily fasting, sought not the enjoyments of the world regardless of danger, and strong in her contempt for death. In order to accomplish her stratagem she put on that robe of mirth, wherewith in her husband's lifetime she was wont to be clothed, as though she would give pleasure to her husband, if she freed her country. But she saw another man whom she was seeking to please, even Him, of Whom it is said: \"After me cometh a Man Who is preferred before me.\"[fn-74-P7448_1928625:49-nf] And she did well in resuming her bridal ornaments when about to fight, for the reminders of wedlock are the arms of chastity, and in no other way could a widow please or gain the victory.","title":"The Treatise Concerning Widows.","author":"St. Ambrose"},{"chapter":1,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_51_on_prayer_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The prayer begins with a testimony to God, and with the reward of faith, when we say, \"Our Father who art in the heavens; \"for (in so saying), we at once pray to God, and commend faith, whose reward this appellation is.

And that which participates in eternity is wont to be assimilated to the incorruptible: so that to us appertains the designation of the age of childhood, a lifelong spring-time, because the truth that is in us, and our habits saturated with the truth, cannot be touched by old age; but Wisdom is ever blooming, ever remains consistent and the same, and never changes. \"Their children,\" it is said, \"shall be borne upon their shoulders, and fondled on their knees; as one whom his mother comforteth, so also shall I comfort you.\"[fn-33-P3369_1005538:44-nf] The mother draws the children to herself; and we seek our mother the Church. Whatever is feeble and tender, as needing help on account of its feebleness, is kindly looked on, and is sweet and pleasant, anger changing into help in the case of such: for thus horses' colts, and the little calves of cows, and the lion's whelp, and the stag's fawn, and the child of man, are looked upon with pleasure by their fathers and mothers. Thus also the Father of the universe cherishes affection towards those who have fled to Him; and having begotten them again by His Spirit to the adoption of children, knows them as gentle, and loves those alone, and aids and fights for them; and therefore He bestows on them the name of child. The word Isaac I also connect with child. Isaac means laughter. He was seen sporting with his wife and helpmeet Rebecca by the prying king.[fn-33-P3370_1006423:45-nf] The king, whose name was Abimelech, appears to me to represent a supramundane wisdom contemplating the mystery of sport. They interpret Rebecca to mean endurance. O wise sport, laughter also assisted by endurance, and the king as spectator! The spirit of those that are children in Christ, whose lives are ordered in endurance, rejoice. And this is the divine sport. \"Such a sport, of his own, Jove sports,\" says Heraclitus. For what other employment is seemly for a wise and perfect man, than to sport and be glad in the endurance of what is good-and, in the administration of what is good, holding festival with God? That which is signified by the prophet may be interpreted differently,-namely, of our rejoicing for salvation, as Isaac. He also, delivered from death, laughed, sporting and rejoicing with his spouse, who was the type of the Helper of our salvation, the Church, to whom the stable name of endurance is given; for this cause surely, because she alone remains to all generations, rejoicing ever, subsisting as she does by the endurance of us believers, who are the members of Christ. And the witness of those that have endured to the end, and the rejoicing on their account, is the mystic sport, and the salvation accompanied with decorous solace which brings us aid. The King, then, who is Christ, beholds from above our laughter, and looking through the window, as the Scripture says, views the thanksgiving, and the blessing, and the rejoicing, and the gladness, and furthermore the endurance which works together with them and their embrace: views His Church, showing only His face, which was wanting to the Church, which is made perfect by her royal Head. And where, then, was the door by which the Lord showed Himself? The flesh by which He was manifested. He is Isaac (for the narrative may be interpreted otherwise), who is a type of the Lord, a child as a son; for he was the son of Abraham, as Christ the Son of God, and a sacrifice as the Lord, but he was not immolated as the Lord. Isaac only bore the wood of the sacrifice, as the Lord the wood of the cross. And he laughed mystically, prophesying that the Lord should fill us with joy, who have been redeemed from corruption by the blood of the Lord. Isaac did everything but suffer, as was right, yielding the precedence in suffering to the Word. Furthermore, there is an intimation of the divinity of the Lord in His not being slain. For Jesus rose again after His burial, having suffered no harm, like Isaac released from sacrifice. And in defence of the point to be established, I shall adduce another consideration of the greatest weight. The Spirit calls the Lord Himself a child, thus prophesying by Esaias: \"Lo, to us a child has been born, to us a son has been given, on whose own shoulder the government shall be; and His name has been called the Angel of great Counsel.\" Who, then, is this infant child? He according to whose image we are made little children. By the same prophet is declared His greatness: \"Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace; that He might fulfil His discipline: and of His peace there shall be no end.\"[fn-33-P3371_1009594:46-nf] O the great God! O the perfect child! The Son in the Father, and the Father in the Son. And how shall not the discipline of this child be perfect, which extends to all, leading as a schoolmaster us as children who are His little ones? He has stretched forth to us those hands of His that are conspicuously worthy of trust. To this child additional testimony is borne by John, \"the greatest prophet among those born of women: \"[fn-33-P3372_1010038:47-nf] Behold the Lamb of God!\"[fn-33-P3373_1010082:48-nf] For since Scripture calls the infant children lambs, it has also called Him-God the Word-who became man for our sakes, and who wished in all points to be made like to u\"-\"the Lamb of God\"-Him, namely, that is the Son of God, the child of the Father.","title":"Book I","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":1,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_52_book_i","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"49","folder":"ANF-02","text":"Further release from evils is the beginning of salvation.

So great indeed was he, that he was taken for Christ; and if he had not himself testified that he was not He, the mistakewould have continued, and he would have been, reputed to be the Christ. What striking humility! Honour was proffered him by the people, and he himself refused it. Men were at fault in his greatness, and he humbled himself.

But we cannot say that nothing was made by Him, when we observe it written that all things were made by Him. He is not therefore subsequent to all things; that is, He is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since God is prior to all things. For He is before all things, because all things are by Him, while if He were only man, nothing would be by Him; or if all things were by Him, He would not be man only, because if He were only man, all things would not be by Him; nay, nothing would be by Him. What, then, do they reply? That nothing is by Him, so that He is man only? How then are all things by Him? Therefore He is not man only, but God also, since all things are by Him; so that we reasonably ought to understand that Christ is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since by Him all things were made. For how can you say that He is man only, when you see Him also in the flesh, unless because when both aspects are considered, both truths are rightly believed?","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And yet the heretic still shrinks from urging that Christ is God, whom he perceives to be proved God by so many words as well as facts.

He came down therefore from whence He came, in the same manner as He goes thither from whence He descended. Whence if Christ were only man, He would not have come thence, and therefore would not depart thither, because He would riot have come thence. Moreover, by coming thence, whence as man He could not have come, He shows Himself to have come as God. For the Jews, ignorant and untaught in the matter of this very descent of His, made these heretics their successors, seeing that to them it is said, \"Ye know not whence I come, and whither I go: ye judge after the flesh.\" As much they as the Jews, holding that the carnal birth of Christ was the only one, believed that Christ was nothing else than man; not considering this point, that as man could not come from heaven, so as that he might return thither, He who descended thence must be God, seeing that man could not come thence.

Or if He does not speak falsely, He is not of this world; He is therefore not man only, because He is not of this world. But that it should not be a secret who He was, He declared whence He was: \"I,\" said He, \"am from above,\" that is, from heaven, whence man cannot come, for he was not made in heaven. He is God, therefore, who is from above, and therefore He is not of this world; although, moreover, in a certain manner He is of this word: wherefore Christ is not God only, but man also. As reasonably in the way in which He is not of this world according to the divinity of the Word, so He is of this world according to the frailty of the body that He has taken upon Him. For man is joined with God, and God is linked with man. But on that account this Christ here laid more stress on the one aspect of His sole divinity, because the Jewish blindness contemplated in Christ the aspect alone of the flesh; and thence in the present passage He passed over in silence the frailty of the body, which is of the world, and spoke of His divinity alone, which is not of the world: so that in proportion as they had inclined to believe Him to be only man, in that proportion Christ might draw them to consider His divinity, so as to believe Him to be God, desirous to overcome their incredulity concerning His divinity by omitting in the meantime any mention of His human condition, and by setting before them His divinity alone. If Christ is man only, how does He say, \"I proceeded forth and came from God,\"[fn-102-P10240_3196072:105-nf] when it is evident that man was made by God, and did not proceed forth from Him? But in the way in which as man He proceeded not from God, thus the Word of God proceeded, of whom it is said, \"My heart hath uttered forth a good Word; \"[fn-102-P10241_3196330:106-nf] which, because it is from God, is with reason also with God. And this, too, since it was not uttered without effect, reasonably makes all things: \"For all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-102-P10242_3196565:107-nf] But this Word whereby all things were made (is God). \"And God,\" says he, \"was the Word.\"[fn-102-P10243_3196673:108-nf] Therefore God proceeded from God, in that the Word which proceeded is God, who proceeded forth from God. If Christ is only man, how does He say, \"If any man shall keep my word, he shall not see death for ever? \"[fn-102-P10244_3196904:109-nf] Not to see death for ever! what is this but immortality? But immortality is the associate of divinity, because both the divinity is immortal, and immortality is the fruit of divinity. For every man is mortal; and immortality cannot be from that which is mortal. Therefore from Christ, as a mortal man, immortality cannot arise. \"But,\" says He, \"whosoever keepeth my word, shall not see death for ever; \"therefore the word of Christ affords immortality, and by immortality affords divinity. But although it is not possible to maintain that one who is himself mortal can make another immortal, yet this word of Christ not only sets forth, but affords immortality: certainly He is not man only who gives immortality, which if He were only man He could not give; but by giving divinity by immortality, He proves Himself to be God by offering divinity, which if He were not God He could not give. If Christ was only man, how did He say, \"Before Abraham was, I Am? \"[fn-102-P10245_3197889:110-nf] For no man can be before Him from whom he himself is; nor can it be that any one should have been prior to him of whom he himself has taken his origin. And yet Christ, although He is born of Abraham, says that He is before Abraham. Either, therefore, He says what is not true, and deceives, if He was not before Abraham, seeing that He was of Abraham; or He does not deceive, if He is also God, and was before Abraham. And if this were not so, it follows that, being of Abraham, He could not be before Abraham. If Christ was only man, how does He say, \"And I know them, and my sheep follow me; and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish? \"[fn-102-P10246_3198572:111-nf] And yet, since every man is bound by the laws of mortality, and therefore is unable to keep himself for ever, much more will he be unable to keep another for ever. But Christ promises to give salvation for ever, which if He does not give, He is a deceiver; if He gives, He is God. But He does not deceive, for He gives what He promises. Therefore He is God who proffers eternal salvation, which man, being unable to keep himself for ever, cannot be able to give to another. If Christ is only man, what is that which He says, \"I and the Father are one? \"[fn-102-P10247_3199149:112-nf] For how can it be that \"I and the Father are one,\" if He is not both God and the Son?-who may therefore be called one, seeing that He is of Himself, being both His Son, and being born of Him, being declared to have proceeded from Him, by which He is also God; which when the Jews thought to be hateful, and believed to be blasphemous, for that He had shown Himself in these discourses to be God, and therefore rushed at once to stoning, and set to work passionately to hurl stones, He strongly refuted His adversaries by the example and witness of the Scriptures. \"If,\" said He, \"He called them gods to whom the words of God were given, and the Scriptures cannot be broken, ye say of Him whom the Father sanctified, and sent into this world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God.\"[fn-102-P10248_3199967:113-nf] By which words He did not deny Himself to be God, but rather He confirmed the assertion that He was God. For because, undoubtedly, they are said to be gods unto whom the words of God were given, much more is He God who is found to be superior to all these. And nevertheless He refuted the calumny of blasphemy in a fitting manner with lawful tact.[fn-102-P10249_3200338:114-nf] For He wishes that He should be thus understood to be God, as the Son of God, and He would not wish to be understood to be the Father Himself. Thus He said that He was sent, and showed them that He had manifested many good works from the Father; whence He desired that He should not be understood to be the Father, but the Son. And in the latter portion of His defence He made mention of the Son, not the Father, when He said, \"Ye say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God.\" Thus, as far as pertains to the guilt of blasphemy, He calls Himself the Son, not the Father; but as pertaining to His divinity, by saying, \"I and the Father are one,\" He proved that He was the Son of God.

But God made man in the image of God; He is therefore God who made man in the image of God; therefore Christ is God: so that with reason neither does the testimony of the Old Testament waver concerning the person of Christ, being supported by the manifestation of the New Testament; nor is the power of the New Testament detracted from, while its truth is resting on the roots of the same Old Testament. Whence they who presume Christ the Son of God and man to be only man, and not God also, do so in opposition to both Old and New Testaments, in that they corrupt the authority and the truth both of the Old and New Testaments. What if the same Moses everywhere introduces God the Father infinite and without end, not as being enclosed in any place, but as one who includes every place; nor as one who is in a place, but rather one in whom every place is, containing all things and embracing all things, so that with reason He can neither descend nor ascend, because He Himself both contains and fills all things, and yet nevertheless introduces God descending to consider the tower which the sons of men were building, asking and saying, \"Come; \"and then, \"Let us go down and there confound their tongues, that each one may not understand the words of his neighbour.\"[fn-102-P10270_3212070:129-nf] Whom do they pretend here to have been the God who descended to that tower, and asking to visit those men at that time? God the Father? Then thus He is enclosed in a place; and how does He embrace all things? Or does He say that it is an angel descending with angels, and saying, \"Come; \"and subsequently, \"Let us go down and there confound their tongues? \"And yet in Deuteronomy we observe that God told these things, and that God said, where it is written, \"When He scattered abroad the children of Adam, He determined the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God.\"[fn-102-P10271_3212684:130-nf] Neither, therefore, did the Father descend, as the subject itself indicates; nor did an angel command these things, as the fact shows.

What if the same Moses introduces God saying, \"Let us make man after our image and likeness; \"[fn-102-P10268_3210133:127-nf] and below, \"And God made man; in the image of God made He him, male and female made He them? \"[fn-102-P10269_3210248:128-nf] If, as we have already shown, it is the Son of God by whom all things were made, certainly it was the Son of God by whom also man was ordained, on whose account all things were made. Moreover, when God commands that man should be made, He is said to be God who makes man; but the Son of God makes man, that is to say, the Word of God, \"by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.\" And this Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us: therefore Christ is God; therefore man was made by Christ as by the Son of God. But God made man in the image of God; He is therefore God who made man in the image of God; therefore Christ is God: so that with reason neither does the testimony of the Old Testament waver concerning the person of Christ, being supported by the manifestation of the New Testament; nor is the power of the New Testament detracted from, while its truth is resting on the roots of the same Old Testament. Whence they who presume Christ the Son of God and man to be only man, and not God also, do so in opposition to both Old and New Testaments, in that they corrupt the authority and the truth both of the Old and New Testaments. What if the same Moses everywhere introduces God the Father infinite and without end, not as being enclosed in any place, but as one who includes every place; nor as one who is in a place, but rather one in whom every place is, containing all things and embracing all things, so that with reason He can neither descend nor ascend, because He Himself both contains and fills all things, and yet nevertheless introduces God descending to consider the tower which the sons of men were building, asking and saying, \"Come; \"and then, \"Let us go down and there confound their tongues, that each one may not understand the words of his neighbour.\"[fn-102-P10270_3212070:129-nf] Whom do they pretend here to have been the God who descended to that tower, and asking to visit those men at that time? God the Father? Then thus He is enclosed in a place; and how does He embrace all things? Or does He say that it is an angel descending with angels, and saying, \"Come; \"and subsequently, \"Let us go down and there confound their tongues? \"And yet in Deuteronomy we observe that God told these things, and that God said, where it is written, \"When He scattered abroad the children of Adam, He determined the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God.\"[fn-102-P10271_3212684:130-nf] Neither, therefore, did the Father descend, as the subject itself indicates; nor did an angel command these things, as the fact shows. Then it remains that He must have descended, of whom the Apostle Paul says, \"He who descended is the same who ascended above all the heavens, that He might fill all things,\"[fn-102-P10272_3213072:131-nf] that is, the Son of God, the Word of God. But the Word of God was made flesh, and dwelt among us. This must be Christ. Therefore Christ must be declared to be God.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":23,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And indeed I could set forth the treatment of this subject by all heavenly Scriptures, and set in motion, so to speak, a perfect forest of texts concerning that manifestation of the divinity of Christ, except that I have not so much undertaken to speak against this special form of heresy, as to expound the rule of truth concerning the person of Christ. Although, however, I must hasten to other matters, I do not think that I must pass over this point, that in the Gospel the Lord declared, by way of signifying His majesty, saying, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will build it up again.\"[fn-103-P10320_3237144:166-nf] Or when, in another passage, and on another subject, He declares, \"I have power to lay down my life, and again to take it up; for this commandment I have received of my Father.\"[fn-103-P10321_3237343:167-nf] Now who is it who says that He can lay down His life, or can Himself recover His life again, because He has received it of His Father? Or who says that He can again resuscitate and rebuild the destroyed temple of His body, except because He is the Word who is from the Father, who is with the Father, \"by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made; \"[fn-103-P10322_3237732:168-nf] the imitator[fn-103-P10323_3237764:169-nf] of His Father's works and powers, \"the image of the invisible God; \"[fn-103-P10324_3238147:170-nf] \"who came down from heaven; \"[fn-103-P10325_3238197:171-nf] who testified what things he had seen and heard; who \"came not to do His own will, but rather to do the will of the Father,\"[fn-103-P10326_3238347:172-nf] by whom He had been sent for this very purpose, that being made the \"Messenger of Great Counsel,\"[fn-103-P10327_3238466:173-nf] He might unfold to us the laws of the heavenly mysteries; and who as the Word made flesh dwelt among us, of us this Christ is proved to be not man only, because He was the son of man, but also God, because He is the Son of God? And if by the apostle Christ is called \"the first-born of every creature,\"[fn-103-P10328_3238789:174-nf] how could He be the first-born of every creature, unless because according to His divinity the Word proceeded from the Father before every creature? And unless the heretics receive it thus, they will be constrained to show that Christ the man was the first-born of every creature; which they will not be able to do. Either, therefore, He is before every creature, that He may be the first-born of every creature, and He is not man only, because man is after every creature; or He is man only, and He is after every creature. And how is He the first-born of every creature, except because being that Word which is before every creature; and therefore, the first-born of every creature, He becomes flesh and dwells in us, that is, assumes that man's nature which is after every creature, and so dwells with him and in him, in us, that neither is humanity taken away from Christ, nor His divinity denied? For if He is only before every creature, humanity is taken away from Him; but if He is only man, the divinity which is before every creature is interfered with. Both of these, therefore, are leagued together in Christ, and both are conjoined, and both are linked with one another. And rightly, as there is in Him something which excels the creature, the agreement of the divinity and the humanity seems to be pledged in Him: for which reason He who is declared as made the \"Mediator between God and man\"[fn-103-P10329_3240515:175-nf] is revealed to have associated in Himself God and man. And if the same apostle says of Christ, that \"having put off the flesh, He spoiled powers, they being openly triumphed over in Himself,\"[fn-103-P10330_3240729:176-nf] he certainly did not without a meaning propound that the flesh was put off, unless because he wished it to be understood that it was again put on also at the resurrection. Who, therefore, is He that thus put off and put on the flesh? Let the heretics seek out. For we know that the Word of God was invested with the substance of flesh, and that He again was divested of the same bodily material, which again He took up in the resurrection and resumed as a garment. And yet Christ could neither have been divested of nor invested with manhood, had He been only man: for man is never either deprived of nor invested with himself. For that must be something else, whatever it may be, which by any other is either taken away or put on. Whence, reasonably, it was the Word of God who put off the flesh, and again in the resurrection put it on, since He put it off because at His birth He had been invested with it. Therefore in Christ it is God who is invested, and moreover must be divested, because He who is invested must also likewise be He who is divested; whereas, as man, He is invested with and divested of, as it were, a certain tunic of the compacted body.[fn-103-P10331_3241913:177-nf] And therefore by consequence He was, as we have said, the Word of God, who is revealed to be at one time invested, at another time divested of the flesh. For this, moreover, He before predicted in blessings: \"He shall wash His garment in wine, and His clothing in the blood of the grape.\"[fn-103-P10332_3242355:178-nf] If the garment in Christ be the flesh, and the clothing itself be the body, let it be asked who is He whose body is clothing, and garment flesh? For to us it is evident that the flesh is the garment, and the body the clothing of the Word; and He washed His bodily substance, and purified the material of the flesh in blood, that is, in wine, by His passion, in the human character that He had undertaken. Whence, if indeed He is washed, He is man, because the garment which is washed is the flesh; but He who washes is the Word of God, who, in order that He might wash the garment, was made the taker-up of the garment. Rightly, from that substance which is taken that it might be washed, He is revealed as a man, even as from the authority of the Word who washed it He is manifested to be God.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"ANF-05","text":"But the material of that heretical error has arisen. as I judge, from this, that they think that there is no distinction between the Son of God and the Son of man; because if a distinction were made, Jesus Christ would easily be proved to be both man and God. For they will have it that the self-same that is man, the Son of man, appears also as the Son of God; that man and flesh and that same frail substance may be said to be also the Son of God Himself. Whence, since no distinction is discerned between the Son of man and the Son of God, but the Son of man Himself is asserted to be the Son of God, the same Christ and the Son of God is asserted to be man only; by which they strive to exclude, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\"[fn-103-P10349_3252679:186-nf] And ye shall call His name Emmanuel; which is, interpreted, God with us.\"[fn-103-P10350_3252773:187-nf] For they propose and put forward what is told in the Gospel of Luke, whence they strive to maintain not what is the truth, but only what they want it to be: \"The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shah overshadow thee; therefore also the Holy Thing which is born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\"[fn-103-P10351_3253126:188-nf] If, then, say they, the angel of God says to Mary, \"that Holy Thing which is born of thee,\" the substance of flesh and body is of Mary; but he has set forth that this substance, that is, that Holy Thing which is born of her, is the Son of God. Man, say they, himself, and that bodily flesh; that which is called holy, itself is the Son of God. That also when the Scripture says that \"Holy Thing,\" we should understand thereby Christ the man, the Son of man; and when it places before us the Son of God, we ought to perceive, not man, but God. And yet the divine Scripture easily convicts and discloses the frauds and artifices of the heretics. For if it were thus only, \"The Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore that Holy Thing which is born of thee shall be called the Son of God,\" perchance we should have had to strive against them in another sort, and to have sought for other arguments, and to have taken up other weapons, with which to overcome both their snares and their wiles; but since the Scripture itself, abounding in heavenly fulness, divests itself of the calumnies of these heretics, we easily depend upon that that is written, and overcome those errors without any hesitation. For it said, not as we have already stated, \"Therefore the Holy Thing which shall be born of thee; \"but added the conjunction, for it says, \"Therefore also that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee,\" so as to make it plain that that Holy Thing which is born of her-that is, that substance of flesh and body-is not the Son of God primarily, but consequently, and in the secondary place;[fn-103-P10352_3254782:189-nf] but primarily, that the Son of God is the Word of God, incarnate by that Spirit of whom the angel says, \"The Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.\" For He is the legitimate Son of God who is of God Himself; and He, while He assumes that Holy Thing, and links to Himself the Son of man, and draws Him and transfers Him to Himself, by His connection and mingling of association becomes responsible for and makes Him the Son of God, which by nature He was not, so that the original cause[fn-103-P10353_3255523:190-nf] of that name Son of God is in the Spirit of the Lord, who descended and came, and that there is only the continuance of the name in the case of the Son of man;[fn-103-P10354_3255706:191-nf] and by consequence He reasonably became the Son of God, although originally He is not the Son of God. And therefore the angel, seeing that arrangement, and providing for that order of the mystery, did not confuse every thing in such a way as to leave no trace of a distinction, but established the distinction by saying, \"Therefore also that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God; \"lest, had he not arranged that distribution with his balances, but had left the matter all mixed up in confusion, it had really afforded occasion to heretics to declare that the Son of man, in that He is man, is the same as the Son of God and man. But now, explaining severally the ordinance and the reason of so great a mystery, he evidently set forth in saying, \"And that Holy Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God; \"the proof that the Son of God descended, and that He, in taking up into Himself the Son of man, consequently made Him the Son of God, because the Son of God associated and joined Him to Himself. So that, while the Son of man cleaves in His nativity to the Son of God, by that very mingling He holds that as pledged and derived which of His own nature He could not possess. And thus by the word of the angel the distinction is made, against the desire of the heretics, between the Son of God and man; yet with their association, by pressing them to understand that Christ the Son of man is man, and also to receive the Son of God and man the Son of God; that is, the Word of God as it is written as God; and thus to acknowledge that Christ Jesus the Lord, connected on both sides, so to speak, is on both sides woven in and grown together, and associated in the same agreement of both substances, by the binding to one another of a mutual alliance-man and God by the truth of the Scripture which declares this very thing.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"98","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And now, indeed, concerning the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, let it be sufficient to have briefly said thus much, and to have laid down these points concisely, without carrying them out in a lengthened argument.

Master, that Paul also is our master, or with the truth that one is good, that Christ also is called good; on the same reasoning, let them understand that, from the fact that God is one, no obstruction arises to the truth that Christ also is declared to be God.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_44_oration_xxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XVII.

For Scripture says, God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.[fn-46-P4639_1474213:19-nf] And again,-We know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit Itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered;[fn-46-P4640_1474380:20-nf] and I will pray with the Spirit and I will pray with the understanding also;[fn-46-P4641_1474477:21-nf] -that is, in the mind and in the Spirit. Therefore to adore or to pray to the Spirit seems to me to be simply Himself offering prayer or adoration to Himself. And what godly or learned man would disapprove of this, because in fact the adoration of One is the adoration of the Three, because of the equality of honour and Deity. between the Three? So I will not be frightened by the argument that all things are said to have been made by the Son;[fn-46-P4642_1474944:22-nf] as if the Holy Spirit also were one of these things. For it says all things that were made, and not simply all things. For the Father was not, nor were any of the things that were not made. Prove that He was made, and then give Him to the Son, and number Him among the creatures; but until you can prove this you will gain nothing for your impiety from this comprehensive phrase. For if He was made, it was certainly through Christ; I myself would not deny that. But if He was not made, how can He be either one of the All, or through Christ? Cease then to dishonour the Father in your opposition to the Only-begotten (for it is no real honour, by presenting to Him a creature to rob Him of what is more valuable, a Son), and to dishonour the Son in your opposition to the Spirit. For He is not the Maker of a Fellow servant, but He is glorified with One of co-equal honour. Rank no part of the Trinity with thyself, lest thou fall away from the Trinity; cut not off from Either the One and equally august Nature; because if thou overthrow any of the Three thou wilt have overthrown the whole. Better to take a meagre view of the Unity than to venture on a complete impiety.","title":"Oration XXXII.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":1,"verse":48,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_36_sermon_xix_lxix_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"4.

For the Virgin conceived Him not by lust, but by faith. He came into the Virgin, who was before the Virgin. He made choice of her whom He created, He created her whom He designed to choose. He brought to the Virgin fruitfulness: He took not away her unimpaired purity. He then who came to thee without the irritation of the leaves of the fig-tree, \"when thou wast under the fig-tree,\" saw thee. Make ready then to see Him in His height of glory,[fn-38-P3842_1664255:17-nf] by whom in His pity thou wast seen. But because the top is high, think of the foundation.

What are we to do then? By what to discern them? Be very attentive; let us go together in heart, and knock. Charity herself keeps watch; for it is none other than she that shall knock, she also that shall open: anon ye shall understand in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Already ye have heard that it was said above, \"Whoso denieth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, the same is an antichrist.\" There also we asked, Who denies? because neither do we deny, nor do those deny. And we found that some do in their deeds deny;[fn-44-P4413_2385604:55-nf] and we brought testimony from the apostle, who saith, \"For they confess that they know God, but in their deedsdeny Him.\"[fn-44-P4414_2385752:56-nf] Thus then let us now also make the enquiry in the deeds not in the tongue. What is the spirit that is not from God? That \"which denieth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.\" And what is the spirit that is from God? That \"which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.\" Who is he that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh? Now, brethren, to the mark! let us look to the works, not stop at the noise of the tongue. Let us ask why Christ came in the flesh, so we get at the persons who deny that He is come in the flesh. If thou stop at tongues, why, thou shalt hear many a heresy confessing that Christ is come in the flesh: but the truth convicteth those men. Wherefore came Christ in the flesh? Was He not God? Is it not written of Him, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God?\"[fn-44-P4415_2386614:57-nf] Was it not He that did feed angels, is it not He that doth feed angels? Did He not in such sort come hither, that He departed not thence? Did He not in such sort ascend, that He forsook not us? Wherefore then came He in the flesh? Because it behooved us to have the hope of resurrection shown unto us. God He was, and in flesh He came; for God could not die, flesh could die; He came then in the flesh, that He might die for us. But how died He for us? \"Greater charity than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\"[fn-44-P4416_2387171:58-nf] Charity therefore broughtHim to the flesh. Whoever therefore has not charity denies that Christ is come in the flesh. Here then do thou now question all heretics. Did Christ come in the flesh? \"He did come; this I believe, this I confess.\" Nay, this thou deniest. \"How do I deny? Thou hearest that I say it!\" Nay, I convict thee of denying it. Thou sayest with the voice, deniest with the heart; sayest in words, deniest in deeds. \"How,\" sayest thou, \"do I deny in deeds?\" Because the end for which Christ came in the flesh, was, that He might die for us. He died for us, because therein He taught much charity. \"Greater charity than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" Thou hast not charity, seeing thou for thine own honor dividest unity. Therefore by this understand ye the spirit that is from God. Give the earthen vessels a tap, put them to the proof, whether haply they be cracked and give a dull sound: see whether they ring full and clear, see whether charity be there. Thou takest thyself away from the unity of the whole earth, thou dividest the Church by schisms, thou rendest the Body of Christ. He came in the flesh, to gather in one, thou makest an outcry to scatter abroad. This then is the Spirit, of God, which saith that Jesus is come in the fleshy which saith, not in tongue but in deeds, which saith, not by making a noise but by loving. And that spirit is not of God, which denies that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh I denies, here also, not in tongue but in life; not in words but in deeds.

If any of you perchance wish to keep charity, brethren, above all things do not imagine it to be an abject and sluggish thing; nor that charity is to be preserved by a sort of gentleness, nay not gentleness, but tameness and listlessness.[fn-44-P4476_2415321:35-nf] Not so is it preserved. Do not imagine that thou then lovest thy servant when thou dost not beat him, or that thou then lovest thy son when thou givest him not discipline, or that thou then lovest thy neighbor when thou dost not rebuke him: this is not charity, but mere feebleness. Let charity be fervent to correct, to amend: but if there be good manners, let them delight thee; if bad, let them be amended, let them be corrected. Love not in the man his error, but the man: for the man God made, the error the man himself made. Love that which God made, love not that which the man himself made. When thou lovest that, thou takest away this: whenthou esteemest that, thou amendest this. But even if thou be severe[fn-44-P4477_2416099:36-nf] at any time, let it be because of love, for correction. For thiscause was charity betokenedby the Dove which descended upon the Lord.[fn-44-P4478_2416246:37-nf] That likeness of a dove, the likeness in which came the Holy Ghost, by whom charity should be shed forth into us: wherefore was this? The dove hath no gall: yet with beak and wings she fights for her young; hers is a fierceness without bitterness. And so does also a father; when he chastises his son, for discipline he chastises him. As I said, the kidnapper, in order that he may sell, inveigles the child with bitter endearments; a father, that he may correct, does without gall chastise. Such be ye to all men. See here, brethren, a great lesson, a great rule: each one of you has children, or wishes to have; or if he has altogether determined to have no children after the flesh, at least spiritually he desires to have children:-what father does not correct his son? what son does not his father discipline? And yet he seems to be fierce[fn-44-P4479_2417134:38-nf] with him. It is the fierceness of love, the fierceness of charity: a sort of fierceness without gall after the manner of the dove, not of the raven. Whence it came into my mind, my brethren, to tell you, that those violaters of charity are they that have made the schism: as they hate charity itself, so they hate also the dove.

John the Baptist, when predicting that the Son of God was to appear immediately, not in that body and soul, but as manifesting Himself everywhere, says regarding Him: \"There stands in the midst of you One whom ye know not, who cometh after me.\"[fn-80-P8056_1972020:31-nf] For if he had thought that the Son of God was only there, where was the visible body of Jesus, how could he have said, \"There stands in the midst of you One whom ye know not? \"And Jesus Himself, in raising the minds of His disciples to higher thoughts of the Son of God, says: \"Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of you.\"[fn-80-P8057_1972401:32-nf] And of the same nature is His promise to His disciples: \"Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.\"[fn-80-P8058_1972536:33-nf] And we quote these passages, making no distinction between the Son of God and Jesus. For the soul and body of Jesus formed, after the oi0konomi/a, one being with the Logos of God.

And I do not yet, in this connection, see how in the world the inventor of philosophy and dialectics, as some suppose, is seduced through being deceived by the form of speech which consists in ambiguity.

The Apostle Paul also speaks of certain men who had erred concerning the truth, and were overthrowing the faith of some; whose word was eating as a canker. Yet in saying that they should be avoided, he nevertheless intimates that they were all in one great house, but as vessels to dishonor,-I suppose because they had not as yet gone out. Or if they had already gone out, how can he say that they were in the same great house with the honorable vessels, unless it was in virtue of the sacraments themselves, which even in the severed meetings of heretics are not changed, that he speaks of all as belonging to the same great house, though in different degrees of esteem, some to honor and some to dishonor? For thus he speaks in his Epistle to Timothy: \"But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness. And their word will eat as doth a canker; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

Further, they teach that John, the disciple of the Lord, indicated the first Ogdoad, expressing themselves in these words: John, the disciple of the Lord, wishing to set forth the origin of all things, so as to explain how the Father produced the whole, lays down a certain principle,-that, namely, which was first-begotten by God, which Being he has termed both the only-begotten Son and God, in whom the Father, after a seminal manner, brought forth all things. By him the Word was produced, and in him the whole substance of the Aeons, to which the Word himself afterwards imparted form. Since, therefore, he treats of the first origin of things, he rightly proceeds in his teaching from the beginning, that is, from God and the Word. And he expresses himself thus: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with God.\"[fn-63-P6335_1457928:118-nf] Having first of all distinguished these three-God, the Beginning, and the Word-he again unites them, that he may exhibit the production of each of them, that is, of the Son and of the Word, and may at the same time show their union with one another, and with the Father. For \"the beginning\" is in the Father, and of the Father, while \"the Word\" is in the beginning, and of the beginning. Very properly, then, did he say, \"In the beginning was the Word,\" for He was in the Son; \"and the Word was with God,\" for He was the beginning; \"and the Word was God,\" of course, for that which is begotten of God is God. \"The same was in the beginning with God\"-this clause discloses the order of production. \"All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made; \"[fn-63-P6336_1458712:119-nf] for the Word was the author of form and beginning to all the Aeons that came into existence after Him. But \"what was made in Him,\" says John, \"is life.\"[fn-63-P6337_1458883:120-nf] Here again he indicated conjunction; for all things, he said, were made by Him, but in Him was life. This, then, which is in Him, is more closely connected with Him than those things which were simply made by Him, for it exists along with Him, and is developed by Him. When, again, he adds, \"And the life was the light of men,\" while thus mentioning Anthropos, he indicated also Ecclesia by that one expression, in order that, by using only one name, he might disclose their fellowship with one another, in virtue of their conjunction.

He knew Him, indeed, as the Son of God, the Bridegroom, of whose fullness all should receive; but whereas of His fullness he himself had so received the power of baptizing that it should be called the baptism of John, he did not know whether He would so give it to others also, or whether He would have His own baptism in such wise, that at whosesoever hands it was given, whether by a man that brought forth fruit a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or thirtyfold, whether by the wheat or by the chaff, it should be known to be of Him alone; and this he learned through the Spirit descending like a dove, and abiding on Him.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_140_homily_ix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"9. \"Let us love,[fn-45-P4597_2481001:32-nf] because He first loved us.\"[fn-45-P4598_2481046:33-nf] For how should we love, except He had first loved us? By loving we became friends: but He loved us as enemies, that we might be made friends. He first loved us, and gave us the gift of loving Him.

Where then in Scripture do we find Jesus uncomely and deformed, as we have found Him comely and \"beauteous in loveliness surpassing the sons of men?\" where find we Him also deformed? Ask Esaias: \"And we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness.\"[fn-46-P4602_2483717:37-nf] There now are two flutes which seem to make discordant sounds: howbeit one Spirit breathes into both.

Turn not away thine ears, apply the understanding.

From which fact, it is evident that the Word, the Artificer of all, He that sitteth upon the cherubim, and contains all things, He who was manifested to men, has given us the Gospel under four aspects, but bound together by one Spirit. As also David says, when entreating His manifestation, \"Thou that sittest between the cherubim, shine forth.\"[fn-75-P7508_2016346:144-nf] For the cherubim, too, were four-faced, and their faces were images of the dispensation of the Son of God. For, [as the Scripture] says, \"The first living creature was like a lion,\"[fn-75-P7509_2016548:145-nf] symbolizing His effectual working, His leadership, and royal power; the second [living creature] was like a calf, signifying [His] sacrificial and sacerdotal order; but \"the third had, as it were, the face as of a man,\"-an evident description of His advent as a human being; \"the fourth was like a flying eagle,\" pointing out the gift of the Spirit hovering with His wings over the Church. And therefore the Gospels are in accord with these things, among which Christ Jesus is seated. For that according to John relates His original, effectual, and glorious generation from the Father, thus declaring, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-75-P7510_2017251:146-nf] Also, \"all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\" For this reason, too, is that Gospel full of all confidence, for such is His person.[fn-75-P7511_2017425:147-nf] But that according to Luke, taking up [His] priestly character, commenced with Zacharias the priest offering sacrifice to God. For now was made ready the fatted calf, about to be immolated for[fn-75-P7512_2017749:148-nf] the finding again of the younger son. Matthew, again, relates His generation as a man, saying, \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham; \"[fn-75-P7513_2017973:149-nf] and also, \"The birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise.\" This, then, is the Gospel of His humanity;[fn-75-P7514_2018095:150-nf] for which reason it is, too, that [the character of] a humble and meek man is kept up through the whole Gospel. Mark, on the other hand, commences with [a reference to] the prophetical spirit coming down from on high to men, saying, \"The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in Esaias the prophet,\"-pointing to the winged aspect of the Gospel; and on this account he made a compendious and cursory narrative, for such is the prophetical character. And the Word of God Himself used to converse with the ante-Mosaic patriarchs, in accordance with His divinity and glory; but for those under the law he instituted a sacerdotal and liturgical service.[fn-75-P7515_2018868:151-nf] Afterwards, being made man for us, He sent the gift of the celestial Spirit over all the earth, protecting us with His wings. Such, then, as was the course followed by the Son of God, so was also the form of the living creatures; and such as was the form of the living creatures, so was also the character of the Gospel.[fn-75-P7516_2019471:152-nf] For the living creatures are quadriform, and the Gospel is quadriform, as is also the course followed by the Lord. For this reason were four principal (kaqolikai/) covenants given to the human race:[fn-75-P7517_2019777:153-nf] one, prior to the deluge, under Adam; the second, that after the deluge, under Noah; the third, the giving of the law, under Moses; the fourth, that which renovates man, and sums up all things in itself by means of the Gospel, raising and bearing men upon heavenly kingdom.its wings into the","title":"Book III.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_60_book_iii_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"ANF-01","text":"2.

We speak of man, servant, curator (curatorem),-man, by reason of substance; servant, by reason of genus or condition; curator, by reason of denomination. We speak also of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: these, however, are not names which have only supervened at some after period, but they are subsistences. Again, the denomination of man is not in actual fact a denomination, but a substance common to men, and is the denomination proper to all men. Moreover, names are such as these,-Adam, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob: these, I say, are names. But the Divine Persons are names indeed: and the names are still the persons; and the persons then signify that which is and subsists,-which is the essence of God. The name also of the nature signifies subsistence;[fn-8-P886_242600:3-nf] as if we should speak of the man. All (the persons) are one nature, one essence, one will, and are called the Holy Trinity; and these also are haines subsistent, one nature in three persons, and one genus. But the person of the Son is composite in its oneness (unita est), being one made up of two, that is, of divinity and humanity together, which two constitute one. Yet the divinity does not consequently receive any increment, but the Trinity remains as it was. Nor does anything new befall the persons even or the names, but these are eternal and without time. No one, however, was sufficient to know these until the Son being made flesh manifested them, saying: \"Father, I have manifested Thy name to men; glorify Thou me also, that they may know me as Thy Son.\"[fn-8-P887_243472:4-nf] And on the mount the Father spake, and said, \"This is my beloved Son.\"[fn-8-P888_243560:5-nf] And the same sent His Holy Spirit at the Jordan. And thus it was declared to us that there is an Eternal Trinity in equal honour. Besides, the generation of the Son by the Father is incomprehensible and ineffable; and because it is spiritual, its investigation becomes impracticable: for a spiritual object can neither be understood nor traced by a corporeal object, for that is far removed from human nature. We men know indeed the generation proper to us, as also that of other objects; but a spiritual matter is above human condition, neither can it in any manner be understood by the minds of men. Spiritual substance can neither perish nor be dissolved; ours, however, as is easy to understand, perishes and is dissolved. How, indeed, could it be possible for man, who is limited on six sides-by east, west, south, north, deep, and sky-understand a matter which is above the skies, which is beneath the deeps, which stretches beyond the north and south, and which is present in every place, and fills all vacuity? But if, indeed, we are able to scrutinize spiritual substance, its excellence truly would be undone. Let us consider what is done in our body; and, furthermore, let us see whether it is in our power to ascertain in what manner thoughts are born of the heart, and words of the tongue, and the like. Now, if we can by no means apprehend things that are done in ourselves, how could it ever be that we should understand the mystery of the uncreated Creator, which goes beyond every mind? Assuredly, if this mystery were one that could be penetrated by man, the inspired John would by no means have affirmed this: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-8-P889_245243:6-nf] He then, whom no man hath seen at any time,-whom can we reckon Him to resemble, so that thereby we should understand His generation? And we, indeed, without ambiguity apprehend that our soul dwells in us in union with the body; but still, who has ever seen his own soul? who has been able to discern its conjunction with his body? This one thing is all we know certainly, that there is a soul within us conjoined with the body. Thus, then, we reason and believe that the Word is begotten by the Father, albeit we neither possess nor know the clear rationale of the fact. The Word Himself is before every creature-eternal froth the Eternal, like spring from spring, and light from light. The vocable Word, indeed, belongs to those three genera of words which are named in Scripture, and which are not substantial,-namely, the word conceived,[fn-8-P890_246100:7-nf] the word uttered,[fn-8-P891_246140:8-nf] and the word articulated.[fn-8-P892_246182:9-nf] The word conceived, certainly, is not substantial. The word uttered, again, is that voice which the prophets hear from God, or the prophetic speech itself; and even this is not substantial. And, lastly, the word articulated is the speech of man formed forth in air (aere efformatus), composed of terms, which also is not substantial.[fn-8-P893_246532:10-nf] But the Word of God is substantial, endowed with an exalted and enduring nature, and is eternal with Himself, and is inseparable from Him, and can never fall away, but shall remain in an everlasting union. This Word created heaven and earth, and in Him were all things made. He is the arm and the power of God, never to be separated from the Father, in virtue of an indivisible nature, and, together with the Father, He is without beginning. This Word took our substance of the Virgin Mary; and in so far as He is spiritual indeed, He is indivisibly equal with the Father; but in so far as He is corporeal, He is in like manner inseparably equal with us. And, again, in so far as He is spiritual, He supplies in the same equality (aequiparat) the Holy Spirit, inseparably and without limit. Neither were there two natures, but only one nature of the Holy Trinity before the incarnation of the Word, the Son; and the nature of the Trinity remained one also after the incarnation of the Son. But if any one, moreover, believes that any increment has been given to the Trinity by reason of the assumption of humanity by the Word, he is an alien from us, and from the ministry of the Catholic and Apostolic Church. This is the perfect, holy, Apostolic faith of the holy God. Praise to the Holy Trinity for ever through the ages of the ages. Amen.","title":"On the Trinity.","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_57_book_vi_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"128","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"54.

For these are mystical expressions,[fn-46-P4693_2522612:56-nf] in which the point always to be considered is, not what the actual things are, but what they denote as signs: since they are signs of things, and what they are in their essence is one thing, what they are in their signification another. If then we understand the things signified, we do find these things to be of one substance. Thus, if we should say, the rock and the water are one, meaning by the Rock, Christ; by the water, the Holy Ghost: who doubts that rock and water are two different substances? yet because Christ and the Holy Spirit are of one and the same nature, therefore when one says, the rock and the water are one, this can be rightly taken in this behalf, that these two things of which the nature is diverse, are signs of other things of which the nature is one. Three things then we know to have issued from the Body of the Lord when He hung upon the tree: first, the spirit: of which it is written, \"And He bowed the head and gave up the spirit:\"[fn-46-P4694_2523863:57-nf] then, as His side was pierced by the spear, \"blood and water.\" Which three things if we look at as they are in themselves, they are in substance several land distinct, and therefore they are not one. But if we will inquire into the things signified I by these, there not unreasonably comes into our thoughts the Trinity itself, which is the One, Only, True, Supreme God, Father and Son and Holy Ghost, of whom it could most truly be said, \"There are Three Witnesses, and the Three are One:\" so that by the term Spirit we should understand God the Father to be signified; as indeed it was concerning the worshipping of Him that the Lord was speaking, when He said, \"God is a Spirit:\"[fn-46-P4695_2524563:58-nf] by the term, blood, the Son; because \"the Word was made flesh:\"[fn-46-P4696_2524650:59-nf] and by the term water, the Holy Ghost; as, when Jesus spake of the water which He would give to them that thirst, the evangelist saith, \"But this said He of the Spirit which they that believed on Him were to receive.\"[fn-46-P4697_2524886:60-nf] Moreover, that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are \"Witnesses,\" who that believes the Gospel can doubt, when the Son saith, \"I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me, He beareth witness of me.\"[fn-46-P4698_2525122:61-nf] Where, though the Holy Ghost is not mentioned, yet He is not to be thought separated from them. Howbeit neither concerning the Spirit hath He kept silence elsewhere, and that He too is a witness hath been sufficiently and openly shown. For in promising Him He said, \"He shall bear witness of me.\"[fn-46-P4699_2525438:62-nf] These are the \"Three Witnesses, and the Three are One, because of one substance. But whereas, the signs by which they were signified came forth from the Body of the Lord, herein they figured the Church preaching the Trinity, that it hath one and the same nature: since these Three in threefold manner signified are One, and the Church that preacheth them is the Body of Christ. In this manner then the three things by which they are signified came out from the Body: of the Lord: like as from the Body of the Lord sounded forth the command to \"baptize the nations in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-47-P4700_2526088:63-nf] \"In the name:\" not, In the names: for \"these Three are One,\" and One God is these Three. And if in any other way this depth of mystery which we read in John's epistle can be expounded and understood agreeably with the Catholic faith, which neither confounds nor divides the Trinity, neither believes the substances diverse nor denies that the persons are three, it is on no account to be rejected. For whenever in Holy Scriptures in order to exercise the minds of the faithful any thing is put darkly, it is to be joyfully welcomed if it can be in many ways but not unwisely expounded.","title":"Homily X.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_141_homily_x_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"And if the Son be not of the same substance as the Father, then is He a made substance: if a made substance, then not \"all things were made by Him:\" but, \"all things were made by Him;\"[fn-47-P4737_2540663:82-nf] therefore, He is of one and the same substance with the Father.

And now it is from no spirit of contention that we answer the assertions of Celsus; but it is in the spirit of truth that we investigate them, as assenting to his view that \"He is the God, not of inordinate desires, nor of error and disorder, but of a nature just and upright,\" because He is the source of all that is good. And that He is able to provide an eternal life for the soul we acknowledge; and that He possesses not only the \"power,\" but the \"will.\" In view, therefore, of these considerations, we are not at all distressed by the assertion of Heraclitus, adopted by Celsus, that \"dead bodies are to be cast out as more worthless than dung; \"and yet, with reference even to this, one might say that dung, indeed, ought to be cast out, while the dead bodies of men, on account of the soul by which they were inhabited, especially if it had been virtuous, ought not to be cast out.

And this was the reason why Moses vested the high priest after this fashion. Something also alludes to the end [of all things], as [where He speaks of] the fine brass burning in the fire, which denotes the power of faith, and the continuing instant in prayer, because of the consuming fire which is to come at the end of time.

For what man of right understanding does not perceive, that what are created and made are external to the maker; but the Son, as the foregoing argument has shewn, exists not externally, but from the Father who begat Him? for man too both builds a house and begets a son, and no one would reverse things, and say that the house or the ship were begotten by the builder[fn-33-P3306_1304664:88-nf] , but the son was created and made by him; nor again that the house was an image of the maker, but the son unlike him who begat him; but rather he will confess that the son is an image of the father, but the house a work of art, unless his mind be disordered, and he beside himself.

For if you say the Son, you have declared what is from the Father by nature; and if you think of the Word, you are thinking again of what is from Him, and what is inseparable; and, speaking of Wisdom, again you mean just as much, what is not from without, but from Him and in Him; and if you name the.

And we have proof of this, not from external sources, but from the Scriptures; for God Himself says by Isaiah the Prophet; `My hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand hath spanned the heavens[fn-33-P3344_1320281:119-nf] .' And again, `And I will cover thee in the shadow of My Hand, by which I planted the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth[fn-33-P3345_1320437:120-nf] .' And David being taught this, and knowing that the Lord's Hand was nothing else than Wisdom, says in the Psalm, `In wisdom hast Thou made them all; the earth is full of Thy creation[fn-33-P3346_1320639:121-nf] .' Solomon also received the same from God, and said, `The Lord by wisdom founded the earth[fn-33-P3347_1320751:122-nf] ,' and John, knowing that the Word was the Hand and the Wisdom, thus preached, `In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made[fn-33-P3348_1321040:123-nf] .' And the Apostle, seeing that the Hand and the Wisdom and the Word was nothing else than the Son, says, `God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom also He made the ages[fn-33-P3349_1321391:124-nf] .' And again, `There is one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him[fn-33-P3350_1321515:125-nf] .' And knowing also that the Word, the Wisdom, the Son Himself was the Image of the Father, he says in the Epistle to the Colossians, `Giving thanks to God and the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son; in whom we have redemption, even the remission of sins; who is the Image of the Invisible God, the First-born of every creature; for by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by Him and for Him; and He is before all things, and in Him all things consist[fn-33-P3351_1322300:126-nf] .' For as all things are created by the Word, so, because He is the Image, are they also created in Him[fn-33-P3352_1322426:127-nf] . And thus anyone who directs his thoughts to the Lord, will avoid stumbling upon the stone of offence, but rather will go forward to the brightness in the light of truth; for this is really the doctrine of truth, though these contentious men burst with spite[fn-33-P3353_1322925:128-nf] , neither religious toward God, nor abashed at their confutation.","title":"De Decretis or Defence of the Nicene Definition","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_34_de_decretis_or_defence_of_the_nicene_definition","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"31.

And for the proof of this point, out of which no question arises, he adduces the example of John, in that he was examined by those who asked him who he claimed to be,[fn-56-P5693_2747548:67-nf] and that he also in turn examined those to whom he says, \"O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?\"[fn-56-P5694_2747700:68-nf] What has this to do with the subject?

So much favor indeed was shown to him, that credence would at once have been given to whatever he might have said about himself. If, therefore, we are to follow this precedent in declaring that each several baptizer is now to be examined, then each must also be believed, whatever he may say of himself. But who is there that is made up of deceit, whom we know that the Holy Spirit flees from, in accordance with the Scripture,[fn-56-P5695_2748625:69-nf] who would not wish the best to be believed of him, or who would hesitate to bring this about by the use of any words within his reach?

Do not therefore any longer say, \"The conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient,\" lest you be asked, When a stain on the conscience of the giver is concealed, who cleanses the conscience of the recipient? And when you shall have answered, Either God or an angel (since there is no other answer which you possibly can make), then should follow a consequence whereby you would be confounded: Those then are justified with greater holiness who are baptized by undetected evil men, so as to be cleansed by God or by an angel, than those who are baptized by men who are genuinely and manifestly good, who cannot be compared with God or with the angels. But prevail upon yourselves to say what is said by Truth and by the Catholic Church, that not only when the minister of baptism is evil, but also when he is holy and good, hope is still not to be placed in man, but in Him that justifieth the ungodly, in whom if any man believe, his faith is counted for righteousness.[fn-57-P5795_2802999:105-nf] For when we say, Christ baptizes, we do not mean by a visible ministry, as Petilianus believes, or would have men think that he believes, to be our meaning, but by a hidden grace, by a hidden power in the Holy Spirit as it is said of Him by John the Baptist, \"The same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-57-P5796_2803331:106-nf] Nor has He, as Petilianus says, now ceased to baptize; but He still does it, not by any ministry of the body, but by the invisible working of His majesty. For in that we say, He Himself baptizes, we do not mean, He Himself holds and dips in the water the bodies of the believers; but He Himself invisibly cleanses, and that He does to the whole Church without exception.

For the Lord says, \"Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works.\"[fn-58-P5800_2804848:110-nf] And this is therefore the injunction that is given us against evil stewards, that the good things of God should be received at their hands, but that we should beware of their own evil life, by reason of its unlikeness to what they thus dispense.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_47_sermon_xxx_lxxx_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"5.

So then neither could He have death in that which was His own, nor we life in that which was our own; but we have life from that which is His, He death from what is ours. What an exchange! What hath He given, and what received? Men who trade enter into commercial intercourse for exchange of things. For ancient commerce was only an exchange of things. A man gave what he had, and received what he had not. For example, he had wheat, but had no barley; another had barley, but no wheat; the former gave the wheat which he had, and received the barley which he had not. How[fn-43-P4362_1851246:16-nf] simple it was that the larger quantity should make up for the cheaper sort! So then another man gives barley, to receive wheat; lastly, another gives lead, to receive silver, only he gives much lead against a little silver; another gives wool, to receive a ready-made garment. And who can enumerate all these exchanges? But no one gives life to receive death. Not in vain then was the voice of the. Physician as He hung upon the tree.

He died, was buried, rose again, having passed forty days with His disciples, He ascended into heaven, He sent the Holy Ghost on them, who waited for the promise. They were filled with the Holy Ghost, whom they had received, and began to speak with the tongues of all nations. Then the Jews who were present, amazed that unlearned and ignorant men, whom they had known as brought up among them with one tongue, should in the Name of Christ speak in all tongues, were in astonishment, and learnt from Peter's words whence this gift came.

For He had nothing Himself, whereby He could die; nor had we anything whereby we could live. For what was He who had nothing whereby He could die? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"[fn-43-P4361_1850462:15-nf] If thou seek for anything in God whereby He may die, thou wilt not find it. But we all die, who are flesh; men bearing about sinful flesh. Seek out for that whereby sin may live; it hath it not. So then neither could He have death in that which was His own, nor we life in that which was our own; but we have life from that which is His, He death from what is ours. What an exchange! What hath He given, and what received? Men who trade enter into commercial intercourse for exchange of things. For ancient commerce was only an exchange of things. A man gave what he had, and received what he had not. For example, he had wheat, but had no barley; another had barley, but no wheat; the former gave the wheat which he had, and received the barley which he had not. How[fn-43-P4362_1851246:16-nf] simple it was that the larger quantity should make up for the cheaper sort! So then another man gives barley, to receive wheat; lastly, another gives lead, to receive silver, only he gives much lead against a little silver; another gives wool, to receive a ready-made garment. And who can enumerate all these exchanges? But no one gives life to receive death. Not in vain then was the voice of the. Physician as He hung upon the tree. For in order that He might die for us because the Word could not die, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.\"[fn-43-P4363_1851816:17-nf] He hung upon the Cross, but in the flesh. There was the meanness,[fn-43-P4364_1851899:18-nf] which the Jews despised; there the dearness,[fn-43-P4365_1851958:19-nf] by which the Jews were delivered. For for them was it said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.\"[fn-43-P4366_1852088:20-nf] And that voice was not in vain. He died, was buried, rose again, having passed forty days with His disciples, He ascended into heaven, He sent the Holy Ghost on them, who waited for the promise. They were filled with the Holy Ghost, whom they had received, and began to speak with the tongues of all nations. Then the Jews who were present, amazed that unlearned and ignorant men, whom they had known as brought up among them with one tongue, should in the Name of Christ speak in all tongues, were in astonishment, and learnt from Peter's words whence this gift came. He gave it, who hung upon the tree. He gave it, who was derided as He hung upon the tree, that from His seat in heaven He might give the Holy Spirit. They of whom He had said, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,\" heard, believed. They believed, were baptized, and their conversion was effected. What conversion? In faith they drank the Blood of Christ, which in fury they had shed.","title":"Sermon XXX. [LXXX.

He understands not what he hears from the Lord, understands not what he hears from the Light, \"which lighteth every man that cometh into this world.\"[fn-7-P713_345345:11-nf] Already hath the Lord said to him, \"Except a man be born again, he shall not see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto Him, How can a man be born again when he is old?\" The Spirit speaks to him, and he thinks of the flesh. He thinks of his own flesh, because as yet he thinks not of Christ's flesh. For when the Lord Jesus had said, \"Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he shall not have life in him,\" some who followed Him were offended, and said among themselves, \"This is a hard saying; who can hear it?\" For they fancied that, in saying this, Jesus meant that they would be able to cook Him, after being cut up like a lamb, and eat Him: horrified at His words, they went back, and no more followed Him. Thus speaks the evangelist: \"And the Lord Himself remained with the twelve; and they said to Him, Lo, those have left Thee. And He said, Will ye also go away?\"-wishing to show them that He was necessary to them, not they necessary to Christ. Let no man fancy that he frightens Christ, when he tells Him that he is a Christian; as if Christ will be more blessed if thou be a Christian.

She is the boast and glory of virgins, and the exultation of mothers. She is the sure support of the believing, and the succourer[fn-12-P1203_304004:13-nf] of the pious. She is the vesture of light, and the domicile of virtue.[fn-12-P1204_304104:14-nf] She is the ever-flowing fountain, wherein the water of life sprang and produced the Lord's incarnate manifestation. She is the monument of righteousness; and all who become lovers of her, and set their affections on virgin-like ingenuousness and purity, shall enjoy the grace of angels. All who keep themselves from wine and intoxication, and from the wanton enjoyments of strong drink, shall be made glad with the products of the life-bearing plant. All who have preserved the lamp of virginity unextinguished shall be privileged to receive the amaranthine crown of immortality. All who have possessed themselves of the stainless robe of temperance shall be received into the mystical bride-chamber of righteousness. All who have come nearer the angelic degree than others shall also enter into the more real enjoyment of their Lord's beatitude. All who have possessed the illuminating oil of understanding, and the pure incense of conscience, shall inherit the promise of spiritual favour and the spiritual adoption. All who worthily observe the festival of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary, the mother of God, acquire as their meet recompense the fuller interest in the message, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured!\" It is our duty, therefore, to keep this feast, seeing that it has tilled the whole world with joy and gladness. And let us keep it with psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs. Of old did Israel also keep their festival, but then it was with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, of which the prophet says: \"I will turn their feasts into afflictions and lamentation, and their joy into shame.\"[fn-12-P1205_305734:15-nf] But our afflictions our Lord has assured us He will turn into joy by the fruits of penitence.[fn-12-P1206_305848:16-nf] And again, the first covenant maintained the righteous requirements[fn-12-P1207_305936:17-nf] of a divine service, as in the case of our forefather Abraham; but these stood in the inflictions of pain in the flesh by circumcision, until the time of the fulfilment. \"The law was given to them through Moses\" for their discipline; \"but grace and truth\" have been given to us by Jesus Christ.[fn-12-P1208_306277:18-nf] The beginning of all these blessings to us appeared in the annunciation to Mary, the highly-favoured, in the economy of the Saviour which is worthy of all praise, and in His divine and supra-mundane instruction. Thence rise the rays of the light of understanding upon us. Thence spring for us the fruits of wisdom and immortality, sending forth the clear pure streams of piety. Thence come to us the brilliant splendours of the treasures of divine knowledge. \"For this is life eternal, that we may know the true God, and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent.\"[fn-12-P1209_306848:19-nf] And again, \"Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life.\"[fn-12-P1210_306946:20-nf] For on this account the treasure of the knowledge of God is revealed to them who search the divine oracles. That treasure of the inspired Scriptures the Paraclete has unfolded to us this day. And let the tongue of prophecy and the doctrine of apostles be the treasure of wisdom to us; for without the law and the prophets, or the evangelists and the apostles, it is not possible to have the certain hope of salvation. For by the tongue of the holy prophets and apostles our Lord speaks, and God takes pleasure in the words of the saints; not that He requires the spoken address, but that He delights in the good disposition; not that He receives any profit from men, but that He finds a restful satisfaction in the rightly-affected soul of the righteous. For it is not that Christ is magnified by what we say; but as we receive benefits from Him, we proclaim with grateful mind His beneficence to us; not that we can attain to what is worthy therein, but that we give the meet return to the best of our ability. And when the Gospels or the Epistles, therefore, are read, let not your attention centre on the book or on the reader, but on the God who speaks to you from heaven. For the book is but that which is seen, while Christ is the divine subject spoken of. It brings us then the glad tidings of that economy of the Saviour, which is worthy of all praise, to wit, that, though He was God, He became man through kindness toward man, and did not lay aside, indeed, the dignity which was His from all eternity, but assumed the economy that should work salvation. It brings us the glad tidings of that economy of the Saviour worthy of all praise, to wit, that He sojourned with us as a physician for the sick, who did not heal them with potions, but restored them by the inclination of His philanthropy.","title":"The Second Homily","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_63_homily_lvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"For the Scriptures speak of two advents of!

For the New Testament arose out of the Old, and bears witness to the Old; if then they reject this, how can they receive what proceeds from it? Thus Paul was an Apostle of the Gospel, `which God promised afore by His prophets in the holy Scriptures[fn-39-P3939_1655212:21-nf] :' and our Lord Himself said, `ye search the Scriptures, for they are they which testify of Me[fn-39-P3940_1655323:22-nf] .' How then shall they confess the Lord unless they first search the Scriptures which are written concerning Him? And the disciples say that they have found Him, `of whom Moses and the Prophets did write[fn-39-P3941_1655544:23-nf] .' And what is the Law to the Sadducees if they receive not the Prophets[fn-39-P3942_1655634:24-nf] ? For God who gave the Law, Himself promised in the Law that He would raise up Prophets also, so that the same is Lord both of the Law and of the Prophets, and he that denies the one must of necessity deny the other also. And again, what is the Old Testament to the Jews, unless they acknowledge the Lord whose coming was expected according to it? For had they believed the writings of Moses, they would have believed the words of the Lord; for He said, `He wrote of Me[fn-39-P3943_1656165:25-nf] .' Moreover, what are the Scriptures to him[fn-39-P3944_1656226:26-nf] of Samosata, who denies the Word of God and His incarnate Presence[fn-39-P3945_1656330:27-nf] , which is signified and declared both in the Old and New Testament? And of what use are the Scriptures to the Arians also, and why do they bring them forward, men who say that the Word of God is a creature, and like the Gentiles `serve the creature more than' God `the Creator[fn-39-P3946_1656629:28-nf] ?' Thus each of these heresies, in respect of the peculiar impiety of its invention, has nothing in common with the Scriptures. And their advocates are aware of this, that the Scriptures are very much, or rather altogether, opposed to the doctrines of every one of them; but for the sake of deceiving the more simple sort (such as are those of whom it is written in the Proverbs, `The simple believeth every word[fn-39-P3947_1657059:29-nf] ),' they pretend like their `father the devil[fn-39-P3948_1657125:30-nf] ' to study and to quote the language of Scripture, in order that they may appear by their words to have a right belief, and so may persuade their wretched followers to believe what is contrary to the Scriptures. Assuredly in every one of these heresies the devil has thus disguised himself, and has suggested to them words full of craftiness. The Lord spake concerning them, that `there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, so that they shall deceive many[fn-39-P3949_1657610:31-nf] .' Accordingly the devil has come, speaking by each and saying, `I am Christ, and the truth is with me;' and he has made them, one and all, to be liars like himself. And strange it is, that while all heresies are at variance with one another concerning the mischievous inventions which each has framed, they are united together only by the common purpose of lying[fn-39-P3950_1657995:32-nf] . For they have one and the same father that has sown in them all the seeds, of falsehood. Wherefore the faithful Christian and true disciple of the Gospel, having grace to discern spiritual things, and having built the house of his faith upon a rock, stands continually firm and secure from their deceits. But the simple person, as I said before, that is not thoroughly grounded in knowledge, such an one, considering only the words that are spoken and not perceiving their meaning, is immediately drawn away by their wiles. Wherefore it is good and needful for us to pray that we may receive the gift of discerning spirits, so that every one may know, according to the precept of John, whom he ought to reject, and whom to receive as friends and of the same faith. Now one might write at great length concerning these things, if one desired to go rate details respecting them; for the impiety and perverseness of heresies will appear to be manifold and various, and the craft of the deceivers to be very terrible.

For the Bishops who all assembled from all parts at the Council of Nicaea, began to hold their ears at these statements, and all with one voice condemned this heresy on account of them, and anathematized it, declaring it to be alien and estranged from the faith of the Church. It was no compulsion which led the judges to this decision, but they all deliberately vindicated the truth[fn-40-P4006_1682105:69-nf] : and they did so justly and rightly. For infidelity is coming in through these men, or rather a Judaism counter to the Scriptures, which has close upon it Gentile superstition, so that he who holds these opinions can no longer be even called a Christian, for they are all contrary to the Scriptures. John, for instance, saith, `In the beginning was the Word[fn-40-P4007_1682817:70-nf] ;' but these men say, `He was not, before He was begotten.' And again he wrote, `And we are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ; this is the true God, and eternal life[fn-40-P4008_1683015:71-nf] ;' but these men, as if in contradiction to this, allege that Christ is not the true God, but that He is only called God, as are other creatures, in regard of His participation in the divine nature. And the Apostle blames the Gentiles, because they worship the creatures, saying, `They served the creature more than' God `the Creator[fn-40-P4009_1683368:72-nf] .' But if these men say that the Lord is a creature, and worship Him as a creature, how do they differ from the Gentiles? If they hold this opinion, is not this passage also against them; and does not the blessed Paul write as blaming them? The Lord also says, `I and My Father are One:' and `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father[fn-40-P4010_1683772:73-nf] ;' and the Apostle who was sent by Him to preach, writes, `Who being the Brightness of His glory, and the express Image of His Persons[fn-40-P4011_1683958:74-nf] .' But these men dare to separate them, and to say that He is alien from the essence and eternity of the Father; and impiously to represent Him as changeable, not perceiving, that by speaking thus, they make Him to be, not one with the Father, but one with created things.

For these also confess the existence of a good God, so far as the mere name goes, but they are unable to point out any of His works either visible or invisible. But inasmuch as they deny Him who is truly and indeed God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things invisible, they are mere inventors of fables. And this appears to me to be the case with these evil-minded men. They see the works of the true Word who alone is in the Father, and yet they deny Him, and make to themselves another Word[fn-40-P4029_1689991:86-nf] , whose existence they are unable to prove either by His Works or by the testimony of others. Unless it be that they have adopted a fabulous notion of God, that He is a composite being like man, speaking and then changing His words, and as a man exercising understanding and wisdom; not perceiving to what absurdities they are reduced by such an opinion. For if God has a succession of words[fn-40-P4030_1690422:87-nf] , they certainly must consider Him as a man. And if those words proceed from Him and then vanish away, they are guilty of a greater impiety, because they resolve into nothing what proceeds from the self-existent God. If they conceive that God doth at all beget, it were surely better and more religious to say that He is the begetter of One Word, who is the fulness of His Godhead, in whom are hidden the treasures of all knowledge[fn-40-P4031_1690880:88-nf] , and that He is co-existent with His Father, and that all things were made by Him; rather than to suppose God to be the Father of many words which are nowhere to be found, or to represent Him who is simple in His nature as compounded of many[fn-40-P4032_1691156:89-nf] , and as being subject to human passions and variable. Next whereas the Apostle says, `Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God[fn-40-P4033_1691314:90-nf] ,' these men reckon Him but as one among many powers; nay, worse than this, they compare Him, transgressors as they are, with the cankerworm and other irrational creatures which are sent by Him for the punishment of men.

If the Lord says, `As the Father knoweth Me, even so know I the Father[fn-40-P4036_1691928:93-nf] ,' and if the Father knows not the Son partially, are they not mad to say idly that the Son knows the Father only partially, and not fully? Next, if the Son has a beginning of existence, and all things likewise have a beginning, let them say, which is prior to the other. But indeed they have nothing to say, neither can they with all their craft prove such a beginning of the Word. For He is the true and proper Offspring of the Father, and `in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God[fn-40-P4037_1692467:94-nf] .' For with regard to their assertion, that the Son knows not His own essence, it is superfluous to reply to it, except only so far as to condemn their madness; for how does not the Word know Himself, when He imparts to all men the knowledge of His Father and of Himself, and blames those who know not themselves?

But there is plainly a reasonable ground and cause[fn-40-P4042_1693286:97-nf] , why such representations as these are given of Him in the Scriptures; and it is because He became man and the Son of man, and took upon Him the form of a servant, which is the human flesh: for `the Word,' says John, `was made flesh[fn-40-P4043_1693538:98-nf] .'

These that I have set down are but a few of the arguments which go to condemn their doctrines; but if any one desires to enter more at large into the proof against them, he will find that this heresy is not far removed from heathenism, and that it is the lowest and the very dregs of all the other heresies. These last are in error either concerning the body or the incarnation of the Lord, falsifying the truth, some in one way and some in another, or else they deny that the Lord has sojourned here at all, as the Jews erroneously suppose. But this one alone more madly than the rest has dared to assail the very Godhead, and to assert that the Word is not at all, and that the Father was not always a father; so that one might reasonably say that that Psalm was written against them; `The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God[fn-40-P4049_1695745:104-nf] .

Why dost Thou reverse the order of things? Why seekest Thou along with the servants, at the hand of Thy servant, the things that are proper to servants?

I know Thee, since I have been taught by Thee; for no one can recognise Thee, unless He enjoys Thine illumination. I know Thee, O Lord, clearly; for I saw Thee spiritually before I beheld this light. When Thou wert altogether in the incorporeal bosom of the heavenly Father, Thou wert also altogether in the womb of Thy handmaid and mother; and I though held in the womb of Elisabeth by nature as in a prison, and bound with the indissoluble bonds of the children unborn, leaped and celebrated Thy birth with anticipative rejoicings.

O how vast His condescension! The King of the heavens hastened to John, His own forerunner, without setting in motion the camps[fn-12-P1265_335759:4-nf] of His angels, without despatching beforehand the incorporeal powers as His precursors; but presenting Himself in utmost simplicity, in soldier-like form,[fn-12-P1266_335929:5-nf] He comes tip to His own subaltern. And He approached him as one of the multitude, and humbled Himself among the captives though He was the Redeemer, and ranged Himself with those under judgment though He was the Judge, and joined Himself with the lost sheep though He was the Good Shepherd who on account of the straying sheep came down from heaven, and yet did not forsake His heavens, and Was mingled with the tares though He was that heavenly grain that springs unsown. And when the Baptist John then saw Him, recognising Him whom before in his mother's womb he had recognised and worshipped, and discerning clearly that this was He on whose account, in a manner surpassing the natural time, the had leaped in the womb of his mother. in violation of the limits of nature, he drew his right hand within his double cloak, and bowing his head like a servant full of love to his master, addressed Him in these words: I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?[fn-12-P1267_336953:6-nf] What is this Thou doest, my Lord? Why dost Thou reverse the order of things? Why seekest Thou along with the servants, at the hand of Thy servant, the things that are proper to servants? Why dost Thou desire to receive what Thou requirest not? Why dost Thou burden me, Thy servitor, with Thy mighty condescension? I have need to be baptized of Thee, but Thou hast no need to be baptized of me. The less is blessed by the greater, and the greater is not blessed and sanctified by the less. The light is kindled by the sun, and the sun is not made to shine by the rush-lamp. The clay is wrought by the potter, and the potter is not moulded by the clay. The creature is made anew by the Creator, and the Creator is not restored by the creature. The infirm is healed by the physician, and the physician is not cured by the infirm. The poor man receives contributions from the rich, and the rich borrow not from the poor. I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me? Can I be ignorant who Thou art, and from what source Thou hast Thy light, and whence Thou art come? Or, because Thou hast been born even as I have been,[fn-12-P1268_338099:7-nf] am I, then, to deny the greatness of Thy divinity? Or, because Thou hast condescended so far to me as to have approached my body, and dost bear me wholly in Thyself in order to effect the salvation of the whole man, am I, on account of that body of Thine which is seen, to overlook that divinity of Thine which is only apprehended? Or, because on behalf of my salvation Thou hast taken to Thyself the offering of my first-fruits, am I to ignore the fact that Thou \"coverest Thyself with light as with a garment? \"[fn-12-P1269_338676:8-nf] Or, because Thou wearest the flesh that is related to me, and dost show Thyself to men as they are able to see Thee, am I to forget the brightness of Thy glorious divinity? Or, because I see my own form in Thee, am I to reason against Thy divine substance, which is invisible and incomprehensible? I know Thee, O Lord; I know Thee clearly. I know Thee, since I have been taught by Thee; for no one can recognise Thee, unless He enjoys Thine illumination. I know Thee, O Lord, clearly; for I saw Thee spiritually before I beheld this light. When Thou wert altogether in the incorporeal bosom of the heavenly Father, Thou wert also altogether in the womb of Thy handmaid and mother; and I though held in the womb of Elisabeth by nature as in a prison, and bound with the indissoluble bonds of the children unborn, leaped and celebrated Thy birth with anticipative rejoicings. Shall I then, who gave intimation of Thy sojourn on earth before Thy birth, fail to apprehend Thy coming after Thy birth? Shall I, who in the womb was a teacher of Thy coming, be now a child in understanding in view of perfect knowledge? But I cannot but worship Thee, who art adored by the whole creation; I cannot but proclaim Thee, of whom heaven gave the indication by the star, and for whom earth offered a kind reception by the wise men, while the choirs of angels also praised Thee in joy over Thy condescension to us, and the shepherds who kept watch by night hymned Thee as the Chief Shepherd of the rational sheep. I cannot keep silence while Thou art present, for I am a voice; yea, I am the voice, as it is said, of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.[fn-12-P1270_340356:9-nf] I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me? I was born, and thereby removed the barrenness of the mother that bore me; and while still a babe I became the healer of my father's speechlessness, having received of Thee from my childhood the gift of the miraculous. But Thou, being born of the Virgin Mary, as Thou didst will, and as Thou alone dost know, didst not do away with her virginity; but Thou didst keep it, and didst simply gift her with the name of mother: and neither did her virginity preclude Thy birth, nor did Thy birth injure her virginity. But these two things, so utterly opposite-bearing and virginity-harmonized with one intent; for such a thing abides, possible with Thee, the Framer of nature. I am, but a man, and am a partaker of the divine grace; but Thou art God, and also man to the same effect: for Thou art by nature man's friend. I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?

One so great to such a one as I am? The King to the forerunner? The Lord to the servant? But though Thou wast not ashamed to be born in the lowly measures of humanity, yet I have no ability to pass the measures of nature. I know how great is the measure of difference between earth and the Creator. I know how great is the distinction between the clay and the potter. I know how vast is the superiority possessed by Thee, who art the Sun of righteousness, over me who am but the torch of Thy grace. Even though Thou art compassed with the pure cloud of the body, I can still recognise Thy lordship.

Why dost Thou reverse the order of things? Why seekest Thou along with the servants, at the hand of Thy servant, the things that are proper to servants? Why dost Thou desire to receive what Thou requirest not? Why dost Thou burden me, Thy servitor, with Thy mighty condescension? I have need to be baptized of Thee, but Thou hast no need to be baptized of me. The less is blessed by the greater, and the greater is not blessed and sanctified by the less. The light is kindled by the sun, and the sun is not made to shine by the rush-lamp. The clay is wrought by the potter, and the potter is not moulded by the clay. The creature is made anew by the Creator, and the Creator is not restored by the creature. The infirm is healed by the physician, and the physician is not cured by the infirm. The poor man receives contributions from the rich, and the rich borrow not from the poor. I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me? Can I be ignorant who Thou art, and from what source Thou hast Thy light, and whence Thou art come? Or, because Thou hast been born even as I have been,[fn-12-P1268_338099:7-nf] am I, then, to deny the greatness of Thy divinity? Or, because Thou hast condescended so far to me as to have approached my body, and dost bear me wholly in Thyself in order to effect the salvation of the whole man, am I, on account of that body of Thine which is seen, to overlook that divinity of Thine which is only apprehended? Or, because on behalf of my salvation Thou hast taken to Thyself the offering of my first-fruits, am I to ignore the fact that Thou \"coverest Thyself with light as with a garment? \"[fn-12-P1269_338676:8-nf] Or, because Thou wearest the flesh that is related to me, and dost show Thyself to men as they are able to see Thee, am I to forget the brightness of Thy glorious divinity? Or, because I see my own form in Thee, am I to reason against Thy divine substance, which is invisible and incomprehensible? I know Thee, O Lord; I know Thee clearly. I know Thee, since I have been taught by Thee; for no one can recognise Thee, unless He enjoys Thine illumination. I know Thee, O Lord, clearly; for I saw Thee spiritually before I beheld this light. When Thou wert altogether in the incorporeal bosom of the heavenly Father, Thou wert also altogether in the womb of Thy handmaid and mother; and I though held in the womb of Elisabeth by nature as in a prison, and bound with the indissoluble bonds of the children unborn, leaped and celebrated Thy birth with anticipative rejoicings. Shall I then, who gave intimation of Thy sojourn on earth before Thy birth, fail to apprehend Thy coming after Thy birth? Shall I, who in the womb was a teacher of Thy coming, be now a child in understanding in view of perfect knowledge? But I cannot but worship Thee, who art adored by the whole creation; I cannot but proclaim Thee, of whom heaven gave the indication by the star, and for whom earth offered a kind reception by the wise men, while the choirs of angels also praised Thee in joy over Thy condescension to us, and the shepherds who kept watch by night hymned Thee as the Chief Shepherd of the rational sheep.

I was born, and thereby removed the barrenness of the mother that bore me; and while still a babe I became the healer of my father's speechlessness, having received of Thee from my childhood the gift of the miraculous. But Thou, being born of the Virgin Mary, as Thou didst will, and as Thou alone dost know, didst not do away with her virginity; but Thou didst keep it, and didst simply gift her with the name of mother: and neither did her virginity preclude Thy birth, nor did Thy birth injure her virginity. But these two things, so utterly opposite-bearing and virginity-harmonized with one intent; for such a thing abides, possible with Thee, the Framer of nature. I am, but a man, and am a partaker of the divine grace; but Thou art God, and also man to the same effect: for Thou art by nature man's friend.

One so great to such a one as I am? The King to the forerunner? The Lord to the servant? But though Thou wast not ashamed to be born in the lowly measures of humanity, yet I have no ability to pass the measures of nature. I know how great is the measure of difference between earth and the Creator. I know how great is the distinction between the clay and the potter. I know how vast is the superiority possessed by Thee, who art the Sun of righteousness, over me who am but the torch of Thy grace. Even though Thou art compassed with the pure cloud of the body, I can still recognise Thy lordship.

Once of old didst thou see Israel pass through thee, and thou didst divide thy floods, and didst wait in expectation of the passage of the people; but now divide thyself more decidedly, and flow more easily, and embrace the stainless limbs of Him who at that ancient time did convey the Jews[fn-12-P1280_344939:18-nf] through thee. Ye mountains and hills, ye valleys and torrents, ye seas and rivers, bless the Lord, who has come upon the river Jordan; for through these streams He transmits sanctification to all streams. And Jesus answered and said to him: Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.[fn-12-P1281_345279:19-nf] Suffer it to be so now; grant the favour of silence, O Baptist, to the season of my economy. Learn to will whatever is my will. Learn to minister to me in those things on which I am bent, and do not pry curiously into all that I wish to do. Suffer it to be so now: do not yet proclaim my divinity; do not yet herald my kingdom with thy lips, in order that the tyrant may not learn the fact and give up the counsel he has formed with respect to me. Permit the devil to come upon me, and enter the conflict with me as though I were but a common man, and receive thus his mortal wound. Permit me to fulfil the object for which I have come to earth. It is a mystery that is being gone through this day in the Jordan. My mysteries are for myself and my own. There is a mystery here, not for the fulfilling of my own need, but for the designing of a remedy for those who have been wounded. There is a mystery, which gives in these waters the representation of the heavenly streams of the regeneration of men. Suffer it to be so now: when thou seest me doing what seemeth to me good among the works of my hands, in a manner befitting divinity, then attune thy praises to the acts accomplished. When thou seest me cleansing the lepers, then proclaim me as the framer of nature. When thou seest me make the lame ready runners, then with quickened pace do thou also prepare thy tongue to praise me. When thou seest me cast out demons, then hail my kingdom with adoration. When thou seest me raise the dead from their graves by my word, then, in concert with those thus raised, glorify me as the Prince of Life. When thou seest me on the Father's right hand, then acknowledge me to be divine, as the equal of the Father and the Holy Spirit, on the throne, and in eternity, and in honour. Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. I am the Lawgiver, and the Son of the Lawgiver; and it becometh me first to pass through all that is established, and then to set forth everywhere the intimations of my free gift. It becometh me to fulfil the law, and then to bestow grace. It becometh me to adduce the shadow, and then the reality. It becometh me to finish the old covenant, and then to dictate the new, and to write it on the hearts of men, and to subscribe it with my blood,[fn-12-P1282_347597:20-nf] and to seal it with my Spirit. It becometh me to ascend the cross, and to be pierced with its nails, and to suffer after the manner of that nature which is capable of suffering, and to heal sufferings by my suffering, and by the tree to cure the wound that was inflicted upon men by the medium of a tree. It becometh me to descend even into the very depths of the grave, on behalf of the dead who are detained there. It becometh me, by my three days' dissolution in the flesh, to destroy the power of the ancient enemy, death. It becometh me to kindle the torch of my body for those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. It becometh me to ascend in the flesh to that place where I am in my divinity. It becometh me to introduce to the Father the Adam reigning in me. It becometh me to accomplish these things, for on account of these things I have taken my position with the works of my hands. It becometh me to be baptized with this baptism for the present, and afterwards to bestow the baptism of the consubstantial Trinity upon all men. Lend me, therefore, O Baptist, thy right hand for the present economy, even as Mary lent her womb for my birth. Immerse me in the streams of Jordan, even as she who bore me wrapped me m children's swaddling-clothes. Grant me thy baptism even as the Virgin granted me her milk. Lay hold of this head of mine, which the seraphim revere. With thy right hand lay hold of this head, that is related to thyself in kinship. Lay hold of this head, which nature has made to be touched. Lay hold of this head, which for this very purpose has been formed by myself and my Father. Lay hold of this head of mine, which, if one does lay hold of it in piety, will save him from ever suffering shipwreck. Baptize me, who am destined to baptize those who believe on me with water, and with the Spirit, and with fire: with water, capable of washing away the defilement of sins; with the Spirit, capable of making the earthly spiritual; with fire, naturally fitted to consume the thorns of transgressions. On hearing these words, the Baptist directed his mind to the object of the salvation,[fn-12-P1283_349743:21-nf] and comprehended the mystery which he had received, and discharged the divine command; for he was at once pious and ready to obey. And stretching forth slowly his right hand, which seemed both to tremble and to rejoice, he baptized the Lord. Then the Jews who were present, with those in the vicinity and those from a distance, reasoned together, and spake thus with themselves and with each other: Was it, then, without cause that we imagined John to be superior to Jesus? Was it without cause that we considered the former to be greater than the latter? Does not this very baptism attest the Baptist's pre-eminence? Is not he who baptizeth presented as the superior, and he who is baptized as the inferior? But while they, in their ignorance of the mystery of the economy, babbled in such wise with each other, He who alone is Lord, and by nature the Father of the Only-begotten, He who alone knoweth perfectly Him whom He alone in passionless fashion begat, to correct the erroneous imaginations of the Jews, opened the gates of the heavens, and sent down the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, lighting upon the head of Jesus, pointing out thereby the new Noah, yea the maker of Noah, and the good pilot of the nature which is in shipwreck. And He Himself calls with clear voice out of heaven, and says: \"This is my beloved Son,\"[fn-12-P1284_351112:22-nf] -the Jesus there, namely, and not the John; the one baptized, and not the one baptizing; He who was begotten of me before all periods of time and not he who was begotten of Zacharias; He who was born of Mary after the flesh, and not he who was brought forth by Elisabeth beyond all expectation; He who was the fruit of the virginity yet preserved intact, and not he who was the shoot from a sterility removed; He who has had His conversation with you, and not he who was brought up in the wilderness. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: my Son, of the same substance with myself, and not of a different; of one substance with me according to what is unseen, and of one substance with you according to what is seen, yet without sin. This is He who along with me made man. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. This Son of mine and this son of Mary are not two distinct persons; but this is my beloved Son,-this one who is both seen with the eye and apprehended with the mind. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear Him. If He shall say, I and my Father are one,[fn-12-P1285_352272:23-nf] hear Him.

And the Lord said unto him, \"Because I said, When thou wast under the fig-tree I saw thee, believest thou? thou shall see greater things than these.\" What are these \"greater things\"? \"Verily I say unto you\" (for he \"is an Israelite in whom is no guile;\" remember Jacob in whom was no guile; and recollect of what he is speaking, the stone at his head, the vision in his sleep, the ladder from earth to heaven, the Angels ascending and descending; and so see what it is that the Lord would say to \"the Israelite without guile\"); \"Verily I say unto you, Ye shall see heaven opened\" (hear, thou guileless Nathanael, what guileless Jacob saw); \"ye shall see heaven opened, and Angels ascending and descending\" (unto whom?) \"unto the Son of Man.\" Therefore was He, as the Son of Man, anointed on the head; for \"the head of the woman is the man, and the Head of the man is Christ.\"[fn-48-P4814_2067035:31-nf] Now observe, He did not say, \"ascending from the Son of Man, and descending to the Son of Man,\" as if He were only above; but \"ascending and descending unto the Son of Man.\" Hear the Son of Man crying out from above, \"Saul, Saul.\" Hear the Son of Man from below, \"Why persecutest thou Me?\"[fn-48-P4815_2067344:32-nf] ","title":"Sermon XXXIX.

He had said, \"The Son cannot of Himself do anything, but what He seeth the Father doing.\" We, however, understood it not that the Father doeth something separately, which when the Son seeth, Himself also doeth something of the same kind, after seeing His Father's work; but when He said, \"The Son cannot of Himself do anything, but what He seeth the Father doing,\" we understood it that the Son is wholly of the Father-that His whole substance and His whole power are of the Father that begat Him. But just now, when He had said that He doeth in like manner these things which the Father doeth, that we may not understand it to mean that the Father doeth some, the Son others, but that the Son with like power doeth the very same which the Father doeth, whilst the Father doeth through the Son, He went on, and said what we have heard read to-day: \"For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that Himself doeth.\" Again mortal thought is disturbed. The Father showeth to the Son what things Himself doeth; therefore, saith some one, the Father doeth separately, that the Son may be able to see what He doeth. Again, there occur to human thought, as it were, two artificers-as, for instance, a carpenter teaching his son his own art, and showing him whatever he doeth, that the son also may be able to do it. \"Showeth Him,\" saith He, \"all things that Himself doeth.\" Is it therefore so, that whilst He doeth, the Son doeth not, that He may be able to see the Father do? Yet, certainly, \"all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\" Hence we see how the Father showeth the Son what He doeth, since the Father doeth nothing but what He doeth through the Son. What hath the Father made? He made the world. Hath He shown the world, when made, to the Son in such wise, that the Son also should make something like it? Then let us see the world which the Son made. Nevertheless, both\" all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made,\" and also \"the world was made by Him.\"[fn-10-P1077_651406:2-nf] If the world was made by Him, and all things were made by Him, and the Father doeth nothing save by the Son, where cloth the Father show to the Son what He doeth, if it be not in the Son Himself, through whom He doeth? In what place can the work of the Father be shown to the Son,as though He were doing and sitting outside, and the Son attentively watching the Father's hand how it maketh?

Whenever, then, the Father showeth to Christ's members, He showeth to Christ. A certain great but yet real miracle happens. There is a showing to Christ of what Christ knew, and it is shown to Christ through Christ. A marvelous and great thing it is, but the Scripture so saith. Shall we contradict the divine declarations? Shall we not rather understand them, and of His own gift render thanks to Him who freely bestowed it on us? What is this that I said, \"is shown to Christ through Christ\"? Is shown to the members through the head. Lo, look at this in thyself. Suppose that with thine eyes shut thou wouldest take up something, thy hand knows not whither to go; and yet thy hand is at any rate thy member, for it is not separated from thy body. Open thine eyes, now the hand sees whither it may go; while the head showed, the member followed. If, then, there could be found in thyself something such, that thy body showed to thy body, and that through thy body something was shown to thy body, then do not marvel that it is said there is shown to Christ through Christ. For the head shows that the members may see, and the head teaches that the members may learn; nevertheless one man, head and members. He willed not to separate Himself, but deigned to attach Himself to us. Far was He from us, yea, very far. What so far apart as the creature and the Creator? What so far apart as God and man?

But free we shall get to be if we lay to mind how Christ loved us, and also how He bade us love one another. Now what love did He show for us? His precious Blood did He shed for us when we were enemies, and had done the greatest wrong to Him. This do thou also do in thy brother's case (for this is the end of His saying \"A new commandment I give unto you, That ye so[fn-22-P2257_2204621:20-nf] love one another as I have loved you\") (John xiii. 34); or rather even so the measure does not come to a stand. For it was in behalf of His enemies that He did this. And are you unwilling to shed your blood for your brother? Why then dost thou even shed his blood, disobeying the commandment even to reversing it? Yet what He did was not as a due: but you, if you do it, are but fulfilling a debt. Since he too, who, after receiving the ten thousand talents, demanded the hundred pence, was punished not merely for the fact that he demanded them, but because even by the kindness done him he had not become any better, and did not even follow where his Lord had begun, or remit the debt. For on the part of the servant the thing done was but a debt after all, if it had been done. For all things that we do, we do towards the payment of a debt. And this is why Himself said, \"When ye have done all, say, We are unprofitable servants, we have done that which was our duty to do.\" (Luke xvii. 10.) If then we display charity, if we give our goods to them that need, we are fulfilling a debt; and that not only in that it was He who first began the acts of goodness, but because it is His goods that we are distributing if we ever[fn-22-P2258_2205933:21-nf] do give. Why then deprive thyself of what He willeth thee to have the right of? For the reason why He bade thee give them to another was that thou mightest have them thyself. For so long as thou hast them to thyself even thou thyself hast them not. But when thou hast given to another, then hast thou received them thyself. What charm then will do as much as this? Himself poured forth His Blood for His enemies: but we not even money for our benefactor. He did so with His Blood that was His own: we will not even with money that is not ours. He did it before us, we not even after His example. He did it for our salvation, we will not do it even for our own advantage. For He is not to have any advantage from our love toward man, but the whole gain accrueth unto us. For this is the very reason why we are bidden to give away our goods, that we may not be thrown out of them. For as a person who gives a little child money and bids him hold it fast, or give it the servant to keep, that it may not be for whoever will to snatch it away, so also doth God. For He says, Give to him that needeth, lest some one should snatch it away from thee, as an informer, for instance, or a calumniator, or a thief, or, after all these are avoided, death. For so long as thou holdest it thyself, thou hast no safe hold of it. But if thou givest it Me through the poor, I keep it all for thee exactly, and in fit season will return it with great increase. For it is not to take it away that I receive it, but to make it a larger amount and to keep it more exactly, that I may have it preserved for you against that time, in which there is no one to lend or to pity. What then can be more hard-hearted, than if we, after such promises, cannot make up our minds to lend to him? Yes, it is for this that we go before Him destitute and naked and poor, not having the things committed to our charge, because we do not deposit them with Him who keepeth them more exactly than any. And for this we shall be most severely punished. For when we are charged with it, what shall we be able to say about the loss of them?[fn-22-P2259_2208061:22-nf] what pretext to put forward? what defence? For what reason is there why you did not give? Do you disbelieve that you will receive it again? And how can this be reasonable? For He that hath given to one that hath not given, how shall He not much rather give after He has received? Does the sight of them please you? Well then, give much the more for this reason, that you may there be the more delighted, when no one can take them from you. Since now if you keep them, you will even suffer countless evils. For as a dog, so doth the devil leap upon them that are rich, wishing to snatch from them, as from a child that holdeth a sippet or a cake. Let us then give them to our Father, and if the devil see this done, he will certainly withdraw: and when he has withdrawn, then will the Father safely give them all to thee, when he cannot trouble, in that world to come. For now surely they that be rich differ not from little children that are troubled by dogs, while all are barking round them, tearing and pulling; not men only, but ignoble affections; as gluttony, drunkenness, flattery, uncleanness of every kind. And when we have to lend, we are very anxious about those that give much, and look particularly for those that are frank dealers. But here we do the opposite. For God, Who dealeth frankly, and giveth not one in the hundred, but a hundred-fold, we desert, and those who will not return us even the capital, these we seek after. For what return will our belly make us, that consumeth the larger share of our goods? Dung and corruption. Or what will vainglory? Envy and grudging. Or what nearness? Care and anxiety. Or what uncleanness? Hell and the venomous worm! For these are the debtors of them that be rich, who pay this interest upon the capital, evils at present, and dreadful things in expectation. Shall we then lead to these, pray, with such punishment for interest, and shall we not trust the same to Christ (4 mss. om. tw) Who holdeth forth unto us heaven, immortal life, blessings unutterable? And what excuse shall we have? For how comest thou not to give to Him, who will assuredly return, and return in greater abundance? Perhaps it is because it is so long before He repays. Yet surely He repays even here. For He is true which saith, \"Seek the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added to you.\" (Matt. vi. 33.) Seest thou this extreme munificence? Those goods, He says, have been stored up for thee, and are not diminishing: but these here I give by way of increase and surplus. But, besides all this, the very fact of its being so long before thou wilt receive it, does but make thy riches the greater: since the interest is more.","title":"Homily VII.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_33_part_i_containing_various_sections_of_the_works_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"ANF-06","text":"6. And from the ideas, and the expressions, and the collocation of the same, it may be very reasonably conjectured that this one is distinct from that.[fn-13-P1385_381787:24-nf] For the Gospel and the Epistle agree with each other, and both commence in the same way. For the one opens thus, \"In the beginning was the Word; \"while the other opens thus, \"That which was from the beginning.\" The one says: \"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father.\"[fn-13-P1386_383083:25-nf] The other says the same things, with a slight alteration: \"That which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life: and the life was manifested.\"[fn-13-P1387_383325:26-nf] For these things are introduced by way of prelude, and in opposition, as he has shown in the subsequent parts, to those who deny that the Lord is come in the flesh. For which reason he has also been careful to add these words: \"And that which we have seen we testify, and show unto you that eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us: that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you.\"[fn-13-P1388_383754:27-nf] Thus he keeps to himself, and does not diverge inconsistently from his subjects, but goes through them all under the same heads and in the same phraseologies, some of which we shall briefly mention. Thus the attentive reader will find the phrases, \"the life,\" \"the light,\" occurring often in both; and also such expressions as fleeing from darkness, holding the truth, grace, joy, the flesh and the blood of the Lord, the judgment, the remission of sins, the love of God toward us, the commandment of love an our side toward each other; as also, that we ought to keep all the commandments, the conviction of the world, of the devil, of Antichrist, the promise of the Holy Spirit, the adoption of God, the faith required of us in all things, the Father and the Son, named as such everywhere. And altogether, through their whole course, it will be evident that the Gospel and the Epistle are distinguished by one and the same character of writing. But the Revelation is totally different, and altogether distinct from this; and I might almost say that it does not even come near it, or border upon it. Neither does it contain a syllable in common with these other books. Nay more, the Epistle-for I say nothing of the Gospel-does not make any mention or evince any notion of the Revelation and the Revelation, in like manner, gives no note of the Epistle. Whereas Paul gives some indication of his revelations in his epistles; which revelations, however, he has not recorded in writing by themselves.","title":"Part I.-Containing Various Sections of the Works.","author":"Dionysius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_33_part_i_containing_various_sections_of_the_works_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"ANF-06","text":"12.

For, indeed, all men are lamps, since they can be both lighted and extinguished. Moreover, when the lamps are wise, they shine and glow with the Spirit; yet also, if they did burn and are put out, they even stink. The servants of God remain good lamps by the oil of His mercy, not by their own strength. The free grace of God, truly, is the oil of the lamps. \"For I have labored more than they all,\" saith a certain lamp; and lest he should seem to burn by his own strength, he added, \"But not I, but the grace of God that was with me.\"[fn-11-P1166_715078:4-nf] All prophecy, therefore, before the coming of the Lord, is a lamp.

If they were not lamps, the Lord would not say to them, \"Ye are the light of the world.\" For after He said, \"Ye are the light of the world,\" He shows that they should not think themselves such a light as that of which it is said, \"That was the true light, that enlighteneth every man coming into this world.\" But this was said of the Lord at that time when He was distinguished from John (the Baptist). Of John the Baptist, indeed, it had been said, \"He was not the light, but that he might bear witness of the light.\"[fn-11-P1168_716405:6-nf] And lest thou shouldst say, How was he not the light, of whom Christ says that \"he was a lamp\"?-I answer, In comparison of the other light, he was not light. For \"that was the true light that enlighteneth every man coming into this world.\" Accordingly, when He said also to the disciples, \"Ye are the light of the world,\" lest they should imagine that anything was attributedto them which was to be understood of Christ alone, and thus the lamps should be extinguished by the wind of pride, when He had said, \"Ye are the light of the world,\" He immediately subjoined, \"A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid; neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but an a candlestick, that it may shine on all that are in the house.\" But what if He did not call the apostles the candle, but the lighters of the candle, which they were to put on a candlestick? Hear that He called themselves the candle. \"So let your light shine,\" saith He, \"before men, that they, seeing your good works, may glorify,\" not you, but \"your Father who is in heaven.\"[fn-11-P1169_717473:7-nf] ","title":"Tractate XXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_28_tractate_xxiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"8","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"6. These things being premised and firmly established,-that the rational soul is made happy only by God, that the body is enlivened only by the soul, and that the soul is a something intermediate between God and the body,-direct your thoughts to, and recollect with me, not the passage read to-day, of which we have spoken enough, but that of yesterday, which we have been turning over and handling these three days, and, to the best of our abilities, digging into until we should come to the rock. The Word Christ, Christ the Word of God with God, Christ the Word and the Word God, Christ and God and Word one God. To this press on; O soul, despising, or even transcending all things else, to this press on. There is nothing more powerful than this creature, which is called the rational mind, nothing more sublime: whatever is above this, is but the Creator. But I was saying that Christ is the Word, and Christ is the Word of God, and Christ the Word is God; but Christ is not only the Word, since \"the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us:\"[fn-11-P1176_722822:11-nf] therefore Christ is both Word and flesh. For when \"He was in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal with God.\" And what of us in our low estate, who, feeble and crawling on the ground, Were not able to reach unto God, were we to be abandoned? God forbid. \"He emptied Himself, taking upon Him the form of a servant;\"[fn-11-P1177_723172:12-nf] not, therefore, by losing the form of God. He became man who was God, by receiving what He was not, not by losing what He was: so God became man. There thou hast something for thy weakness, something for thy perfection. Let Christ raise thee by that which is man, lead thee by That which is God-man, and guide thee through to that which is God. And the whole preaching and dispensation by Christ is this, brethren, and there is not another, that souls may be raised again, and that bodies also may be raised again. For each of the two was dead; the body by weakness, the soul by iniquity. Because each was dead, each may rise again What each? Soul and body. By what, then, can the soul rise again but by Christ God? By what the body, but by the man Christ? For there was also in Christ a human soul, a whole soul; not merely the irrational part of the soul, but also the rational, which is called mind. For there have been certain heretics, and they have been driven out of the Church, who fancied that the body of Christ did not have in it a rational mind, but, as it were, the animal life of a beast; since, without the rational mind, life is only animal life. But because they were driven out, and driven out by the truth, accept thou the whole Christ, Word, rational mind, and flesh. This is the whole Christ. Let thy soul rise again from iniquity by that which is God, thy body from corruption by that which is man. There, most beloved, hear ye what, so far as it appears to me, is the great profundity of this passage; and see how Christ here speaks to the effect, that the only reason why He came is, in order that souls may have a resurrection from iniquity, and bodies from corruption. I have already said by what our souls are raised, by the very substance of God; by what our bodies are raised, by the human dispensation of our Lord Jesus Christ.","title":"Tractate XXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_73_homily_lxvii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And what sort of inference is this?

At his suggestion then ye have maintained and ye think, that `there was once when the Son was not;' this is the first cloke of your views of doctrine which has to be stripped off Say then what was once when the Son was not, O slanderous and irreligious men[fn-53-P5347_2095608:61-nf] ? If ye say the Father, your blasphemy is but greater; for it is impious to say that He was `once,' or to signify Him by the word `once.' For He is ever, and is now, and as the Son is, so is He, and is Himself He that is, and Father of the Son. But if ye say that the Son was once, when He Himself was not, the answer is foolish and unmeaning. For how could He both be and not be? In this difficulty, you can but answer, that there was a time when the Word was not; for your very adverb `once' naturally signifies this. And your other, `The Son was not before His generation,' is equivalent to saying, `There was once when He was not,' for both the one and the other signify that there is a time before the Word. Whence then this your discovery? Why do ye, as `the heathen, rage, and imagine vain phrases against the Lord[fn-53-P5348_2097288:62-nf] and against His Christ?' for no holy Scripture has used such language of the Saviour, but rather `always' and `eternal' and `coexistent always with the Father.'

And in the Apocalypse be thus speaks[fn-53-P5350_2097606:64-nf] ; `Who is and who was and who is to come.' Now who can rob `who is' and `who was' of eternity? This too in confutation of the Jews hath Paul written in his Epistle to the Romans, `Of whom as concerning the flesh is Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever[fn-53-P5351_2098007:65-nf] ;' while silencing the Greeks, he has said, `The visible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead[fn-53-P5352_2098225:66-nf] ;' and what the Power of God is, he teaches us elsewhere himself, `Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of God[fn-53-P5353_2098354:67-nf] .' Surely in these words he does not designate the Father, as ye often whisper one to another, affirming that the Father is `His eternal power.' This is not so; for he says not, `God Himself is the power,' but `His is the power.' Very plain is it to all that `His' is not `He;' yet not something alien but rather proper to Him.

Thus it appears that the phrases `once was not,' and `before it came to be,' and `when,' and the like, belong to things originate and creatures, which come out of nothing, but are alien to the Word. But if such terms are used in Scripture of things originate, but `ever' of the Word, it follows, O ye enemies of God, that the Son did not come out of nothing, nor is in the number of originated things at all, but is the Father's Image and Word eternal, never having not been, but being ever, as the, eternal Radiance[fn-53-P5380_2107455:92-nf] of a Light which is eternal. Why imagine then times before the Son? or wherefore blaspheme the Word as after times, by whom even the ages were made? for how did time or age at all subsist when the Word, as you say, had not appeared, `through' whom `all things have been made and without' whom `not one thing was made[fn-53-P5381_2107798:93-nf] ?' Or why, when you mean time, do you not plainly say, `a time was when the Word was not?' But while you drop the word `time' to deceive the simple, you do not at all conceal your own feeling, nor, even if you did, could you escape discovery.

Is it not then irreligious to say, `Once the Son was not?' for it is all one with saying, `Once the Fountain was dry, destitute of Life and Wisdom.' But a fountain it would then cease to be; for what begetteth not from itself, is not a fountain[fn-54-P5425_2127474:125-nf] . What a load of extravagance! for God promises that those who do His will shall be as a fountain which the water fails not, saying by Isaiah the prophet, `And the Lord shall satisfy thy soul in drought, and make thy bones fat; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not[fn-54-P5426_2127811:126-nf] .'

For in It were all things made, as David says in the Psalm, `In Wisdom bast Thou made them all[fn-54-P5427_2128231:127-nf] ;' and Solomon says, `The Lord by Wisdom hath formed the earth, by understanding hath He established the heavens[fn-54-P5428_2128364:128-nf] .'

And, if He be not one of the all[fn-54-P5432_2129281:132-nf] , it is sin to say concerning Him, `He was not,' and `He was not before His generation.'

For first of all, as to their first question, which is such as this, how dull and vague it is! they do not explain who it is they ask about, so as to allow of an answer, but they say abstractedly, `He who is,' `him who is not.' Who then `is,' and what `are not,' O Arians? or who `is,' and who `is not?' what are said `to be,' what `not to be?' for He that is, can make things which are not, and which are, and which were before. For instance, carpenter, and goldsmith, and potter, each, according to his own art, works upon materials previously existing, making what vessels he pleases; and the God of all Himself, having taken the dust of the earth existing and already brought to be, fashions man; that very earth, however, whereas it was not once, He has at one time made by His own Word. If then this is the meaning of their question, the creature on the one hand plainly was not before its origination, and men, on the other, work the existing material; and thus their reasoning is inconsequent, since both `what is' becomes, and `what is not' becomes, as these instances shew. But if they speak concerning God and His Word, let them complete their question and then ask, Was the God, `who is,' ever without Reason? and, whereas He is Light, was He ray-less? or was He always Father of the Word? Or again in this manner. Has the Father `who is' made the Word `who is not,' or has He ever with Him His Word, as the proper offspring of His substance? This will shew them that they do but presume and venture on sophisms about God and Him who is from Him. Who indeed can bear to hear them say that God was ever without Reason? this is what they fall into a second time, though endeavouring in vain to escape it and to hide it with their sophisms. Nay, one would fain not hear them disputing at all, that God was not always Father, but became so afterwards (which is necessary for their fantasy, that His Word once was not), considering the number of the proofs already adduced against them; while John besides says, `The Word was[fn-54-P5464_2150873:155-nf] ,' and Paul again writes, `Who being the brightness of His glory[fn-54-P5465_2150956:156-nf] ,' and, `Who is over all, God blessed for ever.

They had best have been silent; but since it is otherwise, it remains to meet their shameless question with a bold retort[fn-54-P5468_2151174:158-nf] . Perhaps on seeing the counter absurdities which beset themselves, they may cease to fight against the truth. After many prayers[fn-54-P5469_2151345:159-nf] then that God would be gracious to us, thus we might ask them in turn; God who is, has He so become, whereas He was not? or is He also before His coming into being? whereas He is, did He make Himself, or is He of nothing, and being nothing before, did He suddenly appear Himself? Unseemly is such an enquiry, both unseemly and very blasphemous, yet parallel with theirs; for the answer they make abounds in irreligion. But if it be blasphemous and utterly irreligious thus to inquire about God, it will be blasphemous too to make the like inquiries about His Word. However, by way of exposing a question so senseless and so dull, it is necessary to answer thus:-whereas God is, He was eternally; since then the Father is ever, His Radiance ever is, which is His Word. And again, God who is, hath from Himself His Word who also is; and neither hath the Word been added, whereas He was not before, nor was the Father once without Reason. For this assault upon the Son makes the blasphemy recoil upon the Father; as if He devised for Himself a Wisdom, and Word, and Son from without[fn-54-P5470_2152769:160-nf] ; for whichever of these titles you use, you denote the offspring from the Father, as has been said. So that this their objection does not hold; and naturally; for denying the Logos they in consequence ask questions which are illogical. As then if a person saw the sun, and then inquired concerning its radiance, and said, `Did that which is make that which was, or that which was not,' he would be held not to reason sensibly, but to be utterly mazed, because he fancied what is from the Light to be external to it, and was raising questions, when and where and whether it were made; in like manner, thus to speculate concerning the Son and the Father and thus to inquire, is far greater madness, for it is to conceive of the Word of the Father as external to Him, and to idly call the natural offspring a work, with the avowal, `He was not before His generation.' Nay, let them over and above take this answer to their question;-The Father who was, made the Son who was, for `the Word was made flesh[fn-54-P5471_2153799:161-nf] ;' and, whereas He was Son of God, He made Him in consummation of the ages also Son of Man, unless forsooth, after the Samosatene, they affirm that He did not even exist at all, till He became man.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"41.

This then I consider the sense of this passage, and that, a very ecclesiastical sense[fn-55-P5589_2216936:248-nf] . However, there is another way in which one might remark upon it, giving the same sense in a parallel way; viz. that, though it does not speak of the exaltation of the Word Himself, so far as He is Word[fn-55-P5590_2217207:249-nf] (for He is, as was just now said, most high and like His Father), yet by reason of His becoming man it indicates His resurrection from the dead. For after saying, `He hath humbled Himself even unto death,' He immediately added, `Wherefore He hath highly exalted Him;' wishing to shew, that, although as man He is said to have died, yet, as being Life, He was exalted on the resurrection; for `He who descended, is the same also who rose again[fn-55-P5591_2217671:250-nf] .' He descended in body, and He rose again because He was God Himself in the body. And this again is the reason why according to this meaning he brought in the conjunction `Wherefore;' not as a reward of virtue nor of advancement, but to signify the cause why the resurrection took place; and why, while all other men from Adam down to this time have died and remained dead, He only rose in integrity from the dead. The cause is this, which He Himself has already taught us, that, being God, He has become man. For all other men, being merely born of Adam, died, and death reigned over them; but He, the Second Man, is from heaven, for `the Word was made flesh[fn-55-P5592_2218376:251-nf] ,' and this Man is said to be from heaven and heavenly[fn-55-P5593_2218450:252-nf] , because the Word descended from heaven; wherefore He was not held under death. For though He humbled Himself, yielding His own Body to come unto death, in that it was capable of death[fn-55-P5594_2218659:253-nf] , yet He was highly exalted from earth, because He was God's Son in a body. Accordingly what is here said, `Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him,' answers to Peter's words in the Acts, `Whom God raised up, having loosed the bonds of death, because it was not possible that He should be holden of it[fn-55-P5595_2220186:254-nf] .' For as Paul has written, `Since being in form of God He became man, and humbled Himself unto death, therefore God also hath highly exalted Him,' so also Peter says, `Since, being God, He became man, and signs and wonders proved Him to beholders to be God, therefore it was not possible that He should be holden of death.' To alan it was not possible to succeed in this; for death belongs to man; wherefore, the Word, being God, became flesh, that, being put to death in the flesh, He might quicken all men by His own power.","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"97","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"50. What is there to wonder at, what to disbelieve, if the Lord who gives the Spirit, is here said Himself to be anointed with the Spirit, at a time when, necessity requiring it, He did not refuse in respect of His manhood to call Himself inferior to the Spirit? For the Jews saying that He east out devils in Beelzebub, He answered and said to them, for the exposure of their blasphemy, `But if 1 through the Spirit of God cast out demons[fn-56-P5640_2241286:290-nf] .' Behold, the Giver of the Spirit here says that He cast out demons in the Spirit; but this is not said, except because of His flesh. For since man's nature is not equal of itself to casting out demons, but only in power of the Spirit, therefore as man He said, `But if I through the Spirit of God cast out demons.' Of course too He signified that the blasphemy offered to the Holy Ghost is greater than that against His humanity, when He said, `Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him;' such as were those who said, `Is not this the carpenter's son[fn-56-P5641_2241898:291-nf] ?' but they who blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, and ascribe the deeds of the Word to the devil, shall have inevitable punishment[fn-56-P5642_2242067:292-nf] . This is what the Lord spoke to the Jews, as man; but to the disciples shewing His Godhead and His majesty, and intimating that He was not inferior but equal to the Spirit, He gave the Spirit and said, `Receive ye the Holy Ghost,' and `I send Him,' and `He shall glorify Me,' and `Whatsoever He heareth, that He shall speak[fn-56-P5643_2242433:293-nf] .' As then in this place the Lord Himself, the Giver of the Spirit, does not refuse to say that through the Spirit He casts out demons, as man; in like manner He the same, the Giver of the Spirit. refused not to say, `The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me[fn-56-P5644_2242762:294-nf] ,' in respect of His having become flesh, as John hath said; that it might be shewn in both these particulars, that we are they who need the Spirit's grace in our sanctification, and again who are unable to cast oat demons without the Spirit's power. Through whom then and from whom behoved it that the Spirit should be given but through the Son, whose also the Spirit is? and when were we enabled to receive It, except when the Word became man? and,as the passage of the Apostle shews, that we had not been redeemed and highly exalted,, had not He who exists in form od God taken a servant's form, so David also shews, that no otherwise should we have partaken the Spirit and been sanctified, but that the Giver of the Spirit, the Word Himself, hast spoken of Himself as anointed with the Spirit for us. And therefore have we securely received it, He being said to i he anointed in the flesh; for the flesh being first sanctified in Him[fn-56-P5645_2243719:295-nf] , and He being said, as man, to have received for its sake, we have the sequel of the Spirit grace, receiving `out of His fulness[fn-56-P5646_2243869:296-nf] .'","title":"Discourse I","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_57_discourse_i","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"105","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"56.

Nor[fn-56-P5695_2259841:336-nf] does even the expression `become,' which here occurs, shew that the Son is originate, as ye suppose. If indeed it were simply `become' and no more, a case might stand for the Arians; but, whereas they are forestalled with the word `Son' throughout the passage, shewing that He is other than things originate, so again not even the word `become' occurs absolutely[fn-56-P5696_2261003:337-nf] , but `better' is immediately subjoined. For the writer thought the expression immaterial, knowing that in the case of one who was confessedly a genuine Son, to say `become' is the same with saying that He had been made, and is, `better.' For it matters not even if we speak of what is generate, as `become' or `made;' but on the contrary, things originate cannot be called generate, God's handiwork as they are, except so far as after their making they partake of the generate Son, and are therefore said to have been generated also, not at all in their own nature, but because of their participation of the Son in the Spirit[fn-56-P5697_2261775:338-nf] .

For our Lord and Saviour was asked pleasantly a question most appropriate for Him,-the Life respecting life, the Saviour respecting salvation, the Teacher respecting the chief doctrines taught, the Truth respecting the true immortality, the Word respecting the word of the Father, the Perfect respecting the perfect rest, the Immortal respecting the sure immortality. He was asked respecting those things on account of which He descended, which He inculcates, which He teaches, which He offers, in order to show the essence of the Gospel, that it is the gift of eternal life. For He foresaw as God, both what He would be asked, and what each one would answer Him. For who should do this more than the Prophet of prophets, and the Lord of' every prophetic spirit? And having been called \"good,\" and taking the starting note from this first expression, He commences His teaching with this, turning the pupil to God, the good, and first and only dispenser of eternal life, which the Son, who received it of Him, gives to us.VII. Wherefore the greatest and chiefest point of the instructions which relate to life must be implanted in the soul from the beginning,-to know the eternal God, the giver of what is eternal, and by knowledge and comprehension to possess God, who is first, and highest, and one, and good. For this is the immutable and immoveable source and support of life, the knowledge of God, who really is, and who bestows the things which really are, that is, those which are eternal, from whom both being and the continuance[fn-105-P10508_2915072:6-nf] of it are derived to other beings.

If then the law of Moses had been sufficient to confer eternal life, it were to no purpose for the Saviour Himself to come and suffer for us, accomplishing the course of human life from His birth to His cross; and to no purpose for him who had done all the commandments of the law from his youth to fall on his knees and beg from another immortality. For he had not only fulfilled the law, but had begun to do so from his very earliest youth. For what is there great or pre-eminently illustrious in an old age which is unproductive of faults? But if one in juvenile frolicsomeness and the fire of youth shows a mature judgment older than his years, this is a champion admirable and distinguished, and hoary pre-eminently in mind.","title":"Who is the Rich Man that Shall Be Saved?","author":"Clement of Alexandria"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_36_tractate_xxxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3.

But what is meant by this which he says, \"For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified?\" He is understood to say this in a sense that is evident. For the meaning is not that the Spirit of God, which was with God, was not in being; but was not yet in them who had believed on Jesus. For thus the Lord jesus disposed not to give them the Spirit of which we speak, until after His resurrection; and this not without a cause. And perhaps if we inquire, He will favor us to find; and if we knock, He will open for us to enter. Piety knocks, not the hand though the hand also knocks, if it cease not from works of mercy. What then is the cause why the Lord Jesus Christ determined not to give the Holy Spirit until He should be glorified? which thing before we speak of as we may be able, we must first inquire, lest that should trouble any one, in what manner the Spirit was not yet in holy men, whilst we read in the Gospel concerning the Lord Himself newly born, that Simeon by the Holy Spirit recognized Him; that Anna the widow, a prophetess, also recognized Him;[fn-14-P1476_928278:2-nf] that John, who baptized Him, recognized Him;[fn-14-P1477_928342:3-nf] that Zacharias, being filled with the Holy Ghost, said many things; that Mary herself received the Holy Ghost to conceive the Lord.[fn-14-P1478_928492:4-nf] We have therefore many preceding evidences of the Holy Spirit before the Lord was glorified by the resurrection of His flesh. Nor was it another spirit that the prophets also had, who proclaimed beforehand the coming of Christ. But still, there was to be a certain manner of this giving, which had not at all appeared before. For nowhere do we read before this, that men being gathered together had, by receiving the Holy Ghost, spoken in the tongues of all nations. But after His resurrection, when He first appeared to His disciples, He said to them: \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\" Of this giving then it is said, \"The Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. And He breathed upon their faces,\"[fn-14-P1479_929223:5-nf] He who with His breath enlivened them first man, and raised him up from the clay, by which breath He gave a soul to the limbs; signifying that He was the same who breathed upon their faces, that they might rise out of the mire and renounce their miry works. Then, after His resurrection, which the evangelist calls His glorifying, did the Lord first give the Holy Ghost to His disciples. Then having tarried with them forty days, as the book of the Acts of the Apostles shows, while they were seeing Him and companying with Him, He ascended into heaven in their sight. There at the end of ten days, on the flay of Pentecost, He sent the Holy Ghost from above.

But if it be He who is the Word and the Wisdom, by which all things come to be, it follows that He is not in the number of works, nor in short of things originate, but the Offspring of the Father.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"46","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"24 (continued).

For God is not wearied by commanding[fn-59-P5990_2389230:153-nf] , nor is His strength unequal to the making of all things, that He should alone create the only Son[fn-59-P5991_2389349:154-nf] , and need His ministry and aid for the framing of the rest.

We have gone through thus much before the passage in the Proverbs, resisting the insensate fables which their hearts have invented, that they may know that the Son of God ought not to be called a creature, and may learn lightly to read what admits in truth of a right[fn-61-P6150_2452614:287-nf] explanation. For it is written, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways, for His works[fn-61-P6151_2452925:288-nf] ;' since, however, these are proverbs, and it is expressed in the way of proverbs, we must not expound them nakedly in their first sense, but we must inquire into the person, and thus religiously put the sense on it. For what is said in proverbs, is not said plainly, but is put forth latently[fn-61-P6152_2453502:289-nf] , as the Lord Himself has taught us in the Gospel according to John, saying, `These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs, but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but openly[fn-61-P6153_2453776:290-nf] .' Therefore it is necessary to unfold the sense[fn-61-P6154_2453846:291-nf] of what is said, and to seek it as something hidden, and not nakedly to expound as if the meaning were spoken `plainly,' lest by a false interpretation we wander from the truth. If then what is written be about Angel, or any other of things originate, as concerning one of us who are works, let it be said, `created me;' but if it be the Wisdom of God, in whom all things originate have been framed, that speaks concerning Itself, what ought we to understand but that `He created' means nothing contrary to `He begat?' Nor, as forgetting that It is Creator and Framer, or ignorant of the difference between the Creator and the creatures, does It number Itself among the creatures; but It signifies a certain sense, as in proverbs, not `plainly,' but latent; which It inspired the saints to use in prophecy, while soon after It doth Itself give the meaning of `He created' in other but parallel expressions, saying, `Wisdom made herself a house[fn-61-P6155_2455048:292-nf] .' Now it is plain that our body is Wisdom's house[fn-61-P6156_2455119:293-nf] , which It took on Itself to become man; hence consistently does John say, `The Word was made flesh[fn-61-P6157_2455562:294-nf] ;' and by Solomon Wisdom says of Itself with cautious exactness[fn-61-P6158_2455645:295-nf] , not `I am a creature,' but only `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways for His works[fn-61-P6159_2455756:296-nf] ,' yet not `created me that I might have being,' nor `because I have a creature's beginning and origin.'","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"73","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"47. For the very passage proves that it is only an invention of your own to call the Lord creature For the Lord, knowing His own Essence to be the Only-begotten Wisdom and Offspring of the Father, and other than things originate and natural creatures, says in love to man, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways,' as if to say, `My Father hath prepared for Me a body, and has created Me for men in behalf of their salvation.' For, as when John says, `The Word was made flesh[fn-61-P6177_2465056:311-nf] ,' we do not conceive the whole Word Himself to be flesh[fn-61-P6178_2465132:312-nf] , but to have put on flesh and become man, and on hearing, `Christ hath become a curse for us,' and `He hath made Him sin for us who knew no sin[fn-61-P6179_2465295:313-nf] ,' we do not simply conceive this, that whole Christ has become curse and sin, but that He has taken on Him the curse which lay against us (as the Apostle has said, `Has redeemed us from the curse,' and `has carried,' as Isaiah has said, `our sins,' and as Peter has written, `has borne them in the body on the wood[fn-61-P6180_2465646:314-nf] '); so, if it is said in the Proverbs `He created,' we must not conceive that the whole Word is in nature a creature, but that He put on the created body[fn-61-P6181_2465849:315-nf] and that God created Him for our sakes, preparing for Him the created body, as it is written, for us, that in Him we might be capable of being renewed and deified. What then deceived you, O senseless, to call the Creator a creature? or whence did you purchase for you this new thought, to parade it[fn-61-P6182_2467351:316-nf] ? For the Proverbs say `He created,' but they call not the Son creature, but Offspring; and, according to the distinction in Scripture aforesaid of `He created' and `creature,' they acknowledge, what is by nature proper to the Son, that He is the Only-begotten Wisdom and Framer of the creatures, and when they say `He created,' they say it not in respect of His Essence, but signify that He was becoming a beginning of many ways; so that `He created' is in contrast to `Offspring,' and His being called the `Beginning of ways[fn-61-P6183_2467906:317-nf] ' to His being the Only-begotten Word.","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"50. Your famous assertion then, that the Son is a creature, is not true, but is your fantasy only; nay Solomon convicts you of having many times slandered him. For he has not called Him creature, but God's Offspring and Wisdom, saying, `God in Wisdom established the earth,' and `Wisdom built her an house[fn-61-P6195_2473690:326-nf] .' And the very passage in question proves your irreligious spirit; for it is written, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways for His works.' Therefore if He is before all things, yet says `He created me' (not `that I might make the works,' but) `for the works,' unless `He created' relates to something later than Himself, He will seem later than the works, finding them on His creation already in existence before Him, for the sake of which He is also brought into being.

For if, as they hold, the Essence of the Word being of created nature, therefore He says, `The Lord created me,' being a creature, He was not created for us; but if He was not created for us, we are not created in Him; and, if not created in Him, we have Him not in ourselves but externally; as, for instance, as receiving instruction from Him as from a teacher[fn-62-P6243_2492137:365-nf] . And it being so with us, sin has not lost its reign over the flesh, being inherent and not cast out of it. But the Apostle opposes such a doctrine a little before, when he says, `For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus[fn-62-P6244_2492394:366-nf] ;' and if in Christ we are created, then it is not He who is created, but we in Him; and thus the words `He created' are for our sake. For because of our need, the Word, though being Creator, endured words which are used of creatures; which are not proper to Him, as being the Word, but are ours who are created in Him. And as, since the Father is always, so is His Word, and always being, always says `I was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him[fn-62-P6245_2492870:367-nf] ,' and `I am in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-62-P6246_2492941:368-nf] ;' so, when for our need He became man, consistently does He use language, as ourselves, `The Lord hath created Me,' that, by His dwelling in the flesh, sin might perfectly be expelled from the flesh, and we might have a free mind[fn-62-P6247_2493193:369-nf] . For what ought He, when made man, to say? `In the beginning I was man?' this were neither suitable to Him nor true; and as it beseemed not to say this, so it is natural and proper in the case of man to say, `He created' and `He made' Him. On this account then the reason of `He created' is added, namely, the need of the works; and where the reason is added, surely the reason rightly explains the lection. Thus here, when He says `He created,' He sets down the cause, `the works;' on the other hand, when He signifies absolutely the generation from the Father, straightway He adds, `Before all the hills He begets me[fn-62-P6248_2494647:370-nf] ;' but He does not add the `wherefore,' as in the case of `He created,' saying, `for the works,' but absolutely, `He begets me,' as in the text, `In the beginning was the Word[fn-62-P6249_2494846:371-nf] .' For, though no works had been created, still `the Word' of God `was,' and `the Word was God.' And His becoming man would not have taken place, had not the need of men become a cause.

For had He been a creature, He had not said, `He begets me,' for the creatures are from without, and are works of the Maker; but the Offspring is not from without nor a work, but from the Father, and proper to His Essence. Wherefore they are creatures; this God's Word and Only-begotten Son. For instance, Moses did not say of the creation, `In the beginning He begat,' nor `In the beginning was,' but `In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth[fn-62-P6254_2496239:372-nf] .' Nor did David say in the Psalm, `Thy hands have \"begotten me,\"' but `made me and fashioned me[fn-62-P6255_2496354:373-nf] ,' everywhere applying the word `made' to the creatures. But to the Son contrariwise; for he has not said `I made,' but `I begat[fn-62-P6256_2496504:374-nf] ,' and `He begets me,' and `My heart uttered a good Word[fn-62-P6257_2496579:375-nf] .' And in the instance of the creation, `In the beginning He made;' but in the instance of the Son, `In the beginning was the Word[fn-62-P6258_2496729:376-nf] .' And there is this difference, that the creatures are made upon the beginning, and have a beginning of existence connected with an interval; wherefore also what is said of them, `In the beginning He made,' is as much as saying of them, `From the beginning He made:'-as the Lord, knowing that which He had made, taught, when He silenced the Pharisees, with the words, `He which made them from the beginning, made them male and female[fn-62-P6259_2497182:377-nf] ;' for from some beginning, when they were not yet, were originate things brought into being and created. This too the Holy Spirit has signified in the Psalms, saying, `Thou, Lord, at the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth[fn-62-P6260_2497439:378-nf] ;' and again, `O think upon Thy congregation which Thou hast purchased from the beginning[fn-62-P6261_2497549:379-nf] ;' now it is plain that what takes place at the beginning, has a beginning of creation, and that from some beginning God purchased His congregation. And that `In the beginning He made,' from his saying `made,' means `began to make,' Moses himself shews by saying, after the completion of all things, `And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because that in it He had rested from all His work which God began to make[fn-62-P6262_2497997:380-nf] .' Therefore the creatures began to be made; but the Word of God, not having beginning of being, certainly did not begin to be, nor begin to come to be, but was ever. And the works have their beginning in their making, and their beginning precedes their coming to be; but the Word, not being of things which come to be, rather comes to be Himself the Framer of those which have a beginning. And the being of things originate is measured by their becoming[fn-62-P6263_2498471:381-nf] , and from some beginning does God begin to make them through the Word, that it may be known that they were not before their origination; but the Word has His being, in no other beginning[fn-62-P6264_2498686:382-nf] than the Father, whom[fn-62-P6265_2498739:383-nf] they allow to be without beginning, so that He too exists without beginning? the Father, being His Offspring, not His creature.

For God not only created them to be men, but called them to be sons, as having begotten them. For the term `begat' is here as elsewhere expressive of a Son, as He says by the Prophet, `I begat sons and exalted them;' and generally, when Scripture wishes to signify a son, it does so, not by the term `created,' but undoubtedly by that of `begat.' And this John seems to say, `He gave to them power to become children of God, even to them that believe on His Name; which were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God[fn-62-P6275_2502484:391-nf] .' And here too the cautious distinction[fn-62-P6276_2502556:392-nf] is well kept up, for first he says `become,' because they are not called sons by nature but by adoption; then he says `were begotten,' because they too had received at any rate the name of son. But the People, as says the Prophet, `despised' their Benefactor. But this is God's kindness to man, that of whom He is Maker, of them according to grace He afterwards becomes Father also; becomes, that is, when men, His creatures, receive into their hearts, as the Apostle says, `the Spirit of His Son, crying, Abba, Father[fn-62-P6277_2503107:393-nf] .' And these are they who, having received the Word, gained power from Him to become sons of God; for they could not become sons, being by nature creatures, otherwise than by receiving the Spirit of the natural and true Son. Wherefore, that this might be, `The Word became flesh,' that He might make man capable of Godhead. This same meaning may be gained also from the Prophet Malachi, who says, `Hath not One God created us?

Therefore `Father' is proper to the Son; and not `creature,' but `Son' is proper to the Father. Accordingly this passage also proves, that we are not sons by nature, but the Son who is in us[fn-62-P6279_2504061:395-nf] ; and again, that God is not our Father by nature, but of that Word in us, in whom and because of whom we `cry, Abba, Father[fn-62-P6280_2504400:396-nf] .' And so in like manner, the Father calls them sons in whomsoever He sees His own Son, and says, `I begat;' since begetting is significant of a Son, and making is indicative of the works.

For God not only created them to be men, but called them to be sons, as having begotten them. For the term `begat' is here as elsewhere expressive of a Son, as He says by the Prophet, `I begat sons and exalted them;' and generally, when Scripture wishes to signify a son, it does so, not by the term `created,' but undoubtedly by that of `begat.' And this John seems to say, `He gave to them power to become children of God, even to them that believe on His Name; which were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God[fn-62-P6275_2502484:391-nf] .' And here too the cautious distinction[fn-62-P6276_2502556:392-nf] is well kept up, for first he says `become,' because they are not called sons by nature but by adoption; then he says `were begotten,' because they too had received at any rate the name of son. But the People, as says the Prophet, `despised' their Benefactor. But this is God's kindness to man, that of whom He is Maker, of them according to grace He afterwards becomes Father also; becomes, that is, when men, His creatures, receive into their hearts, as the Apostle says, `the Spirit of His Son, crying, Abba, Father[fn-62-P6277_2503107:393-nf] .' And these are they who, having received the Word, gained power from Him to become sons of God; for they could not become sons, being by nature creatures, otherwise than by receiving the Spirit of the natural and true Son. Wherefore, that this might be, `The Word became flesh,' that He might make man capable of Godhead. This same meaning may be gained also from the Prophet Malachi, who says, `Hath not One God created us? Have we not all one Father[fn-62-P6278_2503585:394-nf] ?' for first he puts `created,' next `Father,' to shew, as the other writers, that from the beginning we were creatures by nature, and God is our Creator through the Word; but afterwards we were made sons, and thenceforward God the Creator becomes our Father also.

The Word then is neither creature nor work; for creature, thing made, work, are all one; and were He creature and thing made, He would also be work.

Therefore if by the Hand of God the works are wrought, and it is written that `all things were made through the Word,' and `without Him was not made one thing[fn-63-P6387_2544442:491-nf] ,' and again, `One Lord Jesus, through whom are all things[fn-63-P6388_2544518:492-nf] ,' and `in Him all things consist[fn-63-P6389_2544575:493-nf] ,' it is very plain that the Son cannot be a work, but He is the Hand[fn-63-P6390_2544664:494-nf] of God and the Wisdom.

Hence the whole earth is filled with the knowledge of Him; for the knowledge of Father through Son and of Son from Father is one and the same, and the Father delights in Him, and in the same joy the Son rejoices in the Father, saying, `I was by Him, daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him[fn-64-P6482_2575763:571-nf] .' And this again proves that the Son is not foreign, but proper to the Father's Essence. For behold, not because of us has He come to be, as the irreligious men say, nor is He out of nothing (for not from without did God procure for Himself a cause of rejoicing), but the words denote what is His own and like. When then was it, when the Father rejoiced not? but if He ever rejoiced, He was ever, in whom He rejoiced. And in whom does the Father rejoice, except as seeing Himself in His own Image, which is His Word? And though in sons of men also He had delight, on finishing the world, as it is written in these same Proverbs[fn-64-P6483_2576416:572-nf] , yet this too has a consistent sense. For even thus He had delight, not because joy was added to Him, but again on seeing the works made after His own Image; so that even this rejoicing of God is on account of His Image. And how too has the Son delight, except as seeing Himself in the Father? for this is the same as saying, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father,' and `I am in the Father and the Father in Me[fn-64-P6484_2576857:573-nf] .'

For behold your sense is proved to be but a fantasy; but the passage in the Proverbs, as well as all that is above said, proves that the Son is not a creature in nature and essence, but the proper Offspring of the Father, true Wisdom and Word, by whom `all things were made,' and `without Him was made not one thing[fn-64-P6487_2577868:576-nf] '","title":"Discourse II","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"4. On this account and reasonably, having said before, `I and the Father are One,' He added, `I in the Father and the Father in Me,[fn-65-P6525_2591232:27-nf] ' by way of shewing the identity[fn-65-P6526_2591282:28-nf] of Godhead and the unity of Essence. For they are one, not[fn-65-P6527_2591364:29-nf] as one thing divided into two parts, and these nothing but one, nor as one thing twice named, so that the Same becomes at one time Father, at another His own Son, for this Sabellius holding was judged an heretic. But They are two, because the Father is Father and is not also Son, and the Son is Son and not also Father[fn-65-P6528_2591708:30-nf] ; but the nature is one; (for the offspring is not unlike[fn-65-P6529_2591781:31-nf] its parent, for it is his image), and all that is the Father's, is the Son's[fn-65-P6530_2591995:32-nf] . Wherefore neither is the Son another God, for He was not procured from without, else were there many, if a godhead be procured foreign from the Father's[fn-65-P6531_2592274:33-nf] ; for if the Son be other, as an Offspring, still He is the Same as God; and He and the Father are one in propriety and peculiarity of nature, and in the identity of the one Godhead, as has been said. For the radiance also is light, not second to the sun, nor a different light, nor from participation of it, but a whole and proper offspring of it. And such an offspring is necessarily one light; and no one would say that they are two lights[fn-65-P6532_2592732:34-nf] , but sun and radiance two, yet one the light from the sun enlightening in its radiance all things. So also the Godhead of the Son is the Father's; whence also it is indivisible; and thus there is one God and none other but He. And so, since they are one, and the Godhead itself one, the same things are said of the Son, which are said of the Father, except His being said to be Father[fn-65-P6533_2593166:35-nf] :-for instance[fn-65-P6534_2593200:36-nf] , that He is God, `And the Word was God[fn-65-P6535_2593269:37-nf] ;' Almighty, `Thus saith He which was and is and is to come, the Almighty[fn-65-P6536_2593359:38-nf] ;' Lord, `One Lord Jesus Christ[fn-65-P6537_2593407:39-nf] ;' that He is Light, `I am the Light[fn-65-P6538_2593465:40-nf] ;' that He wipes out sins, `that ye may know,' He says, `that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins[fn-65-P6539_2593600:41-nf] ;' and so with other attributes.

Again, taking patterns for man from divine subjects, the Saviour says; `Be ye merciful, as your Father which is in heaven is merciful[fn-66-P6669_2647294:150-nf] ;' and, `Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect[fn-66-P6670_2647373:151-nf] .' And He said this too, not that we might become such as the Father; for to become as the Father, is impossible for us creatures, who have been brought to be out of nothing; but as He charged us, `Be ye not like to horse,' not lest we should become as draught animals, but that we should not imitate their want of reason, so, not that we might become as God, did He say, `Be ye merciful as your Father,' but that looking at His beneficent acts, what we do well, we might do, not for men's sake, but for His sake, so that from Him and not from men we may have the reward. For as, although there be one Son by nature, True and Only-begotten, we too become sons, not as He in nature and truth, but according to the grace of Him that calleth, and though we are men from the earth, are yet called gods[fn-66-P6671_2648191:152-nf] , not as the True God or His Word, but as has pleased God who has given us that grace; so also, as God do we become merciful, not by being made equal to God, nor becoming in nature and truth benefactors (for it is not our gift to benefit but belongs to God), but in order that what has accrued to us from God Himself by grace, these things we may impart to others, without making distinctions, but largely towards all extending our kind service. For only in this way can we anyhow become imitators, and in no other, when we minister to others what comes from Him. And as we put a fair and right[fn-66-P6672_2648831:153-nf] sense upon these texts, such again is the sense of the lection in John. For he does not say, that, as the Son is in the Father, such we must become:-whence could it be? when He is God's Word and Wisdom, and we were fashioned out of the earth, and He is by nature and essence Word and true God (for thus speaks John, `We know that the Son of God is come, and He hath given us an understanding to know Him that is true, and we are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ; this is the true God and eternal life[fn-66-P6673_2649370:154-nf] ') and we are made sons through Him by adoption and grace, as partaking of His Spirit (for `as many as received Him,' he says, `to them gave He power to become children of God, even to them that believe on His Name[fn-66-P6674_2649606:155-nf] '), and therefore also He is the Truth (saying, `I am the Truth,' and in His address to His Father, He said, `Sanctify them through Thy Truth, Thy Word is Truth[fn-66-P6675_2649786:156-nf] '); but we by imitation[fn-66-P6676_2649839:157-nf] become virtuous[fn-66-P6677_2650220:158-nf] and sons:-therefore not that we might become such as He, did He say `that they may be one as We are;' but that as He, being the Word, is in His own Father, so that we too, taking an examplar and looking at Him, might become one towards each other in concord and oneness of spirit, nor be at variance as the Corinthians, but mind the same thing, as those five thousand in the Acts[fn-66-P6678_2650648:159-nf] , who were as one.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"30. The reader then of divine Scripture may acquaint himself with these passages from the ancient books; and from the Gospels on the other hand he will perceive that the Lord became man; for `the Word,' he says, `became flesh, and dwelt among us[fn-67-P6760_2679920:227-nf] .' And He became man, and did not come into man; for this it is necessary to know, lest perchance these irreligious men fall into this notion also, and beguile any into thinking, that, as in former times the Word was used to come into each of the Saints, so now He sojourned in a man, hallowing him also, and manifesting[fn-67-P6761_2680260:228-nf] Himself as in the others. For if it were so, and He only appeared in a man, it were nothing strange, nor had those who saw Him been startled, saying, Whence is He? and wherefore dost Thou, being a man, make Thyself God? for they were familiar with the idea, from the words, `And the Word of the Lord came' to this or that of the Prophets[fn-67-P6762_2681426:229-nf] . But now, since the Word of God, by whom all things came to be, endured to become also Son of man, and humbled Himself, taking a servant's form, therefore to the Jews the Cross of Christ is a scandal, but to us Christ is `God's power' and `God's wisdom[fn-67-P6763_2681712:230-nf] ;' for `the Word,' as John says, `became flesh' (it being the custom[fn-67-P6764_2681802:231-nf] of Scripture to call man by the name of `flesh,' as it says by Joel the Prophet, `I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh;' and as Daniel said to Astyages, `I do not worship idols made with hands, but the Living God, who hath created the heaven and the earth, and hath sovereignty over all flesh[fn-67-P6765_2682125:232-nf] ;' for both he and Joel call mankind flesh).","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"43. Now why it was that, though He knew, He did not tell His disciples plainly at that time, no one may be curious[fn-68-P6869_2724104:315-nf] where He has been silent; for `Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor[fn-68-P6870_2724226:316-nf] ?' but why, though He knew, He said, `no, not the Son knows,' this I think none of the faithful is ignorant, viz. that He made this as those other declarations as man by reason of the flesh. For this as before is not the Word's deficiency[fn-68-P6871_2724485:317-nf] , but of that human nature[fn-68-P6872_2724530:318-nf] whose property it is to be ignorant. And this again will be weIl seen by honestly examining into the occasion, when and to whom the Saviour spoke thus. Not then when the heaven was made by Him, nor when He was with the Father Himself, the Word `disposing all things[fn-68-P6873_2724821:319-nf] ,' nor before He became man did He say it, but when `the Word became flesh[fn-68-P6874_2724924:320-nf] .' On this account it is reasonable to ascribe to His manhood everything which, after He became man, He speaks humanly. For it is proper to the Word to know what was made, nor be ignorant either of the beginning or of the end of these (for the works are His), and He knows how many things He wrought, and the limit of their consistence. And knowing of each the beginning and the end, He knows surely the general and common end of all. Certainly when He says in the Gospel concerning Himself in His human character, `Father, the hour is come, glorify Thy Son[fn-68-P6875_2725501:321-nf] ,' it is plain that He knows also the hour of the end of all things, as the Word, though as man He is ignorant of it, for ignorance is proper to man[fn-68-P6876_2725670:322-nf] , and especially ignorance of these things. Moreover this is proper to the Saviour's love of man; for since He was made man, He is not ashamed, because of the flesh which is ignorant[fn-68-P6877_2727888:323-nf] , to say `I know not,' that He may shew that knowing as God, He is but ignorant according to the flesh[fn-68-P6878_2728007:324-nf] . And therefore He said not, `no, not the Son of God knows,' test the Godhead should seem ignorant, but simply, `no, not the Son,' that the ignorance might be the Son's as born from among men.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"88","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"59.

He then acknowledging the perverseness of his views, and seeing the light of faith, wrote to the Gallican Bishops, and thus began:[fn-68-P6888_2475365:9-nf] \"I scarcely know, O my most venerable lords and blessed priests, what first to accuse myself of, and what first to excuse myself for. Clumsiness and pride and foolish ignorance together with wrong notions, zeal combined with indiscretion, and (to speak truly) a weak faith which was gradually failing, all these were admitted by me and flourished to such an extent that I am ashamed of having yielded to such and so many sins, while at the same time I am profoundly thankful for having been able to cast them out of my soul.\" And after a little he adds: \"If then, not understanding this power of God, and wise in our conceits and opinions, from fear lest God should seem to act a part that was beneath Him, we suppose that a man was born in conjunction with God, in such a way that we ascribe to God alone what belongs to God separately, and attribute to man alone what belongs to man separately, we clearly add a fourth Person to the Trinity and out of the one God the Son begin to make not one but two Christs; from which may our Lord and God Jesus Christ Himself preserve us. Therefore we confess that our Lord and God Jesus Christ the only Son of God, who for His own sake[fn-68-P6889_2476707:10-nf] was begotten of the Father before all worlds, when in time He was for our sakes[fn-68-P6890_2476810:11-nf] made man of the Holy Ghost and the ever-virgin Mary, was God at His birth; and while we confess the two substances of the flesh and the Word,[fn-68-P6891_2477046:12-nf] we always acknowledge with pious belief and faith one and the same Person to be indivisibly God and man; and we say that from the time when He took upon Him flesh all that belonged to God was given to man, as all that belonged to man was joined to God.[fn-68-P6892_2477535:13-nf] And in this sense `the Word was made flesh:'[fn-68-P6893_2477600:14-nf] not that He began by any conversion or change to be what He was not, but that by the Divine `economy' the Word of the Father never left the Father,[fn-68-P6894_2478349:15-nf] and yet vouchsafed to become truly man, and the Only Begotten was incarnate through that hidden mystery which He alone understands (for it is ours to believe: His to understand). And thus God `the Word' Himself receiving everything that belongs to man, is made man, and the manhood[fn-68-P6895_2479079:16-nf] which is assumed, receiving everything that belongs to God cannot but be God; but whereas He is said to be incarnate and unmixed, we must not hold that there is any diminution of His substance: for God knows how to communicate Himself without suffering any corruption, and yet truly to communicate Himself. He knows how to receive into Himself without Himself being increased thereby, just as He knows how to impart Himself in such a way as Himself to suffer no loss. We should not then in our feeble minds make guesses, in accordance with visible proofs and experiments, from the case of creatures which are equal, and which mutually enter into each other, nor think that God and man are mixed together, and that out of such a fusion of flesh and the Word (i.e., the Godhead and manhood) some sort of body is produced. God forbid that we should imagine that the two natures being in a way moulded together should become one substance. For a mixture of this sort is destructive of both parts. For God, who contains and is not Himself contained, who enters into things and is not Himself entered into, who fills things and is not Himself filled, who is everywhere at once in His completeness and is diffused everywhere, communicates Himself graciously to human nature by the infusion of His power.\" And after a little: \"Therefore the God-man, Jesus Christ, tho Son of God, is truly born for us of the Holy Ghost and the ever-virgin Mary. And so in the two natures the Word and Flesh become one, so that while each substance continues naturally perfect in itself, what is Divine imparteth without suffering any loss, to the humanity, and what is human participates in the Divine; nor is there one person God, and another person man, but the same person is God who is also man: and again the man who is also God is called and indeed is Jesus Christ the only Son of God; and so we must always take care and believe so as not to deny that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Very God (whom we confess as existing ever with the Father and equal to the Father before all worlds) became from the moment when He took flesh the God-man. Nor may we imagine that gradually as time went on He became God, and that He was in one condition before the resurrection and in another after it, but that He was always of the same fulness and power.\" And again a little later on: \"But because the Word of God[fn-68-P6896_2481522:17-nf] vouchsafed to come down upon manhood by assuming manhood, and manhood was taken up into the Word by being assumed by God, God the Word in His completeness became complete man. For it was not God the Father who was made man, nor the Holy Ghost, but the Only Be-555gotten of the Father; and so we must hold that there is one Person of the Flesh and the Word: so as faithfully and without any doubt to believe that one and the same Son of God, who can never be divided, existing in two natures[fn-68-P6897_2482031:18-nf] (who was also spoken of as a \"giant\"[fn-68-P6898_2482534:19-nf] ) in the days of His Flesh truly took upon Him all that belongs to man, and ever truly had as His own what belongs to God: since even though[fn-68-P6899_2482717:20-nf] He was crucified in weakness, yet He liveth by the power of God.\"","title":"Book I.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_70_sermon_liii_ciii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"2. Martha and Mary were two sisters, true kinswomen both, not only in blood, but in religion also; both clave to the Lord, both with one heart served the Lord when He was present in the flesh. Martha received Him, as strangers are usually received. Yet it was the handmaid received her Lord, the sick her Saviour, the creature her Creator. And she received Him to be fed in the body, herself to be fed in spirit. For the Lord was pleased to \"take on Him the form of a servant,\"[fn-53-P5316_2258905:1-nf] and \"having taken the form of a servant\" in it to be fed by servants, by reason of His condescension, not His condition.

By no means. He did not fail in His power of feeding him, when He sent him to the widow; but He designed to bless the religious widow, by means of her pious office paid to His servant.

We read in the Acts of the Apostles that the Apostle James[fn-69-P6953_2511187:25-nf] thus refuted those who thought that when they received the gospel they ought still to bear the yoke of the old Law: \"Why,\" said he, \"do ye tempt God, to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear. But by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ we believe to be saved in like manner as they also.\"[fn-69-P6954_2511557:26-nf] The Apostle certainly speaks of the gift of this grace as given by Jesus Christ. Answer me now, if you please: do you think that this grace which is given for the salvation of all men, is given by man or by God? If you say, By man, Paul, God's own vessel, will cry out against you, saying: \"There appeared the grace of God our Saviour.\"[fn-69-P6955_2511913:27-nf] He teaches that this grace is the result of a Divine gift, and not of human weakness. And even if the sacred testimony was not sufficient, the truth of the matter itself would bear its witness, because fragile earthly things cannot possibly furnish a thing of lasting and immortal value; nor can anyone give to another that in which he himself is lacking, nor supply a sufficiency of that, from the want of which he admits that he himself is suffering. You cannot then help admitting that the grace comes from God. It is God then who has given it. But it has been given by our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore the Lord Jesus Christ is God. But if He be, as He certainly is, God: then she who bore God is Theotocos, i.e., the mother of God. Unless perhaps you want to take refuge in so utterly absurd and blasphemous a contradiction as to deny that she from whom God was born is the mother of God, while you cannot deny that He who was born is God. But, however, let us see what the gospel of God thinks about this same grace of our Lord: \"Grace and truth,\" it says, \"came by Jesus Christ.\"[fn-69-P6956_2513020:28-nf] If Christ is a mere man, how did these come by Christ? Whence was there in Him Divine power if, as you say,there was in Him only the nature of man? Whence comes heavenly largesse, if His is earthly poverty? For no one can give what he has not already. As then Christ gave Divine grace, He already had that which He gave. Nor can anyone endure a diversity of things that are so utterly different from each other, as at one and the same time to suffer the wants of a poor man, and also to show the munificence of a bounteous one. And so the Apostle Paul, knowing that all the treasures of heavenly riches are found in Christ, rightly writes to the Churches: \"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.\"[fn-69-P6957_2513747:29-nf] For though he had already often enough taught that God is the same as Christ, and that all the glory of Deity resides in Him, and that all the fulness of the Godhead dwelleth in Him bodily, yet here he is certainly right in praying for the grace of Christ alone, without adding the word God: for while he had often taught that the grace of God is the same as the grace of Christ, he now most perfectly prays only for the grace of Christ, for he knows that in the grace of Christ is contained the whole grace of God. Therefore he says: \"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.\" If Jesus Christ was a mere man, then in his wish that the grace of Christ might be given to the Churches he was wishing that the grace of a man might be given; and by saying: \"The grace of Christ be with you\" he meant: the grace of a man be with you, the grace of flesh be with you, the grace of bodily weakness, the grace of human frailty! Or why did he ever even mention the word grace, if his wish was for the grace of a man? For there was no reason for wishing, if that was not in existence which was wished for; nor ought he to have prayed that there might be bestowed on themthe grace of one who, according to you, did not possess the reality of that grace for which he was wishing. And so you see that it is utterly absurd and ridiculous - or rather not a thing to laugh at but to cry over, for what is a matter for laughter to some frivolous persons becomes a matter for crying to pious and faithful souls, for they shed tears of charity for the folly of your unbelief, and weep pious tears at thefolly of another's impiety. Let us then recover ourselves for a while and take our breath, for this idea is not only without wisdom but also without the Spirit, as it is certainly wanting in spiritual wisdom and has nothing to do with the Spirit of salvation.","title":"Book II.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_71_sermon_liv_civ_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"The things which were made, are many, He who made them is One.

Let us consider then our \"occupations about many things.\" Much serving is necessary for the refreshment of our bodies. Wherefore is this? Because we hunger, and thirst. Mercy is necessary for the miserable. Thou breakest bread to the hungry; because thou hast found an hungry man; take hunger away; to whom dost thou break bread? Take houseless wandering[fn-53-P5357_2272255:5-nf] away; to whom dost thou show hospitality? Take nakedness away; to whom dost thou furnish clothes? Let there be no sickness; whom dost thou visit?

The more lowlily she sat, the more amply did she receive. For the water flows together to the low hollows of the valley, runs down from the risings of the hill. The Lord then did not blame Martha's work, but distinguished between their services. \"Thou art occupied about many things; yet one thing is needful.\" Already hath Mary chosen this for herself. The labour of manifoldness passeth away, and the love of unity abideth. Therefore what she hath chosen, \"shall not be taken from her.\" But from thee, that which thou hast chosen (of course this follows, of course this is understood) from thee, that which thou hast chosen shall be taken away.

The heaven, the earth, the sea, and all things that in them are, how many are they! Who could enumerate them? who conceive their vast number? Who made all these? God made them all. Behold, \"they are very good.\"[fn-53-P5356_2271814:4-nf] Very good are the things He made; how much better is He who made them! Let us consider then our \"occupations about many things.\" Much serving is necessary for the refreshment of our bodies. Wherefore is this? Because we hunger, and thirst. Mercy is necessary for the miserable. Thou breakest bread to the hungry; because thou hast found an hungry man; take hunger away; to whom dost thou break bread? Take houseless wandering[fn-53-P5357_2272255:5-nf] away; to whom dost thou show hospitality? Take nakedness away; to whom dost thou furnish clothes? Let there be no sickness; whom dost thou visit? No captivity; whom dost thou redeem? No quarrelling; whom dost thou reconcile? No death; whom dost thou bury? In that world to come, these evils will not be; therefore these services will not be either. Well then did Martha, as touching the bodily-what shall I call it, want, or will, of the Lord?-minister to His mortal flesh. But who was He in that mortal flesh? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God:\"[fn-53-P5358_2272868:6-nf] see what Mary was listening to! \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us:\"[fn-53-P5359_2272962:7-nf] see to whom Martha was ministering! Therefore \"hath Mary chosen the better part, which shall not be taken from her.\" For she chose that which shall abide for ever; \"it shall not be taken from her.\" She wished to be occupied about \"one thing.\" She understood already, \"But it is good for me to cleave to the Lord.\"[fn-53-P5360_2273291:8-nf] She sat at the feet of our Head. The more lowlily she sat, the more amply did she receive. For the water flows together to the low hollows of the valley, runs down from the risings of the hill. The Lord then did not blame Martha's work, but distinguished between their services. \"Thou art occupied about many things; yet one thing is needful.\" Already hath Mary chosen this for herself. The labour of manifoldness passeth away, and the love of unity abideth. Therefore what she hath chosen, \"shall not be taken from her.\" But from thee, that which thou hast chosen (of course this follows, of course this is understood) from thee, that which thou hast chosen shall be taken away.

When our Lord Jesus Christ had spoken these things, the Jews answered, \"Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.\" Before our Lord Jesus Christ came, He lighted and sent many prophetic lamps before Him. Of these was also John Baptist, to whom the great Light itself, which is the Lord Christ, gave a testimony such as was given to no other man; for He said, \"Among them that are born of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist.\"[fn-15-P1545_973358:1-nf] Yet this man, than whom none was greater among those born of women, said of the Lord Jesus Christ, \"I indeed baptize you in water; but He that is coming is mightier than I, whose shoe I am not worthy to loose.\"[fn-15-P1546_973586:2-nf] See how the lamps submits itself to the Day.

The Jews then answered, \"Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.\" Let us see what they hear; let us also hear, yet not as they did: they despising, we believing; they wishing to slay Christ, we desiring to live through Christ. Let this difference distinguish our ears and minds from theirs, and let us hear what the Lord answers to the Jews. \"Jesus answered and said to them, Though I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; because I know whence I came and whither I go.\" The light shows both other things and also itself. Thou lightest a lamp, for instance, to look for thy coat, and the burning lamp affords thee light to find thy coat; dost thou light the lamp to see itself when it burns? A burning lamp is indeed capable at the same time of exposing to view other things which the darkness covered, and also of showing itself to thine eyes. So also the Lord Christ distinguished between His faithful ones and His Jewish enemies, as between light and darkness: as between those whom He illuminated with the ray of faith, and those on whose closed eyes He shed His light. So, too, the sun shines on the face of the sighted and of the blind; both alike standing and facing the sun are shone upon in the flesh, but both are not enlightened in the eyesight. The one sees, the other sees not: the sun is present to both, but one is absent from the present sun. So likewise the Wisdom of God, the Word of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, is everywhere present, because the truth is everywhere, wisdom is everywhere. One man in the east understands justice, another man in the west understands justice; is justice which the one understands a different thing from that which the other understands? In body they are far apart, and yet they have the eyes of their minds on one object. The justice which I, placed here, see, if justice it is, is the same which the just man, separated from me in the flesh by ever so many days' journey, also Sees, and is united to me in the light of that justice. Therefore the light bears witness to itself; it opens the sound eyes and is its own witness, that it may be known as the light. But how about the unbelievers? Is it not present to them? It is present also to them, but they have not eyes of the heart with which to see it. Hear the sentence fetched from the Gospel itself concerning them: \"And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.\"[fn-15-P1554_979987:8-nf] Hence the Lord saith, and saith truly, \"Though I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; because I know whence I came and whither I go.\" He meant us to understand the Father here: the Son gave glory to the Father.

But in answer to the weak and human notion of the Arians, their supposing that the Lord is in want, when He says, `Is given unto Me,' and `I received,' and if Paul says, `Wherefore He highly exalted Him,' and `He set Him at the right hand[fn-71-P7126_2830911:30-nf] ,' and the like, we must say that our Lord, being Word and Son of God, bore a body, and became Son of Man, that, having become Mediator between God, and men, He might minister the things of God to us, and ours to God. When then He is said to hunger and weep and weary, and to cry Eloi, Eloi, which are our human affections, He receives them from us and offers to the Father[fn-71-P7127_2831345:31-nf] , interceding for us, that in Him they may be annulled[fn-71-P7128_2831432:32-nf] . And when it is said, `All power is given unto Me,' and `I received,' and `Wherefore God highly exalted Him,' these are gifts given from God to us through Him. For the Word was never in want[fn-71-P7129_2831656:33-nf] , nor has come into being[fn-71-P7130_2831698:34-nf] ; nor again were men sufficient to minister these things for themselves, but through the Word they are given to us; therefore, as if given to Him, they are imparted to us. For this was the reason of His becoming man, that, as being given to Him, they might pass on to us[fn-71-P7131_2831997:35-nf] . For of such gifts mere man had not become worthy; and again the mere Word had not needed them[fn-71-P7132_2832113:36-nf] ; the Word then was united to us, and then imparted to us power, and highly exalted us[fn-71-P7133_2832225:37-nf] . For the Word being in man, highly exalted man himself; and, when the Word was in man, man himself received. Since then, the Word being in flesh, man himself was exalted, and received power, therefore these things are referred to the Word, since they were given on His account; for on account of the Word in man were these gifts given. And as `the Word became flesh[fn-71-P7134_2832612:38-nf] ,' so also man himself received the gifts which came through the Word. For all that man himself has received, the Word is said to have received[fn-71-P7135_2832773:39-nf] ; that it might be shewn, that man himself, being unworthy to receive, as far as his own nature is concerned, yet has received because of the Word become flesh. Wherefore if anything be said to be given to the Lord, or the like, we must consider that it is given, not to Him as needing it, but to man himself through the Word. For every one interceding for another, receives the gift in his own person, not as needing, but on his account for whom he intercedes.","title":"Discourse IV","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_62_discourse_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"16.

But if the Son was ever, He must be the Word; for if the Word be not Son, and this is what a man waxes bold to say, either he holds that Word to be Father or the Son superior to the Word. For the Son being `in the bosom of the Father[fn-71-P7180_2850328:69-nf] ,' of necessity either the Word is not before the Son (for nothing is before Him who is in the Father), or if the Word be other than the Son, the Word must be the Father in whom is the Son.

For not both the Word and the Son are in the bosom, but one must be, and He the Son, who is Only-begotten.

Either then the Word does not know, or if He knows, it is not true that `no one knows.'

The Jews answered Him, saying, For a good work we stone Thee not, but for blasphemy, and because that Thou, being a man, makest Thyself God. Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? If he called them gods unto whom the Word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken, say ye of Him, whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not. But if I do, though ye believe not Me, believe the works, that ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.' And yet, as far as the surface of the words intimated, He said neither `I am God,' nor `I am Son of God,' but `I and the Father are One.'","title":"Discourse IV","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_62_discourse_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"19. This then being shewn, it follows that the Word is the Son. But if the Son is the Light, which has come into the world, beyond all dispute the world was made by the Son. For in the beginning of the Gospel, the Evangelist, speaking of John the Baptist, says, `He was not that Light, but that he might bear witness concerning that Light[fn-71-P7194_2857050:80-nf] .' For Christ Himself was, as we have said before, the True Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world. For if `He was in the world, and the world was made by Him[fn-71-P7195_2857242:81-nf] ,' of necessity He is the Word of God, concerning whom also the Evangelist witnesses that all things were made by Him. For either they will be compelled to speak of two worlds, that the one may have come into being by the Son and the other by the Word, or, if the world is one and the creation one, it follows that Son and Word are one and the same before all creation, for by Him it came into being. Therefore if as by the Word, so by the Son also all things came to be, it will not be contradictory, but even identical to say, for instance, `In the beginning was the Word,' or, `In the beginning was the Son.' But if because John did not say, `In the beginning was the Son,' they shall maintain that the attributes of the Word do not suit with the Son, it at once follows that the attributes of the Son do not suit with the Word. But it was shewn that to the Son belongs, `I and the Father are One,' and that it is He `Who is in the bosom of the Father,' and, `He that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me[fn-71-P7196_2858262:82-nf] ;' and that `the world was brought into being by Him,' is common to the Word and the Son; so that from this the Son is shewn to be before the world; for of necessity the Framer is before the things brought into being. And what is said to Philip must belong, according to them, not to the Word, but to the Son. For, `Jesus said,' says Scripture, `Have I been so long time with you, and yet thou hast not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father. And how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? Believest thou not, that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? the words that I speak unto you, I speak not of Myself, but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else, believe Me for the very works' sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto the Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in My Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son[fn-71-P7197_2859363:83-nf] .' Therefore if the Father be glorified in the Son, the Son must be He who said, `I in the Father and the Father in Me;' and He who said, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father;' for He, the same who thus spoke, shews Himself to be the Son, by adding, `that the Father may be glorified in the Son.'","title":"Discourse IV","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_62_discourse_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"19.

For if `He was in the world, and the world was made by Him[fn-71-P7195_2857242:81-nf] ,' of necessity He is the Word of God, concerning whom also the Evangelist witnesses that all things were made by Him. For either they will be compelled to speak of two worlds, that the one may have come into being by the Son and the other by the Word, or, if the world is one and the creation one, it follows that Son and Word are one and the same before all creation, for by Him it came into being. Therefore if as by the Word, so by the Son also all things came to be, it will not be contradictory, but even identical to say, for instance, `In the beginning was the Word,' or, `In the beginning was the Son.' But if because John did not say, `In the beginning was the Son,' they shall maintain that the attributes of the Word do not suit with the Son, it at once follows that the attributes of the Son do not suit with the Word. But it was shewn that to the Son belongs, `I and the Father are One,' and that it is He `Who is in the bosom of the Father,' and, `He that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me[fn-71-P7196_2858262:82-nf] ;' and that `the world was brought into being by Him,' is common to the Word and the Son; so that from this the Son is shewn to be before the world; for of necessity the Framer is before the things brought into being. And what is said to Philip must belong, according to them, not to the Word, but to the Son. For, `Jesus said,' says Scripture, `Have I been so long time with you, and yet thou hast not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father. And how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? Believest thou not, that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? the words that I speak unto you, I speak not of Myself, but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else, believe Me for the very works' sake. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto the Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in My Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son[fn-71-P7197_2859363:83-nf] .' Therefore if the Father be glorified in the Son, the Son must be He who said, `I in the Father and the Father in Me;' and He who said, `He that hath seen Me, hath seen the Father;' for He, the same who thus spoke, shews Himself to be the Son, by adding, `that the Father may be glorified in the Son.'","title":"Discourse IV","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_62_discourse_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"19. This then being shewn, it follows that the Word is the Son. But if the Son is the Light, which has come into the world, beyond all dispute the world was made by the Son.

Thus in the Old also, statements are plainly made concerning the Son; at the same time it is superfluous to argue the point; for if what is not stated in the Old is of later date, let them who are thus disputatious, say where in the Old is mention made of the Spirit, the Paraclete? for of the Holy Spirit there is mention, but nowhere of the Paraclete. Is then the Holy Spirit one, and the Paraclete another, and the Paraclete the later, as not mentioned in the Old? but far be it to say that the Spirit is later, or to distinguish the Holy Ghost as one and the Paraclete as another; for the Spirit is one and the same, then and now hallowing and comforting those who are His recipients; as one and the same Word and Son led even then to adoption of sons those who were worthy[fn-72-P7254_2881504:128-nf] . For sons under the Old were made such through no other than the Son. For unless even before Mary there were a Son who was of God, how is He before all, when they are sons before Him? and how also `First-born,' if He comes second after many? But neither is the Paraclete second, for He was before all, nor the Son later; for `in the beginning was the Word[fn-72-P7255_2881885:129-nf] .'

For here too he does not distinguish but witnesses the identity. And as the Paraclete is not one and the Holy Ghost another, but one and the same, so Word is not one, and Son another, but the Word is Only-Begotten; for He says not the glory of the flesh itself, but of the Word. He then who dares distinguish between Word and Son, let him distinguish between Spirit and Paraclete; but if the Spirit cannot be distinguished, so neither can the Word, being also Son and Wisdom and Power. Moreover, the word `Well-beloved' even the Greeks who are skilful in phrases know to be equivalent with `Only-begotten.'

See now here, though Moses be one, Moses himself speaks as if about another Moses, `as the Lord commanded Moses.' In like manner then, if the blessed Peter speak of the Divine Word also, as sent to the children of Israel by Jesus Christ, it is not necessary to understand that the Word is one and Christ another, but that they were one and the same by reason of the uniting which took place in His divine and loving condescension and becoming man. And even if He be considered in two ways[fn-72-P7265_2885242:137-nf] , still it is without any division of the Word, as when the inspired John says, `And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us[fn-72-P7266_2885395:138-nf] .' What then is said well and rightly[fn-72-P7267_2885452:139-nf] by the blessed Peter, the followers of the Samosatene, understanding badly and wrongly, stand not in the truth.

If then Peter says that the Word was sent through Jesus Christ unto the children of Israel, let him be understood to mean, that the Word incarnate has appeared to the children of Israel, so that it may correspond to `And the Word became flesh.' But if they understand it otherwise, and, while confessing the Word to be divine, as He is, separate from Him the Man that He has taken, with which also we believe that He is made one, saying that He has been sent through Jesus Christ, they are, without knowing it, contradicting themselves. For those who in this place separate the divine Word from the divine Incarnation, have, it seems, a degraded notion of the doctrine of His having become flesh, and entertain Gentile thoughts, as they do, conceiving that the divine Incarnation is an alteration of the Word.

For Thine they are, when spoken of Thee by Thine own. See how much is embraced in the few words of this saying of the Apostle's. \"One Lord,\" says he, \"Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.\" Did he make use of any circumlocution in order to proclaim the truth of this great mystery?[fn-71-P7109_2588027:14-nf] or did he make a long story of that which he wanted us to grasp? \"Our one Lord,\" he says, \"Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.\" In a plain and short phrase he taught the secret of this great mystery, through this confidence by which he realized that in what refers to God his statements had no need of lengthened arguments, and that the Divinity added faith to his utterances. For the demonstration of facts is enough to confirm what is said, whenever the proof rests on the authority of the speaker. There is then, he says, \"one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things.\" Notice how you read the same thing of the Word of the Father, which you read of Christ. For the gospel tells us that \"All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made.\"[fn-71-P7110_2588809:15-nf] The Apostle says, \"By Christ are all things:\" the gospel says, \"By the Word are all things.\" Do these sacred utterances contradict each other? Most certainly not. But by Christ, by whom the Apostle said that all things were created, and by the Word, by whom the Evangelist relates that all things were made, we are meant to understand one and the same Person. Hear, I tell you, what the Word of God, Himself God, has said of Himself. \"No man,\" he saith, \"hath ascended into heaven, save He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man, who is in heaven.\"[fn-71-P7111_2589388:16-nf] And again He says: \"If ye shall see the Son of man ascending where He was before.\"[fn-71-P7112_2589493:17-nf] He said that the Son of man was in heaven: He asserted that the Son of man had come down from heaven. What does it mean? Why are you muttering? Deny it, if you can. But do you ask the reason of what is said? However I do not give it you. God has said this. God has spoken this to me: His Word is the best reason. I get rid of arguments and discussions. The Person of the Speaker alone is enough to make me believe. I may not debate about the trustworthiness of what is said, nor discuss it. Why should I question whether what God has said is true, since I ought not to doubt that what God says is true. \"No man,\" He says, \"hath ascended into heaven, save He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man, who is in heaven.\" Certainly the Word of the Father was ever in heaven: and how did He assert that the Son ofman was ever in heaven? You are then to understand that He showed that He who was ever the Son of God was also the Son of man: when lie asserted that He, who had but recently appeared as the Son of man, was ever in heaven. To this points still mere that other passage in which He testifies that the same Son of man; viz., the Word of God who, as He said, came down from heaven, even at the time when He was speaking on earth, was in heaven. For \"no man,\" He said, \"hath ascended into heaven, save He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.\" Who, I pray you, is this who is speaking? Assuredly it is Christ. But where was He at the moment when He spoke? Assuredly on earth. And how can He assert that He came down from heaven when He was born, and that He was in heaven when He was speaking, or say that He is the same Son of man, when certainly no one but God can come down from heaven, and when He speaks on earth, and certainly cannot be in heaven except through the Infinite nature of God? Consider then this at last, and note that the Son of man is the same Person as the Word of God: for He is the Son of man since He is truly born of man, and the Word of God, since He who speaks on earth abideth ever in heaven. And so when He truly terms Himself the Son of man, it refers to His human birth, while the fact that He never departs from heaven, refers to the Infinite character of His Divine nature. And so the Apostle's teaching is admirably in accordance with those sacred words:(\"for He that descended,\" says He, \"is the same that ascended also above all heavens, that He might fill all things,\"[fn-71-P7113_2591955:18-nf] ) when He says that He that descended is the same that ascended. But none can descend from heaven except the Word of God: who certainly \"being in the form of God, emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross.\"[fn-71-P7114_2592339:19-nf] Thus the Word of God descended from heaven: but the Son of man ascended. But He says that the same Person ascended and descended.

At God's will the Son is what and whatsoever He is. And when and since He was, from that time He has subsisted from God. He, being a strong God, praises in His degree the Superior.

So that nothing which is called comprehensible[fn-74-P7414_2950741:59-nf] does the Son know to speak about; for it is impossible for Him to investigate the Father, who is by Himself. For the Son does not know His own essence, For, being Son, He really existed, at the will of the Father.

For sometimes days, and things, and men, and times are de- noted in holy Scripture in no other fashion. As in this case where God declares that Israel shall serve the Egyptians for four hundred years, and says to Abraham: \"Know thou that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not theirs, and they shall bring them under bondage and afflict them four hundred years.\"[fn-74-P7422_2723383:43-nf] Whereas if you take into account the whole time after that God spoke, they are more than four hundred: but if you only reckon the time in which they were in slavery, they are less. And in giving this period indeed, unless you understand it in this way, we must think that the Word of God lied (and away with such a thought from Christian minds!). But since from the time of the Divine utterance, the whole period of their lives amounted to more than four hundred years, and their bondage endured for not nearly four hundred, you must understand that the part is to be taken for the whole, or the whole for the part. There is also a similar way of representing days and nights, where, when in the case of either division of time one day is meant, either period is shown by a portion of a single period. And indeed in this way the difficulty about the time of ourLord's Passion is cleared up: for whereas the Lord prophesied that after the model of the prophet Jonah, the Son of man would be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth,[fn-74-P7423_2724451:44-nf] and whereas after the sixth day of the week on which He was crucified, He was only in hell[fn-74-P7424_2724561:45-nf] for one day and two nights, how can we show the truth of the Divine words? Surely by the trope of Synecdoche, i.e., because to the day on which He was crucified the previous night belongs, and to the night on which He rose again, the coming day; and so when there is added the night which preceded the day belonging to it, and the day which followed the night belonging to it, we see thatthere is nothing lacking to the whole period of time, which is made up of its portions. Theholy Scriptures abound in such instances of ways of speaking: but it would take too longto relate them all. For so when the Psalm says, \"What is a man that Thou art mindfulof Him,\"[fn-74-P7425_2725239:46-nf] from the hart we understand thewhole, as while only one man is mentioned the whole human race is meant. So also where Ahab sinned we are told that the people sinned. Where - though all are mentioned, a part is to be understood from the whole. John also the Lord's forerunner says: \"After me cometh a man who is preferred before me for He was before me.\"[fn-74-P7426_2725613:47-nf] How then does He mean that He would come after Him, whom He shows to be before Him? For if this is understood of a man who was afterwards born, how was he before him? But if it is taken of the Word how is it, \"a man cometh after me?\" Except that in the one Lord Jesus Christ is shown both the posteriority of the manhood and the precedence of the Godhead. And so the result is that one and the same Lord was before him and came after him: for according to the flesh He was posterior in time to John; and according to His Deity was before all men. And so he, when he named that man, denoted both the manhood and the Word, for as the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God was complete in both manhood and Divinity[fn-74-P7427_2726332:48-nf] in mentioning one of these natures in Him hedenoted the whole person. And what need is there of anything further? I think that the day would fail me if I were to try to collect or to tell everything that could be said on this subject. And what we have already said is enough, at any rate on this part of the subject, both for the exposition of the Creed, and for the requirements of our case, and for the limits of our book.","title":"Book VI.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_75_sermon_lviii_cviii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1.

If thenwe can show that all that which you\nrefer to the Spirit, is His own, what remains but that we prove that He whom you therefore would have\ntaken to be a man, because as you say everything which He has is another's, is therefore God, because\neverything which He has is His own? And indeed we will prove this not only by discussion and\nargument, but by the voice of Divinity Itself: for nothing testifies of God better than things\ndivine. And because nothing knows itself better than the very glory of God, we believe nothing on the\nsubject of God with greater right than those writings in which God Himself is His own witness. First\nthen, as to this that you say that the Holy Spirit created His humanity; we might take it simply, if\nwe could acknowledge that you had not brought it forward in the interests of unbelief. For neither do\nwe deny that the flesh of the Lord was conceived by the Holy Ghost: but we assert that the body was\nconceived by the co-operation of the Holy Ghost in such a way that we can say that His\nHumanity[fn-75-P7542_2774807:43-nf] was created for Himself by the\nSon of God, as the Holy Spirit Itself says in holy Scripture, testifying that \"Wisdom hath builded\nfor Itself a house.\"[fn-75-P7543_2774977:44-nf] You see then that\nthat which was conceived by the Holy Ghost was built and perfected by the Son of God: not that the\nwork of the Son of God is one thing, and the work of the Holy Ghost another: but that through the\nunity of the Godhead and glory the operation of the Spirit is the building of the Son of God; and the\nbuilding of the Son of God is the co-operation of the Holy Ghost. And so we read not only that the\nHoly Ghost came upon the Virgin, but also that the power of the Most High overshadowed the Virgin;\nthat since Wisdom Itself is the fulness of the Godhead, no one might doubt that when Wisdom built\nItself a house all the fulness of the Godhead was present. But the wretched hardness of your\nblasphemy, while it tries to sever Christ from the Son of God, fails to see that it is entirely\nsevering the nature of the Godhead from Itself. Unless perhaps you believe that the house is\ntherefore built for Him by the Holy Ghost because He Himself was insufficient and incapable of\nbuilding for Himself an house. But it is as absurd as it is wild, to believe that He, whom we believe\nto have created the whole universe of things heavenly and earthly by His will, was unable to build\nfor Himself a body: especially as the power of the Holy Ghost is His power, and the Divinity and\nGlory of the Trinity are so united and inseparable, that we cannot think of anything at all in One\nPerson of the Trinity, which can be separated from the fulness of the Godhead. Therefore when this is\nlaid down and grasped; viz., that according to the faith of holy Scripture, when the Holy Ghost came\nupon (the Virgin) and the power of the Most High overshadowed her, Wisdom builded Itself an house;\nthe rest of the slanders of your blasphemy come to nothing. For neither is it doubtful that He made\nall things by Himself and in Himself, in whose name and faith, the faith even of believers can do\nanything. For neither did He need the aid of another, as neither have they needed it, who have\ntrusted in His power. And so as for your assertions that He was justified by the Spirit, and that the\nSpirit made Him to be feared by the devils, and that His flesh became the temple of the Holy Ghost,\nand that He was taken up by the Spirit into heaven, they are all blasphemous and wild: not because we\nare to believe that in all these things which He Himself did, the unity and cooperation of the Spirit\nwas wanting - since the Godhead is never wanting to Itself, and the [power of the Trinity was ever\npresent in the Saviour's works - but because you will have it that the Holy Ghost gave assistance to\nthe Lord Jesus Christ as if He had been feeble and powerless; and that He granted those things to\nHim, which He was unable to procure for Himself.

But the others, after being deposed again and again, and once more at Ariminum itself, ventured to write that it ought not to be said that the Son had Essence or Subsistence. This enables us to see, brethren, that they of Nicaea breathe the spirit of Scripture, in that God says in Exodus[fn-78-P7848_3145099:12-nf] , `I am that I am,' and through Jeremiah, `Who is in His substance[fn-78-P7849_3145184:13-nf] and hath seen His word;' and just below, `if they had stood in My subsistence[fn-78-P7850_3145300:14-nf] and heard My words:' now subsistence is essence, and means nothing else but very being, which Jeremiah calls existence, in the words, `and they heard not the voice of existence[fn-78-P7851_3145500:15-nf] .'

Thus, for instance, those who were with Cleopas[fn-89-P8951_3276939:31-nf] , although infirm at first from lack of knowledge, yet afterwards were inflamed with the words of the Saviour, and brought forth the fruits of the knowledge of Him.

But not such were those nine lepers who were cleansed from their leprosy, and yet were unthankful to the Lord who healed them; nor Judas, who obtained the lot of an apostle, and was named a disciple of the Lord, but at last, `while eating bread with the Saviour, lifted up his heel against Him, and became a traitor[fn-89-P8952_3277589:32-nf] .'

For from John's Gospel we have understood our Lord Jesus Christ according to His Divinity for the creating of the whole creation, and according to His Humanity for the recovery of the creature fallen. Now in this same Gospel we find what sort and how great a man was John, that from the dignity of the dispenser it may be understood of how great a price is the Word which could be announced by such a man; yea, rather how without price is That which surpasseth all things. For any purchasable thing is either equal to the price, or it is below it, or it exceeds it. When any one procures a thing for as much as it is worth, the price is equal to the thing which is procured; when for less, it is below it; when for more, it exceeds it. But to the Word of God nothing can either be equalled, or to exchange can anything be below It, or above It. For all things can be below the Word of God, for that \"all things were made by Him;\"[fn-57-P5744_2426577:1-nf] yet are they not in such wise below, as if they were the price of the Word, that any one should give something to receive That.

Accordingly when we bay anything we look out for something to give, that for the price we give we may have the thing we wish to buy. And that which we give is without us; and if it was with us before, what we give becomes without us, that that which we procure may be with us. Whatever price the purchaser may find it, it must needs be such as that he gives what he has, and receives what he has not; yet so that he from whom the price goes himself remains, and that for which he gives the price is added to him. But whoso would procure this Word, whoso would have it, let him not seek for anything without himself to give, let him give himself.

To reach to God in any measure by the mind, is a great blessedness; but to comprehend Him. is altogether impossible. God is an object for the mind, He is to be understood; a body is for the eyes, it is to be seen. But thinkest thou that thou comprehendest a body by the eye? Thou canst not at all. For whatever thou lookest at, thou dost not see the whole. If thou seest a man's face, thou dost not see his back at the thee thou seest the face; and when thou seest the back, thou dost not at that thee see the face. Thou dost not then so see, as to comprehend; but when thou seest another part which thou hadst not seen before, unless memory aid thee to remember that thou hast seen that from which thou dost withdraw, thou couldest never say that thou hadst comprehended anything even on the surface. Thou handiest what thou seest, turnest it about on this side and that, or thyself dost go round it to see the whole. In one view then thou canst not see the whole. And as long as thou turnest it about to see it, thou art but seeing the parts; and by putting together that thou hast seen the other parts, thou dost fancy that thou seest the whole. But this must not be understood as the sight of the eyes, but the activity of the memory. What then can be said, Brethren, of that Word? Lo, of the bodies which are before our eyes we say they cannot comprehend them by a glance; what eye of the heart then comprehendeth God? Enough that it reach to Him if the eye be pure.

For \"blessed are the clean in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-57-P5772_2454726:15-nf] But whilst the heart was not cleansed, what could be provided and granted more mercifully by Him, than that That Word of whom we have spoken so great and so many things, and yet have spoken nothing worthy of Him; that That Word, \"by whom all things were made,\" should become that which we are, that we might be able to attain to That which we are not? For we are not God; but with the mind or the interior eye of the heart we can see God. Our eyes dulled by sins, blinded, enfeebled by infirmity, desire to see; but we are in hope, not yet in possession. We are the children of God. This saith John, who says, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; \"[fn-57-P5773_2455436:16-nf] he who lay on the Lord's Breast, who drew in these secrets from the Bosom of His Heart; he says, \"Dearly beloved, we are the children of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.\"[fn-57-P5774_2455729:17-nf] This is promised us.","title":"Sermon LXVII.

Understand ye what I say.Lo, this light from heaven, which is called by the name of the sun, when it comes forth, itenlightens the earth, unfolds the day, develops forms, distinguishes colours. Great blessing itis, great gift of God to all mortal men; let Hisworks magnify Him. If the sun is so beauteous, what more beauteous than the sun's Maker? And yet look, Brethren; lo, he pours his rays through the whole earth; penetrates open places, the closed resist him; he sends his light through windows; can he also through a wall? To theWord of God all is open, from the Word of God nothing is hid. Observe another difference, how far from the Creator is the creature, especiallythe bodily creature. When the sun is in the East, it is not in the West. Its light indeed shed from that vast body reaches even to the West; but itself is not there. When it begins to set, then it will be there. When it rises, it is in the East; when it sets it is in the West By these operations of his, it has given name to those quarters. Because it is in the East when it rises at the East, it has made it be called the Rising Sun; because it is at the West when it sets at the West, it has made it be called the Setting Sun. At night it is nowhere seen. Is the Word of God so? When It is in the East, is It not in the West; or when It is in the West, is It not in the East? or does It ever leave the earth, and go under or behind the earth? It is Whole everywhere.

For God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.\"[fn-58-P5852_2483857:12-nf] For God is able of these stones which he saw in the Spirit; to them he spake; he foresaw us; \"For God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.\" Of what stones? \"If these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.\" Ye have just now heard, and cried out. It is fulfilled, \"The stones shall cry out.\" For from among the Gentiles we came, in our forefathers we worshipped stones. Therefore are we called dogs too. Call to mind what that woman heard who cried out after the Lord, for she was a Canaanitish woman, a worshipper of idols, the handmaid of devils. What said Jesus to her? \"It is not good to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.\"[fn-58-P5853_2484552:13-nf] Have ye never noticed, how dogs will lick the greasy stones? So are all the worshippers of images.

And, further, the blessed Evangelists-who recorded the words of the Lord-in the beginning of the Gospels, wrote the things concerning our Saviour; so that, having first made known the Lord, the Creator, they might be believed when narrating the events that took place. For how could they have been believed, when writing respecting him who [was blind] from his mother's womb, and those other blind men who recovered their sight, and those who rose from the dead, and the changing of water into wine, and those lepers who were cleansed; if they bad not taught of Him as the Creator, writing, `In the beginning was the Word[fn-93-P9320_3381759:21-nf] ?' Or, according to Matthew, that He Who was born of the seed of David, was Emmanuel, and the Son of the living God? He from Whom the Jews, with the Arians, turn away their faces, but Whom we acknowledge and worship. The Apostle therefore, as was meet, sent to different people, but his own son he especially reminded, `that he should not despise the things in which he had been instructed by him,' and enjoined on him, `Remember Jesus Christ, who rose from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Gospel[fn-93-P9321_3382288:22-nf] .' And speaking of these things being delivered to him, to be always had in remembrance, he immediately writes to him. saying, `Meditate on these things: be engaged in them[fn-93-P9322_3382496:23-nf] ' For constant meditation, and the remembrance of divine words, strengthens piety towards God, and produces a love to Him inseparable and not merely formal[fn-93-P9323_3382672:24-nf] ; as he, being of this mind, speaks about himself and others like-minded, saying boldly, `Who shall separate us from the love of God[fn-93-P9324_3383110:25-nf] ?'

In Him the careless take no delight; and having no continuous purpose of good, they are sullied by temporal attacks, and esteem nothing more highly than present things, being unstable and deserving reproof as regards the faith. For `either the care of this world, or the deceitfulness of riches, chokes them[fn-93-P9328_3383986:29-nf] ;' or, as Jesus said in that parable which had reference to them, since they have not established the faith that has been preached to them, but continue only for a time, immediately, in time of persecution, or when affliction ariseth through the word, they are offended. Now those who meditate evil we say, [think] not truth, but falsehood and not righteousness, but iniquity, for their tongue learns to speak lies. They have done evil, and have not ceased that they might repent. For, persevering with delight in wicked actions, they hasten thereto without turning back, even treading under foot the commandment with regard to neighbours, and, instead of loving them, devise evil against them, as the saint testifies, saying, `And those who seek me evil have spoken vanity, and imagined deceit all the day[fn-93-P9329_3384814:30-nf] .' But that the cause of such meditation is none other than the want of instruction, the divine proverb has already declared; `The son that forsaketh the commandment of his father meditateth evil words[fn-93-P9330_3385038:31-nf] .' But such meditation, because it is evil, the Holy Spirit blames in these words, and reproves too in other terms, saying, `Your hands are polluted with blood, your fingers with sins; your lips have spoken lawlessness, and your tongue imagineth iniquity: no man speaketh right things, nor is there true judgment[fn-93-P9331_3385376:32-nf] .' But what the end is of such perverse imagining, He immediately declares, saying, `They trust in vanities and speak falsehood; for they conceive mischief, and bring forth lawlessness. They have hatched the eggs of an asp, and woven a spider's web; and he who is prepared to eat of their eggs, when he breaks them finds gall, and a basilisk therein[fn-93-P9332_3385755:33-nf] .' Again, what the hope of such is, He has already announced. `Because righteousness does not overtake them, when they waited for light, they had darkness; when they waited for brightness, they walked in a thick cloud. They shall grope for the wall like the blind, and as those who have no eyes shall they grope; they shall fall at noon-day as at midnight; when dead, they shall groan. They shall roar together as a bear, or as a dove[fn-93-P9333_3386210:34-nf] .'","title":"Letter XI.

I am speaking briefly. That water was the Jewish people; the five porches were the Law. For Moses wrote five books. Therefore was the water enclosed by five porches as that people was held in by the Law. The troubling of the water is the Lord's Passion among that people. He who descended was healed, and only one; for this is unity. Whosoever are offended at the Passion of Christ are proud; they will not descend, they are not healed. And, say they, \"Am I to believe that God was Incarnate, that God was born of a woman, that God was crucified, scourged, dead, wounded, buried?\" Be it far from me to believe this of God, it is unworthy of Him. Let the heart speak, not the neck. To the proud the humiliation of the Lord seems unworthy of Him, therefore is saving health from such far off. Lift not thyself up; if thou wouldest be made whole, descend. Well might piety be alarmed, if Christ in the flesh subject to change were only spoken of.

Then He added, \"And hath given Him power to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man.\" This Son of God, is Son of Man. For if the Son of God had continued the Son of God, and had not been made the Son of Man, He would not have delivered the sons of men. He who had made man, was Himself made that which He made, that what He made might not perish. But He was in such wise made the Son of Man, as to continue the Son of God.

That which is the less, took He from us; That which is the more, gave He to us. For thus He died in that He is the Son of Man, not in that He is the Son of God.

In His human humiliation He was \"made of a woman, made under the Law[fn-30-P3020_719378:8-nf] :\" in His Divine majesty He abides the Word of God, \"through whom all things were made[fn-30-P3021_719480:9-nf] .\"[fn-30-P3022_719501:10-nf] Accordingly, He Who in the form of God made man, in the form of a slave was made man.

And so the mystery of power united to weakness, in respect of the same human nature, allows the Son to be called inferior to the Father: but the Godhead, which is One in the Trinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, excludes all notion of inequality. For the eternity of the Trinity has nothing temporal, nothing dissimilar in nature: Its will is one, Its substance identical, Its power equal, and yet there are not three Gods, but one God[fn-30-P3024_720389:12-nf] ; because it is a true and inseparable unity, where there can be no diversity[fn-30-P3025_720745:13-nf] .

And by \"ours\" we mean what the Creator formed in us from the beginning, and what He undertook to repair. For what the deceiver brought in, and man deceived committed, had no trace in the Saviour; nor because He partook of man's weaknesses, did He therefore share our faults. He took the form of a slave without stain of sin, increasing the human and not diminishing the divine: for that \"emptying of Himself,\" whereby the Invisible made Himself visible, was the bending down of pity, not the failing of power.","title":"Sermon XXIII.

But if it is Reason-that is, Logos[fn-27-P2764_827137:12-nf] -by which it appears that all things were made, they change the name without purpose, when they make statements concerning the reason of the Creator.

My brethren, I indeed am a disciple of Christ, and, moreover, an apostle of Jesus; and it is owing to the exceeding kindness of Marcellus that I have hastened hither, with the view of showing him clearly in what manner he ought to keep the system of divine religion, so that the said Marcellus verily, who at present has put himself, like one who has surrendered himself prisoner, under the doctrine of Archclaus, may not, like the dumb animals, which are destitute of intellect and understand not what they do, be fatally smitten to the ruin of his soul, in consequence of any failure in the possession of further facilities for setting about the right observance of divine worship. I know, furthermore, and am certain, that if Marcellus is once set right,[fn-33-P3347_874919:97-nf] it will be quite possible that all of you may also have your salvation effected; for your city hangs suspended upon his judgment. If vain presumption is rejected by every one of you, and if those things which are to be declared by me be heard with a real love for the truth, ye will receive the inheritance of the age to come, and the kingdom of heaven. I, in sooth, am the Paraclete, whose mission was announced of old time by Jesus, and who was to come to \"convince the world of sin and unrighteousness.\"[fn-33-P3348_875483:98-nf] And even as Paul, who was sent before me, said of himself, that \"he knew in part, and prophesied in part,\"[fn-33-P3349_875929:99-nf] so I reserve the perfect for myself, in order that I may do away with that which is in part. Therefore receive ye this third testimony, that I am an elect apostle of Christ; and if ye choose to accept my words, ye will find salvation; but if ye refuse them, eternal fire will have you to consume you. For as Hymenaeus and Alexander were\" delivered unto Satan, that they might learn not to blaspheme,\"[fn-33-P3350_876352:100-nf] so will all ye also be delivered unto the prince of punishments, because ye have done injury to the Father of Christ, in so far as ye declare Him to be the cause of all evils, and the founder of unrighteousness, and the creator of all iniquity. By such doctrine ye do, indeed, bring forth from the same fountain both sweet water and bitter,-a thing which can in no possible way be either done or apprehended. For who ought to be believed? Should it be those masters of yours whose enjoyment is in the flesh, and who pamper themselves with the richest delights; or our Saviour Jesus Christ, who says, as it is written in the book of the Gospels, \"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit,\"[fn-33-P3351_877114:101-nf] and who in another place assures us that the \"father of the devil[fn-33-P3352_877202:102-nf] is a liar and a murderer from the beginning,\"[fn-33-P3353_877271:103-nf] and tells us again that men's desire was for the darkness,[fn-33-P3354_877352:104-nf] so that they would not follow that Word that had been sent forth in the beginning from the light,[fn-33-P3355_877491:105-nf] and (once more shows us) the man who is the enemy of the same, the sower of tares,[fn-33-P3356_877871:106-nf] and the god and prince of the age of this world, who blinds the minds of men that they may not be obedient to the truth in the Gospel of Christ?[fn-33-P3357_878039:107-nf] Is that God good who has no wish that the men who are his own should be saved? And, not to go over a multitude of other matters, and waste much time, I may defer[fn-33-P3358_878235:108-nf] till another opportunity the exposition of the true doctrine; and taking it for granted that I have said enough on this subject for the present, I may revert to the matter immediately before me, and endeavour satisfactorily to demonstrate the absurdity of these men's teaching, and show that none of these things can be attributed to the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour, but that we must take Satan to be the cause of all our ills. To him, certainly, these must be carried back, for all ills of this kind are generated by him. But those things also which are written in the prophets and the law are none the less to be ascribed to him; for he it is who spake then in the prophets, introducing into their minds very many ignorant notions of God, as well as temptations and passions. They, too, set forth that devourer of blood and flesh; and to that Satan and to his prophets all these things properly pertain which he wished to transfer[fn-33-P3359_879243:109-nf] to the Father of Christ, prepared as he was to write a few things in the way of truth, that by means of these he might also gain credence for those other statements of his which are false. Hence it is well for us to receive nothing at all of all those things which have been written of old even down to John, and indeed to embrace only the kingdom of heaven, which has been preached in the Gospel since his days; for they verily but made a mockery of themselves, introducing as they did things ridiculous and ludicrous, keeping some small words given in obscure outline in the law, but not understanding that, if good things are mixed up with evil, the result is, that by the corruption of these evil things, even those others which are good are destroyed. And if, indeed, there is any one who may prove himself able to demonstrate that the law upholds the right, that law ought to be kept; but if we can show it to be evil, then it ought to be done away with and rejected, inasmuch as it contains the ministration of death, which was graven,[fn-33-P3360_880308:110-nf] which also covered and destroyed the glory on the countenance of Moses.[fn-33-P3361_880399:111-nf] It is a thing not without peril, therefore, for any one of you to teach the New Testament along with the law and the prophets, as if they were of one and the same origin; for the knowledge of our Saviour renews the one from day to day, while the other grows old and infirm, and passes almost into utter destruction.[fn-33-P3362_880737:112-nf] And this is a fact manifest to those who are capable of exercising discernment. For just as, when the branches of a tree become aged, or when the trunk ceases to bear fruit any more, they are cut down; and just as, when the members of the body suffer mortification, they are amputated, for the poison of the mortification diffuses itself from these members through the whole body, and unless some remedy be found for the disease by the skill of the physician, the whole body will be vitiated; so, too, if ye receive the law without understanding its origin, ye will ruin your souls, and lose your salvation. For \"the law and the prophets were until John; \"[fn-33-P3363_881420:113-nf] but since John the law of truth, the law of the promises, the law of heaven, the new law, is made known to the race of man. And, in sooth, as long as there was no one to exhibit to you this most true knowledge of our Lord Jesus, ye had not sin. Now, however, ye both see and hear, and yet ye desire to walk in ignorance,[fn-33-P3364_881762:114-nf] in order that ye may keep[fn-33-P3365_882007:115-nf] that law which has been destroyed and abandoned. And Paul, too, who is held to be the most approved apostle with us, expresses himself to the same effect in one of his epistles, when he says: \"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.\"[fn-33-P3366_882339:116-nf] And in saying this he pronounces on them as Gentiles, because they were under the elements of the world,[fn-33-P3367_882507:117-nf] before the fulness of faith came, believing then as they did in the law and the prophets.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":5,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"ANF-06","text":"24.

For Archelaus begs that due importance be attached, to the practice of interrogation in this discussion. Manes said: The God who is good, and who has nothing in common with evil, placed the firmament in the midst, in order to make it plain[fn-34-P3455_930845:194-nf] that the wicked one is an alien to Him. Archelaus said: How fearfully you belie the dignity of that name! You do indeed call Him God, but you do so in name only, and you make His deity resemble man's infirmities. At one time out of the non-existent, and at another time out of underlying matter, which indeed thus existed before Himself, you assert that He did build the structure, as builders among men are wont to do. Sometimes also you speak of Him as apprehensive, and sometimes as variable. It is, however, the part of God to do what is proper to God, and it is the part of man to do what is proper to man. If, then, God, as you say, has constructed a wall, this is a God who marks Himself out as apprehensive, and as possessed of no fortitude. For we know that it is always the case that those who are suspicious of the preparation of secret perils against them by strangers, and who are afraid of the plots of enemies, are accustomed to surround their cities with walls, by which procedure they at once secure themselves in their ignorance, and display their feeble capacity. But here, too, we have something which ought not to be passed over by us in silence, but rather brought prominently forward; so that even by the great abundance of our declarations on the subject our adversary's manifold craftiness may be brought to nought, with the help of the truth on our side. We may grant, then, that the structure of the wall has been made with the purpose of serving to distinguish between the two kingdoms; for without this one division[fn-34-P3456_932466:195-nf] it is impossible for either of them to have his own proper kingdom. But granting this, then it follows further that in the same manner it will also be impossible for the wicked one to pass without his own proper limits and invade the territories of the good King, inasmuch as the wall stands there as an obstacle, unless it should chance first to be cast down, for we have heard that such things have been done by enemies, and indeed with our own eyes we have quite recently seen an achievement of that nature successfully carried out.[fn-34-P3457_933113:196-nf] And when a king attacks a citadel surrounded by a strong wall, he uses first of all the ballista[fn-34-P3458_933451:197-nf] and projectiles; then he endeavours to cut through the gates with axes, and to demolish the walls by the battering-rams; and when he at last obtains an entrance, and gains possession of the place, he does whatever he listeth, whether it be his pleasure to carry off the citizens into captivity, or to make a complete destruction of the fortress and its contents, or whether, on the. other hand, it may be his will to grant indulgence to the captured stronghold on the humble suit of the conquered. What, then, does my opponent here say to this analogy? Did no adversary substantially-which is as much as to say, designedly-overthrow the muniment cast up between the two?[fn-34-P3459_934283:198-nf] For in his former statements he has avouched that the darkness passed without its own limits, and supervened upon the kingdom of the good God. Who, then, overthrew that munition before the one could thus? have crossed over to the other? For it was impossible for the evil one to find any entrance while the munition stood fast. Why are you silent? Why do you hesitate, Manichaeus? Yet, although you may hold back, I shall proceed with the task of my own accord. For if we suppose you to say that God destroyed it, then I have to ask what moved Him in this way to demolish the very thing which He had Himself previously constructed on account of the importunity of the wicked one, and for the purpose of preserving the separation between them? In what fit of passion, or under what sense of injury, did He thus set about contending against Himself? Or was it that He lusted after some of the possessions of the wicked one? But if none of these things formed the real cause that led God to destroy those very things which He had constructed a long time before with the view of estranging and separating the wicked one from Him, then it must needs be considered no matter of surprise if God should also have become delighted with his society;[fn-34-P3460_935895:199-nf] for, on your supposition, the munition which had been set up with the purpose of securing God against trouble from him, will appear to have been removed just because now he is to be regarded no more as an enemy, but as a friend. And, on the other hand, if you aver that the wall was destroyed by the wicked one, tell Us then how it can be possible for the works of the good God to be mastered by the wicked one. For if that is possible, then the evil nature will be proved to be stronger than God. Furthermore, how can that being, seeing that he is pure and total darkness, surprise the light and apprehend it, while the evangelist gives us the testimony that \"the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not? \"[fn-34-P3461_936779:200-nf] How is this blind one armed? How does the darkness fight against the kingdom of light? For even as the creatures of God[fn-34-P3462_936917:201-nf] here cannot take in the rays of the sun with uninjured eye,[fn-34-P3463_937044:202-nf] so neither can that being bear the clear vision of the kingdom of light, but he remains for ever a stranger to it, and an alien.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":12,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"36","folder":"ANF-06","text":"28. Manes said: [fn-35-P3501_957149:236-nf] You are caught in the charge you yourself bring forward. For you have been speaking now against yourself, and have not perceived that, in trying to cast reproaches in my teeth, you lay yourself under the greater fault. Tell me this now, I pray you: if, as you allege, those who have died from the time of Tiberius on to the days of Probus are to say to Jesus, \"Do not judge us if we have failed to do Thy works, for Thou didst not send the Paraclete to us, although Thou didst promise to send Him; \"[fn-35-P3502_958220:237-nf] will not those much more use such an address who have departed this life from the time of Moses on to the advent of Christ Himself? And will not those with still greater right express themselves in terms like these: \"Do not deliver us over to torments,[fn-35-P3503_958527:238-nf] seeing that we had no knowledge of Thee imparted to us? \"And will it only he those that have died thus far previously to His advent who may be seen making such a charge with right? Will not those also do the same who have passed away from Adam's time on to Christ's advent? For none of these either obtained any knowledge of the Paraclete, or received instruction in the doctrine of Jesus. But only this latest generation of men, which has run its course from Tiberius onward, as you make it out,[fn-35-P3504_959137:239-nf] is to be saved: for it is Christ Himself that \"has re-deemed them from the curse of the law; \"[fn-35-P3505_959273:240-nf] as Paul, too, has given these further testimonies, that \"the letter killeth, and quickeneth no man,\"[fn-35-P3506_959395:241-nf] and that \"the law is the ministration of death,\"[fn-35-P3507_959490:242-nf] and \"the strength of sin.\"[fn-35-P3508_959539:243-nf] Archelaus said: You err, not knowing the Scriptures, neither the power of God.[fn-35-P3509_959640:244-nf] For many have also perished after the period of Christ's advent on to this present period, and many are still perishing,-those, to wit, who have not chosen to devote themselves to works of righteousness; whereas only those who have received Him, and yet receive Him, \"have obtained power to become the sons of God.\"[fn-35-P3510_959979:245-nf] For the evangelist has not said all have obtained that power; neither, on the other hand, however, has he put any limit on the time. But this is his expression: \"As many as received Him.\" Moreover, from the creation of the world He has ever been with righteous men, and has never ceased to require their blood at the hands of the wicked, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias.[fn-35-P3511_960396:246-nf] And whence, then, did righteous Abel and all those succeeding worthies,[fn-35-P3512_960491:247-nf] who are enrolled among the righteous, derive their righteousness when as yet there was no law of Moses, and when as vet the prophets had not arisen and discharged the functions of prophecy? Were they not constituted righteous in virtue of their fulfilling the law, \"every one of them showing the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing them witness? \"[fn-35-P3513_960947:248-nf] For when a man \"who has not the law does naturally the things contained in the law, he, not having the law, is a law unto himself.\"[fn-35-P3514_961099:249-nf] And consider now the multitude of laws thus existing among the several righteous men who lived a life of uprightness, at one time discovering for themselves the law of God implanted in their hearts, at another learning of it from their parents, and yet again being instructed in it further by the ancients and the elders. But inasmuch as dull, few were able to rise by this medium[fn-35-P3515_961500:250-nf] to the height of righteousness, that is to say, by means of the traditions of parents, when as yet there was no law embodied in writing, God had compassion on the race of man. and was pleased to give through Moses a written law to men, since verily the equity of the natural law filled to be retained in all its perfection in their hearts. In consonance, therefore, with man's first creation, a written legislation was prepared which was given through Moses in behoof of the salvation of very many. For if we reckon that man is justified without the works of the law, and if Abraham was counted righteous, how much more shall those obtain righteousness who have fulfilled the law which contains the things that are expedient for men? And seeing that you have made mention only of three several scriptures, in terms of which the apostle has declared that \"the law is a ministration of death,\"[fn-35-P3516_962494:251-nf] and that \"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law,\"[fn-35-P3517_962577:252-nf] and that \"the law is the strength of sin,\"[fn-35-P3518_962641:253-nf] you may now advance others of like tenor, and bring forward any passages which may seem to you to be written against the law, to any extent you please.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"ANF-06","text":"32. Moreover, as to this word which is written in the Gospel, \"Ye are of your father the devil,\"[fn-35-P3558_979737:288-nf] and so forth, we say in brief that there is a devil working in us, whose aim it has been, in the strength of his own will, to make us like himself. For all the creatures that God made, He made very good; and He gave to every individual the sense of free-will, in accordance with which standard He also instituted the law of judgment. To sin is ours, and that we sin not is God's gift, as our will is constituted to choose either to sin or not to sin. And this you doubtless understand well enough yourself, Manes; for you know that, although you were to bring together all your disciples and admonish[fn-35-P3559_980360:289-nf] them not to commit any transgression or do any unrighteousness, every one of them might still pass by the law of judgment. And certainly whosoever will, may keep the commandments; and whosoever shall despise them, and turn aside to what is contrary to them, shall yet without doubt have to face this law of judgment. Hence also certain of the angels, refusing to submit themselves to the commandment of God, resisted His will; and one of them indeed fell like a flash of lightning[fn-35-P3560_980914:290-nf] upon the earth, while others,[fn-35-P3561_980963:291-nf] harassed by the dragon, sought their felicity in intercourse with the daughters of men,[fn-35-P3562_981523:292-nf] and thus brought on themselves the merited award of the punishment of eternal fire. And that angel who was cast down to earth, finding no further admittance into any of the regions of heaven, now flaunts about among men, deceiving them, and luring them to become transgressors like himself, and even to this day he is an adversary to the commandments of God. The example of his fall and ruin, however, will not be followed by all, inasmuch as to each is given liberty of will. For this reason also has he obtained the name of devil, because he has passed over from the heavenly places, and appeared on earth as the disparager of God's commandment.[fn-35-P3563_982581:293-nf] But because it was God who first gave the commandment, the Lord Jesus Himself said to the devil, \"Get thee behind me, Satan; \"[fn-35-P3564_982917:294-nf] and, without doubt, to go behind God is the sign of being His servant. And again He says, \"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.\"[fn-35-P3565_983098:295-nf] Wherefore, as certain men were inclined to yield obedience to his wishes, they were addressed in these terms by the Saviour: \"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts. of your father ye will do.\"[fn-35-P3566_983321:296-nf] And, in fine, when they are found to be actually doing his will, they are thus addressed: \"O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.\"[fn-35-P3567_983561:297-nf] From all this, then, you ought to see how weighty a matter it is for man to have freedom of will, However, let my antagonist here say whether there is a judgment for the godly and the ungodly, or not. Manes said: There is a judgment. Archelaus said: I think that what we[fn-35-P3568_983855:298-nf] have said concerning the devil contains no small measure of reason as well as of piety. For every creature, moreover, has its own order; and there is one order for the human race, and another for animals, and another for angels. Furthermore, there is but one only inconvertible substance, the divine substance, eternal and invisible, as is known to all, and as is also borne out by this scripture: \"No man hath seen God at any time, save the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father.\"[fn-35-P3569_984407:299-nf] All the other creatures, consequently, are of necessity visible,-such as heaven, earth, sea, men, angels, archangels. But if God has not been seen by any man at any time, what consubstantiality can there be between Him and those creatures? Hence we hold that all things whatsoever have, in their several positions, their own proper substances, according to their proper order. You, on the other band, allege that every living thing which moves is made of one,[fn-35-P3570_984886:300-nf] and you say that every object has received like substance from God, and that this substance is capable of sinning and of being brought under the judgment; and you are unwilling to accept the word which declares that the devil was an angel, and that he fell in transgression, and that he is not of the same substance with God. Logically, you ought to do away with any allowance of the doctrine of a judgment, and that would make it clear which of us is in error.[fn-35-P3571_985363:301-nf] If, indeed, the angel that has been created by God is incapable of falling in transgression, how can the soul, as a part of God, be capable of sinning? But, again, if yon say that there is a judgment for sinning souls, and if you hold also that these are of one substance with God; and if still, even although you maintain that they are of the divine nature, you affirm that, notwithstanding that fact, they do not keep[fn-35-P3572_986615:302-nf] the commandments of God, then, even on such grounds, my argument will pass very well,[fn-35-P3573_986938:303-nf] which avers that the devil fell first, on account of his failure to keep the commandments of God. He was not indeed of the substance of God. And he fell, not so much to do hurt to the race of man, as rather to be set at nought[fn-35-P3574_987229:304-nf] by the same. For He \"gave unto us power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the strength of the enemy.\"[fn-35-P3575_987482:305-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":16,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"56","folder":"ANF-06","text":"45. On receipt of this letter, Diodorus made himself master of its contents, and then entered the lists against Manes. This he did too with such spirit, that he was commended greatly by all for the careful and satisfactory demonstration which he gave of the fact that there is a mutual relationship between the two testaments, and also between the two laws.[fn-38-P3829_1075287:544-nf] Discovering also more arguments for himself he was able to bring forward many points of great pertinency and power against the man, and in defence of the truth. He also reasoned in a conclusive manner against his opponent on verbal grounds.[fn-38-P3830_1075555:545-nf] For example, he argued with him in the following manner:-Did you say that the testaments are two? Well, then, say either that there are two old testaments, or that there are two new testaments. For you assert that there are two unbegottens[fn-38-P3831_1075883:546-nf] belonging to the same time, or rather eternity: and if there are in this way two, there should be either two old testaments or two new testaments. If, however, you do not allow this, but affirm, on the contrary, that there is one old testament and that there is also another new restatement, that will only prove again that there is but one author for both; and the very sequence will show that the Old Testament belongs to Him to whom also the New Testament pertains. We may illustrate this by the case of a man who says to some other individual,[fn-38-P3832_1076449:547-nf] Lease me your old house. For by such a mode of address does he not pronounce the man to be alsothe owner of a new house? Or, on the other hand, if he says to him, Show me[fn-38-P3833_1076766:548-nf] your new house; does he not by that very word designate him also as the possessor of an old house? Then, again, this also is to be considered, that since there are two beings, having an unbegotten nature, it is also necessary from that to suppose each of them to have (what must be called) an old testament, and thus there will appear to be two old testaments; if indeed you affirm that both these beings are ancient, and both indeed without a beginning.[fn-38-P3834_1077237:549-nf] But I have not learned doctrine like that; neither do the Scriptures contain it. You, however, who allege that the law of Moses comes from the prince of evil, and not from the good God, tell me who those were who withstood Moses to the face-I mean Jamnes and Mambres?[fn-38-P3835_1077910:550-nf] For, every object that withstands, withstands not itself, but some other one, either better or worse; as Paul also gives us to understand when he writes in the following terms in his second Epistle to Timothy: \"As Jamnes and Mambres withstood Moses, so have these also resisted the truth: men of corrupt mind, reprobate concerning the faith. But they shall proceed no further: for their folly is manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.\"[fn-38-P3836_1078413:551-nf] Do you observe how he compares Jamnes and Mambres to men of corrupt mind, and reprobate concerning the faith.; while he likens Moses, on the other hand, to the truth? But the holy John, the greatest of the evangelists, also tells us of the giving and diffusing of grace for grace;[fn-38-P3837_1078719:552-nf] for he indicates, indeed, that we have received the law of Moses out of the fulness of Christ, and he means that for that one grace this other grace has been made perfect in us through Jesus Christ. It was also to show this to be the case that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself spake in these terms: \"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye hope. For had ye believed Moses, ye would indeed have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?[fn-38-P3838_1079333:553-nf] And besides all these words, there are still many other passages that might be adduced both from the Apostle Paul and from the Gospels, by which we are able to prove that the old law belongs to no other one than that Lord to whom also the new testament appertains, and which it would suit us very well to set forth, and to make use of in a satisfactory manner.[fn-38-P3839_1079716:554-nf] Now, however, the evening prevents us from doing so; for the day is drawing to its close, and it is right that we should now bring our disputation to an end. But an opportunity will be given you to-morrow to put questions to us on any points you are pleased to take up. And after these words they went their way.[fn-38-P3840_1080283:555-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":1,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"58","folder":"ANF-06","text":"47. Then Manes, after silence had been secured among all, thus began his address: Like others, Archelaus, you too smite me with the most injurious words, notwithstanding that my sentiments on the subject of God are correct, and that I hold also a proper conception of Christ; and yet the family of the apostles is rather of the character that bears all things and endures all things, even although a man may assail them with revilings and curses. If it is your intention to persecute me, I am prepared for it: and if you wish to involve me in punishment, I shall not shrink from it; yea, if you mean even to put me to death, I am not afraid: \"For we ought to fear Him only who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.\"[fn-38-P3849_1085852:562-nf] Archelaus said: Far be that from me! Not such is my intention. For what have you ever had to suffer at my hands, or at the hands of those who think with us, even when you were disparaging us and doing us injury, and when you were speaking in detraction of the traditions of our fathers, and when it was your aim to work the death of the souls of men that were well established in the truth, and that were kept with the most conscientious carefulness; for which, in truth, the whole wealth of the world would not sere as a sufficient compensation?[fn-38-P3850_1086419:563-nf] Nevertheless, what ground have you for assuming this position? What have you to show? Tell us this,-what signs of salvation have you to bring before us? For the bare bravado of words will not avail to satisfy the multitude here present, neither will it be enough to qualify them for recognising which of us holds the knowledge of the truth the more correctly. Wherefore, as you have got the opportunity of speaking first, tell us first to what particular head of the subject you wish us to direct the disputation. Manes said: If you do not offer a second time an unfair resistance to the positions which shall be stated with all due propriety by us, I shall speak with you; but if you mean to show yourself still in the character which on a former occasion I perceived you to take up, I shall address myself to Diodorus, and shall keep clear of your turbulence. Archelaus said: I have already expressed my opinion that we shall be simply abusing the occasion by the mere bandying of empty words. If any one on one side is formal to offer an unfair resistance, leave that to the decision of the judges. But now, tell us what you have got to advance. Manes said: If you do not mean a second time merely to gainsay the positions which are stated with all due correctness by me, I shall begin. Archelaus said: \"If not this,\" and \"if not that,\" are ways of speaking which mark out an ignorant man. You are ignorant, therefore, of what is in the future. But as to this particular thing which you do declare to be still future, to gainsay or not to gainsay is a matter in my own power. How, then, will that argument about the two trees stand, in which you place your trust as in a buckler of the most approved strength? For if I am of the contrary side, how do you require my obedience? And if, on the other hand, there is in me the disposition of obedience, how are you so greatly alarmed lest I should gainsay you? For you maintain that evil remains evil always, and that good remains good always, in utter ignorance of the force of your words. Manes said: Have I employed you as the advocate of my words, so that you may determine also the intelligence that may suit my knowledge? And how will you be able to explain what belongs to another person, when you cannot make what pertains to yourself clear? But if Diodorus now admits himself to be vanquished, my reasonings will then be addressed to you. If, however, he still stands out, and is prepared to speak, I beg you to give over and cease from interfering with the substantiating of the truth. For you are a strange sheep; nevertheless hereafter you will be introduced into the number of the same flock, as the voice of Jesus[fn-38-P3851_1089187:564-nf] also intimates,-that Jesus, namely, who appeared in the form of man indeed, and yet was not a man. Archelaus said: Are you not, then, of opinion that He was born of the Virgin Mary? Manes said: God forbid that I should admit that our Lord Jesus Christ came down to us through the natural womb of a woman! For He gives us His own testimony that He came down from the Father's bosom;[fn-38-P3852_1089673:565-nf] and again He says, \"He that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me; \"[fn-38-P3853_1089773:566-nf] and. \"I came not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me; \"[fn-38-P3854_1089867:567-nf] and once more, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"[fn-38-P3855_1089966:568-nf] And there are also innumerable other passages of a similar import, which point Him out as one that came, and not as one that was born. But if you are greater than He, and if you know better than He what is true, how do we yet believe Him? Archelaus said: Neither am I greater than He, for I am His servant nor can I be even the equal of my Lord, for I am His unprofitable servant; I am a disciple of His words, and I believe those things which have been spoken by Him, and I affirm that they are unchangeable. Manes said: A certain person somewhat like you once said to Him, \"Mary Thy mother, and Thy brethren, stand without; \"[fn-38-P3856_1090615:569-nf] and He took not the word kindly, but rebuked the person who had uttered it, saying, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? \"And He showed that those who did His will were both His mothers and His brethren. If you, however, mean to say that Mary was actually His mother, you place yourself in a position of considerable peril. For, without any doubt, it would be proved on the same principles that He had brethren also by her. Now tell me whether these brethren were begotten by Joseph or by the same Holy Spirit. For if you say that they were begotten by the same Holy Spirit, it will follow that we have had many Christs. And if you say that these were not begotten by the same Holy Spirit, and yet aver that He had brethren, then without doubt we shall be under the necessity of understanding that, in succession to the Spirit and after Gabriel, the most pure and spotless virgin[fn-38-P3857_1091524:570-nf] formed an actual marriage connection with Joseph. But if this is also a thing altogether absurd-I mean the supposition that she had any manner of intercourse with Joseph-tell me whether then He had brethren. Are you thus to fix the crime of adultery also on her, most sagacious Marcellus?[fn-38-P3858_1092182:571-nf] But if none of these suppositions suits the position of the Virgin undefiled, how will you make it out that He had brothers? And if you are unable to prove clearly to us that He had brethren, will it be any the easier for you to prove Mary to be His mother, in accordance with the saying of him who ventured to write,[fn-38-P3859_1092623:572-nf] \"Behold, Thy mother and Thy brethren stand without? \"Yet, although that man was bold enough to address Him thus, no one can be mightier or greater than this same person Himself who shows us His mother or His brethren. Nay, He does not deign even to hear it said that He is David's son.[fn-38-P3860_1092968:573-nf] The Apostle Peter, however, the most eminent of all the disciples, was able to acknowledge Him on that occasion, when all were putting forth the several opinions which they entertained respecting Him: for he said, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God; \"[fn-38-P3861_1093294:574-nf] and immediately He names him blessed, addressing him thus: \"For my heavenly Father hath revealed it unto thee.\" Observe what a difference there is between these two words which were spoken by Jesus. For to him who had said, \"Behold, Thy mother stands without,\" He replied, \"Who is my mother, or who are my brethren? \"But to him who said, \"Thou art the Christ the Son of the living, God,\" He makes the return of a beatitude and benediction.

But after the Lord's resurrection (which, of course, was of His true body, because He was raised the same as He had died and been buried), what else was effected by the forty days' delay than the cleansing of our faith's purity from all darkness? For to that end He talked with His disciples, and dwelt and ate with them, He allowed Himself to be handled with diligent and curious touch by those who were affected by doubt, He entered when the doors were shut upon the Apostles, and by His breathing upon them gave them the Holy Spirit[fn-11-P1128_268604:49-nf] , and bestowing on them the light of understanding, opened the secrets of the Holy Scriptures[fn-11-P1129_268719:50-nf] . So again He showed the wound in His side, the marks of the nails, and all the signs of His quite recent suffering, saying, \"See My hands and feet, that it is I. Handle Me and see that a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have[fn-11-P1130_268981:51-nf] ;\" in order that the properties of His Divine and human nature might be acknowledged to remain still inseparable: and that we might know the Word not to be different from the flesh, in such a sense as also to confess that the one Son of God iS both the Word and flesh[fn-11-P1131_269263:52-nf] . Of this mystery of the faith[fn-11-P1132_269391:53-nf] your opponent Eutyches must be reckoned to have but little sense if he bus recognized our nature in the Only-begotten of God neither through the humiliation of His having to die, nor through the glory of His rising again. Nor has he any fear of the blessed apostle and evangelist John's declaration when he says, \"every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ to have come in the flesh, is of God: and every spirit which destroys Jesus is not of God, and this is Antichrist[fn-11-P1133_269885:54-nf] .\" But what is \"to destroy Jesus,\" except to take away the human nature from Him, and to render void the mystery, by which alone we were saved, by the most barefaced fictions. The truth is that being in darkness about the nature of Christ's body, he must also be befooled by the same blindness in the matter of His sufferings. For if he does not think the cross of the Lord fictitious, and does not doubt that the punishment He underwent to save the world is likewise true, let him acknowledge the flesh of Him whose death he already believes: and let him not disbelieve Him man with a body like ours, since he acknowledges Him to have been able to suffer: seeing that the denial of His true flesh is also the denial of His bodily suffering. If therefore he receives the Christian faith, and does not turn away his ears from the preaching of the Gospel: let him see what was the nature that hung pierced with nails on the wooden cross, and, when the side of the Crucified was opened by the soldier's spear, let him understand whence it was that blood and water flowed, that the Church of God might be watered from the font and from the cup[fn-11-P1134_271585:55-nf] . Let him hear also the blessed Apostle Peter, proclaiming that the sanctification of the Spirit takes place through the sprinkling of Christ's blood[fn-11-P1135_271924:56-nf] . And let him not read cursorily the same Apostle's words when he says, \"Knowing that not with corruptible things, such as silver and gold, have ye been redeemed from your vain manner of life which is part of your fathers' tradition, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ as of a lamb without spot and blemish[fn-11-P1136_272279:57-nf] .\" Let him not resist too the witness of the blessed Apostle John, who says: \"and the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanseth us from all sin[fn-11-P1137_272439:58-nf] .\" And again: \"this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.\" And \"who is He that overcometh the world save He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God. This is He that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that testifieth, because the Spirit is the truth[fn-11-P1138_272797:59-nf] , because there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the water and the blood, and the three are one[fn-11-P1139_273124:60-nf] .\" The Spirit, that is, of sanctification, and the blood of redemption, and the water of baptism: because the three are one, and remain undivided, and none of them is separated from this connection; because the catholic Church lives and progresses by this faith, so that in Christ Jesus neither the manhood without the true Godhead nor the Godhead without the true manhood is believed in.","title":"Letter XXVIII.

We speak of angel as greater than angel, of man as juster than man, of bird as fleeter than bird. If then comparisons are made between things of the same species, and the Father by comparison is said to be greater than the Son, then the Son is of the same substance as the Father.

Certainly, the Creator of all natures, since \"through Him all things were made, and without Him was nothing made[fn-14-P1469_358247:5-nf] ,\" is above all things which He created, nor were the things which He made ever not subject to their Creator, Whose eternal property it is, to be from none other than the Father, and in no way different to the Father.

But everything he ventures to uphold is absolutely foolish: because neither our religious belief nor the scope of the mystery admits either of the Godhead suffering anything or of the Truth belying Itself in anything.

I have been specially moved to desire union with you by the report of the zeal of your reverences in the cause of orthodoxy. The constancy of your hearts has been stirred neither by multiplicity of books nor by variety of ingenious arguments. You have on the contrary, recognised those who endeavoured to introduce innovations in opposition to the apostolic doctrines, and you have refused to keep silence concerning the mischief which they are causing. I have in truth found great distress among all who cleave to the peace of the Lord at the divers innovations of Apollinarius of Laodicea. He has all the more distressed me from the fact that he seemed at the beginning on our side. A sufferer can in a certain sense endure what comes to him from an open enemy, even though it be exceedingly painful, as it is written, \"For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could bare borne it.\"[fn-59-P5953_1875408:2-nf] But it is intolerable, and beyond the power of comfort, to be wronged by a close and sympathetic friend. Now that very man whom I have expected to have at my right hand in defence of the truth, I have found in many ways hindering those who are being saved, by seducing their minds and drawing them away from direct doctrine. What rash and hasty deed has he not done? What ill considered and dangerous argument has he not risked? Is not all the Church divided against herself, specially since the day when men have been sent by him to the Churches governed by orthodox bishops, to rend them asunder and to set up some peculiar and illegal service? Is not ridicule brought upon the great mystery of true religion when bishops go about without people and clergy, having nothing but the mere name and title, and effecting nothing for the advancement of the Gospel of peace and salvation? Are not his discourses about God full of impious doctrines, the old impiety of the insane Sabellius being now renewed by him in his writings? For if the works which are current among the Sebastenes are not the forgery of foes, and are really his composition, he has reached a height of impiety which cannot be surpassed, in saying that Father, Son, and Spirit are the same, and other dark pieces of irreverence which I have declined even to hear, praying that I may have nothing to do with those who have uttered them. Does he not confuse the doctrine of the incarnation? Has not the oeconomy of salvation been made doubtful to the many on account of his dark and cloudy speculations about it? To collect them all, and refute them, requires long time and much discussion. But where have the promises of the Gospel been blunted and destroyed as by his figments? So meanly and poorly has he dared to explain the blessed hope laid up for all who live according to the Gospel of Christ, as to reduce it to mere old wives' fables and doctrines of Jews. He proclaims the renewal of the Temple, the observance of the worship of the Law, a typical high priest over again after the real High Priest, and a sacrifice for sins after the Lamb of God Who taketh away the sin of the world.[fn-59-P5954_1877583:3-nf] He preaches partial baptisms after the one baptism, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the Church which, through its faith in Christ, has not spot or wrinkle, or any such thing;[fn-59-P5955_1877778:4-nf] cleansing of leprosy after the painless state of the resurrection; an offering of jealousy[fn-59-P5956_1877884:5-nf] when they neither marry nor are given in marriage; shew-bread after the Bread from heaven; burning lamps after the true Light.

Now the proper way to direct our investigation seems to me to be as follows. We say that every good thing, which by God's providence befalls us, is an operation, of the Grace which worketh in us all things, as the apostle says, \"But all these worketh that one and the self same Spirit dividing to every man severally as he will.\"[fn-31-P3112_1012024:7-nf] If we ask, if the supply of good things which thus comes to the saints has its origin in the Holy Ghost alone, we are on the other hand guided by Scripture to the belief that of the supply of the good things which are wrought in us through the Holy Ghost, the Originator and Cause is the Only-begotten God;[fn-31-P3113_1012350:8-nf] for we are taught by Holy Scripture that \"All things were made by Him,\"[fn-31-P3114_1012794:9-nf] and \"by Him consist.\"[fn-31-P3115_1012831:10-nf] When we are exalted to this conception, again, led by God-inspired guidance, we are taught that by that power all things are brought from non-being into being, but yet not by that power to the exclusion of origination.[fn-31-P3116_1013067:11-nf] On the other hand there is a certain power subsisting without generation and without origination,[fn-31-P3117_1013181:12-nf] which is the cause of the cause of all things. For the Son, by whom are all things, and with whom the Holy Ghost is inseparably conceived of, is of the Father.[fn-31-P3118_1013385:13-nf] For it is not possible for any one to conceive of the Son if he be not previously enlightened by the Spirit. Since, then, the Holy Ghost, from Whom all the supply of good things for creation has its source, is attached to the Son, and with Him is inseparably apprehended, and has Its[fn-31-P3119_1013865:14-nf] being attached to the Father, as cause, from Whom also It proceeds; It has this note of Its peculiar hypostatic nature, that It is known after the Son[fn-31-P3120_1014044:15-nf] and together with the Son, and that It has Its subsistence of the Father. The Son, Who declares the Spirit proceeding from the Father through Himself and with Himself, shining forth alone and by only-begetting from the unbegotten light, so far as the peculiar notes are concerned, has nothing in common either with the Father or with the Holy Ghost. He alone is known by the stated signs. But God, Who is over all, alone haS, as one special mark of His own hypostasis, His being Father, and His deriving His hypostasis[fn-31-P3121_1015000:16-nf] from no cause; and through this mark He is peculiarly known. Wherefore in the communion of the substance we maintain that there is no mutual approach or intercommunion of those notes of indication perceived in the Trinity, whereby is set forth the proper peculiarity of the Persons delivered in the faith, each of these being distinctively apprehended by His own notes. Hence, in accordance with the stated signs of indication, discovery is made of the separation of the hypostases; while so far as relates to the infinite, the incomprehensible, the uncreate, the uncircumscribed, and similar attributes, there is no variableness in the life-giving nature; in that, I mean, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but in Them is seen a certain communion indissoluble and continuous. And by the same considerations, whereby a reflective student could perceive the greatness of any one of the (Persons) believed in in the Holy Trinity, he will proceed without variation. Beholding the glory in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, his mind all the while recognises no void interval wherein it may travel between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for there is nothing inserted between Them; nor beyond the divine nature is there anything so subsisting as to be able to divide that nature from itself by the interposition of any foreign matter. Neither is there any vacuum of interval, void of subsistence, which can make a break in the mutual harmony of the divine essence, and solve the continuity by the interjection of emptiness. He who perceives the Father, and perceives Him by Himself, has at the same time mental perception of the Son; and he who receives the Son does not divide Him from the Spirit, but, in consecution so far as order is concerned, in conjunction so far as nature is concerned, expresses the faith commingled in himself in the three together. He who makes mention of the Spirit alone, embraces also in this confession Him of whom He is the Spirit. And since the Spirit is Christ's and of God,[fn-31-P3122_1017013:17-nf] as says Paul, then just as he who lays hold on one end of the chain pulls the other to him, so he who \"draws the Spirit,\"[fn-31-P3123_1017169:18-nf] as says the prophet, by His means draws to him at the same time both the Son and the Father. And if any one verily receives the Son, he will hold Him on both sides, the Son drawing towards him on the one His own Father, and on the other His own Spirit. For He who eternally exists in the Father can never be cut off from the Father, nor can He who worketh all things by the Spirit ever be disjoined from His own Spirit. Likewise moreover he who receives the Father virtually receives at the same time both the Son and the Spirit; for it is in no wise possible to entertain the idea of severance or division, in such a way as that the Son should be thought of apart from the Father, or the Spirit be disjoined from the Son. But the communion and the distinction apprehended in Them are, in a certain sense, ineffable and inconceivable, the continuity of nature being never rent asunder by the distinction of the hypostases, nor the notes of proper distinction confounded in the community of essence. Marvel not then at my speaking of the name thing as being both conjoined and parted, and thinking as it were darkly in a riddle, of a certain[fn-31-P3124_1018478:19-nf] new and strange conjoined separation and separated conjunction.

For the Son, by whom are all things, and with whom the Holy Ghost is inseparably conceived of, is of the Father.[fn-31-P3118_1013385:13-nf] For it is not possible for any one to conceive of the Son if he be not previously enlightened by the Spirit. Since, then, the Holy Ghost, from Whom all the supply of good things for creation has its source, is attached to the Son, and with Him is inseparably apprehended, and has Its[fn-31-P3119_1013865:14-nf] being attached to the Father, as cause, from Whom also It proceeds; It has this note of Its peculiar hypostatic nature, that It is known after the Son[fn-31-P3120_1014044:15-nf] and together with the Son, and that It has Its subsistence of the Father. The Son, Who declares the Spirit proceeding from the Father through Himself and with Himself, shining forth alone and by only-begetting from the unbegotten light, so far as the peculiar notes are concerned, has nothing in common either with the Father or with the Holy Ghost. He alone is known by the stated signs. But God, Who is over all, alone haS, as one special mark of His own hypostasis, His being Father, and His deriving His hypostasis[fn-31-P3121_1015000:16-nf] from no cause; and through this mark He is peculiarly known. Wherefore in the communion of the substance we maintain that there is no mutual approach or intercommunion of those notes of indication perceived in the Trinity, whereby is set forth the proper peculiarity of the Persons delivered in the faith, each of these being distinctively apprehended by His own notes. Hence, in accordance with the stated signs of indication, discovery is made of the separation of the hypostases; while so far as relates to the infinite, the incomprehensible, the uncreate, the uncircumscribed, and similar attributes, there is no variableness in the life-giving nature; in that, I mean, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but in Them is seen a certain communion indissoluble and continuous. And by the same considerations, whereby a reflective student could perceive the greatness of any one of the (Persons) believed in in the Holy Trinity, he will proceed without variation. Beholding the glory in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, his mind all the while recognises no void interval wherein it may travel between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for there is nothing inserted between Them; nor beyond the divine nature is there anything so subsisting as to be able to divide that nature from itself by the interposition of any foreign matter. Neither is there any vacuum of interval, void of subsistence, which can make a break in the mutual harmony of the divine essence, and solve the continuity by the interjection of emptiness. He who perceives the Father, and perceives Him by Himself, has at the same time mental perception of the Son; and he who receives the Son does not divide Him from the Spirit, but, in consecution so far as order is concerned, in conjunction so far as nature is concerned, expresses the faith commingled in himself in the three together. He who makes mention of the Spirit alone, embraces also in this confession Him of whom He is the Spirit. And since the Spirit is Christ's and of God,[fn-31-P3122_1017013:17-nf] as says Paul, then just as he who lays hold on one end of the chain pulls the other to him, so he who \"draws the Spirit,\"[fn-31-P3123_1017169:18-nf] as says the prophet, by His means draws to him at the same time both the Son and the Father. And if any one verily receives the Son, he will hold Him on both sides, the Son drawing towards him on the one His own Father, and on the other His own Spirit. For He who eternally exists in the Father can never be cut off from the Father, nor can He who worketh all things by the Spirit ever be disjoined from His own Spirit. Likewise moreover he who receives the Father virtually receives at the same time both the Son and the Spirit; for it is in no wise possible to entertain the idea of severance or division, in such a way as that the Son should be thought of apart from the Father, or the Spirit be disjoined from the Son. But the communion and the distinction apprehended in Them are, in a certain sense, ineffable and inconceivable, the continuity of nature being never rent asunder by the distinction of the hypostases, nor the notes of proper distinction confounded in the community of essence. Marvel not then at my speaking of the name thing as being both conjoined and parted, and thinking as it were darkly in a riddle, of a certain[fn-31-P3124_1018478:19-nf] new and strange conjoined separation and separated conjunction. Indeed, even in objects perceptible to the senses, any one who approaches the subject in a candid and uncontentious spirit, may find similar conditions of things.","title":"Letter XXXVIII","author":"St. Basil"}]
