It was necessary, then, that the form of a servant should be taken away from their eyes, because, through gazing upon it, they thought that alone which they saw to be Christ. Hence also is that which is said, \"If ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I said, \"I go unto the Father; for my Father is greater than I:\"[fn-3-P301_103870:95-nf] that is, on that account it is necessary for me to go to the Father, because, whilst you see me thus, you hold me to be less than the Father through that which you see; and so, being taken up with the creature and the \"fashion\" which I have taken upon me, you do not perceive the equality which I have with the Father. Hence, too, is this: \"Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father.\"[fn-3-P302_104284:96-nf] For touch, as it were, puts a limit to their conception, and He therefore would not have the thought of the heart, directed towards Himself, to be so limited as that He should be held to be only that which He seemed to be. But the \"ascension to the Father\" meant, so to appear as He is equal to the Father, that the limit of the sight which sufficeth us might be attained there. Sometimes also it is said of the Son alone, that He himself sufficeth, and the whole reward of our love and longing is held forth as in the sight of Him. For so it is said, \"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.\"[fn-3-P303_105034:97-nf] Pray, because He has not here said, And I will show the Father also to him, has He therefore excluded the Father? On the contrary, because it is true, \"I and my Father are one,\" when the Father is manifested, the Son also, who is in Him, is manifested; and when the Son is manifested, the Father also, who is in Him, is manifested. As, therefore, when it is said, \"And I will manifest myself to him,\" it is understood that He manifests also the Father; so likewise in that which is said, \"When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father,\" it is understood that He does not take it away from Himself; since, when He shall bring believers to the contemplation of God, even the Father, doubtless He will bring them to the contemplation of Himself, who has said, \"And I will manifest myself to him.\" And so, consequently, when Judas had said to Him, \"Lord, how is it that Thou wilt manifest Thyself unto us, and not unto the world?\" Jesus answered and said to him, \"If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.\"[fn-3-P304_106162:98-nf] Behold, that He manifests not only Himself to him by whom He is loved, because He comes to him together with the Father, and abides with him.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_06_tractate_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2.

Spare yourself, I beseech you, spare Blaesilla, who now reigns with Christ; at least spare Eustochium, whose tender years and inexperience depend on you for guidance and instruction. Now does the devil rage and complain that he is set at naught, because he sees one of your children exalted in triumph. The victory which he failed to win over her that is gone he hopes to obtain over her who still remains. Too great affection towards one's children is disaffection towards God. Abraham gladly prepares to slay his only son, and do you complain if one child out of several has received her crown? I cannot say what I am going to say without a groan. When you were carried fainting out of the funeral procession, whispers such as these were audible in the crowd. \"Is not this what we have often said. She weeps for her daughter, killed with fasting. She wanted her to marry again, that she might have grandchildren. How long must we refrain from driving these detestable monks out of Rome? Why do we not stone them or hurl them into the Tiber? They have misled this unhappy lady; that she is not a nun from choice is clear. No heathen mother ever wept for her children as she does for Blaesilla.\" What sorrow, think you, must not Christ have endured when He listened to such words as these! And how triumphantly must Satan have exulted, eager as he is to snatch your soul! Luring you with the claims of a grief which seems natural and right, and always keeping before you the image of Blaesilla, his aim is to slay the mother of the victress, and then to fall upon her forsaken sister. I do not speak thus to terrify you. The Lord is my witness that I address you now as though I were standing at His judgment seat. Tears which have no meaning are an object of abhorrence. Yours are detestable tears, sacrilegious tears, unbelieving tears; for they know no limits, and bring you to the verge of death. You shriek and cry out as though on fire within, and do your best to put an end to yourself. But to you and others like you Jesus comes in His mercy and says: \"Why weepest thou? the damsel is not dead but sleepeth.\"[fn-12-P1261_275187:853-nf] The bystanders may laugh him to scorn; such unbelief is worthy of the Jews.

I must briefly mention the manner in which she avoided the foul cisterns of the heretics whom she regarded as no better than heathen. A certain cunning knave, in his own estimation both learned and clever, began without my knowledge to put to her such questions as these: What sin has an infant committed that it should be seized by the devil? Shall we be young or old when we rise again? If we die young and rise young, we shall after the resurrection require to have nurses. If however we die young and rise old, the dead will not rise again at all: they will be transformed into new beings. Will there be a distinction of sexes in the next world? Or will there be no such distinction? If the distinction continues, there will be wedlock and sexual intercourse and procreation of children. If however it does not continue, the bodies that rise again will not be the same. For, he argued, \"the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things,\"[fn-41-P4120_1108799:2971-nf] but the bodies that we shall have in heaven will be subtle and spiritual according to the words of the apostle: \"it is sown a natural body: it is raised a spiritual body.\"[fn-41-P4121_1108995:2972-nf] From all of which considerations he sought to prove that rational creatures have been for their faults and previous sins subjected to bodily conditions; and that according to the nature and guilt of their transgression they are born in this or that state of life. Some, he said, rejoice in sound bodies and wealthy and noble parents; others have for their portion diseased frames and poverty stricken homes; and by imprisonment in the present world and in bodies pay the penalty of their former sins. Paula listened and reported what she heard to me, at the same time pointing out the man. Thus upon me was laid the task of opposing this most noxious viper and deadly pest. It is of such that the Psalmist speaks when he writes: \"deliver not the soul of thy turtle dove unto the wild beast,\"[fn-41-P4122_1109816:2973-nf] and \"Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds;\"[fn-41-P4123_1109888:2974-nf] creatures who write iniquity and speak lies against the Lord and lift up their mouths against the Most High. As the fellow had tried to deceive Paula, I at her request went to him, and by asking him a few questions involved him in a dilemma. Do you believe, said I, that there will be a resurrection of the dead or do you disbelieve? He replied, I believe. I went on: Will the bodies that rise again be the same or different? He said, The same. Then I asked: What of their sex? Will that remain unaltered or will it be changed? At this question he became silent and swayed his head this way and that as a serpent does to avoid being struck. Accordingly I continued, As you have nothing to say I will answer for you and will draw the conclusion from your premises. If the woman shall not rise again as a woman nor the man as a man, there will be no resurrection of the dead. For the body is made up of sex and members. But if there shall be no sex and no members what will become of the resurrection of the body, which cannot exist without sex and members? And if there shall be no resurrection of the body, there can be no resurrection of the dead. But as to your objection taken from marriage, that, if the members shall remain the same, marriage must inevitably be allowed; it is disposed of by the Saviour's words: \"ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels.\"[fn-41-P4124_1111400:2975-nf] When it is said that they neither marry nor are given in marriage, the distinction of sex is shewn to persist. For no one says of things which have no capacity for marriage such as a stick or a stone that they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but this may well be said of those who while they can marry yet abstain from doing so by their own virtue and by the grace of Christ. But if you cavil at this and say, how shall we in that case be like the angels with whom there is neither male nor female, hear my answer in brief as follows. What the Lord promises to us is not the nature of angels but their mode of life and their bliss. And therefore John the Baptist is called an angel[fn-41-P4125_1112165:2976-nf] even before he is beheaded, and all God's holy men and virgins manifest in themselves even in this world the life of angels. When it is said \"ye shall be like the angels,\" likeness only is promised and not a change of nature.","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":20,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1118","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"24. And now do you in your turn answer me these questions. How do you explain the fact that Thomas felt the hands of the risen Lord and beheld His side pierced by the spear?[fn-41-P4127_1112589:2977-nf] And the fact that Peter saw the Lord standing on the shore[fn-41-P4128_1112670:2978-nf] and eating a piece of a roasted fish and a honeycomb.[fn-41-P4129_1112764:2979-nf] If He stood, He must certainly have had feet. If He pointed to His wounded side He must have also had chest and belly for to these the sides are attached and without them they cannot be.

Therefore those who patronize heretics or schismatics must answer us whether they have or have not the Holy Ghost. If they have, why are hands imposed on those who are baptized among them when they come to us, that they may receive the Holy Ghost, since He must surely have been received there, where if He was He could be given? But if heretics and schismatics baptized without have not the Holy Spirit, and therefore hands are imposed on them among us, that here may be received what there neither is nor can be given; it is plain, also, that remission of sins cannot be given by those who, it is certain, have not the Holy Spirit. And therefore, in order that, according to the divine arrangement and the evangelical truth, they may be able to obtain remission of sins, and to be sanctified, and to become temples of God, they must all absolutely be baptized with the baptism of the Church who come from adversaries and antichrists to the Church of Christ.","title":"Epistle LXXV.","author":"Cyprian"},{"chapter":20,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_12_book_i_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"ANF-04","text":"But we read \"that the flesh is weak; \"[fn-7-P751_182936:32-nf] and hence we soothe[fn-7-P752_182977:33-nf] ourselves in some cases.

For if any one will consider how great a thing it is for one, being a man, and compassed with flesh and blood, to be enabled to draw nigh to that blessed and pure nature, he will then clearly see what great honor the grace of the Spirit has vouchsafed to priests; since by their agency these rites are celebrated, and others nowise inferior to these both in respect of our dignity and our salvation. For they who inhabit the earth and make their abode there are entrusted with the administration of things which are in Heaven, and have received an authority which God has not given to angels or archangels. For it has not been said to them, \"Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven.\"[fn-3-P372_148312:8-nf] They who rule on earth have indeed authority to bind, but only the body: whereas this binding lays hold of the soul and penetrates the heavens; and what priests do here below God ratifies above, and the Master confirms the sentence of his servants. For indeed what is it but all manner of heavenly authority which He has given them when He says, \"Whose sins ye remit they are remitted, and whose sins ye retain they are retained?\"[fn-3-P373_148763:9-nf] What authority could be greater than this? \"The Father hath committed all judgment to the Son?\"[fn-3-P374_148875:10-nf] But I see it all put into the hands of these men by the Son. For they have been conducted to this dignity as if they were already translated to Heaven, and had transcended human nature, and were released from the passions to which we are liable. Moreover, if a king should bestow this honor upon any of his subjects, authorizing him to cast into prison whom he pleased and to release them again, he becomes an object of envy and respect to all men; but he who has received from God an authority as much greater as heaven is more precious than earth, and souls more precious than bodies, seems to some to have received so small an honor that they are actually able to imagine that one of those who have been entrusted with these things will despise the gift. Away with such madness! For transparent madness it is to despise so great a dignity, without which it is not possible to obtain either our own salvation, or the good things which have been promised to us. For if no one can enter into the kingdom of Heaven except he be regenerate through water and the Spirit, and he who does not eat the flesh of the Lord and drink His blood is excluded from eternal life, and if all these things are accomplished only by means of those holy hands, I mean the hands of the priest, how will any one, without these, be able to escape the fire of hell, or to win those crowns which are reserved for the victorious?","title":"Book III.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":20,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"6.

For it was in a mystery as regards our inner man, so as to signify the death of our soul, that those words were uttered, not only in the Psalm, but also on the cross: \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"[fn-8-P841_325461:25-nf] To which words the apostle agrees, saying, \"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin;\" since by the crucifixion of the tuner man are understood the pains of repentance, and a certain wholesome agony of self-control, by which death the death of ungodliness is destroyed, and in which death God has left us.

Again, the death of the flesh of our Lord contains a type of the death of our outer man, since it is by such suffering most of all that He exhorts His servants that they should not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul.[fn-8-P850_327429:34-nf] Wherefore the apostle says, \"That I may fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.\"[fn-8-P851_327559:35-nf] And the resurrection of the body of the Lord is found to contain a type of the resurrection of our outward man, because He says to His disciples, \"Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.\"[fn-8-P852_327802:36-nf] And one of the disciples also, handling His scars, exclaimed, \"My Lord and my God!\"[fn-8-P853_327907:37-nf] And whereas the entire integrity of that flesh was apparent, this was shown in that which He had said when exhorting His disciples: \"There shall not a hair of your head perish.\"[fn-8-P854_328104:38-nf] For how comes it that first is said, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;\"[fn-8-P855_328216:39-nf] and how comes it that before He ascends to the Father, He actually is touched by the disciples: unless because in the former the mystery of the inner man was intimated, in the latter a type was given of the outer man? Or can any one possibly be so without understanding, and so turned away from the truth, as to dare to saythat He was touched by men before He ascended, but by women when He had ascended? It was on account of this type, which went before in the Lord, of our future resurrection in the body, that the apostle says, \"Christ the first-fruits; afterward they that are Christ's.\"[fn-8-P856_328826:40-nf] For it was the resurrection of the body to which this place refers, on account of which he also says, \"Who has changed our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.\"[fn-8-P857_329035:41-nf] The one death therefore of our Saviour brought salvation to our double death, and His one resurrection wrought for us two resurrections; since His body in both cases, that is, both in His death and in His resurrection, wasministered to us by a kind of healing suitableness, both as a mystery of the inner man, and as a type of the outer.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"6.

Therefore on this double death of ours our Saviour bestowed His own single death; and to cause both our resurrections, He appointed beforehand and set forth in mystery and type His own one resurrection. For He was not a sinner or ungodly, that, as though dead in spirit, He should need to be renewed in the inner man, and to be recalled as it were to the life of righteousness by repentance; but being clothed in mortal flesh, and in that alone dying, in that alone rising again, in that alone did He answer to both for us; since in it was wrought a mystery as regards the inner man, and a type as regards the outer. For it was in a mystery as regards our inner man, so as to signify the death of our soul, that those words were uttered, not only in the Psalm, but also on the cross: \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\"[fn-8-P841_325461:25-nf] To which words the apostle agrees, saying, \"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin;\" since by the crucifixion of the tuner man are understood the pains of repentance, and a certain wholesome agony of self-control, by which death the death of ungodliness is destroyed, and in which death God has left us.

As, therefore, the Father begat, the Son is begotten; so the Father sent, the Son was sent. But in like manner as He who begat and He who was begotten, so both He who sent and He who was sent, are one, since the Father and the Son are one.[fn-9-P985_386032:111-nf] So also the Holy Spirit is one with them, since these three are one. For as to be born, in respect to the Son, means to be from the Father; so to be sent, in respect to the Son, means to be known to be from the Father. And as to be the gift of God in respect to the Holy Spirit, means to proceed from the Father; so to be sent, is to be known to proceed from the Father. Neither can we say that the Holy Spirit does not also proceed from the Son, for the same Spirit is not without reason said to be the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son.[fn-9-P986_386597:112-nf] Nor do I see what else He intended to signify, when He breathed on the face of the disciples, and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P987_386852:113-nf] For that bodily breathing, proceeding from the body with the feeling of bodily touching, was not the substance of the Holy Spirit, but a declaration by a fitting sign, that the Holy Spirit proceeds not only from the Father, but also from the Son. For the veriest of madmen would not say, that it was one Spirit which He gave when He breathed on them, and another which He sent after His ascension.[fn-9-P988_387270:114-nf] For the Spirit of God is one, the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, the Holy Spirit, who worketh all in all.[fn-9-P989_387403:115-nf] But that He was given twice was certainly a significant economy, which we will discuss in its place, as far as the Lord may grant. That then which the Lord says,-\"Whom I will send unto you from the Father,\"[fn-9-P990_387633:116-nf] -shows the Spirit to be both of the Father and of the Son; because, also, when He had said, \"Whom the Father will send,\" He added also, \"in my name.\"[fn-9-P991_387803:117-nf] Yet He did not say, Whom the Father will send from me, as He said, \"Whom Iwill send unto you from the Father,\"-showing, namely, that the Father is the beginning (principium) of the whole divinity, or if it is better so expressed, deity.[fn-9-P992_388061:118-nf] He, therefore, who proceeds from the Father and from the Son, is referred back to Him from whom the Son was born (natus). And that which the evangelist says, \"For the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified;\"[fn-9-P993_389484:119-nf] how is this to be understood, unless because the special giving or sending of the Holy Spirit after the glorification of Christ was to be such as it had never been before? For it was not previously none at all, but it had not been such as this. For if the Holy Spirit was not given before, wherewith were the prophets who spoke filled? Whereas the Scripture plainly says, and shows in many places, that they spake by the Holy Spirit. Whereas, also, it is said of John the Baptist, \"And he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.\" And his father Zacharias is found to have been filled with the Holy Ghost, so as to say such things of him. And Mary, too, was filled with the Holy Ghost, so as to foretell such things of the Lord, whom she was bearing in her womb.[fn-9-P994_390293:120-nf] And Simeon and Anna were filled with the Holy Spirit, so as to acknowledge the greatness of the little child Christ.[fn-9-P995_390437:121-nf] How, then, was \"the Spirit not yet given, since Jesus was not yet glorified,\" unless because that giving, or granting, or mission of the Holy Spirit was to have a certain speciality of its own in its very advent, such as never was before? For we read nowhere that men spoke in tongues which they did not know, through the Holy Spirit coming upon them; as happened then, when it was needful that His coming should be made plain by visible signs, in order to show that the whole world, and all nations constituted with different tongues, should believe in Christ through the gift of the Holy Spirit, to fulfill that which is sung in the Psalm, \"There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard; their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"[fn-9-P996_391256:122-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_11_book_v_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"12.

That the Father had no beginning, and is invisible, immortal, and impossible: but that the Son was begotten of the Father, God of God, Light of Light; and that no one comprehends his generation, as was before said, but the Father alone. That the Son himself, our Lord and God, took flesh or a body, that is to say human nature, according as the angel brought glad tidings: and as the whole Scriptures teaches, and especially the apostle who was the great teacher of the Gentiles, Christ assumed the human nature through which he suffered, from the Virgin Mary.

Innumerable instances of the same kind are to be found in the sacred books. But, to be brief, I will return to the last of the four classes of brethren, those, namely, who are brethren by affection, and these again fall into two divisions, those of the spiritual and those of the general relationship. I say spiritual because all of us Christians are called brethren, as in the verse,[fn-60-P6082_1813752:65-nf] \"Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.\" And in another psalm the Saviour says,[fn-60-P6083_1813895:66-nf] \"I will declare thy name unto my brethren.\" And elsewhere,[fn-60-P6084_1813973:67-nf] \"Go unto my brethren and say to them.\" I say also general, because we are all children of one Father, there is a like bond of brotherhood between us all.[fn-60-P6085_1814148:68-nf] \"Tell these who hate you,\" says the prophet, \"ye are our brethren.\" And the Apostle writing to the Corinthians:[fn-60-P6086_1814278:69-nf] \"If any man that is named brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one no, not to eat.\" I now ask to which class you consider the Lord's brethren in the Gospel must be assigned. They are brethren by nature, you say. But Scripture does not say so; it calls them neither sons of Mary, nor of Joseph. Shall we say they are brethren by race? But it is absurd to suppose that a few Jews were called His brethren when all Jews of the time might upon this principle have borne the title. Were they brethren by virtue of close intimacy and the union of heart and mind? If that were so, who were more truly His brethren than the apostles who received His private instruction and were called by Him His mother and His brethren? Again, if all men, as such, were His brethren, it would have been foolish to deliver a special message, \"Behold, thy brethren seek thee,\" for all men alike were entitled to the name. The only alternative is to adopt the previous explanation and understand them to be called brethren in virtue of the bond of kindred, not of love and sympathy, nor by prerogative of race, nor yet by nature. Just as Lot was called Abraham's brother, and Jacob Laban's, just as the daughters of Zelophehad received a lot among their brethren, just as Abraham himself had to wife Sarah his sister, for he says,[fn-60-P6087_1815679:70-nf] \"She is indeed my sister, on the father's side, not on the mother's,\" that is to say, she was the daughter of his brother, not of his sister. Otherwise, what are we to say of Abraham, a just man, taking to wife the daughter of his own father? Scripture, in relating the history of the men of early times, does not outrage our ears by speaking of the enormity in express terms, but prefers to leave it to be inferred by the reader: and God afterwards gives to the prohibition the sanction of the law, and threatens,[fn-60-P6088_1816213:71-nf] \"He who takes his sister, born of his father, or of his mother, and beholds her nakedness, hath commited abomination, he shall be utterly destroyed.

Coming to the Gospel he sets before us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his mother-in-law, and, with a shamelessness to which we have now grown accustomed, fails to understand that they, too, ought to have been reckoned among those who served the Law. For the Gospel had no being before the crucifixion of Christ-it was consecrated by His passion and by His blood. In accordance with this rule Peter and the other Apostles (I must give Jovinianus something now and then out of my abundance) had indeed wives, but those which they had taken before they knew the Gospel. But once they were received into the Apostolate, they forsook the offices of marriage. For when Peter, representing the Apostles, says to the Lord:[fn-63-P6320_1936460:161-nf] \"Lo we have left all and followed thee,\" the Lord answered him,[fn-63-P6321_1936546:162-nf] \"Verily I say unto you, there is no man that hath left house or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.\" But if, in order to show that all the Apostles had wives, he meets us with the words[fn-63-P6322_1936898:163-nf] \"Have we no right to lead about women or wives\" (for gunh in Greek has both meanings) \"even as the rest of the apostles, and Cephas, and the brethren of the Lord?\" let him add what is found in the Greek copies, \"Have we no right to lead about women that are sisters, or wives?\" This makes it clear that the writer referred to other holy women, who, in accordance with Jewish custom, ministered to their teachers of their substance, as we read was the practice with even our Lord himself. Where there is a previous reference to eating and drinking, and the outlay of money, and mention is afterwards made of women that are sisters, it is quite clear, as we have said, that we must understand, not wives, but those women who ministered of their substance. And we read the same account in the Old Testament of the Shunammite who was wont to welcome Elisha, and to put for him a table, and bread, and a candlestick, and the rest. At all events if we take gunaikaj to mean wives, not women, the addition of the word sisters destroys the effect of the word wives, and shews that they were related in spirit, not by wedlock. Nevertheless, with the exception of the Apostle Peter, it is not openly stated that the Apostles had wives; and since the statement is made of one while nothing is said about the rest, we must understand that those of whom Scripture gives no such description had no wives. Yet Jovinianus, who has arrayed against us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his wife's mother, should know, that John was the son of Zacharias and Elizabeth, that is, a virgin was the offspring of marriage, the Gospel of the law, chastity of matrimony; so that by a virgin prophet the virgin Lord might be both announced and baptized. But we might say concerning Peter, that he had a mother-in-law when he believed, and no longer had a wife, although in the[fn-63-P6323_1939524:164-nf] \"Sentences\" we read of both his wife and daughter. But for the present our argument must be based wholly on Scripture. He has made his appeal to the Apostles, because he thinks that they, who hold the chief authority in our moral system and are the typical Christian teachers, were not virgins. If, then, we allow that they were not virgins (and, with the exception of Peter, the point cannot be proved), yet I must tell him that it is to the Apostles that the words of Isaiah relate:[fn-63-P6324_1940049:165-nf] \"Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.\" So, then, they who were by birth Jews could not under the Gospel recover the virginity which they had lost in Judaism. And yet John, one of the disciples, who is related to have been the youngest of the Apostles, and who was a virgin when he embraced Christianity, remained a virgin, and on that account was more beloved by our Lord, and lay upon the breast of Jesus. And what Peter, who had had a wife, did not dare ask,[fn-63-P6325_1940620:166-nf] he requested John to ask. And after the resurrection, when Mary Magdalene told them that the Lord had risen,[fn-63-P6326_1940754:167-nf] they both ran to the sepulchre, but John outran Peter. And when they were fishing in the ship on the lake of Gennesaret, Jesus stood upon the shore, and the Apostles knew not who it was they saw;[fn-63-P6327_1940972:168-nf] the virgin alone recognized a virgin, and said to Peter, \"It is the Lord.\" Again, after hearing the prediction that he must be bound by another, and led whither he would not, and must suffer on the cross. Peter said, \"Lord what shall this man do?\" being unwilling to desert John, with whom he had always been united. Our Lord said to him, \"What is that to thee if I wish him so to be?\" Whence the saying went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die. Here we have a proof that virginity does not die, and that the defilement of marriage is not washed away by the blood of martyrdom, but virginity abides with Christ, and its sleep is not death but a passing to another state. If, however, Jovinianus should obstinately contend that John was not a virgin, (whereas we have maintained that his virginity was the cause of the special love our Lord bore to him), let him explain, if he was not a virgin, why it was that he was loved more than the other Apostles. But you say,[fn-63-P6328_1941990:169-nf] the Church was rounded upon Peter: although[fn-63-P6329_1942059:170-nf] elsewhere the same is attributed to all the Apostles, and they all receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the strength of the Church depends upon them all alike, yet one among the twelve is chosen so that when a head has been appointed, there may be no occasion for schism. But why was not John chosen, who was a virgin? Deference was paid to age, because Peter was the eider: one who was a youth, I may say almost a boy, could not be set over men of advanced age; and a good master who was bound to remove every occasion of strife among his disciples, and who had said to them,[fn-63-P6330_1942702:171-nf] \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,\" and,[fn-63-P6331_1942783:172-nf] \"He that is the greater among you, let him be the least of all,\" would not be thought to afford cause of envy against the youth whom he had loved. We maybe sure that John was then a boy because ecclesiastical history most clearly proves that he lived to the reign of Trajan, that is, he fell asleep in the sixty-eighth year after our Lord's passion, as I have briefly noted in my treatise on Illustrious Men.[fn-63-P6332_1943234:173-nf] Peter is an Apostle, and John is an Apostle-the one a married man, the other a virgin; but Peter is an Apostle only, John is both an Apostle and an Evangelist, and a prophet. An Apostle, because he wrote to the Churches as a master; an Evangelist, because he composed a Gospel, a thing which no other of the Apostles, excepting Matthew, did; a prophet, for he saw in the island of Patmos, to which he had been banished by the Emperor Domitian as a martyr for the Lord, an Apocalypse containing the boundless mysteries of the future Tertullian, more over, relates that he was sent to Rome, and that having been plunged into a jar of boiling oil he came out fresher and more active than when he went in. But his very Gospel is widely different from the rest. Matthew as though he were writing of a man begins thus: \"The book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham;\" Luke begins with the priesthood of Zacharias; Mark with a prophecy of the prophets Malachi and Isaiah. The first has the face of a man, on account of the genealogical table; the second, the face of a calf, on account of the priesthood; the third, the face of a lion, on account of the voice of one crying in the desert,[fn-63-P6333_1944501:174-nf] \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" But John like an eagle soars aloft, and reaches the Father Himself, and says,[fn-63-P6334_1944656:175-nf] \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God,\" and so on. The virgin writer expounded mysteries which the married could not, and to briefly sum up all and show how great was the privilege of John, or rather of virginity in John, the Virgin Mother[fn-63-P6335_1944999:176-nf] was entrusted by the Virgin Lord to the Virgin disciple.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":20,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"26.

Yet Jovinianus, who has arrayed against us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his wife's mother, should know, that John was the son of Zacharias and Elizabeth, that is, a virgin was the offspring of marriage, the Gospel of the law, chastity of matrimony; so that by a virgin prophet the virgin Lord might be both announced and baptized. But we might say concerning Peter, that he had a mother-in-law when he believed, and no longer had a wife, although in the[fn-63-P6323_1939524:164-nf] \"Sentences\" we read of both his wife and daughter. But for the present our argument must be based wholly on Scripture. He has made his appeal to the Apostles, because he thinks that they, who hold the chief authority in our moral system and are the typical Christian teachers, were not virgins. If, then, we allow that they were not virgins (and, with the exception of Peter, the point cannot be proved), yet I must tell him that it is to the Apostles that the words of Isaiah relate:[fn-63-P6324_1940049:165-nf] \"Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.\" So, then, they who were by birth Jews could not under the Gospel recover the virginity which they had lost in Judaism. And yet John, one of the disciples, who is related to have been the youngest of the Apostles, and who was a virgin when he embraced Christianity, remained a virgin, and on that account was more beloved by our Lord, and lay upon the breast of Jesus. And what Peter, who had had a wife, did not dare ask,[fn-63-P6325_1940620:166-nf] he requested John to ask. And after the resurrection, when Mary Magdalene told them that the Lord had risen,[fn-63-P6326_1940754:167-nf] they both ran to the sepulchre, but John outran Peter. And when they were fishing in the ship on the lake of Gennesaret, Jesus stood upon the shore, and the Apostles knew not who it was they saw;[fn-63-P6327_1940972:168-nf] the virgin alone recognized a virgin, and said to Peter, \"It is the Lord.\" Again, after hearing the prediction that he must be bound by another, and led whither he would not, and must suffer on the cross. Peter said, \"Lord what shall this man do?\" being unwilling to desert John, with whom he had always been united. Our Lord said to him, \"What is that to thee if I wish him so to be?\" Whence the saying went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die. Here we have a proof that virginity does not die, and that the defilement of marriage is not washed away by the blood of martyrdom, but virginity abides with Christ, and its sleep is not death but a passing to another state. If, however, Jovinianus should obstinately contend that John was not a virgin, (whereas we have maintained that his virginity was the cause of the special love our Lord bore to him), let him explain, if he was not a virgin, why it was that he was loved more than the other Apostles. But you say,[fn-63-P6328_1941990:169-nf] the Church was rounded upon Peter: although[fn-63-P6329_1942059:170-nf] elsewhere the same is attributed to all the Apostles, and they all receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the strength of the Church depends upon them all alike, yet one among the twelve is chosen so that when a head has been appointed, there may be no occasion for schism. But why was not John chosen, who was a virgin? Deference was paid to age, because Peter was the eider: one who was a youth, I may say almost a boy, could not be set over men of advanced age; and a good master who was bound to remove every occasion of strife among his disciples, and who had said to them,[fn-63-P6330_1942702:171-nf] \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,\" and,[fn-63-P6331_1942783:172-nf] \"He that is the greater among you, let him be the least of all,\" would not be thought to afford cause of envy against the youth whom he had loved. We maybe sure that John was then a boy because ecclesiastical history most clearly proves that he lived to the reign of Trajan, that is, he fell asleep in the sixty-eighth year after our Lord's passion, as I have briefly noted in my treatise on Illustrious Men.[fn-63-P6332_1943234:173-nf] Peter is an Apostle, and John is an Apostle-the one a married man, the other a virgin; but Peter is an Apostle only, John is both an Apostle and an Evangelist, and a prophet. An Apostle, because he wrote to the Churches as a master; an Evangelist, because he composed a Gospel, a thing which no other of the Apostles, excepting Matthew, did; a prophet, for he saw in the island of Patmos, to which he had been banished by the Emperor Domitian as a martyr for the Lord, an Apocalypse containing the boundless mysteries of the future Tertullian, more over, relates that he was sent to Rome, and that having been plunged into a jar of boiling oil he came out fresher and more active than when he went in. But his very Gospel is widely different from the rest. Matthew as though he were writing of a man begins thus: \"The book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham;\" Luke begins with the priesthood of Zacharias; Mark with a prophecy of the prophets Malachi and Isaiah. The first has the face of a man, on account of the genealogical table; the second, the face of a calf, on account of the priesthood; the third, the face of a lion, on account of the voice of one crying in the desert,[fn-63-P6333_1944501:174-nf] \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" But John like an eagle soars aloft, and reaches the Father Himself, and says,[fn-63-P6334_1944656:175-nf] \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God,\" and so on. The virgin writer expounded mysteries which the married could not, and to briefly sum up all and show how great was the privilege of John, or rather of virginity in John, the Virgin Mother[fn-63-P6335_1944999:176-nf] was entrusted by the Virgin Lord to the Virgin disciple.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":20,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"36.

I can indeed say: \"Our hinder parts which are banished from sight, and the lower portions of the abdomen, which perform the functions of nature, are the Creator's work.\" But inasmuch as the physical conformation of the organs of generation testifies to difference of sex, I shall briefly reply: Are we never then to forego lust, for fear that we may have members of this kind for nothing? Why then should a husband keep himself from his wife? Why should a widow persevere in chastity, if we were only born to live like beasts? Or what harm does it do me if another man lies with my wife? For as the teeth were made for chewing, and the food masticated passes into the stomach, and a man is not blamed for giving my wife bread: similarly if it was intended that the organs of generation should always be performing their office, when my vigour is spent let another take my place, and, if I may so speak, let my wife quench her burning lust where she can.

Your voice is rugged, your speech rough, your eyebrows more shaggy. To no purpose you have all these manly qualities, if you forego the embraces of women.

For proof of which question itself, the times likewise must be examined by us when the prophets announced that the Christ would come; that, if we succeed in recognising that He has come within the limits of those times, we may without doubt believe Him to be the very one whose future coming was ever the theme of prophetic song, upon whom we-the nations, to wit-were ever announced as destined to believe; and that, when it shall have been agreed that He is come, we may undoubtedly likewise believe that the new law has by Him been given, and not disavow the new testament in Him and through Him drawn up for us. For that Christ was to come we know that even the Jews do not attempt to disprove, inasmuch as it is to His advent that they are directing their hope. Nor need we inquire at more length concerning that matter, since in days bygone all the prophets have prophesied of it; as Isaiah: \"Thus saith the Lord God to my Christ (the) Lord,[fn-21-P2143_727145:93-nf] whose right hand I have holden, that the nations may hear Him: the powers of kings will I burst asunder; I will open before Him the gates, and the cities shall not be closed to Him.\" Which very thing we see fulfilled. For whose right hand does God the Father hold but Christ's, His Son?-whom all nations have heard, that is, whom all nations have believed,-whose preachers, withal, the apostles, are pointed to in the Psalms of David: \"Into the universal earth,\" says he, \"is gone out their sound, and unto the ends of the earth their words.\"[fn-21-P2144_727961:94-nf] For upon whom else have the universal nations believed, but upon the Christ who is already come? For whom have the nations believed,-Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and they who inhabit Mesopotamia, Armenia, Phrygia, Cappadocia, and they who dwell in Pontus, and Asia, and Pamphylia, tarriers in Egypt, and inhabiters of the region of Africa which is beyond Cyrene, Romans and sojourners, yes, and in Jerusalem Jews,[fn-21-P2145_728427:95-nf] and all other nations; as, for instance, by this time, the varied races of the Gµtulians, and manifold confines of the Moors, all the limits of the Spains, and the diverse nations of the Gauls, and the haunts of the Britons-inaccessible to the Romans, but subjugated to Christ, and of the Sarmatians, and Dacians, and Germans, and Scythians, and of many remote nations, and of provinces and islands many, to us unknown, and which we can scarce enumerate? In all which places the name of the Christ who is already come reigns, as of Him before whom the gates of all cities have been opened, and to whom none are closed, before whom iron bars have been crumbled, and brazen gates[fn-21-P2146_729148:96-nf] opened. Although there be withal a spiritual sense to be affixed to these expressions,-that the hearts of individuals, blockaded in various ways by the devil, are unbarred by the faith of Christ,-still they have been evidently fulfilled, inasmuch as in all these places dwells the \"people\" of the Name of Christ. For who could have reigned over all nations but Christ, God's Son, who was ever announced as destined to reign over all to eternity? For if Solomon \"reigned,\" why, it was within the confines of Judea merely: \"from Beersheba unto Dan\" the boundaries of his kingdom are marked.[fn-21-P2147_729806:97-nf] If, moreover, Darius \"reigned\" over the Babylonians and Parthians, he had not power over all nations; if Pharaoh, or whoever succeeded him in his hereditary kingdom, over the Egyptians, in that country merely did he possess his kingdom's dominion; if Nebuchadnezzar with his petty kings, \"from India unto Ethiopia\" he had his kingdom's boundaries;[fn-21-P2148_730567:98-nf] if Alexander the Macedonian he did not hold more than universal Asia, and other regions, after he had quite conquered them; if the Germans, to this day they are not suffered to cross their own limits; the Britons are shut within the circuit of their own ocean; the nations of the Moors, and the barbarism of the Gµtulians, are blockaded by the Romans, lest they exceed the confines of their own regions.

For God is \"jealous,\"[fn-13-P1321_360862:34-nf] and is One who is not contemptuously derided[fn-13-P1322_360996:35-nf] -derided, namely, by such as flatter His goodness-and who, albeit \"patient,\"[fn-13-P1323_361090:36-nf] yet threatens, through Isaiah, an end of (His) patience. \"I have held my peace; shall I withal always hold my peace and endure? I have been quiet as (a woman) in birth-throes; I will arise, and will make (them) to grow arid.\"[fn-13-P1324_361362:37-nf] For \"a fire shall proceed before His face, and shall utterly burn His enemies; \"[fn-13-P1325_361463:38-nf] striking down not the body only, but the souls too, into hell.[fn-13-P1326_361551:39-nf] Besides, the Lord Himself demonstrates the manner in which He threatens such as judge: \"For with what judgment ye judge, judgment shall be given on you.\"[fn-13-P1327_361745:40-nf] Thus He has not prohibited judging, but taught (how to do it). Whence the apostle withal judges, and that in a case of fornication,[fn-13-P1328_361909:41-nf] that \"such a man must be surrendered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh; \"[fn-13-P1329_362041:42-nf] chiding them likewise because \"brethren\" were not \"judged at the bar of the saints: \"[fn-13-P1330_362145:43-nf] for he goes on and says, \"To what (purpose is it) for me to judge those who are without? \"\"But you remit, in order that remission may be granted you by God.\" The sins which are (thus) cleansed are such as a man may have committed against his brother, not against God. We profess, in short, in our prayer, that we will grant remission to our debtors;[fn-13-P1331_362527:44-nf] but it is not becoming to distend further, on the ground of the authority of such Scriptures, the cable of contention with alternate pull into diverse directions; so that one (Scripture) may seem to draw tight, another to relax, the reins of discipline-in uncertainty, as it were,-and the latter to debase the remedial aid of repentance through lenity, the former to refuse it through austerity. Further: the authority of Scripture will stand within its own limits, without reciprocal opposition. The remedial aid of repentance is determined by its own conditions, without unlimited concession; and the causes of it themselves are anteriorly distinguished without confusion in the proposition. We agree that the causes of repentance are sins. These we divide into two issues: some will be remissible, some irremissible: in accordance wherewith it will be doubtful to no one that some deserve chastisement, some condemnation. Every sin is dischargeable either by pardon or else by penalty: by pardon as the result of chastisement, by penalty as the result of condemnation. Touching this difference, we have not only already premised certain antithetical passages of the Scriptures, on one hand retaining, on the other remitting, sins;[fn-13-P1332_363778:45-nf] but John, too, will teach us: \"If any knoweth his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, he shall request, and life shall be given to him; \"because he is not \"sinning unto death,\" this will be remissible. \"(There) is a sin unto death; not for this do I say that any is to request\"[fn-13-P1333_364088:46-nf] -this will be irremissible. So, where there is the efficacious power of \"making request,\" there likewise is that of remission: where there is no (efficacious power) of \"making request,\" there equally is none of remission either. According to this difference of sins, the condition of repentance also is discriminated. There will be a condition which may possibly obtain pardon,-in the case, namely, of a remissible sin: there will be a condition which can by no means obtain it,-in the case, namely, of an irremissible sin. And it remains to examine specially, with regard to the position of adultery and fornication, to which class of sins they ought to be assigned.","title":"VII.

For so withal the result teaches. In (Peter) himself the Church was reared; that is, through (Peter) himself; (Peter) himself essayed the key; you see what (key): \"Men of Israel, let what I say sink into your ears: Jesus the Nazarene, a man destined by God for you,\" and so forth.[fn-16-P1650_486512:281-nf] (Peter) himself, therefore, was the first to unbar, in Christ's baptism, the entrance to the heavenly kingdom, in which (kingdom) are \"loosed\" the sins that were beforetime \"bound; \"and those which have not been \"loosed\" are \"bound,\" in accordance with true salvation; and Ananias he \"bound\" with the bond of death, and the weak in his feet he \"absolved\" from his defect of health. Moreover, in that dispute about the observance or non-observance of the Law, Peter was the first of all to be endued with the Spirit, and, after making preface touching the calling of the nations, to say, \"And now why are ye tempting the Lord, concerning the imposition upon the brethren of a yoke which neither we nor our fathers were able to support?

Hence the power of loosing and of binding committed to Peter had nothing to do with the capital sins of believers; and if the Lord had given him a precept that he must grant pardon to a brother sinning against him even \"seventy times sevenfold,\" of course He would have commanded him to \"bind\"-that is, to \"retain\"[fn-16-P1652_487828:283-nf] -nothing subsequently, unless perchance such (sins) as one may have committed against the Lord, not against a brother.

But you, whoever you are that would seek into the unsearchable, and in all seriousness form an opinion upon the mysteries and powers of God;-I turn to you for counsel, and beg you to enlighten me, an unskilled and simple believer of all that God says, as to a circumstance which I am about to mention. I listen to the Lord's words and, since I believe what is recorded, I am sure that after His Resurrection He offered Himself repeatedly in the Body to the sight of multitudes of unbelievers. At any rate, He did so to Thomas who had protested that he would not believe unless he handled His wounds. His words are, Unless I shall see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe[fn-11-P1163_709728:13-nf] . The Lord stoops to the level even of our feeble understanding; to satisfy the doubts of unbelieving minds He works a miracle of His invisible power. Do you, my critic of the ways of heaven, explain His action if you can. The disciples were in a closed room; they had met and held their assembly in secret since the Passion of the Lord. The Lord presents Himself to strengthen the faith of Thomas by meeting his challenge; He gives him His Body to feel, His wounds to handle. He, indeed, who would be recognised as having suffered wounds must needs produce the body in which those wounds were received. I ask at what point in the walls of that closed house the Lord bodily entered. The Apostle has recorded the circumstances with careful precision; Jesus came when the doors were shut, and stood in the midst[fn-11-P1164_710560:14-nf] . Did He penetrate through bricks and mortar, or through stout woodwork, substances whose very nature it is to bar progress? For there He stood in bodily presence; there was no suspicion of deceit Let the eye of your mind follow His path as He enters; let your intellectual vision accompany Him as He passes into that closed dwell ing. There is no breach in the walls, no door has been unbarred; yet lo, He stands in the midst Whose might no barrier can resist. You are a critic of things invisible; I ask you to explain a visible event. Everything remains firm as it was; no body is capable of insinuating itself through the interstices of wood and stone. The Body of the Lord does not disperse itself, to come together again after a disappearance; yet whence comes He Who is standing in the midst? Your senses and your words are powerless to account for it; the fact is certain, but it lies beyond the region of human explanation. If, as you say, our account of the Divine birth is a lie, then prove that this account of tile Lord's entrance is a fiction. If we assume that an event did not happen, because we cannot discover how it was done, we make the limits of our understanding into the limits of reality. But the certainty of the evidence proves the falsehood of our contradiction. The Lord did stand in a closed house in the midst of the disciples; the Son was born of the Father. Deny not that He stood, because your puny wits cannot ascertain how He came there; renounce a disbelief in God the Only-begotten and perfect Son of God the Unbegotten and perfect Father, which is based only on the incapacity of sense and speech to comprehend the transcendent miracle of that birth.","title":"Book III.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":20,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_21_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_smyrnaeans","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"ANF-01","text":"And I know that He was possessed of a body not only in His being born and crucified, but I also know that He was so after His resurrection, and believe that He is so now.

And that our view about this may be made clearer let us thus divide our argument. The inspired apostle on four occasions employs this term, once as here, calling Him, \"first-born of all creation[fn-10-P1069_579579:88-nf] ,\" another time, \"the first-born among many brethren[fn-10-P1070_579649:89-nf] ,\" again, \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1071_579705:90-nf] ,\" and on another occasion he employs the term absolutely, without combining it with other words, saying, \"But when again He bringeth the first-born into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him[fn-10-P1072_579955:91-nf] .\" Accordingly whatever view we entertain concerning this title in the other combinations, the same we shall in consistency apply to the phrase \"first-born of all creation.\" For since the title is one and the same it must needs be that the meaning conveyed is also one. In what sense then does He become \"the first-born among many brethren?\" in what sense does He become \"the first-born from the dead?\" Assuredly this is plain, that because we are by birth flesh and blood, as the Scripture saith, \"He Who for our sakes was born among us and was partaker of flesh and blood[fn-10-P1073_580545:92-nf] ,\" purposing to change us from corruption to incorruption by the birth from above, the birth by water and the Spirit, Himself led the way in this birth, drawing down upon the water, by His own baptism, the Holy Spirit; so that in all things He became the first-born of those who are spiritually born again, and gave the name of brethren to those who partook in a birth like to His own by water and the Spirit. But since it was also meet that He should implant in our nature the power of rising again from the dead, He becomes the \"first-fruits of them that slept[fn-10-P1074_581130:93-nf] \" and the \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1075_581186:94-nf] ,\" in that He first by His own act loosed the pains of death[fn-10-P1076_581264:95-nf] , so that His new birth from the dead was made a way for us also, since the pains of death, wherein we were held, were loosed by the resurrection of the Lord. Thus, just as by having shared in the washing of regeneration[fn-10-P1077_581533:96-nf] He became \"the first-born among many brethren,\" and again by having made Himself the first-fruits of the resurrection, He obtains the name of the \"first-born from the dead,\" so having in all things the pre-eminence, after that \"all old things,\" as the apostle says, \"have passed away[fn-10-P1078_581877:97-nf] ,\" He becomes the first-born of the new creation of men in Christ by the two-fold regeneration, alike that by Holy Baptism and that which is the consequence of the resurrection from the dead, becoming for us in both alike the Prince of Life[fn-10-P1079_582141:98-nf] , the first-fruits, the first-born. This first-born, then, hath also brethren, concerning whom He speaks to Mary, saying, \"Go and tell My brethren, I go to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God[fn-10-P1080_582374:99-nf] .\" In these words He sums up the whole aim of His dispensation as Man. For men revolted front God, and \"served them which by nature were no gods[fn-10-P1081_582574:100-nf] ,\" and though being the children of God became attached to an evil father falsely so called. For this cause the mediator between God and man[fn-10-P1082_582738:101-nf] having assumed the first-fruits of all human nature[fn-10-P1083_582815:102-nf] , sends to His brethren the announcement of Himself not in His divine character, but in that which He shares with us, saying, \"I am departing in order to make by My own self that true Father, from whom you were separated, to be your Father, and by My own self to make that true God from whom you had revolted to be your God, for by that first-fruits which I have assumed, I am in Myself presenting all humanity to its God and Father.\"","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":20,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Thus much with regard to his profanity towards the Son. Now let us see what he says about the Holy Spirit. \"After Him, we believe,\" he says, \"on the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth.\" I think it will be plain to all who come across this passage what object he has in view in thus perverting the declaration of the faith delivered to us by the Lord, in his statements concerning the Son and the Father. Though this absurdity has already been exposed, I will nevertheless endeavour, in few words, to make plain the aim of his knavery. As in the former case, he avoided using the name \"Father,\" that so he might not include the Son in the eternity of the Father, so he avoided employing the title Son, that he might not by it suggest His natural affinity to the Father; so here, too, he refrains from saying \"Holy Spirit,\" that he may not by this name acknowledge the majesty of His glory, and His complete union with the Father and the Son. For since the appellation of \"Spirit,\" and that of \"Holy,\" are by the Scriptures equally applied to the Father and the Son (for \"God is a Spirits[fn-12-P1225_665183:210-nf] ,\" and \"the anointed Lord is the Spirit before our face[fn-12-P1226_665262:211-nf] ,\" and \"the Lord our God is Holy[fn-12-P1227_665326:212-nf] ,\" and there is \"one Holy, one Lord Jesus Christ[fn-12-P1228_665395:213-nf] \") lest there should, by the use of these terms, be bred in the minds of his readers some orthodox conception of the Holy Spirit, such as would naturally arise in them from His sharing His glorious appellation with the Father and the Son, for this reason, deluding the ears of the foolish, he changes the words of the Faith as set forth by God in the delivery of this mystery, making a way, so to speak, by this sequence, for the entrance of his impiety against the Holy Spirit. For if he had said, \"We believe in the Holy Spirit,\" and \"God is a Spirit,\" any one instructed in things divine would have interposed the remark, that if we are to believe in the Holy Spirit, while God is called a Spirit, He is assuredly not distinct in nature from that which receives the same titles in a proper sense. For of all those things which are indicated not unreally, nor metaphorically, but properly and absolutely, by the same names, we are necessarily compelled to acknowledge that the nature also, which is signified by this identity of names, is one and the same. For this reason it is that, suppressing the name appointed by the Lord in the formula of the faith, he says, \"We believe in the Comforter.\" But I have been taught that this very name is also applied by the inspired Scripture to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost alike. For the Son gives the name of \"Comforter\" equally to Himself and to the Holy Spirit[fn-12-P1229_666903:214-nf] ; and the Father, where He is said to work comfort, surely claims as His own the name of \"Comforter.\" For assuredly he Who does the work of a Comforter does not disdain the name belonging to the work: for David says to the Father, \"Thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me[fn-12-P1230_667203:215-nf] ,\" and the great Apostle applies to the Father the same language, when he says, \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1231_667403:216-nf] \"; and John, in one of his Catholic Epistles, expressly gives to the Son the name of Comforter[fn-12-P1232_667520:217-nf] . Nay, more, the Lord Himself, in saying that another Comforter would be sent us, when speaking of the Spirit, clearly asserted this title of Himself in the first place. But as there are two senses of the parakalein[fn-12-P1233_667807:218-nf] ,-one to beseech, by words and gestures of respect, to induce him to whom we apply for anything, to feel with us in respect of those things for which we apply,-the other to comfort, to take remedial thought for affections of body and soul,-the Holy Scripture affirms the conception of the Paraclete, in either sense alike, to belong to the Divine nature. For at one time Paul sets before us by the word parakalein the healing power of God, as when he says, \"God, Who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus[fn-12-P1234_668424:219-nf] \"; and at another time he uses this word in its other meaning, when he says, writing to the Corinthians, \"Now we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God[fn-12-P1235_668680:220-nf] .\" Now since these things are so, in whatever way you understand the title \"Paraclete,\" when used of the Spirit, you will not in either of its significations detach Him from His community in it with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, he has not been able, even though he wished it, to belittle the glory of the Spirit by ascribing to Him the very attribute which Holy Scripture refers also to the Father and to the Son. But in styling Him \"the Spirit of Truth,\" Eunomius' own wish, I suppose, was to suggest by this phrase subjection, since Christ is the Truth, and he called Him the Spirit of Truth, as if one should say that He is a possession and chattel of the Truth, without being aware that God is called a God of righteousness[fn-12-P1236_669437:221-nf] ; and we certainly do not understand thereby that God is a possession of righteousness. Wherefore also, when we hear of the \"Spirit of Truth,\" we acquire by that phrase such a conception as befits the Deity, being guided to the loftier interpretation by the words which follow it. For when the Lord said \"The Spirit of Truth,\" He immediately added \"Which proceedeth from the Father[fn-12-P1237_669966:222-nf] ,\" a fact which the voice of the Lord never asserted of any conceivable thing in creation, not of aught visible or invisible, not of thrones, principalities, powers, or dominions, nor of any other name that is named either in this world or in that which is to come. It is plain then that that, from share in which all creation is excluded, is something special and peculiar to uncreated being. But this man bids us believe in \"the Guide of godliness.\" Let a man then believe in Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and all those by whom we have been led into the way of thefaith. For if we are to believe in \"that which guides us to godliness,\" along with the Father and the Son, all the prophets and lawgivers and patriarchs, heralds, evangelists, apostles, pastors,and teachers, have equal honour with the Holy Spirit, as they bare been \"guides to godliness\" to those who came after them. \"Who came into being,\" he goes on, \"by the only God through the Only-begotten.\" In these words he gathers up in one head all his blasphemy. Once more he calls the Father \"only God,\" who employs the Only-begotten as an instrument for the production of the Spirit. What shadow of such a notion did he find in Scripture, that he ventures upon this assertion? by deduction from what premises did he bring his profanity to such a conclusion as this?Which of the Evangelists says it? what apostle? what prophet? Nay, on the contrary every scripture divinely inspired, written by the afflatus of the Spirit, attests the Divinity of the Spirit. For example (for it is better to prove my position from the actual testimonies), those who receive power to become children of God bear witness to the Divinity of the Spirit. Who knows not that utterance of the Lord which tells us that they who are born of the Spirit are the children of God? For thus He expressly ascribes the birth of the children of God to the Spirit, saying, that as that which is born of the flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. But as many as are born of the Spirit are called the children of God[fn-12-P1238_672086:223-nf] . So also when the Lord by breathing upon His disciples had imparted to them the Holy Spirit, John says, \"Of His fulness have all we received[fn-12-P1239_672321:224-nf] .\" And that \"in Him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead[fn-12-P1240_672419:225-nf] ,\" the mighty Paul attests: yea, moreover, through the prophet Isaiah it is attested, as to the manifestation of the Divine appearance vouchsafed to him, when he saw Him that sat \"on the throne high and lifted up[fn-12-P1241_672651:226-nf] ;\" the older tradition, it is true, says that it was the Father Who appeared to him, but the evangelist John refers the prophecy to our Lord, saying, touching those of the Jews who did not believe the words uttered by the prophet concerning the Lord, \"These things said Esaias, when he saw His glory and spoke of Him[fn-12-P1242_672986:227-nf] .\" But the mighty Paul attributes the same passage to the Holy Spirit in his speech made to the Jews at Rome, when he says, \"Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet concerning you, saying, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand[fn-12-P1243_673333:228-nf] ,\" showing, in my opinion, by Holy Scripture itself, that every specially divine vision, every theophany, every word uttered in the Person of God, is to be understood to refer to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hence when David says, \"they provoked God in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert[fn-12-P1244_673719:229-nf] ,\" the apostle refers to the Holy Spirit the despite done by the Israelites to God, in these terms: \"Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me[fn-12-P1245_674004:230-nf] ,\" and goes on to refer all that the prophecy refers to God, to the Person of the Holy Ghost. Those who keep repeating against us the phrase \"three Gods,\" because we hold these views, have perhaps not yet learnt how to count. For if the Father and the Son are not divided into duality, (for they are, according to the Lord's words, One, and not Two[fn-12-P1246_674374:231-nf] ) and if the Holy Ghost is also one, how can one added to one be divided into the number of three Gods? Is it not rather plain that no one can charge us with believing in the number of three Gods, without himself first maintaining in his own doctrine a pair of Gods? For it is by being added to two that the one completes the triad of Gods. But what room is there for the charge of tritheism against those by whom one God is worshipped, the God expressed by the Name ofthe Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost?","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":20,"verse":27,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_13_to_pammachius_against_john_of_jerusalem","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"28. In the symbol of our faith and hope, which was delivered by the Apostles, and is not written with paper and ink, but on fleshy tables of the heart, after the confession of the Trinity and the unity of the Church, the whole symbol of Christian dogma concludes with the resurrection of the flesh. You dwell so exclusively upon the subject of the body, harping upon it in your discourse, repeating first the body, and secondly the body, and again the body, and nine times over the body, that you do not even once name the flesh; whereas they always speak of the flesh, but say nothing of the body. I would have you know that we see through what you craftily add, and with wise precaution seek to conceal. For you make use of the same passages to prove the reality of the resurrection by means of which Origen denies it; you support questionable positions with doubtful arguments, and thus raise a storm which in a moment overthrows the settled fabric of faith. You quote the words,[fn-70-P7094_2336554:66-nf] \"It is sown an animal body: it shall rise a spiritual body.\" \"For they shall neither marry, nor be given in marriage, but shall be as the angels in heaven.\" What other instances would you take if you were denying the resurrection? You intend to confess the resurrection of the flesh, you say, in a real and not an imaginary sense. After the remarks with which you smooth things over to the ears of the ignorant, to the effect that we rise again with the very bodies with which we died and were buried, why do you not go on and speak thus: \"The Lord after His resurrection showed the prints of the nails in His hands, pointed to the wound of the spear in His side, and when the Apostles doubted because they thought they saw a phantom, gave them reply,[fn-70-P7095_2337355:67-nf] `Handle Me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and blood as ye see Me have'; and specially to Thomas,[fn-70-P7096_2337478:68-nf] `Put thy finger into My hands, and thy hand into My side, and be not faithless, but believing.' Similarly after the resurrection we shall have the same members which we now use, the same flesh and blood and bones, for it is not the nature of these which is condemned in Holy Scripture, but their works. Then again, it is written in Genesis:[fn-70-P7097_2337837:69-nf] `My Spirit shall not abide in those men, because they are flesh.' And the Apostle Paul, speaking of the corrupt doctrine and works of the Jews, says:[fn-70-P7098_2338004:70-nf] `I rested not in flesh and blood.' And to the Saints, who, of course, were in the flesh, he says:[fn-70-P7099_2338119:71-nf] `But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you.'

Since those also which are called our deserts, are His gifts.

For then He promised that He Himself would send Him, and He sent Him;[fn-16-P1660_828358:17-nf] because then, as it was written and foretold of Him, \"He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.\"[fn-16-P1661_828527:18-nf] These gifts constitute our deserts, by which we arrive at the chief good of an immortal blessedness. \"But God,\" says the apostle, \"commendeth His love towards as, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.\" To this he goes on to add, \"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.\" Those whom he first calls sinners he afterwards calls the enemies of God; and those whom he first speaks of as justified by His blood, he afterwards speaks of as reconciled by the death of the Son of God; and those whom he speaks of first as saved from wrath through Him, he afterwards speaks of as saved by His life. We were not, therefore, before that grace merely anyhow sinners, but in such sins that we were enemies of God. But the same apostle calls us above several times by two appellations, viz. sinners and enemies of God,-one as if the most mild, the other plainly the most harsh,-saying, \"For if when we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.\"[fn-16-P1662_829719:19-nf] Those whom he called weak, the same he called ungodly. Weakness seems something slight; but sometimes it is such as to be called impiety. Yet except it were weakness, it would not need a physician, who is in the Hebrew Jesus, in the Greek Swthr, but in our speech Saviour. And this word the Latin language had not previously, but could have seeing that it could have it when it wanted it. And this foregoing sentence of the apostle, where he says, \"For when we were yet weak, in due time He died for the ungodly,\" coheres with those two following sentences; in the one of which he spoke of sinners, in the other of enemies of God, as though he referred each severally to each, viz. sinners to the weak, the enemies of God to the ungodly.","title":"Book XIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"101","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Then, again, when we encounter the question (as to the veracity of those five senses which we learn with our alphabet; since from this source even there arises some support for our heretics. They are the faculties of seeing, and hearing, and smelling, and tasting, and touching. The fidelity of these senses is impugned with too much severity by the Platonists,[fn-27-P2737_915262:118-nf] and according to some by Heraclitus also, and Diocles, and Empedocles; at any rate, Plato, in the Timµus, declares the operations of the senses to be irrational, and vitiated[fn-27-P2738_915455:119-nf] by our opinions or beliefs. Deception is imputed to the sight, because it asserts that oars, when immersed in the water, are inclined or bent, notwithstanding the certainty that they are straight; because, again, it is quite sure that distant tower with its really quadrangular contour is round; because also it will discredit the fact of the truly parallel fabric of yonder porch or arcade, by supposing it to be narrower and narrower towards its end; and because it will join with the sea the sky which hangs at so great a height above it. In the same way, our hearing is charged with fallacy: we think, for instance, that is a noise in the sky which is nothing else than the rumbling of a carriage; or, if you prefer it[fn-27-P2739_916255:120-nf] the other way, when the thunder rolled at a distance, we were quite sure that it was a carriage which made the noise. Thus, too, are our faculties of smell and taste at fault, because the selfsame perfumes and wines lose their value after we have used them awhile. On the same principle our touch is censured, when the identical pavement which seemed rough to the hands is felt by the feet to be smooth enough; and in the baths a stream of warm water is pronounced to be quite hot at first, and beautifully temperate afterwards. Thus, according to them, our senses deceive us, when all the while we are (the cause of the discrepancies, by) changing our opinions. The Stoics are more moderate in their views; for they do not load with the obloquy of deception every one of the senses, and at all times. The Epicureans, again, show still greater consistency, in maintaining that all the senses are equally true in their testimony, and always so-only in a different way. It is not our organs of sensation that are at fault, but our opinion. The senses only experience sensation, they do not exercise opinion; it is the soul that opines. They separated opinion from the senses, and sensation from the soul. Well, but whence comes opinion, if not from the senses? Indeed, unless the eye had descried a round shape in that tower, it could have had no idea that it possessed roundness. Again, whence arises sensation if not from the soul? For if the soul had no body, it would have no sensation. Accordingly, sensation comes from the soul, and opinion from sensation; and the whole (process) is the soul. But further, it may well be insisted on that there is a something which causes the discrepancy between the report of the senses and the reality of the facts. Now, since it is possible, (as we have seen), for phenomena to be reported which exist not in the objects, why should it not be equally possible for phenomena to be reported which are caused not by the senses, but by reasons and conditions which intervene, in the very nature of the case? If so, it will be only right that they should be duly recognised. The truth is, that it was the water which was the cause of the oar seeming to be inclined or bent: out of the water, it was perfectly straight in appearance (as well as in fact). The delicacy of the substance or medium which forms a mirror by means of its luminosity, according as it is struck or shaken, by the vibration actually destroys the appearance of the straightness of a right line. In like manner, the condition of the open space which fills up the interval between it and us, necessarily causes the true shape of the tower to escape our notice; for the uniform density of the surrounding air covering its angles with a similar light obliterates their outlines. So, again, the equal breadth of the arcade is sharpened or narrowed off towards its termination, until its aspect, becoming more and more contracted under its prolonged roof, comes to a vanishing point in the direction of its farthest distance. So the sky blends itself with the sea, the vision becoming spent at last, which had maintained duly the boundaries of the two elements, so long as its vigorous glance lasted. As for the (alleged cases of deceptive) hearing, what else could produce the illusion but the similarity of the sounds? And if the perfume afterwards was less strong to the smell, and the wine more flat to the taste, and the water not so hot to the touch, their original strength was after all found in the whole of them pretty well unimpaired. In the matter, however, of the roughness and smoothness of the pavement, it was only natural and right that limbs like the hands and the feet, so different in tenderness and callousness, should have different impressions. In this way, then, there cannot occur an illusion in our senses without an adequate cause. Now if special causes, (such as we have indicated, ) mislead our senses add (through our senses) our opinions also, then we must no longer ascribe the deception to the senses, which follow the specific causes of the illusion, nor to the opinions we form; for these are occasioned and controlled by our senses, which only follow the causes. Persons who are afflicted with madness or insanity, mistake one object for another. Orestes in his sister sees his mother; Ajax sees Ulysses in the slaughtered herd; Athamas and Agave descry wild beasts in their children. Now is it their eyes or their phrenzy which you must blame for so vast a fallacy? All things taste bitter, in the redundancy of their bile, to those who have the jaundice. Is it their taste which you will charge with the physical prevarication, or their ill state of health? All the senses, therefore, are disordered occasionally, or imposed upon, but only in such a way as to be quite free of any fault in their own natural functions. But further still, not even against the specific causes and conditions themselves must we lay an indictment of deception. For, since these physical aberrations happen for stated reasons, the reasons do not deserve to be regarded as deceptions. Whatever ought to occur in a certain manner is not a deception. If, then, even these circumstantial causes must be acquitted of all censure and blame, how much more should we free from reproach the senses, over which the said causes exercise a liberal sway! Hence we are bound most certainly to claim for the senses truth, and fidelity, and integrity, seeing that they never render any other account of their impressions than is enjoined on them by the specific causes or conditions which in all cases produce that discrepancy which appears between the report of the senses and the reality of the objects. What mean you, then, O most insolent Academy? You overthrow the entire condition of human life; you disturb the whole order of nature; you obscure the good providence of God Himself: for the senses of man which God has appointed over all His works, that we might understand, inhabit, dispense, and enjoy them, (you reproach) as fallacious and treacherous tyrants! But is it not from these that all creation receives our services? Is it not by their means that a second form is impressed even upon the world?-so many arts, so many industrious resources, so many pursuits, such business, such offices, such commerce, such remedies, counsels, consolations, modes, civilizations, and accomplishments of life! All these things have produced the very relish and savour of human existence; whilst by these senses of man, he alone of all animated nature has the distinction of being a rational animal, with a capacity for intelligence and knowledge-nay, an ability to form the Academy itself! But Plato, in order to disparage the testimony of the senses, in the Phµdrus denies (in the person of Socrates) his own ability to know even himself, according to the injunction of the Delphic oracle; and in the Theµtetus he deprives himself of the faculties of knowledge and sensation; and again, in the Phµdrus he postpones till after death the posthumous knowledge, as he calls it, of the truth; and yet for all he went on playing the philosopher even before he died. We may not, I say, we may not call into question the truth of the (poor vilified) senses,[fn-27-P2740_923523:121-nf] lest we should even in Christ Himself, bring doubt upon[fn-27-P2741_923600:122-nf] the truth of their sensation; lest perchance it should be said that He did not really \"behold Satan as lightning fall from heaven; \"[fn-27-P2742_923753:123-nf] that He did not really hear the Father's voice testifying of Himself;[fn-27-P2743_923842:124-nf] or that He was deceived in touching Peter's wife's mother;[fn-27-P2744_923923:125-nf] or that the fragrance of the ointment which He afterwards smelled was different from that which He accepted for His burial;[fn-27-P2745_924070:126-nf] and that the taste of the wine was different from that which He consecrated in memory of His blood.[fn-27-P2746_924195:127-nf] On this false principle it was that Marcion actually chose to believe that He was a phantom, denying to Him the reality of a perfect body. Now, not even to His apostles was His nature ever a matter of deception. He was truly both seen and heard upon the mount;[fn-27-P2747_924517:128-nf] true and real was the draught of that wine at the marriage of (Cana in) Galilee;[fn-27-P2748_924622:129-nf] true and real also was the touch of the then believing Thomas.[fn-27-P2749_924707:130-nf] Read the testimony of John: \"That which we have seen, which we have heard, which we have looked upon with our eyes, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.\"[fn-27-P2750_924893:131-nf] False, of course, and deceptive must have been that testimony, if the witness of our eyes, and ears, and hands be by nature a lie.","title":"A Treatise on the Soul.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":20,"verse":31,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_13_book_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"41.

And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"[fn-68-P6849_2199368:11-nf] And again to the same He says, after His resurrection, \"Feed nay sheep.\"[fn-68-P6850_2199466:12-nf] And although to all the apostles, after His resurrection, He gives an equal power, and says, \"As the Father hath sent me, even so send I you: Receive ye the Holy Ghost: Whose soever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted unto him; and whose soever sins ye retain, they shall be retained; \"[fn-68-P6851_2199876:13-nf] yet, that He might set forth unity, He arranged by His authority the origin of that unity, as beginning from one. Assuredly the rest of the apostles were also the same as was Peter, endowed with a like partnership both of honour and power; but the beginning proceeds from unity.[fn-68-P6852_2200174:14-nf] Which one Church, also, the Holy Spirit in the Song of Songs designated in the person of our Lord, and says, \"My dove, my spotless one, is but one. She is the only one of her mother, elect of her that bare her.\"[fn-68-P6853_2200704:15-nf] Does he who does not hold this unity of the Church think that he holds the faith? Does he who strives against and resists the Church[fn-68-P6854_2200855:16-nf] trust that he is in the Church, when moreover the blessed Apostle Paul teaches the same thing, and sets forth the sacrament of unity, saying, \"There is one body and one spirit, one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God? \"[fn-68-P6855_2201242:17-nf] ","title":"Treatise I.

But the reason why, after His resurrection, He both gave the Holy Spirit, first on earth,[fn-21-P2121_1072991:118-nf] and afterwards sent Him from heaven,[fn-21-P2122_1073048:119-nf] is in my judgment this: that \"love is shed abroad in our hearts,\"[fn-21-P2123_1073134:120-nf] by that Gift itself,whereby we love God and our neighbors, according to those two commandments,\"onwhich hang all the law and the prophets.\"[fn-21-P2124_1073292:121-nf] And Jesus Christ, in order to signify this,gave to them the Holy Spirit, once upon earth, on account of the love of our neighbor, and a second time from heaven, on account of the love of God. And if some other reason may perhaps be given for this double gift of the Holy Spirit, at any rate we ought not to doubt that the same Holy Spirit was given when Jesus breathed upon them, of whom He by and by says, \"Go, baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,\" where this Trinity is especially commended to us. It is therefore He who was also given from heaven on the day of Pentecost, i.e. ten days after the Lord ascended into heaven. How, therefore, is He not God, who gives the Holy Spirit? Nay, how great a God is He who gives God! For no one of His disciples gave the HolySpirit, since they prayed that He might come upon those upon whom they laid their hands: they did not give Him themselves. And the Church preserves this custom even now in the case of her rulers. Lastly, Simon Magus also, when he offered the apostles money, does not say, \"Give me also this power, that I may give\" the Holy Spirit; but, \"that on whomsoever I may lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.\" Because neither had the Scriptures said before, And Simon, seeing that the apostles gave the Holy Spirit; but it had said,\" And Simon, seeing that the Holy Spirit was given by the laying on of the apostles' hands.\"[fn-21-P2125_1074760:122-nf] Therefore also the Lord Jesus Christ Himself not only gave the Holy Spirit as God, but also received it as man, and therefore He is said to be full of grace,[fn-21-P2126_1074944:123-nf] and of the Holy Spirit.[fn-21-P2127_1074987:124-nf] And in the Acts of the Apostles it is more plainly written of Him, \"Because God anointed Him With the Holy Spirit.\"[fn-21-P2128_1075133:125-nf] Certainly not with visible oil but with the gift of grace which is signified by the visible ointment wherewith the Church anoints the baptized. And Christ was certainly not then anointed with the Holy Spirit, when He, as a dove, descended upon Him at His baptism.[fn-21-P2129_1075416:126-nf] For at that time He deigned to prefigure His body, i.e. His Church, in which especially the baptized receive the Holy Spirit. But He is to be understood to have been then anointed with that mystical and invisible unction, when the Word of God was made flesh,[fn-21-P2130_1075697:127-nf] i.e. when human nature, without any precedent merits of good works, was joined to God the Word in the womb of the Virgin, so that with it it became one person. Therefore it is that we confess Him to have been born of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary. For it is most absurd to believe Him to have received the Holy Spirit when He was near thirty years old: for at that age He was baptized by John;[fn-21-P2131_1076118:128-nf] but that He came to baptism as without any sin at all, so not without the Holy Spirit. For if it was written of His servant and forerunner John himself, \"He shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb,\"[fn-21-P2132_1076367:129-nf] because, although generated by his father, yet he received the Holy Spirit when formed in the womb; what must be understood and believed of the man Christ, of whose flesh the very conception was not carnal, but spiritual? Both natures, too, as well the human as the divine, are shown in that also that is written of Him, that He received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, and shed forth the Holy Spirit:[fn-21-P2133_1076802:130-nf] seeing that He received as man, and shed forth as God.

Great is Thy day, Lord, let us not be despised. All men honour the day of Thy birth. Thou righteous One, keep Thou the glory of Thy birth; for even Herod honoured the day of His birth! The dances of the impure one pleased the tyrant; to Thee, Lord, let the voice of chaste women be sweet! Thee, Lord, let the voice of chaste women please, whose bodies Thou guardest holily. The day of Herod was like him: Thy day too is like Thee! The day of the troubled one was troubled with sin; and fair as Thou art is Thy fair day!

The day of the tyrant raged like himself, because with his chain it put to silence the righteous Voice. The feast of the Meek One is tranquil like Himself, because His sum shines upon His persecutors. The tyrant was conscious that He was not a king, therefore to the King of kings he gave place. The whole day, Lord, suffices me not to balance Thy praise with his blame. May Thy Gracious day cause my sin to pass away, seeing that it is with the day of the impure one, that I have weighed Thy day! For great is Thy day beyond comparison! nor can it be compared with our days. The day of man is as of the earthy: the day of God is as of God!

With much wine also He filled the waterpots; they drew it out, yet it failed though it was abundant: of the Cup that He gave though the draught was small, very great was its strength, so that there is no stint thereto. A Cup is He[fn-25-P2581_960863:24-nf] that contains all strong wines, and also a Mystery in the midst of which He Himself is!

And, indeed, on this subject of the Father and the Son, learned and spiritual[fn-32-P3259_1501126:77-nf] men have conducted discussions in many books, in which, so far as men could do with men, they have endeavored to introduce an intelligible account as to how the Father was not one personally with the Son, and yet the two were one substantially;[fn-32-P3260_1501447:78-nf] and as to what the Father was individually (proprie), and what the Son: to wit, that the former was the Begetter, the latter the Begotten; the formernot of the Son, the latter of the Father: theformer the Beginning of the latter, whence also He is called the Head of Christ,[fn-32-P3261_1501854:79-nf] although Christ likewise is the Beginning,[fn-32-P3262_1501917:80-nf] but not of the Father; the latter, moreover, the Image[fn-32-P3263_1502149:81-nf] of the former, although in no respect dissimilar, and although absolutely and without difference equal (omnino et indifferenter aequalis). These questions are handled with greater breadth by those who, in less narrow limits than ours are at present, seek to set forth the profession of the Christian faith in its totality. Accordingly, in so far as He is the Son, of the Father received He it that He is, while that other [the Father] received not this of the Son; and in so far as He, in unutterable mercy, in a temporal dispensation took upon Himself the [nature of] man (hominem),-to wit, the changeable creature that was thereby to be changed into something better,-many statements concerning Him are discovered in the Scriptures, which are so expressed as to have given occasion to error in the impious intellects of heretics, with whom the desire to teach takes precedence of that to understand, so that they have supposed Him to be neither equal with the Father nor of the same substance. Such statements [are meant] as the following: \"For the Father is greater than I;\"[fn-32-P3264_1503245:82-nf] and, \"The head of the woman is the man, the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God;\"[fn-32-P3265_1503368:83-nf] and, \"Then shall He Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him;\"[fn-32-P3266_1503467:84-nf] and, \"I go to my Father and your Father, my God and your God,\"[fn-32-P3267_1503550:85-nf] together with some others of like tenor. Now all these have had a place given them, [certainly] not with the object of signifying an inequality of nature and substance; for to take them so would be to falsify a different class of statements, such as, \"I and my Father are one\" (unum);[fn-32-P3268_1503853:86-nf] and, \"He that hath seen me hath seen my Father also;\"[fn-32-P3269_1503923:87-nf] and, \"The Word was God,\"[fn-32-P3270_1503966:88-nf] for He was not made, inasmuch as \"all things were made by Him;\"[fn-32-P3271_1504046:89-nf] and, \"He thought it not robbery to be equal with God:\"[fn-32-P3272_1504117:90-nf] together with all the other passages of a similar order. But these statements have had a place given them, partly with a view to that administration of His assumption of human nature (administrationem suscepti hominis), in accordance with which it is said that \"He emptied Himself:\" not that that Wisdom was changed, since it is absolutely unchangeable; but that it was His will to make Himself known in such humble fashion to men. Partly then, I repeat, it is with a view to this administration that those things have been thus written which the heretics make the ground of their false allegations; and partly it was with a view to the consideration that the Son owes to the Father that which He is,[fn-32-P3273_1504849:91-nf] -thereby also certainly owing this in particular to the Father, to wit, that He is equal to the same Father, or that He is His Peer (eidem Patri aequalis aut par est), whereas the Father owes whatsoever He is to no one.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_30_5_five_books_in_reply_to_marcion_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1212","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Sprinkled, by speaking.[fn-47-P4785_760290:227-nf] words of presage, those","title":"5.

For those who would degrade the majesty of the glory of the Only-begotten to slavish and grovelling conceptions think that they find the strongest proof of their assertions in the words of the Lord to Mary, which He uttered after His resurrection, and before His ascension into heaven, saying, \"Touch Me not, for I am not yet ascended to My Father: but go to My brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God[fn-20-P2086_1263308:1-nf] .\" The orthodox interpretation of these words, the sense in which we have been accustomed to believe that they were spoken to Mary, is I think manifest to all who have received the faith in truth. Still the discussion of this point shall be given by us in its proper place; but meantime it is worth while to inquire from those who allege against us such phrases as \"ascending,\" \"being seen,\" \"being recognized by touch,\" and moreover \"being associated with men by brotherhood,\" whether they consider them to be proper to the Divine or to the Human Nature. For if they see in the Godhead the capacity of being seen and touched, of being supported by meat and drink, kinship and brotherhood with men, and all the attributes of corporeal nature, then let them predicate of the Only-begotten God both these and whatsoever else they will, as motive energy and local change, which are peculiar to things circumscribed by a body. But if He by Mary is discoursing with His brethren, and if the Only-begotten has no brethren, (for how, if He had brethren, could the property of being Only-begotten be preserved?) and if the same Person Who said, \"God is a Spirit[fn-20-P2087_1264481:2-nf] ,\" says to His disciples, \"Handle Me[fn-20-P2088_1264537:3-nf] ,\" that He may show that while the Human Nature is capable of being handled the Divinity is intangible, and if He Who says, \"I go,\" indicates local change, while He who contains all things, \"in Whom,\" as the Apostle says, \"all things were created, and in Whom all things consist[fn-20-P2089_1264837:4-nf] ,\" has nothing in existent things external to Himself to which removal could take place by any kind of motion, (for motion cannot otherwise be effected than by that which is removed leaving the place in which it is, and occupying another place instead, while that which extends through all, and is in all, and controls all, and is confined by no existent thing, has no place to which to pass, inasmuch as nothing is void of the Divine fulness,) how can these men abandon the belief that such expressions arise from that which is apparent, and apply them to that Nature which is Divine and which surpasseth all understanding, when the Apostle has in his speech to the Athenians plainly forbidden us to imagine any such thing of God, inasmuch as the Divine power is not discoverable by touch[fn-20-P2090_1265654:5-nf] , but by intelligent contemplation and faith? Or, again, whom does He Who did eat before the eyes of His disciples, and promised to go before them into Galilee and there be seen of them,-whom does He reveal Him to be Who should so appear to them? God, Whom no man hath seen or can see[fn-20-P2091_1266003:6-nf] ? or the bodily image, that is, the form of a servant in which God was? If then what has been said plainly proves that the meaning of the phrases alleged refers to that which is visible, expressing shape, and capable of motion, akin to the nature of His disciples, and none of these properties is discernible in Him Who is invisible, incorporeal, intangible, and formless, how do they come to degrade the very Only-begotten God, Who was in the beginning, and is in the Father, to a level with Peter, Andrew, John, and the rest of the Apostles, by calling them the brethren and fellow-servants of the Only-begotten? And yet all their exertions are directed to this aim, to show that in majesty of nature there is as great a distance between the Father and the dignity, power, and essence of the Only-begotten, as there is between the Only-begotten and humanity. And they press this saying into the support of this meaning, treating the name of the God and Father as being of common significance in respect of the Lord and of His disciples, in the view that no difference in dignity of nature is conceived while He is recognized as God and Father both of Him and of them in a precisely similar manner.","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":20,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":63,"source_paragraph":"266","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"119.

The Lord, however, was speaking in a strain which makes it quite clear that even the question which Peter thus proposed, and the answer which was returned to him, belong really to the same address. Luke, again, records none of these things in the order here observed, with the exception of the incident with the little child whom He set before His disciples, for their imitation when they were thinking of their own greatness.[fn-20-P2036_835495:451-nf] For if he has also narrated some other matters of a tenor resembling those which are inserted in this discourse, these are sayings which he has recalled for notice in other connections, and on occasions different from the present: just as John[fn-20-P2037_835762:452-nf] introduces the Lord's words on the subject of the forgiveness of sins,-namely, those to the effect that they should be remitted to him to whom the apostles remitted them, and that they should be retained to him to whom they retained them, as spoken by the Lord after His resurrection; while Matthew mentions that in the discourse now under notice the Lord made this declaration, which, however, the self-same evangelist at the same time affirms to have been given on a previous occasion to Peter.[fn-20-P2038_836279:453-nf] Therefore, to preclude the necessity of having always to inculcate the same rule, we ought to bear in mind the fact that Jesus uttered the same word repeatedly, and in a number of different places,-a principle which we have pressed so often upon your attention already; and this consideration should save us from feeling any perplexity, even although the order of the sayings may be thought to create some difficulty.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_113_letter_lix_to_epictetus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"10.

For the Son, being God, and Lord of glory[fn-100-P10069_3605395:35-nf] , was in the Body which was ingloriously nailed and dishonoured; but the Body, while it suffered, being pierced on the tree, and water and blood flowed from its side, yet because it was a temple of the Word was filled full of the Godhead. For this reason it was that the sun, seeing its creator suffering in His outraged body, withdrew its rays and darkened the earth. But the body itself being of mortal nature, beyond its own nature rose again by reason of the Word which was in it; and it has ceased from natural corruption, and, having put on the Word which is above man, has become incorruptible.","title":"Letter LIX.

Here we must take care not to let John underlie the appearance not only of standing in antagonism to Luke, who had stated before this, that Satan entered into the heart of Judas at the time when he made his bargain with the Jews to betray Him on receipt of a sum of money, but also of contradicting himself. For, at an earlier point, and previous to [his notice of] the receiving of this sop, he had made use of these terms: \"And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas to betray Him.\"[fn-22-P2258_952651:14-nf] And how does he enter into the heart, but by putting unrighteous persuasions into the thoughts of unrighteous men? The explanation, however, is this. We ought to suppose Judas to have been more fully taken possession of by the devil now, just as on theother hand, in the instance of the good, those who had already received the Holy Spirit on that occasion, subsequently to His resurrection, when He breathed upon them and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost,\"[fn-22-P2259_953128:15-nf] also obtained a fuller gift of that Spirit at a later time, namely, when He was sent down from above on the day of Pentecost. In like manner, Satan then entered into this man after the sop. And (as John himself mentions in the immediate context) \"Jesus saith unto him, What thou doest, do quickly. Now no man at the table knew for what intent He spake this unto him; for some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. He then, having received the sop, went immediately out; and it was night. Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus saith, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him: and if God be glorified in Him, God shall also glorify Him in Himself, and shall straightway glorify Him.\"[fn-22-P2260_953985:16-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"120","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"67. Let us now proceed, therefore, to look into the rest of this passage, and see how in other respects these statements are quite consistent with what is given by Matthew. For Luke tells us, with the utmost plainness, that two angels were seen by those women who came to the sepulchre. One of these angels we have understood to be referred to by each of the first two evangelists; that is to say, one of them is noticed by Matthew, namely, the one who was sitting outside upon the stone, and a second by Mark, namely, the one who was sitting within the sepulchre on the right side. But Luke's version of the scene is to the following effect: \"And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drew on. And the women which had come with Him from Galilee beheld the sepulchre, and how His body was laid. And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath-day, according to the commandment.[fn-26-P2624_1140802:271-nf] Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.[fn-26-P2625_1141090:272-nf] And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments; and as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. And they remembered His words. And they returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.\"[fn-26-P2626_1141822:273-nf] The question, therefore, is this, how can these angels have been seen sitting each one separately,-namely, one outside upon the stone, according to Matthew, and another within upon the right side, according to Mark,-if Luke's report of the same bears that the two stood beside those women, although the words ascribed to them are similar? Well, it is still possible for us to suppose that one angel was seen by the women in the position assigned by Matthew, and in the circumstances indicated by Mark, as we have already explained. In this way, we may understand the said women to have entered into the sepulchre, that is to say, into a certain space which had been fenced off within a kind of enclosure, in such a manner that an entrance might be said to be made when they came in front of the rocky place in which the sepulchre was constructed; and there we may take them to have beheld the angel sitting upon the stone which had been rolled away from the tomb, as Matthew tells us, or in other words, the angel sitting on the right side, as Mark expresses it.[fn-26-P2627_1142995:274-nf] And then we may further surmise that the said women, after they had gone within, and when they were looking at the place where the body of the Lord lay, saw other two angels standing, as Luke informs us, by whom they were addressed in similar terms, with a view to animate their minds and edify their faith.[fn-26-P2628_1143510:275-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"69. This being the case, therefore, let us, so far as the Lord may help us, take all these incidents, which took place about the time of the Lord's resurrection, as they are brought before us in the statements of all the evangelists together, and let us arrange them in one connected narrative, which will exhibit them, precisely as they may have actually occurred. It was in the early morning of the first day of the week, as all the evangelists are at one in attesting, that the women came to the sepulchre. By that time, all that is recorded by Matthew alone had already taken place; that is to say, in regard to the quaking of the earth, and the rolling away of the stone, and the terror of the guards, with which they were so stricken, that in some part they lay like dead men. Then, as John informs us, came Mary Magdalene, who unquestionably was surpassingly more ardent in her love than these other women[fn-26-P2632_1147978:277-nf] who had ministered to the Lord; so that it was not unreasonable in John to make mention of her alone, leaving those others unnamed, who, however, were along with her, as we gather from the reports given by others of the evangelists. She came accordingly; and when she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre, without pausing to make any more minute investigation, and never doubting but that the body of Jesus had been removed from the tomb, she ran, as the same John states, and told the state of matters to Peter and to John himself. For John is himself that disciple whom Jesus loved. They then set out running to the sepulchre; and John, reaching the spot first, stooped down and saw the linen clothes lying, but he did not go within. But Peter followed up, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen clothes lie, and the napkin, which had been about His head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. Then John entered also, and saw in like manner, and believed what Mary had told him, namely, that the Lord had been taken away from the sepulchre. \"For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping,\"[fn-26-P2633_1149284:278-nf] -that is to say, before the place in the rock in which the sepulchre was constructed, but at the same time within that space into which they had now entered; for there was a garden there, as the same John mentions.[fn-26-P2634_1149520:279-nf] Then they saw the angel sitting on the right side, upon the stone which was rolled away from the sepulchre; of which angel both Matthew and Mark discourse. \"Then he said unto them, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay: and go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead; and, behold, He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him: lo, I have told you.\"[fn-26-P2635_1150041:280-nf] In Mark we also find a passage similar in tenor to the above. At these words, Mary, still weeping, bent down and looked forwards into the sepulchre, and beheld the two angels, who are introduced to us in John's narrative, sitting in white raiment, one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been deposited. \"They say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.\"[fn-26-P2636_1150543:281-nf] Here we are to suppose the angels to have risen up, so that they could be seen standing, as Luke states that they were seen, and then, according to the narrative of the same Luke, to have addressed the women, as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth. The terms were these: \"Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise. And they remembered His words.\"[fn-26-P2637_1151132:282-nf] It was after this that, as we learn from John, \"Mary turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing Him to be the gardener, saith unto Him, Sir, if thou have borne Him hence, tell me where thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\"[fn-26-P2638_1151793:283-nf] Then she departed from the sepulchre, that is to say, from the ground where there was space for the garden in front of the stone which had been dug out. Along with her there were also those other women, who, as Mark tells us, were surprised with fear and trembling. And they told nothing to any one. At this point we next take up what Matthew has recorded in the following passage: \"Behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail! And they came and held Him by the feet, and worshipped Him.\"[fn-26-P2639_1152303:284-nf] For thus we gather that, on coming to the sepulchre, they were twice addressed by the angels; and, again, that they were also twice addressed by the Lord Himself, namely, at the point at which Mary took Him to be the gardener, and a second time at present, when He meets them on the way, with a view to strengthen them by such a repetition, and to bring them out of their state of fear. \"Then, accordingly, said He unto them, Be not afraid: go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.\"[fn-26-P2640_1152847:285-nf] \"Then came Mary Magdalene, and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her;\"[fn-26-P2641_1152992:286-nf] -not herself alone, however, but with her also those other women to whom Luke alludes when he says, \"Which told these things unto the eleven disciples, and all the rest. And their words seemed to them like madness, and they believed them not.\"[fn-26-P2642_1153262:287-nf] Mark also attests these facts; for, after telling us how the women went out from the sepulchre, trembling and amazed, and said nothing to any man, he subjoins the statement, that the Lord rose early the first day of the week, and appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils, and that she went and told them who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept, and that they, when they heard that He was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.[fn-26-P2643_1153876:288-nf] It is further to be observed, that Matthew has also introduced a notice to the effect that, as the women who had seen and heard all these things were going away, there came likewise into the city some of the guards who had been lying like dead men, and that these persons reported to the chief priests all the things that were done, that is to say, those of them which they were themselves also in a position to observe. He tells us, moreover, that when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, and bade them say that His disciples came and stole Him away while they slept, promising at the same time to secure them against the governor, who had given those guards. Finally, he adds that they took the money, and did as they had been taught, and that this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.[fn-26-P2644_1154779:289-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"69.

By that time, all that is recorded by Matthew alone had already taken place; that is to say, in regard to the quaking of the earth, and the rolling away of the stone, and the terror of the guards, with which they were so stricken, that in some part they lay like dead men. Then, as John informs us, came Mary Magdalene, who unquestionably was surpassingly more ardent in her love than these other women[fn-26-P2632_1147978:277-nf] who had ministered to the Lord; so that it was not unreasonable in John to make mention of her alone, leaving those others unnamed, who, however, were along with her, as we gather from the reports given by others of the evangelists. She came accordingly; and when she saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre, without pausing to make any more minute investigation, and never doubting but that the body of Jesus had been removed from the tomb, she ran, as the same John states, and told the state of matters to Peter and to John himself. For John is himself that disciple whom Jesus loved. They then set out running to the sepulchre; and John, reaching the spot first, stooped down and saw the linen clothes lying, but he did not go within. But Peter followed up, and went into the sepulchre, and saw the linen clothes lie, and the napkin, which had been about His head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. Then John entered also, and saw in like manner, and believed what Mary had told him, namely, that the Lord had been taken away from the sepulchre. \"For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping,\"[fn-26-P2633_1149284:278-nf] -that is to say, before the place in the rock in which the sepulchre was constructed, but at the same time within that space into which they had now entered; for there was a garden there, as the same John mentions.[fn-26-P2634_1149520:279-nf] Then they saw the angel sitting on the right side, upon the stone which was rolled away from the sepulchre; of which angel both Matthew and Mark discourse. \"Then he said unto them, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay: and go quickly, and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead; and, behold, He goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see Him: lo, I have told you.\"[fn-26-P2635_1150041:280-nf] In Mark we also find a passage similar in tenor to the above. At these words, Mary, still weeping, bent down and looked forwards into the sepulchre, and beheld the two angels, who are introduced to us in John's narrative, sitting in white raiment, one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been deposited. \"They say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.\"[fn-26-P2636_1150543:281-nf] Here we are to suppose the angels to have risen up, so that they could be seen standing, as Luke states that they were seen, and then, according to the narrative of the same Luke, to have addressed the women, as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth. The terms were these: \"Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen: remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise. And they remembered His words.\"[fn-26-P2637_1151132:282-nf] It was after this that, as we learn from John, \"Mary turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing Him to be the gardener, saith unto Him, Sir, if thou have borne Him hence, tell me where thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him away. Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\"[fn-26-P2638_1151793:283-nf] Then she departed from the sepulchre, that is to say, from the ground where there was space for the garden in front of the stone which had been dug out. Along with her there were also those other women, who, as Mark tells us, were surprised with fear and trembling. And they told nothing to any one. At this point we next take up what Matthew has recorded in the following passage: \"Behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail! And they came and held Him by the feet, and worshipped Him.\"[fn-26-P2639_1152303:284-nf] For thus we gather that, on coming to the sepulchre, they were twice addressed by the angels; and, again, that they were also twice addressed by the Lord Himself, namely, at the point at which Mary took Him to be the gardener, and a second time at present, when He meets them on the way, with a view to strengthen them by such a repetition, and to bring them out of their state of fear. \"Then, accordingly, said He unto them, Be not afraid: go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.\"[fn-26-P2640_1152847:285-nf] \"Then came Mary Magdalene, and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her;\"[fn-26-P2641_1152992:286-nf] -not herself alone, however, but with her also those other women to whom Luke alludes when he says, \"Which told these things unto the eleven disciples, and all the rest. And their words seemed to them like madness, and they believed them not.\"[fn-26-P2642_1153262:287-nf] Mark also attests these facts; for, after telling us how the women went out from the sepulchre, trembling and amazed, and said nothing to any man, he subjoins the statement, that the Lord rose early the first day of the week, and appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils, and that she went and told them who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept, and that they, when they heard that He was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.[fn-26-P2643_1153876:288-nf] It is further to be observed, that Matthew has also introduced a notice to the effect that, as the women who had seen and heard all these things were going away, there came likewise into the city some of the guards who had been lying like dead men, and that these persons reported to the chief priests all the things that were done, that is to say, those of them which they were themselves also in a position to observe. He tells us, moreover, that when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, and bade them say that His disciples came and stole Him away while they slept, promising at the same time to secure them against the governor, who had given those guards. Finally, he adds that they took the money, and did as they had been taught, and that this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.[fn-26-P2644_1154779:289-nf] ","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":18,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":26,"source_paragraph":"122","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"69.

Luke next proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: \"And as they thus spake, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you: it is I; be not afraid.[fn-26-P2673_1173657:311-nf] But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.

It runs thus: \"And He said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me. Then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.

Finally, as regards the fact that John states that the Apostle Thomas was not present with these others on the occasion under review, whereas, according to Luke, the two disciples, of whom Cleophas was one, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven assembled and those who were with them, it admits of little doubt that we must suppose Thomas simply to have left the company before the Lord showed Himself to the brethren when they were talking in the terms noticed above.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"128","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"74.

This being the case, John now records a second manifestation of Himself, which was vouchsafed by the Lord to the disciples eight days after, on which occasion Thomas also was present, who had not seen Him up to that time. The narrative proceeds thus: \"And after eight days again His disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith He to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. Thomas answered and said unto Him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto Him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\"[fn-26-P2683_1178904:320-nf] This second appearance of the Lord among the disciples-that is to say, the appearance which John records in the second instance-we might also recognise as alluded to by Mark in a section concisely disposing of it, according to that evangelist's habit. A difficulty, however, is created by the circumstance that his terms are these: \"Lastly,[fn-26-P2684_1179268:321-nf] He appeared unto those eleven as they sat at meat.\"[fn-26-P2685_1179406:322-nf] The difficulty does not lie in the mere fact that John says nothing about their sitting at meat, for he might well have omitted that; but it does rest in the use of the word \"lastly,\" for that makes it seem as if He did not show Himself to them after that occasion, whereas John still proceeds to record a third appearance of the Lord by the sea of Tiberias. And then we have to keep in view the fact that the same Mark tells us how Jesus \"upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen Him after He was risen.\" In these words he refers to the two disciples to whom He appeared after He was risen, as they went toward a country-seat, and to Peter, to whom the examination of Luke's narrative has shown us that He manifested Himself first of all [among the apostles],-perhaps also to Mary Magdalene, and those other women who were along with her on the occasion when He was seen by them at the sepulchre, and again when He met them as they were returning on the way. For the said Mark has constructed his record in a manner which leads him first to insert his brief notice of the two disciples to whom He appeared as they went toward the country-seat, and of their giving a report to the residue and obtaining no credit, and then to subjoin in the immediate connection this statement: \"Lastly, He appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen Him after He was risen.\" How, then, is this phrase \"lastly\" used, as if they did not see Him subsequently to this occasion? For the last time that the apostles saw the Lord upon the earth was really the time when He ascended into heaven, and that event took place on the fortieth day after His resurrection. Now, is it likely that He would upbraid them at that period on the ground that they had not believed those who had seen Him after He was risen, when by that time they had seen Him themselves so often after His resurrection, and especially when they had seen Him on the very day of His resurrection,-that is to say, on the first day of the week, when it was now about night, as Luke and John record? It remains for us, therefore, to suppose that, in the passage under review, it was Mark's intention to give a statement, in his own concise fashion, simply on the subject of the said day of the Lord's resurrection; that is to say, that first day of the week on which Mary and the other women who were along with her saw Him after daybreak, on which also Peter beheld Him, on which likewise He appeared to the two disciples, of whom Cleophas was one, and to whom Mark himself also seems to refer; on which, further, when it was now about night, He showed Himself to the eleven (Thomas, however, being excepted) and those who were with them; and on which, finally, the persons already instanced reported to the disciples the things which they had seen. Hence it is that he has employed the term \"lastly,\" because the incident mentioned was the last that took place on this same day. For the night was now coming on by the time that the two disciples had returned from the place where they had recognised Him in the breaking of bread, and had made their way into Jerusalem and found the eleven, as Luke tells us, and those who were with them, speaking to each other about the Lord's resurrection and about His having appeared to Peter; to whom these two also related what had occurred on the way, and how they came to know Him in the breaking of bread. But, assuredly, there were also there some who did not believe. Hence we see the truth of Mark's words, \"Neither believed they them.\" When these, therefore, were now sitting at meat, as Mark informs us, and when they were talking of these subjects, as Luke tells us, the Lord stood in their midst, and said unto them, \"Peace be unto you,\" as Luke and John both record. Moreover, the doors were shut when He entered among them, as John alone mentions.

For if by the \"breath\" the Holy Ghost could not be signified, the Lord would not, when He \"breathed upon\" His disciples after His resurrection, have said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-45-P4515_1725186:13-nf] Nor would it have been thus written in the Acts of the Apostles, \"Suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as if a mighty breath were borne in upon them; and there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-45-P4516_1725497:14-nf] Suppose, now, that it was this which the prophet foretold in the words, \"who giveth breath unto the people upon it;\" and then, as an exposition of what he had designated \"breath,\" he went on to say, \"and spirit to them that walk over it.\" Surely this prediction was most manifestly fulfilled when they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. If, however, the term \"people\" is not yet applicable to the one hundred and twenty persons who were then assembled together in one place, at all events, when the number of believers amounted to four or five thousand, who when they were baptized received the Holy Ghost,[fn-45-P4517_1726123:15-nf] can any doubt that the recipients of the Holy Ghost were then \"the people,\" even \"the men walking in the earth\"? For that spirit which is given to man as appertaining to his nature, whether it be given by propagation or be inbreathed as something new to individuals (and I do not determine which of these two modes ought to be affirmed, at least until one of the two can be clearly ascertained beyond a doubt), is not given to men when they \"walk over the earth,\" but whilst they are still shut up in their mother's womb. \"He gave breath, therefore, to the people upon the earth, and spirit to them that walk over it,\" when many became believers together, and were together filled with the Holy Ghost. And He gives Him to His people, although not to all at the same time, but to every one in His own time, until, by departing from this life, and by coming into it, the entire number of His people be fulfilled. In this passage of Holy Scripture, therefore, breath is not one thing, and spirit another thing; but there is a repetition of one and the same idea. Just as \"He that sitteth in the heavens\" is not one, and \"the Lord\" is not another; nor, again, is it one thing \"to laugh,\" and another thing \"to hold in derision;\" but there is only a repetition of the same meaning in the passage where we read, \"He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.\"[fn-45-P4518_1727532:16-nf] So, in precisely the same manner, in the passage, \"I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession,\"[fn-45-P4519_1727709:17-nf] it is certainly not meant that \"inheritance\" is one thing, and \"possession\" another thing; nor that \"the heathen\" means one thing, and \"the uttermost parts of the earth\" another; there is only a repetition of the self-same thing.

And I will strengthen them in the Lord their God, and in His name shall they glory, saith the Lord.\"[fn-81-P8193_2713738:159-nf] Moreover, in Hosea the Lord saith: \"I will not do according to the anger of mine indignation, I will not allow Ephraim to be destroyed: for I am God, and there is not a holy man in thee: and I will not enter into the city; I will go after God.\"[fn-81-P8194_2714007:160-nf] Also in the forty-fourth Psalm: \"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity: wherefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.\"[fn-81-P8195_2714303:161-nf] So, too, in the forty-fifth Psalm: \"Be still, and know that I am God.

Thomas answered and said unto Him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed.\"[fn-82-P8200_2715240:166-nf] Also Paul to the Romans: \"I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren and my kindred according to the flesh: who are Israel-ires: whose are the adoption, and the glory, and the covenant, and the appointment of the law, and the service (of God), and the promises; whose are the fathers, of whom, according to the flesh, Christ came, who is God over all, blessed for evermore.\"[fn-82-P8201_2715664:167-nf] Also in the Apocalypse: \"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end I will give to him that is athirst, of the fountain of living water freely. He that overcometh shall possess these things, and their inheritance; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.\"[fn-82-P8202_2715953:168-nf] Also in the eighty-first Psalm: \"God stood in the congregation of gods, and judging gods in the midst.\"[fn-82-P8203_2716080:169-nf] And again in the same place: \"I have said, Ye are gods; and ye are all the children of the Highest: but ye shall die like men.\"[fn-82-P8204_2716230:170-nf] But if they who have been righteous, and have obeyed the divine precepts, may be called gods, how much more is Christ, the Son of God, God! Thus He Himself says in the Gospel according to John: \"Is it not written in the law, that I said, Ye are gods? If He called them gods to whom the word of God was given, and the Scripture cannot be relaxed, do ye say to Him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, that thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?

Man, undoubtedly. The entire man, or only a part of him? The whole man, of course. In fact, since the transgression which caused man's ruin was committed quite as much by the instigation of the soul from concupiscence as by the action of the flesh from actual fruition, it has marked the entire man with the sentence of transgression, and has therefore made him deservedly amenable to perdition. So that he will be wholly saved, since he has by sinning been wholly lost. Unless it be true that the sheep (of the parable) is a\" lost\" one, irrespective of its body; then its recovery may be effected without the body. Since, however, it is the bodily substance as well as the soul, making up the entire animal, which was carried on the shoulders of the Good Shepherd, we have here unquestionably an example how man is restored in both his natures. Else how unworthy it were of God to bring only a moiety of man to salvation-and almost less than that; whereas the munificence of princes of this world always claims for itself the merit of a plenary grace! Then must the devil be understood to be stronger for injuring man, ruining him wholly? and must God have the character of comparative weakness, since He does not relieve and help man in his entire state? The apostle, however, suggests that \"where sin abounded, there has grace much more abounded.\"[fn-100-P10005_2774976:224-nf] How, in fact, can he be regarded as saved, who can at the same time be said to be lost-lost, that is, in the flesh, but saved as to his soul? Unless, indeed, their argument now makes it necessary that the soul should be placed in a \"lost\" condition, that it may be susceptible of salvation, on the ground that is properly saved which has been lost. We, however, so understand the soul's immortality as to believe it \"lost,\" not in the sense of destruction, but of punishment, that is, in hell. And if this is the case, then it is not the soul which salvation will affect, since it is \"safe\"already in its own nature by reason of its immortality, but rather the flesh, which, as all readily allow, is subject to destruction. Else, if the soul is also perishable (in this sense), in other words, not immortal-the condition of the flesh-then this same condition ought in all fairness to benefit the flesh also, as being similarly mortal and perishable, since that which perishes the Lord purposes to save. I do not care now to follow the clue of our discussion, so far as to consider whether it is in one of his natures or in the other that perdition puts in its claim on man, provided that salvation is equally distributed over the two substances, and makes him its aim in respect of them both. For observe, in which substance so-ever you assume man to have perished, in the other be does not perish. He will therefore be saved in the substance in which he does not perish, and yet obtain salvation in that in which he does perish. You have (then) the restoration of the entire man, inasmuch as the Lord purposes to save that part of him which perishes, whilst he will not of course lose that portion which cannot be lost, Who will any longer doubt of the safety of both natures, when one of them is to obtain salvation, and the other is not to lose it? And, still further, the Lord explains to us the meaning of the thing when He says: \"I came not to do my own will, but the Father's, who hath sent me.\"[fn-100-P10006_2776999:225-nf] What, I ask, is that will? \"That of all which He hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.\"[fn-100-P10007_2777152:226-nf] Now, what had Christ received of the Father but that which He had Himself put on? Man, of course, in his texture of flesh and soul. Neither, therefore, of those parts which He has received will He allow to perish; nay, no considerable portion-nay, not the least fraction, of either. If the flesh be, as our opponents slightingly think, but a poor fraction, then the flesh is safe, because not a fraction of man is to perish; and no larger portion is in danger, because every portion of man is in equally safe keeping with Him. If, however, He will not raise the flesh also up at the last day, then He will permit not only a fraction of man to perish, but (as I will venture to say, in consideration of so important a part) almost the whole of him.But when He repeats His words with increased emphasis, \"And this is the Father's will, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day,\"[fn-100-P10008_2778125:227-nf] -He asserts the full extent of the resurrection. For He assigns to each several nature that reward which is suited to its services: both to the flesh, for by it the Son was \"seen; \"and to the soul, for by it He was \"believed on.\" Then, you will say, to them was this promise given by whom Christ was \"seen.\" Well, be it so; only let the same hope flow on from them to us! For if to them who saw, and therefore believed, such fruit then accrued to the operations of the flesh and the soul, how much more to us! For more \"blessed,\" says Christ, \"are they who have not seen, and yet have believed; \"[fn-100-P10009_2778738:228-nf] since, even if the resurrection of the flesh must be denied to them, it must at any rate be a fitting boon to us, who are the more blessed.

And first of all there comes at once to hand the preamble of John to his Gospel, which shows us what He previously was who had to become flesh. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-106-P10683_3001318:243-nf] Now, since these words may not be taken otherwise than as they are written, there is without doubt shown to be One who was from the beginning, and also One with whom He always was: one the Word of God, the other God although the Word is also God, but God regarded as the Son of God, not as the Father); One through whom were all things, Another by whom were all things. But in what sense we call Him Another we have already often described. In that we called Him Another, we must needs imply that He is not identical-not identical indeed, yet not as if separate; Other by dispensation, not by division. He, therefore, who became flesh was not the very same as He from whom the Word came. \"His glory was beheld-the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father;\"[fn-106-P10684_3002098:244-nf] not, (observe, ) as of the Father. He \"declared\" (what was in) \"the bosom of the Father alone; \"[fn-106-P10685_3002214:245-nf] the Father did not divulge the secrets of His own bosom. For this is preceded by another statement: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-106-P10686_3002449:246-nf] Then, again, when He is designated by John (the Baptist) as \"the Lamb of God,\"[fn-106-P10687_3002561:247-nf] He is not described as Himself the same with Him of whom He is the beloved Son. He is, no doubt, ever the Son of God, but yet not He Himself of whom He is the Son. This (divine relationship) Nathanµl at once recognised in Him,[fn-106-P10688_3002807:248-nf] even as Peter did on another occasion: \"Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-106-P10689_3002892:249-nf] And He affirmed Himself that they were quite right in their convictions; for He answered Nathanµl: \"Because I said, I saw thee under the fig-tree, therefore dose thou believe?\"[fn-106-P10690_3003091:250-nf] And in the same manner He pronounced Peter to be \"blessed,\" inasmuch as \"flesh and blood had not revealed it to him\"-that he had perceived the Father-\"but the Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-106-P10691_3003297:251-nf] By asserting all this, He determined the distinction which is between the two Persons: that is, the Son then on earth, whom Peter had confessed to be the Son of God; and the Father in heaven, who had revealed to Peter the discovery which he had made, that Christ was the Son of God. When He entered the temple, He called it \"His Father's house,\"[fn-106-P10692_3003666:252-nf] speaking as the Son. In His address to Nicodemus He says: \"So God loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"[fn-106-P10693_3003884:253-nf] And again: \"For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He that believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.\"[fn-106-P10694_3004192:254-nf] Moreover, when John (the Baptist) was asked what he happened to know of Jesus, he said: \"The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.\"[fn-106-P10695_3004518:255-nf] Whom, indeed, did He reveal to the woman of Samaria? Was it not \"the Messias which is called Christ? \"[fn-106-P10696_3004646:256-nf] And so lie showed, of course, that He was not the Father, but the Son; and elsewhere He is expressly called \"the Christ, the Son of God,\"[fn-106-P10697_3004804:257-nf] and not the Father. He says, therefore,\" My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work; \"[fn-106-P10698_3004938:258-nf] whilst to the Jews He remarks respecting the cure of the impotent man, \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\"[fn-106-P10699_3005071:259-nf] \"My Father and I\"-these are the Son's words. And it was on this very account that \"the Jews sought the more intently to kill Him, not only because He broke the Sabbath, but also because He said that God was His Father, thus making Himself equal with God. Then indeed did He answer and say unto them, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do; for what things soever He doeth these also doeth the Son likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that He Himself doeth; and He will also show Him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son also quickeneth whom He will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son, that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent the Son. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my words, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. Verily I say unto you, that the hour is coming, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and when they have heard it, they shall live. For as the Father hath eternal life in Himself, so also hath He given to the Son to have eternal life in Himself; and He hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man\"[fn-107-P10700_3006548:260-nf] -that is, according to the flesh, even as He is also the Son of God through His Spirit.[fn-107-P10701_3006658:261-nf] Afterwards He goes on to say: \"But I have greater witness than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to finish-those very works bear witness of me that the Father hath sent me. And the Father Himself, which hath sent me, hath also borne witness of me.\"[fn-107-P10702_3006963:262-nf] But He at once adds, \"Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape; \"[fn-107-P10703_3007075:263-nf] thus affirming that in former times it was not the Father, but the Son, who used to be seen and heard. Then He says at last: \"I am come in my Father's name, and ye have not received me.\"[fn-107-P10704_3007278:264-nf] It was therefore always the Son (of whom we read) under the designation of the Almighty and Most High God, and King, and Lord. To those also who inquired \"what they should do to work the works of God,\"[fn-107-P10705_3007496:265-nf] He answered, \"This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.\"[fn-107-P10706_3007598:266-nf] He also declares Himself to be \"the bread which the Father sent from heaven; \"[fn-107-P10707_3007693:267-nf] and adds, that \"all that the Father gave Him should come to Him, and that He Himself would not reject them,[fn-107-P10708_3007817:268-nf] because He had come down from heaven not to do His own will, but the will of the Father; and that the will of the Father was that every one who saw the Son, and believed on Him, should obtain the life (everlasting, ) and the resurrection at the last day. No man indeed was able to come to Him, except the Father attracted him; whereas every one who had heard and learnt of the Father came to Him.\"[fn-107-P10709_3008287:269-nf] He goes on then expressly to say, \"Not that any man hath seen the Father; \"[fn-107-P10710_3008386:270-nf] thus showing us that it was through the Word of the Father that men were instructed and taught. Then, when many departed from Him,[fn-107-P10711_3008534:271-nf] and He turned to the apostles with the inquiry whether \"they also would go away,\"[fn-107-P10712_3008632:272-nf] what was Simon Peter's answer? \"To whom shall we go?

Suppose now that by some means Jesus were also called Vestitus (Clothed), as He is actually called Christ from the mystery of His anointing, would you in like manner say that Jesus was the Son of God, and at the same time suppose that Vestitus was the Father? Now then, concerning Christ, if Christ is the Father, the Father is an Anointed One, and receives the unction of course from another. Else if it is from Himself that He receives it, then you must prove it to us. But we learn no such fact from the Acts of the Apostles in that ejaculation of the Church to God, \"Of a truth, Lord, against Thy Holy Child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together.\"[fn-108-P10857_3048785:396-nf] These then testified both that Jesus was the Son of God, and that being the Son, He was anointed by the Father. Christ therefore must be the same as Jesus who was anointed by the Father, and not the Father, who anointed the Son. To the same effect are the words of Peter: \"Let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ,\" that is, Anointed.[fn-108-P10858_3049223:397-nf] John, moreover, brands that man as \"a liar\" who \"denieth that Jesus is the Christ; \"whilst on the other hand he declares that \"every one is born of God who believeth that Jesus is the Christ.\"[fn-108-P10859_3049436:398-nf] Wherefore he also exhorts us to believe in the name of His (the Father's, ) Son Jesus Christ, that \"our fellowship may be with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.\"[fn-108-P10860_3049653:399-nf] Paul, in like manner, everywhere speaks of \"God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.\" When writing to the Romans, he gives thanks to God through our Lord Jesus Christ.[fn-108-P10861_3049843:400-nf] To the Galatians he declares himself to be \"an apostle not of men, neither by man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father.\"[fn-108-P10862_3049990:401-nf] You possess indeed all his writings, which testify plainly to the same effect, and set forth Two-God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father.

For precisely by the same right as both names belong to the same Person, even the Son of God, does either name alone without the other belong to the same Person. Consequently, whether it be the name Jesus which occurs alone, Christ is also understood, because Jesus is the Anointed One; or if the name Christ is the only one given, then Jesus is identified with Him, because the Anointed One is Jesus. Now, of these two names Jesus Christ, the former is the proper one, which was given to Him by the angel; and the latter is only an adjunct, predicable of Him from His anointing,-thussuggesting the proviso that Christ must be the Son, not the Father. How blind, to be sure, is the man who fails to perceive that by the name of Christ some other God is implied, if he ascribes to the Father this name of Christ! For if Christ is God the Father, when He says, \"I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God,\"[fn-108-P10863_3051210:402-nf] He of course shows plainly enough that there is above Himself another Father and another God.

But these bear the surname of the rock just as Christ does. But also as members of Christ deriving their surname from Him they are called Christians, and from the rock, Peters. And taking occasion from these things you will say that the righteous bear the surname of Christ who is Righteousness, and the wise of Christ who is Wisdom.[fn-79-P7919_1683128:79-nf] And so in regard to all His other names, you will apply them by way of surname to the saints; and to all such the saying of the Saviour might be spoken, \"Thou art Peter,\" etc., down to the words, \"prevail against it.\" But what is the \"it\"?

However, it was better that He should be, as He actually was, born of a virgin, and, by His condescension, do honor to both sexes, for whose deliverance He was to die, by taking a man's body born of a woman. In this He testifies emphatically against you, and refutes your doctrine, which makes the sexes the work of the devil. What we call sorcery in your doctrine is your making Christ's passion and death to have been only in appearance, so that, by a spectral illusion, He seemed to die when He did not. Hence you must also make His resurrection spectral and illusory and false; for if there was no true death, there could not be a real resurrection.

The fact that Christ's body was the only one born of a virgin does not prove that there was sorcery in His birth, any more than there is sorcery in its being the only body to rise again on the third day, never to die any more. Will you say that there was sorcery in all the Lord's miracles because they were unusual? They really happened, and their appearance, as seen by men, was true, and not an illusion; and when they are said to be contrary to nature, it is not that they oppose nature, but that they transcend the method of nature to which we are accustomed. May God keep the minds of His people who are still babes in Christ from being influenced by Faustus, when he recommends as a duty that we should acknowledge Christ's birth to have been illusory and not real, that so we may end our dispute!

Who, then, is not amazed at the exceeding majesty of the Holy Spirit, when he hears that he who speaks a word against the Son of man may hope for forgiveness; but that he who is guilty of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit has not forgiveness, either in the present world or in that which is to come![fn-63-P6338_1158471:62-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":20,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_45_book_i_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"ANF-04","text":"7. But if this is to be understood as spoken of the Spirit of God, since Adam also is found to have prophesied of some things, it may be taken not as of general application, but as confined to those who are saints. Finally, also, at the time of the flood, when all flesh had corrupter their way before God, it is recorded that God spoke thus, as of undeserving men and sinners: \"My Spirit shall not abide with those men for ever, because they are flesh.\"[fn-63-P6361_1168520:80-nf] By which, it is clearly shown that the Spirit of God is taken away from all who are unworthy. In the Psalms also it is written: \"Thou wilt take away their spirit, and they will die, and return to their earth. Thou wilt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and Thou wilt renew the face of the earth; \"[fn-63-P6362_1168851:81-nf] which is manifestly intended of the Holy Spirit, who, after sinners and unworthy persons have been taken away and destroyed, creates for Himself a new people, and renews the face of the earth, when, laying aside, through the grace of the Spirit, the old map with his deeds, they begin to walk in newness of life. And therefore the expression is competently applied to the Holy Spirit, because He will take up His dwelling, not in all men, nor in those who are flesh, but in those whose land[fn-63-P6363_1169364:82-nf] has been renewed. Lastly, for this reason was the grace and revelation of the Holy Spirit bestowed by the imposition of the apostles' hands after baptism. Our Saviour also, after the resurrection, when old things had already passed away, and all things had become new, Himself a new man, and the first-born from the dead, His apostles also being renewed by faith in His resurrection, says, \"Receive the Holy Spirit; \"[fn-63-P6364_1169794:83-nf] This is doubtless what the Lord the Saviour meant to convey in the Gospel, when He said that new wine cannot be put into old bottles, but commanded that the bottles should be made new, i.e., that men should walk in newness of life, that they might receive the new wine, i.e., the newness of grace of the Holy Spirit. In this manner, then, is the working of the power of God the Father and of the Son extended without distinction to every creature; but a share in the Holy Spirit we find possessed only by the saints. And therefore it is said, \"No man can say that Jesus is Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-63-P6365_1170415:84-nf] And on one occasion, scarcely even the apostles themselves are deemed worthy to hear the words, \"Ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you.\"[fn-63-P6366_1170595:85-nf] For this reason, also, I think it follows that he who has committed a sin against the Son of man is deserving of forgiveness; because if he who is a participator of the word or reason of God cease to live agreeably to reason, he seems to have fallen into a state of ignorance or folly, and therefore to deserve forgiveness; whereas he who has been deemed worthy to have a portion of the Holy Spirit, and who has relapsed, is, by this very act and work, said to be guilty of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Let no one indeed suppose that we, from having said that the Holy Spirit is conferred upon the saints alone, but that the benefits or operations of the Father and of the Son extend to good and bad, to just and unjust, by so doing give a preference to the Holy Spirit over the Father and the Son, or assert that His dignity is greater, which certainly would be a very illogical conclusion. For it is the peculiarity of His grace and operations that we have been describing. Moreover, nothing in the Trinity can be called greater or less, since the fountain of divinity alone contains all things by His word and reason, and by the Spirit of His mouth sanctifies all things which are worthy of sanctification, as it is written in the Psalm: \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens strengthened, and all their power by the Spirit of His mouth.\"[fn-63-P6367_1171964:86-nf] There is also a special working of God the Father, besides that by which He bestowed upon all things the gift of natural life. There is also a special ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ to those upon whom he confers by nature the gift of reason, by means of which they are enabled to be rightly what they are. There is also another grace of the Holy Spirit, which is bestowed upon the deserving, through the ministry of Christ and the working of the Father, in proportion to the merits of those who are rendered capable of receiving it. This is most clearly pointed out by the Apostle Paul, when demonstrating that the power of the Trinity is one and the same, in the words, \"There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit; there are diversities of administrations, but the same Lord; and there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit: withal.\"[fn-63-P6368_1172939:87-nf] From which it most clearly follows that there is no difference in the Trinity, but that which is called the gift of the Spirit is made known through the Son, and operated by God the Father. \"But all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every one severally as He will.\"[fn-63-P6369_1173254:88-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":20,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_132_homily_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"3. \"And we are witnesses, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us:\" i.e., manifested among us: which might be more plainly expressed, manifested to us. \"The things,\" therefore, \"which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you.\"[fn-39-P3972_2187192:13-nf] Those saw the Lord Himself present in the flesh, and heard words from the mouth of the Lord, and told them to us.

And the Lord, to console us who, now that He sitteth in heaven, cannot touch Him with the hand, but only reach Him with faith, said to him, \"Because thou hast seen, thou hast believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet believe. We are here described, we designated. Then let the blessedness take place in us, of which the Lord predicted that it should take place; let us firmly hold that which we see not; because those tell us who have seen. \"That ye also,\" saith he, \"may have fellowship with us.\" And what great matter is it to have fellowship with men?

Then why doth He forbid Mary, and saith, \"Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to the Father?\" Or are we to say, that He feared not to be touched by men, and feared to be touched by women? The touch of Him cleanseth all flesh. To whom He willed first to be manifested, by them feared He to be handled? Was not His resurrection announced by women to the men, that so the serpent should by a sort of counterplot be overcome? For because he first by the woman announced death to man, therefore to men was also life announced by a woman. Then why was He unwilling to be touched, but because He would have it to be understood of that spiritual touch? The spiritual touch takes place from a pure heart. That person does of a pure heart reach Christ with his touch who understands Him coequal with the Father. But whoso does not yet understand Christ's Godhead, that person reaches but unto the flesh, reaches not unto the Godhead. Now what great matter is it, to reach only unto that which the persecutors reached unto, who crucified Him? But that is the great thing, to understand the Word God with God, in the beginning, by whom all things were made: such as He would have Himself to be known when He said to Philip, \"Am I so long time with you, and have ye not known me, Philip?

And therefore in the one nature the power of human weakness, in the other the power of divine majesty is exhibited.

But as for such as are unmarried, it is the extremest scandal for them to be present at a banquet of men, especially men under the influence of wine. And let the men, fixing their eyes on the couch, and leaning without moving on their elbows, be present with their ears alone; and if they sit, let them not have their feet crossed, nor place one thigh on another, nor apply the hand to the chin. For it is vulgar not to bear one's self without support, and consequently a fault in a young man. And perpetually moving and changing one's position is a sign of frivolousness. It is the part of a temperate man also, in eating and drinking, to take a small portion, and deliberately, not eagerly, both at the beginning and during the courses and to leave off betimes, and so show his indifference. \"Eat,\" it is said, \"like a man what is set before you. Be the first to stop for the sake of regimen; and, if seated in the midst of several people, do not stretch out your hand before them.\"[fn-39-P3940_1202362:140-nf] You must never rush forward under the influence of gluttony; nor must you, though desirous, reach out your hand till some time, in as much as by greed one shows an uncontrolled appetite. Nor are you, in the midst of the repast, to exhibit yourselves hugging your food like wild beasts; nor helping yourselves to too much sauce, for man is not by nature a sauce-consumer, but a bread-eater. A temperate man, too, must rise before the general company, and retire quietly from the banquet. \"For at the time for rising,\" it is said, \"be not the last; haste home.\"[fn-39-P3941_1202950:141-nf] The twelve, having called together the multitude of the disciples, said, \"It is not meet for us to leave the word of God and serve tables.\"[fn-39-P3942_1203116:142-nf] If they avoided this, much more did they shun gluttony. And the apostles themselves, writing to the brethren at Antioch, and in Syria and Cilicia, said: \"It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no other burden than these necessary things, to abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication, from which, if you keep yourselves, ye shall do well.\"[fn-39-P3943_1203557:143-nf] But we must guard against drunkenness as against hemlock; for both drag down to death. We must also check excessive laughter and immoderate tears. For often people under the influence of wine, after laughing immoderately, then are, I know not how, by some impulse of intoxication moved to tears; for both effiminacy and violence are discordant with the word. And elderly people, looking on the young as children, may, though but very rarely, be playful with them, joking with them to train them in good behaviour. For example, before a bashful and silent youth, one might by way of pleasantry speak thus: \"This son of mine (I mean one who is silent) is perpetually talking.\" For a joke such as this enhances the youth's modesty, by showing the good qualities that belong to him playfully, by censure of the bad quantities, which do not. For this device is instructive, confirming as it does what is present by what is not present. Such, certainly, is the intention of him who says that a water-drinker and a sober man gets intoxicated and drunk. But if there are those who like to jest at people, we must be silent, and dispense with superfluous words like full cups. For such sport is dangerous. \"The mouth of the impetuous approaches to contrition.\"[fn-39-P3944_1204837:144-nf] \"Thou shalt not receive a foolish report, nor shall thou agree with an unjust person to be an unjust witness,\"[fn-39-P3945_1204968:145-nf] neither in calumnies nor in injurious speeches, much less evil practices. I also should think it right to impose a limit on the speech of rightly regulated persons, who are impelled to speak to one who maintains a conversation with them. \"For silence is the excellence of women, and the safe prize of the young; but good speech is characteristic of experienced, mature age. Speak, old man, at a banquet, for it is becoming to you. But speak without embarrassment, and with accuracy of knowledge. Youth, Wisdom also commands thee. Speak, if you must, with hesitation, on being twice asked; sum up your discourse in a few words.\"[fn-39-P3946_1205633:146-nf] But let both speakers regulate their discourse according to just proportion. For loudness of utterance is most insane; while an inaudible utterance is characteristic of a senseless man, for people will not hear: the one is the mark of pusillanimity, the other of arrogance. Let contentiousness in words, for the sake of a useless triumph, be banished; for our aim is to be free from perturbation. Such is the meaning of the phrase,[fn-39-P3947_1206097:147-nf] \"Peace to thee.\" Answer not a word before you hear. An enervated voice is the sign of effeminacy. But modulation in the voice is characteristic of a wise man, who keeps his utterance from loudness, from drawling, from rapidity, from prolixity. For we ought not to speak long or much, nor ought we to speak frivolously. Nor must we converse rapidly and rashly. For the voice itself, so to speak, ought to receive its just dues; and those who are vociferous and clamorous ought to be silenced.

For He it is who \"as a bride-groom goeth forth from his bride-chamber; He exulted as a giant to run his way. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and His return unto the ends of it.\"[fn-102-P10217_3185294:88-nf] Because, even to the highest, \"not any one hath ascended into heaven save He who came down from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.\"[fn-102-P10218_3185452:89-nf] Repeating this same thing, He says: \"Father, glorify me with that glory wherewith I was with Thee before the world was.\"[fn-102-P10219_3185593:90-nf] And if this Word came down from heaven as a bridegroom to the flesh, that by the assumption of flesh He might ascend thither as the Son of man, whence the Son of God had descended as the Word, reasonably, while by the mutual connection both flesh wears the Word of God, and the Son of God assumes the frailty of the flesh; when the flesh being espoused ascending thither, whence without the flesh it had descended, it at length receives that glory which in being shown to have had before the foundation of the world, it is most manifestly proved. to be God. And, nevertheless, while the world itself is said to have been founded after Him, it is found to have been created by Him; by that very divinity in Him whereby, the world was made, both His glory and His authority are proved. Moreover, if, whereas it is the property of none but God to know the secrets of the heart, Christ beholds the secrets of the heart; and if, whereas it belongs to none but God to remit sins, the same Christ remits sins; and if, whereas it is the portion of no man to come from heaven, He descended by coming from heaven; and if, whereas this word can be true of no man, \"I and the Father are one,\"[fn-102-P10220_3186818:91-nf] Christ alone declared this word out of the consciousness of His divinity; and if, finally, the Apostle Thomas, instructed in all the proofs and conditions of Christ's divinity, says in reply to Christ, \"My Lord and my God; \"[fn-102-P10221_3187061:92-nf] and if, besides, the Apostle Paul says, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom Christ came according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for evermore,\"[fn-102-P10222_3187236:93-nf] writing in his epistles; and if the same apostle declares that he was ordained \"an apostle not by men, nor of man, but by Jesus Christ; \"[fn-102-P10223_3187392:94-nf] and if the same contends that he learned the Gospel not from men or by man, but received it from Jesus Christ, reasonably Christ is God.

For since it is evident that all things were made by Christ, He is either before all things, since all things were by Him, and so He is justly God; or because He is man He is subsequent to all things, and justly nothing was made by Him. But we cannot say that nothing was made by Him, when we observe it written that all things were made by Him. He is not therefore subsequent to all things; that is, He is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since God is prior to all things. For He is before all things, because all things are by Him, while if He were only man, nothing would be by Him; or if all things were by Him, He would not be man only, because if He were only man, all things would not be by Him; nay, nothing would be by Him. What, then, do they reply? That nothing is by Him, so that He is man only? How then are all things by Him? Therefore He is not man only, but God also, since all things are by Him; so that we reasonably ought to understand that Christ is not man only, who is subsequent to all things, but God also, since by Him all things were made.

For the former deserved to be accused, because they had contemned the law; and they of the Gentiles who believe deserve to be aided by the defence of the Spirit, because they earnestly desire to attain to the Gospel law. Assuredly in the Spirit there are different kinds of offices, because in the times there is a different order of occasions; and yet, on this account, He who discharges these offices is not different, nor is He another in so acting, but He is one and the same, distributing His offices according to the times, and the occasions and impulses of things. Moreover, the Apostle Paul says, \"Having the same Spirit; as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-104-P10424_3282722:246-nf] He is therefore one and the same Spirit who was in the prophets and apostles, except that in the former He was occasional, in the latter always.

For this is He who strengthened their hearts and minds, who marked out the Gospel sacraments, who was in them the enlightener of divine things; and they being strengthened, feared, for the sake of the Lord's name, neither dungeons nor chains, nay, even trod under foot the very powers of the world and its tortures, since they were henceforth armed and strengthened by the same Spirit, having in themselves the gifts which this same Spirit distributes, and appropriates to the Church, the spouse of Christ, as her ornaments. This is He who places prophets in the Church, instructs teachers, directs tongues, gives powers and healings, does wonderful works, often discrimination of spirits, affords powers of government, suggests counsels, and orders and arranges whatever other gifts there are of charismata; and thus make the Lord's Church everywhere, and in all, perfected and completed. This is He who, after the manner of a dove, when our Lord was baptized, came and abode upon Him, dwelling in Christ full and entire, and not maimed in any measure or portion; but with His whole overflow copiously distributed and sent forth, so that from Him others might receive some enjoyment of His graces: the source of the entire Holy Spirit remaining in Christ, so that from Him might be drawn streams of gifts and works, while the Holy Spirit dwelt affluently in Christ. For truly Isaiah, prophesying this, said: \"And the Spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and piety; and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-104-P10430_3285641:252-nf] This self-same thing also he said in the person of the Lord Himself, in another place, ' \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because He has anointed me, He has sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor.\"[fn-104-P10431_3285866:253-nf] Similarly David: \"Wherefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\"[fn-104-P10432_3285998:254-nf] Of Him the Apostle Paul says: \"For he who hath not the Spirit of Christ is none of His.\"[fn-104-P10433_3286107:255-nf] \"And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"[fn-104-P10434_3286186:256-nf] He it is who effects with water the second birth as a certain seed of divine generation, and a consecration of a heavenly nativity, the pledge of a promised inheritance, and as it were a kind of handwriting of eternal salvation; who can make us God's temple, and fit us for His house; who solicits the divine hearing for us with groanings that cannot be uttered; filling the offices of advocacy, and manifesting the duties of our defence,-an inhabitant given for our bodies and an effector of their holiness. Who, working in us for eternity, can also produce our bodies at the resurrection of immortality, accustoming them to be associated in Himself with heavenly power, and to be allied with the divine eternity of the Holy Spirit. For our bodies are both trained in Him and by Him to advance to immortality, by learning to govern themselves with moderation according to His decrees. For this is He who \"desireth against the flesh,\" because \"the flesh resisteth against the Spirit.\"[fn-104-P10435_3287195:257-nf] This is He who restrains insatiable desires, controls immoderate lusts, quenches unlawful fires, conquers reckless impulses, repels drunkenness, checks avarice, drives away luxurious revellings, links love, binds together affections, keeps down sects, orders the rule of truth, overcomes heretics, turns out the wicked, guards the Gospel, Of this says the same apostle: \"We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God.\"[fn-104-P10436_3287665:258-nf] Concerning Him he exultingly says: \"And I think also that I have the Spirit of God.\"[fn-104-P10437_3287773:259-nf] Of Him he says: \"The Spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets.\"[fn-104-P10438_3287870:260-nf] Of Him also he tells: \"Now the Spirit speaketh plainly, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, doctrines of demons, who speak lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience cauterized.\"[fn-104-P10439_3288127:261-nf] Established in this Spirit, \"none ever calleth Jesus anathema; \"[fn-104-P10440_3288214:262-nf] no one has ever denied Christ to be the Son of God, or has rejected God the Creator; no one utters any words of his own contrary to the Scriptures; no one ordains other and sacrilegious decrees; no one draws up different laws.[fn-104-P10441_3288464:263-nf] Whosoever shall blaspheme against Him, \"hath not forgiveness, not only in this world, but also not in the world to come.\"[fn-104-P10442_3288722:264-nf] This is He who in the apostles gives testimony to Christ; in the martyrs shows forth the constant faithfulness of their religion; in virgins restrains the admirable continency of their sealed chastity; in others, guards the laws of the Lord's doctrine incorrupt and uncontaminated; destroys heretics, corrects the perverse, condemns infidels, makes known pretenders; moreover, rebukes the wicked, keeps the Church uncorrupt and inviolate, in the sanctity of a perpetual virginity and truth.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":20,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"98","folder":"ANF-05","text":"And now, indeed, concerning the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, let it be sufficient to have briefly said thus much, and to have laid down these points concisely, without carrying them out in a lengthened argument. For they could be presented more diffusely and continued in a more expanded disputation, since the whole of the Old and New Testaments might be adduced in testimony that thus the true faith stands. But because heretics, ever struggling against the truth, are accustomed to prolong the controversy of pure tradition and Catholic faith, being offended against Christ; because He is, moreover, asserted to be God by the Scriptures also, and this is believed to be so by us; we must rightly-that every heretical calumny may be removed from our faith-contend, concerning the fact that Christ is God also, in such a way as that it may not militate against the truth of Scripture; nor yet against our faith, how there is declared to be one God by the Scriptures, and how it is held and believed by us. For as well they who say that Jesus Christ Himself is God the Father, as moreover they who would have Him to be only man, have gathered thence[fn-104-P10447_3290705:266-nf] the sources and reasons of their error and perversity; because when they perceived that it was written[fn-104-P10448_3290837:267-nf] that \"God is one,\" they thought that they could not otherwise hold such an opinion than by supposing that it must be believed either that Christ was man only, or really God the Father. And they were accustomed in such a way to connect their sophistries as to endeavour to justify their own error. And thus they who say that Jesus Christ is the Father argue as follows:-If God is one, and Christ is God, Christ is the Father, since God is one. If Christ be not the Father, because Christ is God the Son, there appear to be two Gods introduced, contrary to the Scriptures. And they who contend that Christ is man only, conclude on the other hand thus:-If the Father is one, and the Son another, but the Father is God and Christ is God, then there is not one God, but two Gods are at once introduced, the Father and the Son; and if God is one, by consequence Christ must be a man, so that rightly the Father may be one God. Thus indeed the Lord is, as it were, crucified between two thieves,[fn-104-P10449_3291864:268-nf] even as He was formerly placed; and thus from either side He receives the sacrilegious reproaches of such heretics as these. But neither the Holy Scriptures nor we suggest to them the reasons of their perdition and blindness, if they either will not, or cannot, see what is evidently written in the midst of the divine documents. For we both know, and read, and believe, and maintain that God is one, who made the heaven as well as the earth, since we neither know any other, nor shall we at any time know such, seeing that there is none. \"I,\" says He, \"am God, and there is none beside me, righteous and a Saviour.\"[fn-104-P10450_3292598:269-nf] And in another place: \"I am the first and the last, and beside me there is no God who is as I.\"[fn-104-P10451_3292718:270-nf] And, \"Who hath meted out heaven with a Span, and the earth with a handful? Who has suspended the mountains in a balance, and the woods on scales? \"[fn-104-P10452_3292890:271-nf] And Hezekiah: \"That all may know that Thou art God alone.\"[fn-104-P10453_3292970:272-nf] Moreover, the Lord Himself: \"Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? God alone is good.\"[fn-104-P10454_3293094:273-nf] Moreover, the Apostle Paul says: \"Who only hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light that no man can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can see.\"[fn-104-P10455_3293272:274-nf] And in another place: \"But a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.\"[fn-104-P10456_3293376:275-nf] But even as we hold, and read, and believe this, thus we ought to pass over no portion of the heavenly Scriptures, since indeed also we ought by no means to reject those marks of Christ's divinity which are laid down in the Scriptures, that we may not, by corrupting the authority of the Scriptures, be held to have corrupted the integrity of our holy faith. And let us therefore believe this, since it is most faithful that Jesus Christ the Son of God is our Lord and God; because \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God.\"[fn-104-P10457_3294002:276-nf] And, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us.\"[fn-104-P10458_3294072:277-nf] And, \"My Lord and my God.\"[fn-104-P10459_3294119:278-nf] And, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom according to the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for evermore.\"[fn-104-P10460_3294261:279-nf] What, then, shall we say? Does Scripture set before us two Gods? How, then, does it say that \"God is one? \"Or is not Christ God also? How, then, is it said to Christ,\" My Lord and my God? \"Unless, therefore, we hold all this with fitting veneration and lawful argument, we shall reasonably be thought to have furnished a scandal to the heretics, not assuredly by the fault of the heavenly Scriptures, which never deceive; but by the presumption of human error, whereby they have chosen to be heretics. And in the first place, we must turn the attack against them who undertake to make against us the charge of saying that there are two Gods. It is written, and they cannot deny it, that \"there is one Lord.\"[fn-104-P10461_3294989:280-nf] What, then, do they think of Christ?-that He is Lord, or that He is not Lord at all? But they do not doubt absolutely that He is Lord; therefore, if their reasoning be true, here are already two Lords. How, then, is it true according to the Scriptures, there is one Lord? And Christ is called the \"one Master.\"[fn-104-P10462_3295322:281-nf] Nevertheless we read that the Apostle Paul also is a master.[fn-104-P10463_3295410:282-nf] Then, according to this, our Master is not one, for from these things we conclude that there are two masters. How, then, according to the Scriptures, is \"one our Master, even Christ? \"In the Scriptures there is one \"called good, even God; \"but in the same Scriptures Christ is also asserted to be good. There is not, then, if they rightly conclude, one good, but even two good. How, then, according to the scriptural faith, is there said to be only one good? But if they do not think that it can by any means interfere with the truth that there is one Lord, that Christ also is Lord, nor with the truth that one is our. Master, that Paul also is our master, or with the truth that one is good, that Christ also is called good; on the same reasoning, let them understand that, from the fact that God is one, no obstruction arises to the truth that Christ also is declared to be God.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":20,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_44_oration_xxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"27","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"But in opposition to all these, do you reckon up for me the expressions which make for your ignorant arrogance, such as \"My God and your God,\"[fn-44-P4413_1396781:29-nf] or greater, or created, or made, or sanctified;[fn-44-P4414_1396851:30-nf] Add, if you like, Servant[fn-44-P4415_1396923:31-nf] and Obedient[fn-44-P4416_1396954:32-nf] and Gave[fn-44-P4417_1396981:33-nf] and Learnt,[fn-44-P4418_1397010:34-nf] and was commanded,[fn-44-P4419_1397045:35-nf] was sent,[fn-44-P4420_1397081:36-nf] can do nothing of Himself, either say, or judge, or give, or will.[fn-44-P4421_1397176:37-nf] And further these,-His ignorance,[fn-44-P4422_1397230:38-nf] subjection,[fn-44-P4423_1397262:39-nf] prayer,[fn-44-P4424_1397290:40-nf] asking,[fn-44-P4425_1397316:41-nf] increase,[fn-44-P4426_1397345:42-nf] being made perfect.[fn-44-P4427_1397383:43-nf] And if you like even more humble than these; such as speak of His sleeping,[fn-44-P4428_1397480:44-nf] hungering,[fn-44-P4429_1397525:45-nf] being in an agony,[fn-44-P4430_1397574:46-nf] and fearing;[fn-44-P4431_1397607:47-nf] or perhaps you would make even His Cross and Death a matter of reproach to Him.

First then in order to our receiving eternal life which shall be given at the last, there comes to us a gift from God's goodness from the beginning of our faith, to wit, the remission of sins. For while they remain, there remains in some sort enmity against God, and alienation from Him, which comes from what is evil in us; since Scripture does not speak falsely, which says, \"Your sins separate between you and God.\"[fn-39-P3945_1705645:59-nf] He does not then bestow on us His good things, except He take away our evil things. And the former increase in proportion as the latter are diminished; nor will the one be perfected, till the other be brought to an end. But now that the Lord Jesus forgives sins by the Holy Ghost, just as by the Holy Ghost He casts out devils, may be understood by this, that after His Resurrection from the dead, when He had said to His disciples, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost,\" He immediately subjoined, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-39-P3946_1706270:60-nf] For that regeneration also, in which there is a remission of all past sins, is wrought by the Holy Ghost, as the Lord saith, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-39-P3947_1706509:61-nf] But it is one thing to be born of the Spirit, another to be nourished by the Spirit; just as it is one thing to be born of the flesh, which happens when the mother is delivered of her child; another to be nourished by the flesh, which happens when she gives suck to her infant, who turns himself that he may drink with pleasure thither whence he was born, to have life; that he may receive the support of life from thence, whence he received the beginning of his birth. We must believe then that the first blessing of God's goodness in the Holy Ghost is the remission of sins. Whence the preaching of John the Baptist, who was sent as the forerunner of the Lord, also begins with it. For thus it is written, \"In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3948_1707369:62-nf] Hence too the beginning of our Lord's preaching, as we read, \"From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"[fn-39-P3949_1707549:63-nf] Now John, amongst the other things which he spake tothose who came to be baptized by him, said, \"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\"[fn-39-P3950_1707856:64-nf] The Lord also said, \"John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence,\"[fn-39-P3951_1707996:65-nf] even at Pentecost. Now as to John's expression, \"with fire,\" though tribulation also might be understood, which believers were to suffer for the name of Christ; yet may we reasonably think that the same Holy Spirit is signified also under the name of \"fire.\"[fn-39-P3952_1708271:66-nf] Wherefore when He came it is said, \"And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.\"[fn-39-P3953_1708468:67-nf] Hence also the Lord Himself said, \"I am come to send fire on the earth.\"[fn-39-P3954_1708558:68-nf] Hence also the Apostle saith, \"Fervent in the spirit;\"[fn-39-P3955_1708632:69-nf] for from Him comes the fervour of love. \"For it is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\"[fn-39-P3956_1708772:70-nf] And the contrary to this fervour is what the Lord said, \"The love of many shall wax cold.\"[fn-39-P3957_1708879:71-nf] Now perfect love is the perfect gift of the Holy Spirit.

Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.\"[fn-33-P3375_1934724:46-nf] Therefore, if they represented the Church, and this was said to them as to the Church herself, it follows that the peace of the Church looses sins, and estrangement from the Church retains them, not according to the will of men, but according to the will of God and the prayers of the saints who are spiritual, who \"judge all things, but themselves are judged of no man.\"[fn-33-P3376_1935117:47-nf] For the rock retains, the rock remits; the dove retains, the dove remits; unity retains, unity remits. But the peace of this unity exists only in the good, in those who are either already spiritual, or are advancing by the obedience of concord to spiritual things; it exists not in the bad, whether they make disturbances abroad, or are endured within the Church with lamentations, baptizing and being baptized. But just as those who are tolerated with groanings within the Church, although they do not belong to the same unity of the dove, and to that \"glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing,\"[fn-33-P3377_1935757:48-nf] yet if they are corrected, and confess that they approached to baptism most unworthily, are not baptized again, but begin to belong to the dove, through whose groans those sins are remitted which were retained in them who were estranged from her peace; so those also who are more openly without the Church, if they have received the same sacraments, are not freed from their sins on coming, after correction, to the unity of the Church, by a repetition of baptism, but by the same law of charity and bond of unity. For if \"those only may baptize who are set over the Church, and established by the law of the gospel and ordination as appointed by the Lord,\" were they in any wise of this kind who seized on estates by treacherous frauds, and increased their gains by compound interest? I trow not, since those are established by ordination as appointed of the Lord, of whom the apostle, in giving them a standard, says, \"Not greedy, not given to filthy lucre.\"[fn-33-P3378_1936781:49-nf] Yet men of this kind used to baptize in the time of Cyprian himself; and he confesses with many lamentations that they were his fellow-bishops, and endures them with the great reward of tolerance. Yet did they not confer remission of sins, which is granted through the prayers of the saints, that is, the groans of the dove, whoever it be that baptizes, if those to whom it is given belong to her peace. For the Lord would not say to robbers and usurers, \"Whose soever sins ye remit, they shall be remitted to him; and whose soever sins ye retain, they shall be retained.\" \"Outside the Church, indeed, nothing can be either bound or loosed, since there there is no one who can either bind or loose;\" but he is loosed who has made peace with the dove, and he is bound who is not at peace with the dove, whether he is openly without, or appears to be within.","title":"Book III.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_58_book_i","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"154","folder":"ANF-01","text":"3.

And so the result is, that in each person we must acknowledge what he already has, and to each person we must give what he has not. If \"nothing can be confirmed and ratified with God which has been done by those whom God calls His enemies and foes,\"[fn-37-P3765_2087500:67-nf] why is the baptism confirmed which is given by murderers? Are we not to call murderers the enemies and foes of the Lord? But \"he that hateth his brother is a murderer.\" How then did they baptize who hated Paul, the servant of Jesus Christ, and thereby hated Jesus Himself, since He Himself said to Saul, \"Why persecutest thou me?\"[fn-37-P3766_2087854:68-nf] when he was persecuting His servants, and since at the last He Himself shall say, \"Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these that are mine, ye did it not to me?\"[fn-37-P3767_2088046:69-nf] Wherefore all who go out from us are not of us, but not all who are with us are of us; just as when men thresh, all that flies from the threshing-floor is shown not to be corn, but not all that remains there is therefore corn. And so John too says, \"They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.\"[fn-37-P3768_2088437:70-nf] Wherefore God gives the sacrament of grace even through the hands of wicked men, but the grace itself only by Himself or through His saints.

And we learn that the baptism is holy in itself, because it is of God; and whether it be given or whether it be received by men of such like character, it cannot be polluted by any perversity of theirs, either within, or yet outside the Church.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":31,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_60_book_iii_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"118","folder":"ANF-01","text":"5.

It might perhaps have been sufficient, that after the reasons have been so often repeated, and considered, and discussed with such variety of treatment, supplemented too, with the addition of proofs from holy Scripture, and the concurrent testimony of so many passages from Cyprian himself, even those who are slow of heart should thus understand, as I believe they do, that the baptism of Christ cannot be rendered void by any perversity on the part of man, whether in administering or receiving it. And when we find that in those times, when the point in question was decided in a manner contrary to ancient custom, after discussions carried on without violation of saving charity and unity, it appeared to some even eminent men who were bishops of Christ, among whom the blessed Cyprian was specially conspicuous, that the baptism of Christ could not exist among heretics or schismatics, this simply arose from their not distinguishing the sacrament from the effect or use of the sacrament; and because its effect and use were not found among heretics in freeing them from their sins and setting their hearts right, the sacrament itself was also thought to be wanting among them. But if we turn our eyes to the multitude of chaff within the Church, since these also who are perverse and lead an abandoned life in unity itself appear to have no power either of giving or retaining remission of sins, seeing that it is not to the wicked but the good sons that it was said, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained,\"[fn-38-P3844_2110399:1-nf] yet that such persons both have, and give, and receive the sacrament of baptism, was sufficiently manifest to the pastors of the Catholic Church dispersed over the whole world, through whom the original custom was afterwards confirmed by the authority of a plenary Council; so that even the sheep which was straying outside, and had received the mark of the Lord from false plunderers outside, if it seek the salvation of Christian unity, is purified from error, is freed from captivity, is healed of its wound, and yet the mark of the Lord is recognized rather than rejected in it; since the mark itself is often impressed both by wolves and on wolves, who seem indeed to be within the fold, but yet are proved by the fruits of their conduct, in which they persevere even to the end, not to belong to that sheep which is one in many; because, according to the foreknowledge of God, as many sheep wander outside, so many wolves lurk treacherously within, among whom the Lord yet knoweth them that are His, which hear only the voice of the Shepherd, even when He calls by the voice of men like the Pharisees, of whom it was said, \"Whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do.\"[fn-38-P3845_2111599:2-nf] ","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_57_book_vi_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"54","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"5.

Lucius of Castra Galbae has brought forward a proof from the gospel, in the words of the Lord, \"Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savor, that which is salted from it shall be good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men;\" just as though we maintained that men when cast out were of any profit for the salvation either of themselves or of any one else. But those also who, though seeming to be within, are yet of such a kind, not only are without spiritually, but will in the end be separated in the body also. For all such are for nothing. But it does not therefore follow that the sacrament of baptism which is in them is nothing. For even in the very men who are cast out, if they return to their senses and come back, the salvation which had departed from them returns; but the baptism does not return, because it never had departed. And in what the Lord says, \"Go therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,\" He did not permit any to baptize except the good, inasmuch as He did not say to the bad, \"Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.\"[fn-39-P3943_2148632:52-nf] How then do the wicked baptize within, who cannot remit sins? How also is it that they baptize the wicked whose hearts are not changed, whose sins are yet upon them, as John says, \"He that hateth his brother is in darkness even until now?\"[fn-39-P3944_2148890:53-nf] But if the sins of these men are remitted when they join themselves in the close bonds of love to the good and just, through whom sins are remitted in the Church, though they have been baptized by the wicked, so the sins of those also are remitted who come from without and join themselves by the inner bond of peace to the same framework of the body of Christ. Yet the baptism Of Christ should be acknowledged in both, and held invalid in none, whether before they are converted, though then it profit them nothing, or after they are converted, that so it may profit them, as he says, \"Since they themselves, by withdrawing when they have lost their savor from the Church, which is one, have become contrary to it, let that be done which is written, `The houses of those that are opposed to the law must need be cleansed.' And it therefore follows,\" he goes on to say, \"that those who have been polluted by being baptized by men opposed to Christ should first be cleansed, and only then baptized.\" What then? Are thieves and murderers not contrary to the law, which says, \"Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not steal?\"[fn-39-P3945_2150028:54-nf] \"They must therefore needs be cleansed.\" Who will deny it? And yet not only those who are baptized by such within the Church, but also those who, being such themselves, are baptized without being changed in heart, are nevertheless exempt from further baptism when they are so changed. So great is the force of the sacrament of mere baptism, that though we allow that a man who has been baptized and continues to lead an evil life requires to be cleansed, we yet forbid him to be any more baptized.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_52_oration_xl_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XXV.

Offer yourself; clothe yourself with Christ, feast me with your conduct; I rejoice to be thus affectionately treated, and God Who gives these great gifts rejoices thus.

To which reply none of us is found either so senseless or so stubborn as to dare, contrary to right or contrary to truth, to object, for instance, so to the doing of things in their integrity, and by all means in the Church, and the observation of them according to the order of discipline perpetually by us.

For when by imposition of the bishop's hands the Holy Spirit is given to every one that believes, as in the case of the Samaritans, after Philip's baptism, the apostles did to them by laying on of hands; in this manner also they conferred on them the Holy Spirit.

Are we to suppose, therefore, that there are two Holy Spirits? Who will be found so utterly mad as to assert this? Christ therefore Himself gave the same Holy Spirit, whether by breathing on the face of the disciples, or by sending Him down from heaven on the day of Pentecost, with undoubted commendation of His holy sacrament. Accordingly it was not that Christ gave the Holy Spirit, and the Comforter gave the fire, that the saying might be fulfilled, \"With the Holy Spirit, and with fire;\" but the same Christ Himself gave the Holy Spirit in both cases, making it manifest while He was yet on earth by His breathing, and when He was ascended into heaven by the tongues of flame.

In like manner, also, when He said, \"Whosoever sinneth against the Holy Ghost,\"or, \"Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost;\" it is dear that He does not refer to every sin of whatsoever kind against the Holy Ghost, in word or deed, but would have us understand some special and peculiar sin.

As at the end He caused by virtue of the Incarnation that, though the body was disunited from the soul, yet the indivisible Godhead which had been blended once for all with the subject (who possessed them) was not stripped from that body any more than it was from that soul, but while it was in Paradise along with the soul, and paved an entrance there in the person of the Thief for all humanity, it remained by means of the body in the heart of the earth, and therein destroyed him that had the power of Death (wherefore His body too is called \"the Lord[fn-43-P4394_2874313:11-nf] \" on account of that inherent Godhead)-so also, at the beginning, we conclude that the power of the Highest, coalescing with our entire nature by that coming upon (the Virgin) of the Holy Ghost, both resides in our soul, so far as reason sees it possible that it should reside there, and is blended with our body, so that our salvation throughout every element may be perfect, that heavenly passionlessness which is peculiar to the Deity being nevertheless preserved both in the beginning and in the end of this life as Man[fn-43-P4395_2874934:12-nf] . Thus the beginning was not as our beginning, nor the end as our end.

However, it will be acknowledged cordially by all, that from the date of the resurrection of our Lord, those who up to that time have been humbling their souls with fastings, ought at once to begin their festal joy and gladness. But in what you have written to me you have made out very clearly, and with an intelligent understanding of the Holy Scriptures, that no very exact account seems to be offered in them of the hour at which He rose. For the evangelists have given different descriptions of the parties who came to the sepulchre one after another,[fn-15-P1582_445884:141-nf] and all have declared that they found the Lord risen already. It was \"in the end of the Sabbath,\" as Matthew has said;[fn-15-P1583_446042:142-nf] it was \"early, when it was yet dark,\" as John writes;[fn-15-P1584_446120:143-nf] it was \"very early in the morning,\" as Luke puts it; and it was \"very early in the morning, at the rising of the sun,\" as Mark tells us. Thus no one has shown us clearly the exact time when He rose. It is admitted, however, that those who came to the sepulchre in the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,[fn-15-P1585_446481:144-nf] found Him no longer lying in it. And let us not suppose that the evangelists disagree or contradict each other. But even although there may seem to be some small difficulty as to the subject of our inquiry, if they all agree that the light of the world, our Lord, rose on that one night, while they differ with respect to the hour, we may well seek with wise and faithful mind to harmonize their statements. The narrative by Matthew then, runs thus: \"In the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week,[fn-15-P1586_447058:145-nf] came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre. And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. And his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said.\"[fn-15-P1587_447611:146-nf] Now this phrase \"in the end\" will be thought by some to signify, according to the common use[fn-15-P1588_447730:147-nf] of the word, the evening: of the Sabbath; while others, with a better perception of the fact, will say that it does not indicate that, but a late hour in the night,[fn-15-P1589_447914:148-nf] as the phrase \"in the end\"[fn-15-P1590_447965:149-nf] denotes slowness and length of time. Also because he speaks of night, and not of evening, he has added the words, \"as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week.\" And the parties here did not come yet, as the others say, \"bearing spices,\" but \"to see the sepulchre; \"and they discovered the occurrence of the earthquake, and the angel sitting upon the stone, and heard from him the declaration, \"He is not here, He is risen.\" And to the same effect is the testimony of John. \"The first day of the week,\" says he, \"came Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.\"[fn-15-P1591_448627:150-nf] Only, according to this \"when it was yet dark,\" she had come in advance.[fn-15-P1592_448719:151-nf] And Luke says: \"They rested the Sabbath-day, according to the commandment. Now, upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared; and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.\"[fn-15-P1593_449025:152-nf] This phrase \"very early in the morning\"[fn-15-P1594_449100:153-nf] probably indicates the early dawn[fn-15-P1595_449157:154-nf] of the first day of the week; and thus, when the Sabbath itself was wholly past, and also the whole night succeeding it, and when another day had begun, they came, bringing spices and myrrh, and then it became apparent that He had already risen long before. And Mark follows this, and says: \"They had bought sweet spices, in order that they might come and anoint Him. And very early (in the morning), the first day of the week, they come unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.\"[fn-15-P1596_449698:155-nf] For this evangelist also has used the term \"very early,\" which is just the same as the \"very early in the morning\" employed by the former; and he has added, \"at the rising of the sun.\" Thus they set out, and took their way first when it was \"very early in the morning,\" or (as Mark says) when it was \"very early; \"but on the road, and by their stay at the sepulchre, they spent the time till it was sunrise. And then the young man clad in white said to them, \"He is risen, He is not here.\" As the case stands thus, we make the following statement and explanation to those who seek an exact account of the specific hour, or half-hour, or quarter of an hour, at which it is proper to begin their rejoicing over our Lord's rising from the dead. Those who are too hasty, and give up even before midnight,[fn-15-P1597_450522:156-nf] we reprehend as remiss and intemperate, and as almost breaking off from their course in their precipitation,[fn-15-P1598_450685:157-nf] for it is a wise man's word, \"That is not little in life which is within a little.\" And those who hold out and continue for a very long time, and persevere even on to the fourth watch, which is also the time at which our Saviour manifested Himself walking upon the sea to those who were then on the deep, we receive as noble and laborious disciples. On those, again, who pause and refresh themselves in the course as they are moved or as they are able, let us not press very hard:[fn-15-P1599_451219:158-nf] for all do not carry out the six days of fasting[fn-16-P1600_451444:159-nf] either equally or alike; but some pass even all the days as a fast, remaining without food through the whole; while others take but two, and others three, and others four, and others not even one. And to those who have laboured painfully through these protracted fasts. and have thereafter become exhausted and well-nigh undone, pardon ought to be extended if they are somewhat precipitate in taking food. But if there are any who not only decline such protracted fasting, but refuse at the first to fast at all, and rather indulge themselves luxuriously during the first four days, and then when they reach the last two days-viz., the preparation and the Sabbath-fast with due rigour during these, and these alone, and think that they do something grand and brilliant if they hold out till the morning, I cannot think that they have gone through the time on equal terms with those who have been practising the same during several days before.

Therefore the Lord said, \"Who touched me?\" And the disciples wondering said, \"The multitude throng Thee, and press Thee, and sayest Thou, Vho touched me?\"[fn-12-P1271_802099:7-nf] And He repeated it, \"Somebody hath touched me.\" That woman touched, the multitude pressed. What is \"touched,\" except \"believed\"? Whence also He said to that woman that wished to throw herself at His feet after His resurrection: \"'Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to the Father.\"[fn-12-P1272_802403:8-nf] Thou thinkest me to be that alone which thou seest; \"touch me not.\" What is this? Thou supposest that I am that alone which I appear to thee: do not thus believe; that is, \"touch me not for I am not yet ascended to the Father.\" To thee I am not ascended, for thence I never departed. She touched Him not while He stood on the earth; how then could she touch Him while ascending to the Father? Thus, however, thus He willed Himself to be touched; thus He is touched by those by whom He is profitably touched, ascending to the Father, abiding with the Father, equa to the Father.","title":"Tractate XXVI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_66_sermon_xlix_xcix_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"9.

But what is meant by this which he says, \"For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified?\" He is understood to say this in a sense that is evident. For the meaning is not that the Spirit of God, which was with God, was not in being; but was not yet in them who had believed on Jesus. For thus the Lord jesus disposed not to give them the Spirit of which we speak, until after His resurrection; and this not without a cause. And perhaps if we inquire, He will favor us to find; and if we knock, He will open for us to enter. Piety knocks, not the hand though the hand also knocks, if it cease not from works of mercy. What then is the cause why the Lord Jesus Christ determined not to give the Holy Spirit until He should be glorified? which thing before we speak of as we may be able, we must first inquire, lest that should trouble any one, in what manner the Spirit was not yet in holy men, whilst we read in the Gospel concerning the Lord Himself newly born, that Simeon by the Holy Spirit recognized Him; that Anna the widow, a prophetess, also recognized Him;[fn-14-P1476_928278:2-nf] that John, who baptized Him, recognized Him;[fn-14-P1477_928342:3-nf] that Zacharias, being filled with the Holy Ghost, said many things; that Mary herself received the Holy Ghost to conceive the Lord.[fn-14-P1478_928492:4-nf] We have therefore many preceding evidences of the Holy Spirit before the Lord was glorified by the resurrection of His flesh. Nor was it another spirit that the prophets also had, who proclaimed beforehand the coming of Christ. But still, there was to be a certain manner of this giving, which had not at all appeared before. For nowhere do we read before this, that men being gathered together had, by receiving the Holy Ghost, spoken in the tongues of all nations. But after His resurrection, when He first appeared to His disciples, He said to them: \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\" Of this giving then it is said, \"The Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. And He breathed upon their faces,\"[fn-14-P1479_929223:5-nf] He who with His breath enlivened them first man, and raised him up from the clay, by which breath He gave a soul to the limbs; signifying that He was the same who breathed upon their faces, that they might rise out of the mire and renounce their miry works. Then, after His resurrection, which the evangelist calls His glorifying, did the Lord first give the Holy Ghost to His disciples. Then having tarried with them forty days, as the book of the Acts of the Apostles shows, while they were seeing Him and companying with Him, He ascended into heaven in their sight. There at the end of ten days, on the flay of Pentecost, He sent the Holy Ghost from above. Which having received, they, who had been gathered together in one place, as I have said, being filled withal, spoke in the tongues of all nations.","title":"Tractate XXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":20,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_59_discourse_ii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"42","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"23. Moreover if, as the heretics hold, the Son were creature or work, but not as one of the creatures, because of His excelling them inglory, it were natural that Scripture should describe and display Him by a comparison in His favour with the other works; for instance, that it should say that He is greater than Archangels, and more honourable than the Thrones, and both brighter than sun and moon, and greater than the heavens.

And He did not say, `This,' or `this Man which I have taken to Me,' but `Me.'

Tell us then, tell us, we pray, O Peter, thou chief of Apostles, tell us how the Churches ought to believe in God.

Shut out all those who try to overthrow the heavenly house: and those who are endeavouring to enter by secret holes and unlawful approaches: as it is clear that none can enter the gate of the kingdom save one to whom the key bestowed on the Churches is revealed by you. Tell us then how we ought to believe in Jesus Christ and to confess our common Lord. You will surely reply without hesitation: \"Why do you consult me as to the way in which the Lord should be confessed, when you have before you my own confession of Him? Read the gospel, and you will not want me myself, when you have got my confession. Nay, you have got me myself when you have my confession; for though I have no weight apart from my confession, yet the actual confession adds weight to my person.\" Tell us then, O Evangelist, tell us the confession: tell us the faith of the chief Apostle: did he confess that Jesus was only a man, or God? did he say that there was nothing but flesh in Him, or did he proclaim Him the Son of God? When then the Lord Jesus Christ asked whom the disciples believed and confessed Him to be, Peter, the first of the Apostles, replied-one in the name of all-for the answer of one was to the same effect as the faith of them all. But it was fitting that he should first give the answer, that the order of the answer might correspond to the degree of honour: and that he might outstrip them in confession, as he outstripped them in age.

And so too you say that Mary is Christotocos, but not Theotocos, because she was the mother of Christ, not of God. Therefore you maintain, that Christ is only a man, and not God, and so that He is the Son of man not of God. What then does Peter reply to this? \"Thou art,\" he says, \"the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" That Christ whom you declare to be only the Son of man, he testifies to be the Son of God. Whom would you like us to believe? you or Peter? I imagine that you are not so shameless as to venture to prefer your own opinion to that of the first of the Apostles. And yet what is there that you would not venture on? or how can you help scorning the Apostle, if you can deny God? \"Thou art then,\" he says, \"the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" Is there anything puzzling or obscure in this? It is nothing but a plain and open confession: he proclaims Christ to be the Son of God. Perhaps you will deny that the words were spoken: but the Evangelist testifies that they were. Or do you say that the Apostle told a lie? But it is an awful lie to accuse an Apostle of lying. Or perhaps you will maintain that the words were spoken of some other Christ? But this is a novel kind of monstrous fabrication. What then is left for you?

For when God was born in human flesh, He was not born in human flesh in such a way as not to remain Divine in Himself, but so that, while the Godhead remained as before, God might become man.

Many holy women, again, ministered to holy men of their substance, as the Shunammite woman ministered to Elisha; but she did not live with him, but the prophet lived in a house apart. And, when her son died, she wanted to throw herself at the feet of the prophet; but his attendant would not allow her, but restrained her. But Elisha said to his servant: \"Let her alone, because her soul is distressed.\"[fn-12-P1217_297725:70-nf] From these things, then, we ought to understand their manner of life.

And although even in \"the form of a slave\" many signs of Divinity have beamed out, yet the events of all that period served particularly to show the reality of His assumed Manhood. But after the Passion, when the chains of death were broken, which had exposed its own strength by attacking Him, Who was ignorant of sin, weakness was turned into power, mortality into eternity, contumely into glory, which the Lord Jesus Christ showed by many clear proofs in the sight of many, until He carried even into heaven the triumphant victory which He had won over the dead. As therefore at the Easter commemoration, the Lord's Resurrection was the cause of our rejoicing; so the subject of our present gladness is His Ascension, as we commemorate and duly venerate that day on which the Nature of our humility in Christ was raised above all the host of heaven, over all the ranks of angels, beyond the height of all powers, to sit with God the Father. On which Providential order of events we are founded and built up, that God's Grace might become more wondrous, when, notwithstanding the removal from men's sight of what was rightly felt to command their awe, faith did not fail, hope did not waver, love did not grow cold. For it is the strength of great minds and the light of firmly-faithful souls, unhesitatingly to believe what is not seen with the bodily sight, and there to fix one's affections whither you cannot direct your gaze. And whence should this Godliness spring up in our hearts, or how should a man be justified by faith, if our salvation rested on those things only which lie beneath our eyes? Hence our Lord said to him who seemed to doubt of Christ's Resurrection, until he had tested by sight and touch the traces of His Passion in His very Flesh, \"because thou hast seen Me, thou hast believed: blessed are, they who have not seen and yet have believed[fn-39-P3936_1002532:1-nf] .\"","title":"Sermon LXXIV.

A better instructed faith then began to draw closer to a conception of the Son's equality with the Father without the necessity of handling the corporeal substance in Christ, whereby He is less than the Father, since, while the Nature of the glorified Body still remained the faith of believers was called upon to touch not with the hand of flesh, but with the spiritual understanding the Only-begotten, Who was equal with the Father. Hence comes that which the Lord said after His Resurrection, when Mary Magdalene, representing the Church, hastened to approach and touch Him: \"Touch Me not, for I have not yet ascended to My Father[fn-39-P3947_1005909:3-nf] :\" that is, I would not have you come to Me as to a human body, nor yet recognize Me by fleshly perceptions: I put thee off for higher things, I prepare greater things for thee: when I have ascended to My Father, then thou shall handle Me more perfectly and truly, for thou shall grasp what thou canst not touch and believe what thou canst not see. But when the disciples' eyes followed the ascending Lord tO heaven with upward gaze of earnest wonder, two angels stood by them in raiment shining with wondrous brightness, who also said, \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing into heaven? This Jesus Who was taken up from you into heaven shall so come as ye saw Him going into heaven[fn-39-P3948_1006613:4-nf] .\" By which words all the sons of the Church were taught to believe that Jesus Christ will come visibly in the same Flesh wherewith He ascended, and not to doubt that all things are subjected to Him on Whom the ministry of angels had waited from the first beginning of His Birth. For, as an angel announced to the blessed Virgin that Christ should be conceived by the Holy Ghost, so the voice of heavenly beings sang of His being born of the Virgin also to the shepherds. As messengers from above were the first to attest His having risen from the dead, so the service of angels was employed to foretell His coming in very Flesh to judge the world, that we might understand what great powers will come with Him as Judge, when such great ones ministered to Him even in being judged.","title":"Sermon LXXIV.

And again the Son of God is said to have been crucified and buried, although it was not actually in His Divinity whereby the Only-begotten is co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father, but in His weak human nature that He suffered these things. And so it is that in the Creed also we all confess that the Only-begotten Son of God was crucified and buried, according to that saying of the Apostle: \"for if they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory[fn-11-P1125_266352:46-nf] .\" But when our Lord and Saviour Himself would instruct His disciples' faith by His questionings, He said, \"Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?\" And when they had put on record the various opinions of other people, He said, \"But ye, whom do ye say that I am?\" Me, that is, who am the Son of Man, and whom ye see in the form of a slave, and in true flesh, whom do ye say that I am? Whereupon blessed Peter, whose divinely inspired confession was destined to profit all nations, said, \"Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God[fn-11-P1126_266906:47-nf] .\" And not undeservedly was he pronounced blessed by the Lord, drawing from the chief corner-stone[fn-11-P1127_267030:48-nf] the solidity of power which his name also expresses, he, who, through the revelation of the Father, confessed Him to be at once Christ and Son of God: because the receiving of the one of these without the other was of no avail to salvation, and it was equally perilous to have believed the Lord Jesus Christ to be either only God without man, or only man without God. But after the Lord's resurrection (which, of course, was of His true body, because He was raised the same as He had died and been buried), what else was effected by the forty days' delay than the cleansing of our faith's purity from all darkness? For to that end He talked with His disciples, and dwelt and ate with them, He allowed Himself to be handled with diligent and curious touch by those who were affected by doubt, He entered when the doors were shut upon the Apostles, and by His breathing upon them gave them the Holy Spirit[fn-11-P1128_268604:49-nf] , and bestowing on them the light of understanding, opened the secrets of the Holy Scriptures[fn-11-P1129_268719:50-nf] . So again He showed the wound in His side, the marks of the nails, and all the signs of His quite recent suffering, saying, \"See My hands and feet, that it is I. Handle Me and see that a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have[fn-11-P1130_268981:51-nf] ;\" in order that the properties of His Divine and human nature might be acknowledged to remain still inseparable: and that we might know the Word not to be different from the flesh, in such a sense as also to confess that the one Son of God iS both the Word and flesh[fn-11-P1131_269263:52-nf] . Of this mystery of the faith[fn-11-P1132_269391:53-nf] your opponent Eutyches must be reckoned to have but little sense if he bus recognized our nature in the Only-begotten of God neither through the humiliation of His having to die, nor through the glory of His rising again. Nor has he any fear of the blessed apostle and evangelist John's declaration when he says, \"every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ to have come in the flesh, is of God: and every spirit which destroys Jesus is not of God, and this is Antichrist[fn-11-P1133_269885:54-nf] .\" But what is \"to destroy Jesus,\" except to take away the human nature from Him, and to render void the mystery, by which alone we were saved, by the most barefaced fictions. The truth is that being in darkness about the nature of Christ's body, he must also be befooled by the same blindness in the matter of His sufferings. For if he does not think the cross of the Lord fictitious, and does not doubt that the punishment He underwent to save the world is likewise true, let him acknowledge the flesh of Him whose death he already believes: and let him not disbelieve Him man with a body like ours, since he acknowledges Him to have been able to suffer: seeing that the denial of His true flesh is also the denial of His bodily suffering. If therefore he receives the Christian faith, and does not turn away his ears from the preaching of the Gospel: let him see what was the nature that hung pierced with nails on the wooden cross, and, when the side of the Crucified was opened by the soldier's spear, let him understand whence it was that blood and water flowed, that the Church of God might be watered from the font and from the cup[fn-11-P1134_271585:55-nf] . Let him hear also the blessed Apostle Peter, proclaiming that the sanctification of the Spirit takes place through the sprinkling of Christ's blood[fn-11-P1135_271924:56-nf] . And let him not read cursorily the same Apostle's words when he says, \"Knowing that not with corruptible things, such as silver and gold, have ye been redeemed from your vain manner of life which is part of your fathers' tradition, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ as of a lamb without spot and blemish[fn-11-P1136_272279:57-nf] .\" Let him not resist too the witness of the blessed Apostle John, who says: \"and the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanseth us from all sin[fn-11-P1137_272439:58-nf] .\" And again: \"this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.\" And \"who is He that overcometh the world save He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God. This is He that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that testifieth, because the Spirit is the truth[fn-11-P1138_272797:59-nf] , because there are three that bear witness, the Spirit, the water and the blood, and the three are one[fn-11-P1139_273124:60-nf] .\" The Spirit, that is, of sanctification, and the blood of redemption, and the water of baptism: because the three are one, and remain undivided, and none of them is separated from this connection; because the catholic Church lives and progresses by this faith, so that in Christ Jesus neither the manhood without the true Godhead nor the Godhead without the true manhood is believed in.","title":"Letter XXVIII.
