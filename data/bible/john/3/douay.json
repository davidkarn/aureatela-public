{"verses":["And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of\nthe Jews.","This man came to Jesus by night and said to him:  Rabbi, we know\nthat thou art come a teacher from God; for no man can do these signs\nwhich thou dost, unless God be with him.","Jesus answered and said to him:  Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless\na man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.","Nicodemus saith to him:  How can a man be born when he is old?  Can\nhe enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born again?","Jesus answered:  Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born\nagain of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of\nGod.","That which is born of the flesh is flesh:  and that which is born\nof the Spirit is spirit.","Wonder not that I said to thee:  You must be born again.","The Spirit breatheth where he will and thou hearest his voice:  but\nthou knowest not whence he cometh and whither he goeth.  So is every one\nthat is born of the Spirit.","Nicodemus answered and said to him:  How can these things be done?","Jesus answered and said to him:  Art thou a master in Israel, and\nknowest not these things?","Amen, amen, I say to thee that we speak what we know and we\ntestify what we have seen:  and you receive not our testimony.","If I have spoken to you earthly things, and you believe not:  how\nwill you believe, if I shall speak to you heavenly things?","And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended from\nheaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.","And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son\nof man be lifted up:","That whosoever believeth in him may not perish, but may have life\neverlasting.","For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son:\nthat whosoever believeth in him may not perish, but may have life\neverlasting.","For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world:  but\nthat the world may be saved by him.","He that believeth in him is not judged.  But he that doth not\nbelieve is already judged:  because he believeth not in the name of the\nonly begotten Son of God.","And this is the judgment:  Because the light is come into the\nworld and men loved darkness rather than the light:  for their works\nwere evil.","For every one that doth evil hateth the light and cometh not to\nthe light, that his works may not be reproved.","But he that doth truth cometh to the light, that his works may be\nmade manifest:  because they are done in God.","After these things, Jesus and his disciples came into the land of\nJudea:  and there he abode with them and baptized.","And John also was baptizing in Ennon near Salim:  because there\nwas much water there.  And they came and were baptized.","For John was not yet cast into prison.","And there arose a question between some of John's disciples and\nthe Jews, concerning purification.","And they came to John and said to him:  Rabbi, he that was with\nthee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony:  behold, he\nbaptizeth and all men come to him.","John answered and said:  A man cannot receive any thing, unless it\nbe given him from heaven.","You yourselves do bear me witness that I said that I am not\nChrist, but that I am sent before him.","He that hath the bride is the bridegroom:  but the friend of the\nbridegroom, who standeth and heareth Him, rejoiceth with joy because of\nthe bridegroom's voice.  This my joy therefore is fulfilled.","He must increase:  but I must decrease.","He that cometh from above is above all.  He that is of the earth,\nof the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh.  He that cometh from\nheaven is above all.","And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth:  and no man\nreceiveth his testimony.","He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God\nis true.","For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God:  for God doth\nnot give the Spirit by measure.","The Father loveth the Son:  and he hath given all things into his\nhand.","He that believeth in the Son hath life everlasting:  but he that\nbelieveth not the Son shall not see life:  but the wrath of God abideth\non him."]}
