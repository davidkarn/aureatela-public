Wherefore, having mastered this rule for interpreting the Scriptures concerning the Son of God, that we are to distinguish in them what relates to the form of God, in which He is equal to the Father, and what to the form of a servant which He took, in which He is less than the Father; we shall not be disquieted by apparently contrary and mutually repugnant sayings of the sacred books. For both the Son and the Holy Spirit, according to the form of God, are equal to the Father, because neither of them is a creature, as we have already shown: but according to the form of a servant He is less than the Father, because He Himself has said, \"My Father is greater than I;\"[fn-3-P327_117822:113-nf] and He is less than Himself, because it is said of Him, He emptied Himself;\"[fn-3-P328_117921:114-nf] and He is less than the Holy Spirit, because He Himself says, \"Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven Him.\"[fn-3-P329_118158:115-nf] And in the Spirit too He wrought miracles, saying: \"But if I with the Spirit of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.\"[fn-3-P330_118327:116-nf] And in Isaiah He says,-in the lesson which He Himself read in the synagogue, and showed without a scruple of doubt to be fulfilled concerning Himself,-\"The Spirit of the Lord God,\" He says, \"is upon me: because He hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek He hath sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives,\"[fn-3-P331_118671:117-nf] etc.: for the doing of which things He therefore declares Himself to be \"sent,\" because the Spirit of God is upon Him. According to the form of God, all things were made by Him;[fn-3-P332_118886:118-nf] according to the form of a servant, He was Himself made of a woman, made under the law.[fn-3-P333_118992:119-nf] According to the form of God, He and the Father are one;[fn-3-P334_119068:120-nf] according to the form of a servant, He came not to do His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him.[fn-3-P335_119191:121-nf] According to the form of God, \"As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself;\"[fn-3-P336_119332:122-nf] according to the form of a servant, His \"soul is sorrowful even unto death;\" and, \"O my Father,\" He says, \"if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.\"[fn-3-P337_119843:123-nf] According to the form of God, \"He is the True God, and eternal life;\"[fn-3-P338_119941:124-nf] according to the form of a servant, \"He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\"[fn-3-P339_120060:125-nf] -23. According to the form of God, all things that the Father hath are His,[fn-3-P340_120156:126-nf] and \"All mine,\" He says, \"are Thine, and Thine are mine;\"[fn-3-P341_120236:127-nf] according to the form of a servant, the doctrine is not His own, but His that sent Him.[fn-3-P342_120346:128-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"27. I ask, therefore, how we are to understand, \"I will not judge him; but the Word which I have spoken shall judge him:\" which appears from what follows to be so said, as if He would say, I will not judge; but the Word of the Father will judge. But the Word of the Father is the Son of God Himself. Is it to be so understood: I will not judge, but I will judge? How can this be true, unless in this way: viz., I will not judge by human power, because I am the Son of man; but I will judge by the power of the Word, because I am the Son of God? Or if it still seems contradictory and inconsistent to say, I will not judge, but I will judge; what shall we say of that place where He says, \"My doctrine is not mine?\" How \"mine,\" when \"not mine?\" For He did not say, This doctrine is not mine, but \"My doctrine is not mine:\" that which He called His own, the same He called not His own. How can this be true, unless He has called it His own in one relation; not His own, in another? According to the form of God, His own; according to the form of a servant, not His own. For when He says, \"It is not mine, but His that sent me,\"[fn-3-P381_132251:160-nf] He makes us recur to the Word itself. For the doctrine of the Father is the Word of the Father, which is the Only Son. And what, too, does that mean, \"He that believeth on me, believeth not on me?\"[fn-3-P382_132470:161-nf] How believe on Him, yet not believe on Him? How canso opposite and inconsistent a thing be understood-\"Whoso believeth on me,\" He says, \"believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me;\"-unless you so understand it, Whoso believeth on me believeth not on that which he sees, lest our hope should be in the creature; but on Him who took the creature, whereby He might appear to human eyes, and so might cleanse our hearts by faith, to contemplate Himself as equal to the Father? So that in turning the attention of believers to the Father, and saying, \"Believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me,\" He certainly did not mean Himself to be separated from the Father, that is, from Him that sent Him; but that men might so believe on Himself, as they believe on the Father, to whom He is equal. And this He says in express terms in another place, \"Ye believe in God, believe also in me:\"[fn-3-P383_133374:162-nf] that is, in the same way as you believe in God, so also believe in me; because I and the Father are One God. As therefore, here, He has as it were withdrawn the faith of men from Himself, and transferred it to the Father, by saying, \"Believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me,\" from whom nevertheless He certainly did not separate Himself; so also, when He says, \"It is not mine to give, but lit shall be given to them] for whom it is prepared by my Father,\" it is I think plain in what relation both are to be taken. For that other also is of the same kind, \"I will not judge;\" whereas He Himself shall judge the quick and dead.[fn-3-P384_134028:163-nf] But because He will not do so by human power, therefore, reverting to the Godhead, He raises the hearts of men upwards; which to lift up, He Himself came down.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_07_book_i_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"76","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"37. In the next place, He goes on to say: \"And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should go[fn-3-P398_108277:119-nf] into hell.\" Here, certainly, there is need of great courage in order to cut off one's members.[fn-3-P399_108403:120-nf] For whatever it is that is mean.t by the \"eye,\" undoubtedly it is such a thing as is ardently loved. For those who wish to express their affection strongly are wont to speak thus: I love him as my own eyes, or even more than my own eyes. Then, when the word \"right\" is added, it is meant perhaps to intensify the strength of the affection.[fn-4-P400_108852:121-nf] For although these bodily eyes of ours are turned in a common direction for the purpose of seeing, and if both are turned they have equal power, yet men are more afraid of losing the right one. So that the sense in this case is: Whatever it is which thou so lovest that thou reckonest it as a right eye, if it offends thee, i.e. if it proves a hindrance to thee on the way to true happiness, pluck it out and cast it from thee. For it is profitable for thee, that one of these which thou so lovest that they cleave to thee as if they were members, should perish, rather than that thy whole body should be cast into hell.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"4. There are, then, some things in the sacred books, as I began by saying, so put, that it is doubtful to which they are to be referred: whether to that rule whereby the Son is less on account of His having taken the creature; or whether to that whereby it is intimated that although equal, yet He is of the Father. And in my opinion, if this is in such way doubtful, that which it really is canneither be explained nor discerned, then such passages may without danger be understood according to either rule, as that, for instance, \"My doctrine is not mine, but His that sent me.\"[fn-4-P454_162740:11-nf] For this may both be taken according to the form of a servant, as we have already treated it in the former book;[fn-4-P455_162872:12-nf] or according to the form of God, in which He is in such way equal to the Father, that He is yet of the Father. For according to the form of God, as the Son is not one and His life another, but the life itself is the Son; so the Son is not one and His doctrine another, but the doctrine itself is the Son. And hence, as the text, \"He hath given life to the Son,\" is no otherwise to be understood than, He hath begotten the Son, who is life; so also when it is said, He hath given doctrine to the Son, it may be rightly understood to mean, He hath begotten the Son, who is doctrine so that, when it is said, \"My doctrine is not mine, but His who sent me,\" it is so to be understood as if it were, I am not from myself, but from Him who sent me.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1165","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"2. Knowing then that the Saviour has said: \"judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment.\"[fn-42-P4254_1144284:3052-nf] ...","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":7,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_10_book_iv_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"75","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"29. As, therefore, the Father begat, the Son is begotten; so the Father sent, the Son was sent. But in like manner as He who begat and He who was begotten, so both He who sent and He who was sent, are one, since the Father and the Son are one.[fn-9-P985_386032:111-nf] So also the Holy Spirit is one with them, since these three are one. For as to be born, in respect to the Son, means to be from the Father; so to be sent, in respect to the Son, means to be known to be from the Father. And as to be the gift of God in respect to the Holy Spirit, means to proceed from the Father; so to be sent, is to be known to proceed from the Father. Neither can we say that the Holy Spirit does not also proceed from the Son, for the same Spirit is not without reason said to be the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son.[fn-9-P986_386597:112-nf] Nor do I see what else He intended to signify, when He breathed on the face of the disciples, and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-9-P987_386852:113-nf] For that bodily breathing, proceeding from the body with the feeling of bodily touching, was not the substance of the Holy Spirit, but a declaration by a fitting sign, that the Holy Spirit proceeds not only from the Father, but also from the Son. For the veriest of madmen would not say, that it was one Spirit which He gave when He breathed on them, and another which He sent after His ascension.[fn-9-P988_387270:114-nf] For the Spirit of God is one, the Spirit of the Father and of the Son, the Holy Spirit, who worketh all in all.[fn-9-P989_387403:115-nf] But that He was given twice was certainly a significant economy, which we will discuss in its place, as far as the Lord may grant. That then which the Lord says,-\"Whom I will send unto you from the Father,\"[fn-9-P990_387633:116-nf] -shows the Spirit to be both of the Father and of the Son; because, also, when He had said, \"Whom the Father will send,\" He added also, \"in my name.\"[fn-9-P991_387803:117-nf] Yet He did not say, Whom the Father will send from me, as He said, \"Whom Iwill send unto you from the Father,\"-showing, namely, that the Father is the beginning (principium) of the whole divinity, or if it is better so expressed, deity.[fn-9-P992_388061:118-nf] He, therefore, who proceeds from the Father and from the Son, is referred back to Him from whom the Son was born (natus). And that which the evangelist says, \"For the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified;\"[fn-9-P993_389484:119-nf] how is this to be understood, unless because the special giving or sending of the Holy Spirit after the glorification of Christ was to be such as it had never been before? For it was not previously none at all, but it had not been such as this. For if the Holy Spirit was not given before, wherewith were the prophets who spoke filled? Whereas the Scripture plainly says, and shows in many places, that they spake by the Holy Spirit. Whereas, also, it is said of John the Baptist, \"And he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.\" And his father Zacharias is found to have been filled with the Holy Ghost, so as to say such things of him. And Mary, too, was filled with the Holy Ghost, so as to foretell such things of the Lord, whom she was bearing in her womb.[fn-9-P994_390293:120-nf] And Simeon and Anna were filled with the Holy Spirit, so as to acknowledge the greatness of the little child Christ.[fn-9-P995_390437:121-nf] How, then, was \"the Spirit not yet given, since Jesus was not yet glorified,\" unless because that giving, or granting, or mission of the Holy Spirit was to have a certain speciality of its own in its very advent, such as never was before? For we read nowhere that men spoke in tongues which they did not know, through the Holy Spirit coming upon them; as happened then, when it was needful that His coming should be made plain by visible signs, in order to show that the whole world, and all nations constituted with different tongues, should believe in Christ through the gift of the Holy Spirit, to fulfill that which is sung in the Psalm, \"There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard; their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"[fn-9-P996_391256:122-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":42,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_08_homily_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"23","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"6. But wherefore did he not say, \"the Son of Abraham,\" and then \"the Son of David?\" it is not, as some suppose, that he means to proceed upward from the lower point, since then he would have done the same as Luke, but now he doth the contrary. Why then hath he made mention of David? The man was in the mouths of all, both from his distinction, and from the time, for he had not been so very long since dead, like Abraham. And though God made promises to both, yet the one, as old, was passed over in silence, while the other, as fresh and recent, was repeated of all. Themselves, for instance, say, \"Doth not Christ come of the seed of David, and out of Bethlehem, the town where David was?\"[fn-3-P335_57735:17-nf] And no man called Him Son of Abraham, but all Son of David; and that because this last was more in the recollection of all, both on account of the time, as I have already said, and because of his royalty. On this principle again all the kings whom they had in honor after his time were named from him, both by the people themselves and by God. For both Ezekiel[fn-3-P336_58116:18-nf] and other prophets besides speak of David as coming and rising again; not meaning him that was dead, but them who were emulating his virtue.

I Purpose by the Lord's assistance to treat of this section[fn-63-P6343_2678801:1-nf] of the Gospel which has just been read; nor is there a little difficulty here, lest the truth be endangered, and falsehood glory. Not that either the truth can perish, nor falsehood triumph. Now hearken for a while what difficulty this lesson has; and being made attentive by the propounding of the difficulty, pray that I may be sufficient for its solution. \"`The Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand;\"[fn-63-P6344_2679220:2-nf] these it seems are the days which they observe even to this day, when they build huts.[fn-63-P6345_2679323:3-nf] For this solemnity of theirs is called from the building of tabernacles; since skhnhmeans a \"tabernacle, \"skhnopha is the building of a tabernacle. These days were kept as feast days among the Jews; and it was called one feast day, not because it was over in one day, but because it was kept up by a continued festivity; just as the feast day of the Passover, and the feast day of unleavened bread, and notwithstanding, as is manifest, that feast is kept throughout many days. This anniversary then was at hand in Judaea, the Lord Jesus was in Galilee, where He had also been brought up, where too He had relations and kinsfolk, whom Scripture calls \"His brethren.\" \"His brethren, therefore,\" as we have heard it read, \"said unto Him, Pass from hence, and go into Judaea; that Thy disciples also may see Thy works that Thou doest. For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If Thou do these things, manifest Thyself to the world.\"[fn-63-P6346_2680298:4-nf] Then the Evangelist subjoins, \"For neither did His brethren believe in Him.\"[fn-63-P6347_2680394:5-nf] If then they did not believe in Him, the words they threw out were of envy. \"Jesus answered them, My time is not yet come; but your time is alway ready. The world cannot hate you;but Me it hateth, because I testify of it that the works thereof are evil. Go ye up to this feast day. I go[fn-63-P6348_2680697:6-nf] not up to this feast day, for My time is not yet accomplished.\"[fn-63-P6349_2680956:7-nf] Then follows the Evangelist; \"When He had said these words, He Himself stayed in Galilee. But when His brethren were gone up, then went He also up to the feast day, not openly, but as it were in secret.\"[fn-63-P6350_2681178:8-nf] Thus far is the extent of the difficulty, all the rest is clear.","title":"Sermon LXXXIII.

But even if some are baptized unto the Spirit, it is not, it is urged, on this account right for the Spirit to be ranked with God. Some \"were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.\"[fn-14-P1484_362053:265-nf] And it is admitted that faith even before now has been put in men; for \"The people believed God and his servant Moses.\"[fn-14-P1485_362201:266-nf] Why then, it is asked, do we, on account of faith and of baptism, exalt and magnify the Holy Spirit so far above creation, when there is evidence that the same things have before now been said of men? What, then, shall we reply? Our answer is that the faith in the Spirit is the same as the faith in the Father and the Son; and in like manner, too, the baptism. But the faith in Moses and in the cloud is, as it were, in a shadow and type. The nature of the divine is very frequently represented by the rough and shadowy outlines[fn-14-P1486_362751:267-nf] of the types;but because divine things are prefigured by small and human things, it is obvious that we must not therefore conclude the divine nature to be small. The type is an exhibition of things expected, and gives an imitative anticipation of the future. So Adam was a type of\"Him that was to come.\"[fn-14-P1487_363080:268-nf] Typically, \"That rock was Christ;\"[fn-14-P1488_363356:269-nf] and the water a type of the living power of the word; as He says, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.\"[fn-14-P1489_363494:270-nf] The manna is a type of the living bread that came down from heaven;[fn-14-P1490_363583:271-nf] and the serpent on the standard,[fn-14-P1491_363637:272-nf] of the passion of salvation accomplished by means of the cross, wherefore they who even looked thereon were preserved. So in like manner, the history of the exodus of Israel is recorded to shew forth those who are being saved through baptism. For the firstborn of the Israelites were preserved, like the bodies of the baptized, by the giving of grace to them that were marked with blood. For the blood of the sheep is a type of the blood of Christ; and the firstborn, a type of the first-formed. And inasmuch as the first-formed of necessity exists in us, and, in sequence of succession, is transmitted till the end, it follows that \"in Adam\" we \"all die,\"[fn-14-P1492_364318:273-nf] and that \"death reigned\"[fn-14-P1493_364409:274-nf] until the fulfilling of the law and the coming of Christ. And the firstborn were preserved by God from being touched by the destroyer, to show that we who were made alive in Christ no longer die in Adam. The sea and the cloud for the time being led on through amazement to faith, but for the time to come they typically prefigured the grace to be. \"Who is wise and he shall understand these things?\"[fn-14-P1494_364831:275-nf] -how the sea is typically a baptism bringing about the departure of Pharaoh. in like manner as this washing causes the departure of the tyranny of the devil. The sea slew the enemy in itself: and in baptism too dies our enmity towards God. From the sea the people came out unharmed: we too, as it were, alive from the dead, step up from the water \"saved\" by the \"grace\" of Him who called us.[fn-14-P1495_365242:276-nf] And the cloud is a shadow of the gift of the Spirit, who cools the flame of our passions by the \"mortification\" of our\"members.\"[fn-14-P1496_365391:277-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":7,"verse":30,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"On this occasion Athanasius read to those present the Defense which he had composed some time before in justification of his flight; a few passages from which it may be of service to introduce here, leaving the entire production, which is too long to be transcribed, to be sought out and perused by the studious.[fn-10-P1061_472594:26-nf] See the daring enormities of the impious persons! Such are their proceedings: and yet instead of blushing at their former clumsy intrigues against us, they even now abuse us for having effected our escape out of their murderous hands; nay, are grievously vexed that they were unable to put us out of the way altogether. In short, they overlook the fact that while they pretend to upbraid us with `cowardice,' they are really criminating themselves: for if it be disgraceful to flee, it is still more so to pursue, since the one is only endeavoring to avoid being murdered, while the other is seeking to commit the deed. But Scripture itself directs us to flee:[fn-10-P1062_473279:27-nf] and those who persecute unto death, in attempting to violate the law, constrain us to have recourse to flight. They should rather, therefore, be ashamed of their persecution, than reproach us for having sought to escape from it: let them cease to harass, and those who flee will also cease. Nevertheless they set no bounds to their malevolence, using every art to entrap us, in the consciousness that the flight of the persecuted is the strongest condemnation of the persecutor: for no one runs away from a mild and beneficent person, but from one who is of a barbarous and cruel disposition. Hence it was that `Every one that was discontented and in debt' fled from Saul to David.[fn-10-P1063_473979:28-nf] Wherefore these [foes of ours] in like manner desire to kill such as conceal themselves, that no evidence may exist to convict them of their wickedness. But in this also these misguided men most egregiously deceive themselves: for the more obvious the effort to elude them, the more manifestly will their deliberate slaughters and exiles be exposed. If they act the part of assassins, the voice of the blood which is shed will cry against them the louder: and if they condemn to banishment, they will raise so everywhere living monuments-of their own injustice and oppression. Surely unless their intellects were unsound they would perceive the dilemma in which their own counsels entangle them. But since they have lost sound judgment, their folly is exposed when they vanish, and when they seek to stay they do not see their wickedness.[fn-10-P1064_474846:29-nf] But if they reproach those who succeed in secreting themselves from the malice of their blood-thirsty adversaries, and revile such as flee from their persecutors, what will they say to Jacob's retreat from the rage of his brother Esau,[fn-10-P1065_475109:30-nf] and to Moses[fn-10-P1066_475140:31-nf] retiring into the land of Midian for fear of Pharaoh? And what apology will these babblers make for David's[fn-10-P1067_475265:32-nf] flight from Saul, when he sent messengers from his own house to dispatch him; and for his concealment in a cave, after contriving to extricate himself from the treacherous designs of Abimelech,[fn-10-P1068_475480:33-nf] by feigning madness? What will these reckless asserters of whatever suits their purpose answer, when they are reminded of the great prophet Elijah,[fn-10-P1069_475679:34-nf] who by calling upon God had recalled the dead to life, hiding himself from dread of Ahab, and fleeing on account of Jezebel's menaces? At which time the sons of the prophets also, being sought for in order to be slain, withdrew, and were concealed in caves by Obadiah;[fn-10-P1070_475969:35-nf] or are they unacquainted with these instances because of their antiquity? Have they forgotten also what is recorded in the Gospel, that the disciples retreated and hid themselves for fear of the Jews?[fn-10-P1071_476193:36-nf] Paul,[fn-10-P1072_476220:37-nf] when sought for by the governor [of Damascus] `was let down from the wall in a basket, and thus escaped the hands of him that sought him.' Since then Scripture relates these circumstances concerning the saints, what excuse can they fabricate for their temerity? If they charge us with `cowardice,' it is in utter insensibility to the condemnation it pronounces on themselves. If they asperse these holy men by asserting that they acted contrary to the will of God, they demonstrate their ignorance of Scripture. For it was commanded in the Law that `cities of refuge' should be constituted,[fn-10-P1073_476846:38-nf] by which provision was made that such as were pursued in order to be put to death might have means afforded of preserving themselves. Again in the consummation of the ages, when the Word of the Father, who had before spoken by Moses, came himself to the earth, he gave this express injunction, `When they persecute you in one city, flee unto another:'[fn-10-P1074_477219:39-nf] and shortly after, `When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (let whosoever reads, understand), then let those in Judea flee unto the mountains: let him that is on the house-top not come down to take anything out of his house; nor him that is in the fields return to take his clothes.'[fn-10-P1075_477598:40-nf] The saints therefore knowing these precepts, had such a sort of training for their action: for what the Lord then commanded, he had before his coming in the flesh already spoken of by his servants. And this is a universal rule for man, leading to perfection, `to practice whatever God has enjoined.' On this account the Word himself, becoming incarnate for our sake, deigned to conceal himself when he was sought for;[fn-10-P1076_478040:41-nf] and being again persecuted, condescended to withdraw to avoid the conspiracy against him. For thus it became him, by hungering and thirsting and suffering other afflictions, to demonstrate that he was indeed made man.[fn-10-P1077_478278:42-nf] For at the very commencement, as soon as he was born, he gave this direction by an angel to Joseph: `Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, for Herod will seek the infant's life.'[fn-10-P1078_478521:43-nf] And after Herod's death, it appears that for fear of his son Archelaus he retired to Nazareth. Subsequently; when he gave unquestionable evidence of his Divine character by healing the withered hand, `when the Pharisees took council how they might destroy him,[fn-10-P1079_478815:44-nf] Jesus knowing their wickedness withdrew himself thence.' Moreover, when he had raised Lazarus from the dead, and they had become still more intent on destroying him, [we are told that] `Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews,[fn-10-P1080_479080:45-nf] but retired into a region on the borders of the desert.' Again when the Saviour said, `Before Abraham was, I am;'[fn-10-P1081_479225:46-nf] and the Jews took up stones to cast at him; Jesus concealed himself, and going through the midst of them out of the Temple, went away thence, and so escaped. Since then they see these things, or rather understand them,[fn-10-P1082_479464:47-nf] (for they will not see,) are they not deserving of being burnt with fire, according to what is written, for acting and speaking so plainly contrary to all that the Lord did and taught? Finally, when John had suffered martyrdom, and his disciples had buried his body, Jesus having heard what was done, departed thence by ship into a desert place apart.[fn-10-P1083_479849:48-nf] Now the Lord did these things and so taught. But would that these men of whom I speak, had the modesty to confine their rashness to men only, without daring to be guilty of such madness as to accuse the Saviour himself of `cowardice'; especially after having already uttered blasphemies against him. But even if they be insane they will not be tolerated and their ignorance of the gospels be detected by every one. The cause for retreat and flight under such circumstances as these is reasonable and valid, of which the evangelists have afforded us precedents in the conduct of our Saviour himself: from which it may be inferred that the saints have always been justly influenced by the same principle, since whatever is recorded of him as man, is applicable to mankind in general. For he took on himself our nature, and exhibited in himself the affections of our infirmity, which John has thus indicated: `Then they sought to take him; but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.'[fn-10-P1084_480887:49-nf] Moreover, before that hour came, he himself said to his mother, `Mine hour is not yet come;'[fn-10-P1085_480999:50-nf] and to those who were denominated his brethren, `My time is not yet come.' Again when the time had arrived, he said to his disciples, `Sleep on now, and take your rest: for behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.'[fn-10-P1086_481295:51-nf] ... So[fn-10-P1087_481321:52-nf] that he neither permitted himself to be apprehended before the time came; nor when the time was come did he conceal himself, but voluntarily gave himself up to those who had conspired against him.[fn-10-P1088_481543:53-nf] ...Thus also the blessed martyrs have guarded themselves in times of persecution: being persecuted they fled, and kept themselves concealed; but being discovered they suffered martyrdom.","title":"Book III.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":7,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_08_counter_statements_of_theodoret_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"14","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Against XII.-Passion is proper to the passible; the impassible is above passions.

Having discussed marriage and continency he at length comes to virginity and says[fn-62-P6207_1880672:62-nf] \"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgement, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. I think therefore that this is good by reason of the present distress, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is,\" Here our opponent goes utterly wild with exultation: this is his strongest battering-ram with which he shakes the wall of virginity. \"See,\" says he, \"the Apostle confesses that as regards virgins he has no commandment of the Lord, and he who had with authority laid down the law respecting husbands and wives, does not dare to command what the Lord has not enjoined. And rightly too. For what is enjoined is commanded, what is commanded must be done, and that which must be done implies punishment if it be not done. For it is useless to order a thing to be done and yet leave the individual free to do it or not do it. If the Lord had commanded virginity He would have seemed to condemn marriage, and to do away with the seed-plot of mankind, of which virginity itself is a growth. If He had cut off the root, how was He to expect fruit? If the foundations were not first laid, how was He to build the edifice, and put on the roof to cover all! Excavators toil hard to remove mountains; the bowels of the earth are pierced in the search for gold. And, when the tiny particles, first by the blast of the furnace, then by the hand of the cunning workman have been fashioned into an ornament, men do not call him blessed who has separated the gold from the dross, but him who wears the beautiful gold. Do not marvel then if, placed as we are, amid temptations of the flesh and incentives to vice, the angelic life be not exacted of us, but merely recommended. If advice be given, a man is free to proffer obedience; if there be a command, he is a servant bound to compliance. \"I have no commandment,\" he says, \"of the Lord: but I give my judgement, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.\" If you have no commandment of the Lord, how dare you give judgement without orders? The Apostle will reply: Do you wish me to give orders where the Lord has offered a favour rather than laid down a law? The great Creator and Fashioner, knowing the weakness of the vessel which he made, left virginity open to those whom He addressed; and shall I, the teacher of the Gentiles, who have become all things to all men that I might gain all, shall I lay upon the necks of weak believers from the very first the burden of perpetual chastity? Let them[fn-62-P6208_1883228:63-nf] begin with short periods of release from the marriage bond, and give themselves unto prayer, that when they have tasted the sweets of chastity they may desire the perpetual possession of that wherewith they were temporarily delighted. The Lord, when tempted by the Pharisees, and asked whether according to the law of Moses it was permitted to put away a wife, forbade the practice altogether. After weighing His words the disciples said to Him:[fn-62-P6209_1883732:64-nf] \"If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry. But He said unto them, all men cannot receive this saying, but they to whom it is given. For there are eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are eunuchs, which were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, which made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\" The reason is plain why the Apostle said, \"concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord.\" Surely; because the Lord had previously said \"All men cannot receive the word, but they to whom it is given,\" and \"He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\"[fn-62-P6210_1884446:65-nf] The Master of the Christian race offers the reward, invites candidates to the course, holds in His hand the prize of virginity, points to the fountain of purity, and cries aloud[fn-62-P6211_1884691:66-nf] \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.\" \"He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.\" He does not say, you must drink, you must run, willing or unwilling: but whoever is willingand able to run and to drink, he shall conquer, he shall be satisfied. And therefore Christ loves virgins more than others, because they willingly give what was not commanded them. And it indicates greater grace to offer what you are not bound to give, than to render what is exacted of you. The apostles, contemplating the burden of a wife, exclaimed, \"If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.\" Our Lord thought well of their view. You rightly think, said He, that it is not expedient for a man who is hastening to the kingdom of heaven to take a wife: but it is a hard matter, and all men do not receive the saying, but they to whom it has been given. Some are eunuchs by nature, others by the violence of men. Those eunuchs please Me who are such not of necessity, but of free choice. Willingly do I take them into my bosom who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake, and in order to worship Me have renounced the condition of their birth. We must now explain the words, \"Those who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.\" If they who have made themselves eunuchs have the reward of the kingdom of heaven, it follows that they who have not made themselves such cannot be placed with those who have. He who is able, he says, to receive it, let him receive it. It is a mark of great faith and of great virtue, to be the pure temple of God, to offer oneself a whole burnt-offering, and, according to the same apostle, to be holy both in body and in spirit. These are the eunuchs, who thinking themselves dry trees because of their impotence, hear by the mouth of[fn-62-P6212_1886553:67-nf] Isaiah that they have a place prepared in heaven for sons and daughters. Their type is[fn-62-P6213_1886657:68-nf] Ebed-melech the eunuch in Jeremiah, and the eunuch of Queen Candace in the[fn-62-P6214_1886754:69-nf] Acts of the Apostles, who on account of the strength of his faith gained the name of a man. These are they to whom Clement, who was the successor of the Apostle Peter, and of whom the Apostle Paul makes mention, wrote letters, directing almost the whole of his discourse to the subject of virgin purity. After them there is a long series of apostolic men, martyrs, and men illustrious no less for holiness than for eloquence, with whom we may very easily become acquainted through their own writings.[fn-62-P6215_1887275:70-nf] \"I think, therefore,\" he says, \"that this is good for the present distress.\" What is this distress which, in contempt of the marriage tie, longs for the liberty of virginity?[fn-62-P6216_1887471:71-nf] \"Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days.\" We have not here a condemnation of harlots and brothels, of whose damnation there is no doubt, but of the swelling womb, and wailing infancy, the fruit as well as the work of marriage. \"For it is good for a man so to be.\" If it is good for a man so to be, it is bad for a man not so to be.[fn-62-P6217_1887864:72-nf] \"Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.\" Each one of us has his appointed bounds; let me have what is mine, and keep your own. If thou art bound to a wife, give her not a bill of divorce. If I am loosed from a wife, I will not seek a wife. As I do not dissolve marriages once contracted: so you should not bind what is loosed. And at the same time the meaning of the words must be taken into account. He who has a wife is regarded as a debtor, and is said to be uncircumcised, to be the servant of his wife, and like bad servants to be bound. But he who has no wife, in the first place owes no man anything, then is circumcised, thirdly is free, lastly, is loosed.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":7,"verse":37,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_19_an_answer_to_the_jews_","source_chapter":15,"source_paragraph":"127","folder":"ANF-03","text":"A second time, in fact, let us show that Christ is already come, (as foretold) through the prophets, and has suffered, and is already received back in the heavens, and thence is to come accordingly as the predictions prophesied.

Their object in such a malignant perversion of the true doctrine, is to show that the less exalted statements, which our Lord utters in tits humanity, are to be thought to have issued from the Godhead Itself, that so they may show their blasphemy to have a stronger case, if it is upheld by the actual acknowledgment of the Lord. For this reason it is that Eunomius says, \"He who in the last days became man did not take upon Himself the man made up of soul and body.\" But, after searching through all the inspired and sacred Scripture, I do not find any such statement as this, that the Creator of all things, at the time of His ministration here on earth for man, took upon Himself flesh only without a soul. Under stress of necessity, then, looking to the object contemplated by the plan of salvation, to the doctrines of the Fathers, and to the inspired Scriptures, I will endeavour to confute the impious falsehood which is being fabricated with regard to this matter. The Lord came \"to seek and to save that which was lost[fn-12-P1204_656584:193-nf] .\" Now it was not the body merely, but the whole man, compacted of soul and body, that was lost: indeed, if we are to speak more exactly, the soul was lost sooner than the body. For disobedience is a sin, not of the body, but of the will: and the will properly belongs to the soul, from which the whole disaster of our nature bad its beginning, as the threat of God, that admits of no falsehood, testifies in the declaration that, in the day that they should eat of the forbidden fruit, death without respite would attach to the act. Now since the condemnation of man was twofold, death correspondingly effects in each part of our nature the deprivation of the twofold life that operates in him who is thus mortally stricken. For the death of the body consists in the extinction of the means of sensible perception, and in the dissolution of the body into its kindred elements: but \"the soul that sinneth,\" he saith, \"it shall die[fn-12-P1205_657543:194-nf] .\" Now sin is nothing else than alienation from God, Who is the true and only life. Accordingly the first man lived many hundred years after his disobedience, and yet God lied not when He said, \"In the day that ye eat thereof ye shall surely die[fn-12-P1206_657814:195-nf] .\" For by the fact of his alienation from the true life, the sentence of death was ratified against him that self-same day: and after this, at a much later time, there followed also the bodily death of Adam. He therefore Who came for this cause that He might seek and save that which was lost, (that which the shepherd in the parable calls the sheep,) both finds that which is lost, and carries home on His shoulders the whole sheep, not its skin only, that He may make the man of God complete, united to the deity in body and in soul. And thus He Who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin, left no part of our nature which He did not take upon Himself. Now the soul is not sin though it is capable of admitting sin into it as the result of being ill-advised: and this He sanctifies by union with Himself for this end, that so the lump may be holy along with the first-fruits. Wherefore also the Angel, when informing Joseph of the destruction of the enemies of the Lord, said, \"They are dead which sought the young Child's life[fn-12-P1207_658887:196-nf] ,\" (or \"soul\"): and the Lord says to the Jews, \"Ye seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth[fn-12-P1208_659073:197-nf] .\" Now by \"Man\" is not meant the body of a man only, but that which is composed of both, soul and body. And again, He says to them, \"Are ye angry at Me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day[fn-12-P1209_659388:198-nf] ?\" And what He meant by \"every whit whole,\" He showed in the other Gospels, when He said to the man who was let down on a couch in the midst, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee,\" which is a healing of the soul, and, \"Arise and walk[fn-12-P1210_659636:199-nf] ,\" which has regard to the body: and in the Gospel of S. John, by liberating the soul also from its own malady after He had given health to the body, where He saith, \"Thou art made whole, sin no more[fn-12-P1211_659932:200-nf] ,\" thou, that is, who hast been cured in both, I mean in soul and in body. For so too does S. Paul speak, \"for to make in Himself of twain one new man[fn-12-P1212_660105:201-nf] .\" And so too He foretells that at the time of His Passion He would voluntarily detach His soul from His body, saying, \"No man taketh\" my soul \"from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again[fn-12-P1213_660370:202-nf] .\" Yea, the prophet David also, according to the interpretation of the great Peter, said with foresight of Him, \"Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption[fn-12-P1214_660678:203-nf] ,\" while the Apostle Peter thus expounds the saying, that \"His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see corruption.\" For His Godhead, alike before taking flesh and in the flesh and after His Passion, is immutably the same, being at all times what It was by nature, and so continuing for ever. But in the suffering of His human nature the Godhead fulfilled the dispensation for our benefit by severing the soul for a season from the body, yet without being Itself separated from either of those elements to which it was once for all united, and by joining again the elements which had been thus parted, so as to give to all human nature a beginning and an example which it should follow of the resurrection from the dead, that all the corruptible may put on incorruption, and all the mortal may put on immortality, our first-fruits having been transformed to the Divine nature by its union with God, as Peter said, \"This same Jesus Whom ye crucified, hath God made both Lord and Christ[fn-12-P1215_661720:204-nf] ;\" and we might cite many passages of Scripture to support such a position, showing how the Lord, reconciling the world to Himself by the Humanity of Christ, apportioned His work of benevolence to men between His soul and His body, willing through His soul and touching them through His body. But it would be superfluous to encumber our argument by entering into every detail.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":7,"verse":39,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_18_concerning_man_s_perfection_in_righteousness","source_chapter":28,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Then shall the Church realize, fully and perfectly, the condition of \"not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,\"[fn-26-P2672_1050472:170-nf] because then also will it in a real sense be glorious.

The Father's words, This is My Son, reveal His nature; those which follow, Hear Him, are a summons to us to listen to the mystery and the faith which He came down from heaven to bring; to learn that, if we would be saved, our confession must be a copy of His teaching.

How then is it that none of them know the Father, when the Son says that the reason why He has this knowledge is that He is from Him? If He be created, not born, we shall observe in Him a resemblance to other beings who are from God. Since all, on this supposition, are from God, why is He not as ignorant of the Father as are the others? But if this knowledge of the Father be peculiar to Him, Who is from the Father, must not this circumstance also, that He is from the Father, be peculiar to Him? That is, must He not be the true Son born from the nature of God? For the reason why He alone knows God is that He alone is from God. You observe, then, a knowledge, which is peculiar to Himself, resulting from a birth which also is peculiar to Himself.

Is this too to be proved, that the Holy Spirit is called in the sacred books the gift of God?

But as we find here that this water is the Holy Spirit, so we find elsewhere in the Gospel itself that this water is called the gift of God. For when the same Lord was talking with the woman of Samaria at the well, to whom He had said, \"Give me to drink,\" and she had answered that the Jews \"have no dealings\" with the Samaritans, Jesus answered and said unto her, \"If thou hadst known the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water.

For when, among other things, I had taught them by testimonies of the Holy Scriptures that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both, I continue: \"If, then, the Holy Spirit proceeds both from the Father and from the Son, why did the Son say, 'He proceedeth from the Father?' \"[fn-21-P2142_1082269:135-nf] Why, think you, except as He is wont to refer to Him, that also which is His own, from whom also He Himself is? Whence also is that which He saith, \"My doctrine is not mine own, but His that sent me?\"[fn-21-P2143_1082491:136-nf] If, therefore, it is His doctrine that is here understood, which yet He said was not His own, but His that sent Him, how much more is it there to be understood that the Holy Spirit proceeds also from Himself, where He so says, He proceedeth from the Father, as not to say, He proceedeth not from me? From Him, certainly, from whom the Son had his Divine nature, for He is God of God, He has also, that from Him too proceeds the Holy Spirit; and hence the Holy Spirit has from the Father Himself, that He should proceed from the Son also, as He proceeds from the Father. Here, too, in some way may this also be understood, so far as it can be understood by such as we are, why the Holy Spirit is not said to be born, but rather to proceed;[fn-21-P2144_1083251:137-nf] since if He, too, was called a Son, He would certainly be called the Son of both, which is most absurd, since no one is son of two, save of father and mother. But far be it from us to surmise any such thing as this between God the Father and God the Son. Because not even the son of men proceeds at the same time from both father and mother; but when he proceeds from the father into the mother, he does not at that time proceed from the mother; and when he proceeds from the mother into this present light, he does not at that time proceed from the father. But the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Father into the Son, and from the Son proceed to sanctify the creature, but proceeds at once from both; although the Father has given this to the Son, that He should proceed, as from Himself, so also from Him. For we cannot say that the Holy Spirit is not life, while the Father is life, and the Son is life: and hence as the Father, while He has life in Himself, has given also to the Son to have life in Himself; so has He given also to Him that life should proceed from Him, as it also proceeds from Himself.\"[fn-21-P2145_1085494:138-nf] I have transferredthis from that sermon into this book, but I was speaking to believers, not to unbelievers.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_15_book_iii_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"219","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"154.

For as its mention of \"fingers,\" \"hand,\" and \"arm,\" in speaking of God, does not by the phrase portray the structure of the limb out of bones and sinews and flesh and ligaments, but signifies by such an expression His effective and operative power, and as it indicates by each of the other words of this kind those conceptions concerning God which correspond to them, not admitting the corporeal senses of the words, so also it speaks indeed of the forms of these modes of coming into being as applied to the Divine Nature, yet does not speak in that sense which our customary knowledge enables us to understand. For when it speaks of the formative power, it calls that particular energy by the name of \"generation,\" because the word expressive of Divine power must needs descend to our lowliness, yet it does not indicate all that is associated with formative generation among ourselves,-neither place nor time nor preparation of material, nor the co-operation of instruments, nor the purpose in the things produced, but it leaves these out of sight, and greatly and loftily claims for God the generation of the things that are, where it says, \"He spake and they were begotten, He commanded and they were created[fn-18-P1851_1082649:25-nf] .\" Again, when it expounds that unspeakable and transcendent existence which the Only-begotten has from the Father, because human poverty is incapable of the truths that are too high for speech or thought, it uses our language here also, and calls Him by the name of \"Son,\"-a name which our ordinary use applies to those who are produced by matter and nature. But just as the word, which tells us in reference to God of the \"generation\" of the creation, did not add the statement that it was generated by the aid of any material, declaring that its material substance, its place, its time, and all the like, had their existence in the power of His will, so here too, in speaking of the \"Son,\" it leaves out of sight both all other things which human nature sees in earthly generation (passions, I mean, and dispositions, and the co-operation of time and the need of place, and especially matter), without all which earthly generation as a result of nature does not occur. Now every such conception of matter and interval being excluded from the sense of the word \"Son,\" nature alone remains, and hereby in the word \"Son\" is declared concerning the Only-begotten the close and true character of His manifestation from the Father. And since this particular species of generation did not suffice to produce in us an adequate idea of the unspeakable existence of the Only-begotten, it employs also another species of generation, that which is the result of efflux, to express the Divine Nature of the Son, and calls Him \"the brightness of glory[fn-18-P1852_1084218:26-nf] ,\" the \"savour of ointment[fn-18-P1853_1084261:27-nf] ,\" the \"breath of God[fn-18-P1854_1084308:28-nf] ,\" which our accustomed use, in the scientific discussion we have already made, calls material efflux. But just as in the previous cases neither the making of creation nor the significance of the word \"Son\" admitted time, or matter, or place, or passion, so here also the phrase, purifying the sense of \"brightness\" and the other terms from every material conception, and employing only that element in this particular species of generation which is suitable to the Divinity, points by the force of this mode of expression to the truth that He is conceived as being both from Him and with Him. For neither does the word \"breath\" present to us dispersion into the air from the underlying matter, nor \"savour\" the transference that takes place from the quality of the ointment to the air, nor \"brightness\" the efflux by means of rays from the body of the sun; but this only, as we have said, is manifested by this particular mode of generation, that He is conceived to be of Him and also with Him, no intermediate interval existing between the Father and that Son Who is of Him. And since, in its abundant loving-kindness, the grace of the Holy Spirit has ordered that our conceptions concerning the Only-begotten Son should arise in us from many sources, it has added also the remaining species of things contemplated in generation,-that, I mean, which is the result of mind and word. But the lofty John uses especial foresight that the hearer may not by any means by inattention or feebleness of thought fall into the common understanding of \"Word,\" so that the Son should be supposed to be the voice of the Father. For this reason he prepares us at his first proclamation to regard the Word as in essence, and not in any essence foreign to or dissevered from that essence whence It has Its being, but in that first and blessed Nature. For this is what he teaches us when he says the Word \"was in the beginning[fn-18-P1855_1086239:29-nf] ,\" and \"was with God[fn-18-P1856_1086283:30-nf] ,\" being Himself also both God and all else that the \"Beginning\" is. For thus it is that he makes his discourse on the Godhead, touching the eternity of the Only-begotten. Seeing then that these modes of generation (those, I mean, which are the result of cause) are ordinarily known among us, and are employed by Holy Scripture for our instruction on the subjects before us, in such a way as it might be expected that each of them would be applied to the presentation of Divine conceptions, let the reader of our argument \"judge righteous judgement[fn-18-P1857_1086855:31-nf] ,\" whether any of the assertions that heresy makes have any force against the truth.","title":"Book VIII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":7,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_22_homily_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"2.

Now the rule in regard to this variation has two forms. For things that signify now one thing and now another, signify either things that are contrary, or things that are only different. They signify contraries, for example, when they are used metaphorically at one time in a good sense, at another in a bad, as in the case of the leaven mentioned above. Another example of the same is that a lion stands for Christ in the place where it is said, \"The lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed;\"[fn-51-P5185_2763286:51-nf] and again, stands for the devil where it is written, \"Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour.\"[fn-51-P5186_2763444:52-nf] In the same way the serpent is used in a good sense, \"Be wise as serpents;\"[fn-51-P5187_2763538:53-nf] and again, in a bad sense, \"The serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty.\"[fn-51-P5188_2763632:54-nf] Bread is used in a good sense, \"I am the living bread which came down from heaven;\"[fn-51-P5189_2763735:55-nf] in a bad, \"Bread eaten in secret is pleasant.\"[fn-51-P5190_2763800:56-nf] And so in a great many other cases.

Some may say, Why did not Abraham's confidence in God prevent his being afraid to confess his wife? God could have warded off from him the death which he feared, and could have protected both him and his wife while among strangers, so that Sara, although very fair, should not have been desired by any one, nor Abraham killed on account of her. Of course, God could have done this; it would be absurd to deny it. But if, in reply to the people, Abraham had told them that Sara was his wife, his trust in God would have included both his own life and the chastity of Sara. Now it is part of sound doctrine, that when a man has any means in his power, he should not tempt the Lord his God. So it was not because the Saviour was unable to protect His disciples that He told them, \"When ye are persecuted in one city, flee to another.\"[fn-21-P2116_1260229:62-nf] And He Himself set the example. For though He had the power of laying down His own life, and did not lay it down till He chose to do so, still when an infant He fled to Egypt, carried by His parents;[fn-21-P2117_1260447:63-nf] and when He went up to the feast, He went not openly, but secretly, though at other times He spoke openly to the Jews, who in spite of their rage and hostility could not lay hands on Him, because His hour was not come,[fn-21-P2118_1260685:64-nf] -not the hour when He would be obliged to die, but the hour when He would consider it seasonable to be put to death. Thus He who displayed divine power by teaching and reproving openly, without allowing the rage of his enemies to hurt Him, did also, by escaping and concealing Himself, exhibit the conduct becoming the feebleness of men, that they should not tempt God when they have any means in their power of escaping threatened danger. So also in the apostle, it was not from despair of divine assistance and protection, or from loss of faith, that he was let down over the wall in a basket, in order to escape being taken by his enemies:[fn-21-P2119_1261351:65-nf] not from want of faith in God did he thus escape, but because not to escape, when this escape was possible, would have been tempting God. Accordingly, when Abraham was among strangers, and when, on account of the remarkable beauty of Sara, both his life and her chastity were in danger, since it was in his power to protect not both of these, but one only,-his life, namely,-to avoid tempting God he did what he could; and in what he could not do, he trusted to God. Unable to conceal his being a man, he concealed his being a husband, test he should be put to death; trusting to God to preserve his wife's purity.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":18,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Having expiscated the \"to us\" and the \"absolutely\"-santification and redemption being \"to us\" and not absolute, wisdom and redemption both to us and absolute-we must not omit to enquire into the position of righteousness in the same passage.

But it was with the view of tempting Him, that they had mentioned to Him a mother and brethren which He did not possess. The Scripture says nothing of this, although it is not in other instances silent when anything was done against Him by way of temptation. \"Behold,\" it says, \"a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him.\"[fn-93-P9364_2573482:103-nf] And in another passage: \"The Pharisees also came unto Him, tempting Him.\" Who[fn-93-P9365_2573579:104-nf] was to prevent its being in this place also indicated that this was done with the view of tempting Him? I do not admit what you advance of your own apart from Scripture. Then there ought to be suggested[fn-93-P9366_2573835:105-nf] some occasion[fn-93-P9367_2573865:106-nf] for the temptation. What could they have thought to be in Him which required temptation? The question, to be sure, whether He had been born or not? For if this point were denied in His answer, it might come out on the announcement of a temptation. And yet no temptation, when aiming at the discovery of the point which prompts the temptation by its doubtfulness, falls upon one so abruptly, as not to be preceded by the question which compels the temptation whilst raising the doubt. Now, since the nativity of Christ had never come into question, how can you contend that they meant by their temptation to inquire about a point on which they had never raised a doubt? Besides,[fn-93-P9368_2574559:107-nf] if He had to be tempted about His birth, this of course was not the proper way of doing it,-by announcing those persons who, even on the supposition of His birth, might possibly not have been in existence. We have all been born, and yet all of us have not either brothers or mother. He might with more probability have had even a father than a mother, and uncles more likely than brothers. Thus is the temptation about His birth unsuitable, for it might have been contrived without any mention of either His mother or His brethren. It is clearly more credible that, being certain that He had both a mother and brothers, they tested His divinity rather than His nativity, whether, when within, He knew what was without; being tried by the untrue announcement of the presence of persons who were not present. But the artifice of a temptation might have been thwarted thus: it might have happened that He knew that those whom they were announcing to be \"standing without,\" were in fact absent by the stress either of sickness, or of business, or a journey which He was at the time aware of. No one tempts (another) in a way in which he knows that he may have himself to bear the shame of the temptation. There being, then, no suitable occasion for a temptation, the announcement that His mother and His brethren had actually turned up[fn-93-P9369_2575917:108-nf] recovers its naturalness. But there is some ground for thinking that Christ's answer denies His mother and brethren for the present, as even Apelles might learn. \"The Lord's brethren had not yet believed in Him.\"[fn-93-P9370_2576153:109-nf] So is it contained in the Gospel which was published before Marcion's time; whilst there is at the same time a want of evidence of His mother's adherence to Him, although the Marthas and the other Marys were in constant attendance on Him. In this very passage indeed, their unbelief is evident. Jesus was teaching the way of life, preaching the kingdom of God and actively engaged in healing infirmities of body and soul; but all the while, whilst strangers were intent on Him, His very nearest relatives were absent. By and by they turn up, and keep outside; but they do not go in, because, forsooth, they set small store[fn-93-P9371_2576796:110-nf] on that which was doing within; nor do they even wait,[fn-93-P9372_2576884:111-nf] as if they had something which they could contribute more necessary than that which He was so earnestly doing; but they prefer to interrupt Him, and wish to call Him away from His great work Now, I ask you, Apelles, or will you Marcion, please (to tell me), if you happened to be at a stage play, or had laid a wager[fn-93-P9373_2577230:112-nf] on a foot race or a chariot race, and were called away by such a message, would you not have exclaimed, \"What are mother and brothers to me? \"[fn-93-P9374_2577426:113-nf] And did not Christ, whilst preaching and manifesting God, fulfilling the law and the prophets, and scattering the darkness of the long preceding age, justly employ this same form of words, in order to strike the unbelief of those who stood outside, or to shake off the importunity of those who would call Him away from His work? If, however, He had meant to deny His own nativity, He would have found place, time, and means for expressing Himself very differently,[fn-93-P9375_2577974:114-nf] and not in words which might be uttered by one who had both a mother and brothers. When denying one's parents in indignation, one does not deny their existence, but censures their faults. Besides, He gave Others the preference; and since He shows their title to this favour-even because they listened to the word (of God)-He points out in what sense He denied His mother and His brethren. For in whatever sense He adopted as His own those who adhered to Him, in that did He deny as His[fn-93-P9376_2578526:115-nf] those who kept aloof from Him. Christ also is wont to do to the utmost that which He enjoins on others. How strange, then, would it certainly[fn-93-P9377_2578700:116-nf] have been, if, while he was teaching others not to esteem mother, or father, or brothers, as highly as the word of God, He were Himself to leave the word of God as soon as His mother and brethren were announced to Him! He denied His parents, then, in the sense in which He has taught us to deny ours-for God's work. But there is also another view of the case: in the abjured mother there is a figure of the synagogue, as well as of the Jews in the unbelieving brethren. In their person Israel remained outside, whilst the new disciples who kept close to Christ within, hearing and believing, represented the Church, which He called mother in a preferable sense and a worthier brotherhood, with the repudiation of the carnal relationship. It was in just the same sense, indeed, that He also replied to that exclamation (of a certain woman), not denying His mother's \"womb and paps,\" but designating those as more \"blessed who hear the word of God.\"[fn-93-P9378_2579691:117-nf] ","title":"On the Flesh of Christ.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":7,"verse":37,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"ANF-10","text":"\"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.\" As He who is peculiarly the Son of God, being no other than the Logos, yet makes use of Logos (reason)-for He was the Logos in the beginning, and was with God, the Logos of God-so John, the servant of that Logos, being, if we take the Scripture to mean what it says, no other than a voice, yet uses his voice to point to the Logos.

For I am an old man and my wife well stricken in years.\" For his want of faith with regard to the birth of the voice, he is himself deprived of his voice, as the angel Gabriel says to him, \"Behold, thou shall be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.\" And afterwards when he had \"asked for a writing tablet and written, His name is John; and they all marvelled,\" he recovered his voice; for \"his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue, and he spake, blessing God.\" We discussed above how it is to be understood that the Logos is the Son of God, and went over the ideas connected with that; and a similar sequence of ideas is to be observed at this point. John came for a witness; he was a man sent from God to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe; he was that voice, then, we are to understand, which alone was fitted worthily to announce the Logos. We shall understand this aright if we call to mind what was adduced in our exposition of the texts: \"That all might believe through Him,\" and \"This is he of whom it is written, Behold I send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.\"[fn-67-P6782_1226620:62-nf] There is fitness, too, in his being said to be the voice, not of one saying in the wilderness, but of one crying in the wilderness. He who cries, \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord,\" also says it; but he might say it without crying it. But he cries and shouts it, that even those may hear who are at a distance from the speaker, and that even the deaf may understand the greatness of the tidings, since it is announced in a great voice; and he thus brings help, both to those who have departed from God and to those who have lost the acuteness of their hearing. This, too, was the reason why \"Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink.\" Hence, too,[fn-67-P6783_1227324:63-nf] \"John beareth witness of Him, and cried, saying,\" \"Hence also God commands Isaiah to cry, with the voice of one saying, Cry. And I said, What shall I cry? \"The physical voice we use in prayer need not be great nor startling; even should we not lift up any great cry or shout, God will yet hear us. He says to Moses,[fn-67-P6784_1227657:64-nf] \"Why criest thou unto Me? \"when Moses had not cried audibly at all. It is not recorded in Exodus that he did so; but Moses had cried mightily to God in prayer with that voice which is heard by God alone. Hence David also says,[fn-67-P6785_1227904:65-nf] \"With my voice I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me.\" And one who cries in the desert has need of a voice, that the soul which is deprived of God and deserted of truth-and what more dreadful desert is there than a soul deserted of God and of all virtue, since it still goes crookedly and needs instruction-may be exhorted to make straight the way of the Lord. And that way is made straight by the man who, far from copying the serpent's crooked journey: while he who is of the contrary disposition perverts his way. Hence the rebuke directed to a man of this kind and to all who resemble him, \"Why pervert ye the right ways of the Lord? \"[fn-67-P6786_1228564:66-nf] ","title":"Sixth Book","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":7,"verse":37,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_41_sixth_book","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"83","folder":"ANF-10","text":"As for the saying, \"There standeth one among you whom you know not,\" we are led by it to consider the Son of God, the Word, by whom all things were made, since He exists in substance throughout the underlying nature of things, being the same as wisdom.

Our Lord then saw that Simon the Pharisee did not believe the signs and wonders which he had seen. He came to him to persuade him with humble words; and humble utterances overcame him, whom mighty wonders had not overcome. What then are the wonders which that Pharisee had seen? He had seen the dead raised to life, the lepers cleansed, the blind with eyes opened. These signs compelled that Pharisee to entertain our Lord as a prophet. But he who entertained Him as a prophet, changed so as to despise Him for one who had not knowledge, saying (namely);-Had this man been a prophet, He would have known that this woman-who had approached Him-is a sinner. But we may despise the Pharisee and say, Had he been a man of discernment,[fn-38-P3800_1242815:45-nf] he would have learned from that sinful woman, who approached our Lord, not that He was a prophet, but the Lord of the Prophets. For the tears of the sinful woman testified, that it was not a prophet they were propitiating, but Him, Who, as God, was wroth with her sins. For, because the prophets sufficed not to raise sinners to life, the Lord of the prophets came down to heal those who were in evil case. But what physician is there who hinders the smitten, that they should not come to him, O blind Pharisee, as it befel that she came to our Physician! For why did the smitten woman approach Him,-she, whose wounds were healed by her tears? He Who had come down to be a fountain of healing amongst the diseased, was proclaiming this;-Let every one that is athirst, come and drink.[fn-38-P3801_1243618:46-nf] But when the Pharisees, this man's companions, murmured at the healing of sinners, the Physician taught concerning His art, that the door is opened for the diseased and not for the whole, for they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick.[fn-38-P3802_1243894:47-nf] Therefore the praise of the physician is the healing of the diseased;-that the shame of the Pharisee who reproved the praise of our physician may be greater. But our Lord used to show signs in the streets; and also when He entered into the house of the Pharisee, He showed signs which were greater than those He had shown outside. For in the street He made whole the bodies that were sick, but within He healed the souls that were diseased. Outside, He raised to life the mortality of Lazarus: but within, He raised to life the mortality of the sinful woman. He restored the living soul to the corpse from which it had gone out; And He expelled from the sinful woman the deadly sin which dwelt within her. But the blind (Pharisee) who was insufficient for great things, because of the great things which he saw not, belied those small things which he had seen. For he was a son of Israel who attributed weakness to his God, and not to himself. For (Israel said), Though He smote the rock and the waters flowed, can He also give us bread?[fn-38-P3803_1244954:48-nf] But when our Lord saw his weakness, that it missed the great things and, because of them, the small things also, He hasted to put forward a simple word, as though for a babe that was being reared on milk, and was not capable of solid food.","title":"On Our Lord.","author":"Ephraim Syrus"},{"chapter":7,"verse":39,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_42_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"124","folder":"ANF-10","text":"But let us next see what was the thought of Peter when he answered and said to Jesus, \"Lord, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, \"[fn-81-P8166_1753216:239-nf] etc. And on this account these words call for very special examination, because Mark, in his own person, has added, \"For he wist not what to answer,\"[fn-81-P8167_1753413:240-nf] but Luke, \"not knowing,\" he says, \"what he spake.\"[fn-81-P8168_1753483:241-nf] You will consider, therefore, if he spake these things as in a trance, being filled with the spirit which moved him to say these things, which could not be a Holy Spirit; for John taught in the Gospel that, before the resurrection of the Saviour, no one had the Holy Spirit, saying, \"For the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\"[fn-81-P8169_1753853:242-nf] But if the Spirit was not yet, and he, not knowing what he said, spoke under the influence of some spirit, the spirit which caused these things to be said was some one of the spirits which had not yet been triumphed over in the cross, nor made a show of along with them, about whom it is written, \"Having put off from Himself the principalities and the powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in the cross.[fn-81-P8170_1754301:243-nf] \" But this spirit was perhaps that which is called a stumbling-block by Jesus, and which is spoken of as Satan in the passage, \"Get thee behind Me, Satan; thou art a stumbling-block unto me.'[fn-81-P8171_1754513:244-nf] But I know well that such things will offend many who meet with them, because they think thai it is opposed to sound reason that he should be spoken ill of who a little before had been pronounced blessed by Jesus, on the ground that the Father in heaven had revealed to him the things concerning the Saviour, to-wit, that He was verily Jesus, and the Christ, and the Son of the living God. But let such an one attend more exactly to the statements about Peter and the rest of the Apostles, how even they made requests as if they were yet alien from Him who was to redeem them from the enemy and purchase them with His own precious blood; or let them also, who will have it that even before the passion of Jesus the Apostles were perfect, tell us whence it came about that \"Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep.\"[fn-81-P8172_1755366:245-nf] But to anticipate something else of what follows and apply it to the subject in hand, I would raise in turn these questions,-whether it is possible for any one to find occasion of stumbling in Jesus apart from the working of the devil who caused him to stumble; and whether it is possible for any one to deny Jesus, and that in presence of a little maid and a doorkeeper and men most worthless, unless a spirit had been with him in his denial hostile to the Spirit which is given and the wisdom, (which is given) to those who are assisted by God to make confession, according to a certain desert of theirs. But he who has learned to refer the roots of sin to the father of sin, the devil, will not say that apart from him either the Apostles were caused to stumble, or that Peter denied Christ thrice before that well-known cock-crowing. But if this be so, consider whether perhaps with a view to make Jesus stumble, so far as was in his power, and to turn Him aside from the dispensation whose characteristic was suffering that brought salvation to men, which He undertook with great willingness, seeking to effect these things which seemed to contribute to this end, he himself also here wishes as it were, by deceit, to draw away Jesus, as if calling upon Him no longer to condescend to men, and come to them, and undergo death for them, but to abide on the high mountain with Moses and Elijah. But he promised also to build three tabernacles, one apart for Jesus, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah, as if one tabernacle would not have sufficed for the three, if it had been necessary for them to be in tabernacles and in the high mountain. And perhaps also in this he acted with evil intent, when he incited him \"who did not know what he said,\" not desiring that Jesus and Moses and Elijah should be together, but desiring to separate them from one another, under pretext of the three tabernacles.\" And likewise it was a lie, \"It is good for us to be here; \"[fn-81-P8173_1757353:246-nf] for if it had been a good thing they would also have remained there. But if it were a lie, you will seek to know who caused the lie to be spoken; and especially since according to John, \"When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar and the father thereof; \"[fn-81-P8174_1757653:247-nf] and as there is no truth apart from the working of Him who says, \"I am the Truth,\"[fn-81-P8175_1757758:248-nf] so there is no lie apart from him who is the enemy of truth. These contrary qualities, accordingly, were still in Peter truth and falsehood; and from truth he said, \"Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God,\"[fn-81-P8176_1757993:249-nf] but from falsehood he said, \"May God be propitious to Thee, Lord, this shall not be unto Thee,\"[fn-81-P8177_1758111:250-nf] and also, \"It is good for us to be here.\"[fn-81-P8178_1758175:251-nf] But if any one will not admit that Peter spoke these things from any evil inspiration, but that his words were of his own mere choice, and it is demanded of him how he will interpret, \"not knowing what he said,\" and,[fn-81-P8179_1758414:252-nf] \"for he did not know what to answer,\"[fn-81-P8180_1758472:253-nf] he will say, that in the former case Peter held it to be a shameful thing and unworthy of Jesus to admit that the Son of the living God, the Christ, whom already the Father had revealed to him, should be killed; and in the: present case that, as having seen the two forms of Jesus and the one at the transfiguration which was much more excellent, being well pleased with that, he said that it was good to make their sojourning in that mountain, in order that he himself and those with him might rejoice as they beheld the transfiguration of Jesus and His face shining as the sun. and His garments white as the light, and, in addition to these things, might always behold in glory those whom they had once seen in glory, Moses and Elijah; and that they might rejoice at the things which they might hear, as they talked and held intercourse with each other, Moses and Elijah with Jesus, and Jesus with them.","title":"Book XII."},{"chapter":7,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_40_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"39","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"I have read the document sent from the East by our friend and good brother to a distinguished member of the Senate, Pammachius, which you have copied and forwarded to me.

Further, what is said in the promise of the Paraclete shows that it cannot possibly refer to Manichaeus, who came so many years after.

In the same way, the Cataphrygians[fn-25-P2516_1521809:34-nf] said that they had received the promised Paraclete; and so they fell away from the Catholic faith, forbidding what Paul allowed, and condemning second marriages, which he made lawful. They turned to their own use the words spoken of the Spirit, \"He shall lead you into all truth,\" as if, forsooth, Paul and the other apostles had not taught all the truth, but had left room for the Paraclete of the Cataphrygians. The same meaning they forced from the words of Paul: \"We know in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away;\"[fn-25-P2517_1522526:35-nf] making out that the apostle knew and prophesied in part, when he said, \"Let him do what he will; if he marries, he sinneth not,\"[fn-25-P2518_1522680:36-nf] and that this is done away by the perfection of the Phrygian Paraclete.[fn-25-P2519_1522773:37-nf] And if they are told that they are condemned by the authority of the Church, which is the subject of such ancient promises, and is spread all over the world, they reply that this is in exact fulfillment of what is said of the Paraclete, that the world cannot receive Him.[fn-25-P2520_1523060:38-nf] And are not those passages, \"He shall lead you into all truth,\" and, \"When that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away,\" and, \"The world cannot receive Him,\" precisely those in which you find a prediction of Manichaeus? And so every heresy arising under the name of the Paraclete will have the boldness to make an equally plausible application to itself of such texts. For there is no heresy but will call itself the truth; and the prouder it is, the more likely it will be to call itself perfect truth: and so it will profess to lead into all truth; and since that which is perfect has come by it, it will try to do away with the doctrine of the apostles, to which its own errors are opposed. And as the Church holds by the earnest admonition of the apostle, that \"whoever preaches another gospel to you than that which ye have received, let him be accursed;\"[fn-25-P2521_1523968:39-nf] when the heretical preacher begins to be pronounced accursed by all the world, will he not forthwith exclaim, This is what is written, \"The world cannot receive Him\"?","title":"Book XXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_41_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"125","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"44. It remains that every reader of this book should give his suffrage for one or the other of us, judging as he desires that he may himself be judged by God; and that he should not injure his own soul by favoring either party unjustly. Also, my beloved son Apronianus, go to Pammachius, that saintly man whose letter is put forward by our friend in this Invective or Bill of Indictment of his, and adjure him in Christ's name to incline in his judgment to the cause of innocence not that of party-spirit: it is the cause of truth that is at stake, and religion not party should be our guide. It is a precept of our Lord[fn-90-P9005_2373783:73-nf] to \"judge not according to the appearance, but judge a righteous judgment,\" and, just as in each one of the least of his brethren it is Christ who is thirsty and hungry, who is clothed and fed; so in these who are unjustly judged it is He who is judged unrighteously. When some are hated without a cause, he will speak on their behalf and say:[fn-90-P9006_2374146:74-nf] \"You have hated me without a cause.\" What judgment does he think will be formed of this cause and of his action in it before the tribunal of Christ? He remembers well no doubt how, when the men we are speaking of had written and published his books against Jovinian, and men were already reading them and finding fault with them, he withdrew them from the hands of the readers, and stopped their remarks, and blamed them for their blame of his friend; and how, further, he sent the books back to the author, with the suggestion that he should either correct those passages which had been found fault with, or in any way that he would set matters right. But when what I had written fell into his hands,-it was not then a book but merely a number of imperfect, uncorrected papers, which had been subtracted by fraud and theft by some scoundrel; he did not bring it to me and complain of it, though I was close at hand; he did not deign even to rebuke me or to convict me of wrong through some friend, as it might have been, or even some enemy; but sent my papers to the East, and set to work the tongue of that man who never yet knew how to control it. Would it have been against the precepts of our religion if he had met me face to face? Did he think me so utterly unworthy of holding converse with him, that it was not worth while even to argue with me? Yet for us too Christ died, for our salvation also He shed his blood. We are sinners, I grant, but we belong to his flock and are numbered among his sheep. Pammachius, however, must be held in honour for his excellent deeds wrought through faith in Christ, which should be an example to all others; for he has counted his rank as nothing worth, and has made himself equal to the humble; consequently, I was unwilling to see him carried away by human partisanship and contention, lest his faith should suffer damage in any way. At all events we shall see how far he preserves a right judgment when he sees that that great master Jerome[fn-90-P9007_2376155:75-nf] taught, in the commentaries which he selected as satisfactory even after his repentance, the very things which he condemns in others as being alien to his own teaching. We shall think that his former action was a mistake due to ignorance if he recognizes it and sets it right.

But we, with but as poor a measure of understanding as of faith, are able to determine that that baptism was divine indeed, (yet in respect of the command, not in respect of efficacy[fn-115-P11597_3270340:98-nf] too, in that we read that John was sent by the lord to perform this duty, )[fn-115-P11598_3270432:99-nf] but human in its nature: for it conveyed nothing celestial, but it fore-ministered to things celestial; being, to wit, appointed over repentance, which is in man's power.[fn-115-P11599_3270625:100-nf] In fact, the doctors of the law and the Pharisees, who were unwilling to \"believe,\" did not \"repent\" either.[fn-116-P11600_3270872:101-nf] But if repentance is a thing human, its baptism must necessarily be of the same nature: else, if it had been celestial, it would have given both the Holy Spirit and remission of sins. But none either pardons sins or freely grants the Spirit save God only.[fn-116-P11601_3271169:102-nf] Even the Lord Himself said that the Spirit would not descend on any other condition, but that He should first ascend to the Father.[fn-116-P11602_3271360:103-nf] What the Lord was not yet conferring, of course the servant could not furnish. Accordingly, in the Acts of the Apostles, we find that men who had \"John's baptism\" had not received the Holy Spirit, whom they knew not even by hearing.[fn-116-P11603_3271616:104-nf] That, then, was no celestial thing which furnished no celestial (endowments): whereas the very thing which was celestial in John-the Spirit of prophecy-so completely failed, after the transfer of the whole Spirit to the Lord, that he presently sent to inquire whether He whom he had himself preached,[fn-116-P11604_3271955:105-nf] whom he had pointed out when coming to him, were \"HE.\"[fn-116-P11605_3272050:106-nf] And so \"the baptism of repentance\"[fn-116-P11606_3272147:107-nf] was dealt with[fn-116-P11607_3272182:108-nf] as if it were a candidate for the remission and sanctification shortly about to follow in Christ: for in that John used to preach \"baptism for the remission of sins,\"[fn-116-P11608_3272366:109-nf] the declaration was made with reference to future remission; if it be true, (as it is, ) that repentance is antecedent, remission subsequent; and this is \"preparing the way.\"[fn-116-P11609_3272559:110-nf] But he who \"prepares\" does not himself \"perfect,\" but procures for another to perfect.

The people of the Hebrews, as we learn, after many sufferings, and after accomplishing their weary course in the desert, did not enter the land of promise until it had first been brought, with Joshua for its guide and the pilot of its life, to the passage of the Jordan[fn-41-P4181_2762977:25-nf] . But it is clear that Joshua also, who set up the twelve stones in the stream[fn-41-P4182_2763076:26-nf] , was anticipating the coming of the twelve disciples, the ministers of Baptism. Again, that marvellous sacrifice of the old Tishbite[fn-41-P4183_2763229:27-nf] , that passes all human understanding, what else does it do but prefigure in action the Faith in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and redemption? For when all the people of the Hebrews had trodden underfoot the religion of their fathers, and fallen into the error of polytheism, and their king Ahab was deluded by idolatry, with Jezebel, of ill-omened name, as the wicked partner of his life, and the vile prompter of his impiety, the prophet, filled with the grace of the Spirit, coming to a meeting with Ahab, withstood the priests of Baal in a marvellous and wondrous contest in the sight of the king and all the people; and by proposing to them the task of sacrificing the bullock without fire, he displayed them in a ridiculous and wretched plight, vainly praying and crying aloud to gods that were not. At last, himself invoking his own and the true God, he accomplished the test proposed with further exaggerations and additions. For he did not simply by prayer bring down the fire from heaven upon the wood when it was dry, but exhorted and enjoined the attendants to bring abundance of water. And when he had thrice poured out the barrels upon the cleft wood, he kindled at his prayer the fire from out of the water, that by the contrariety of the elements, so concurring in friendly cooperation, he might show with superabundant force the power of his own God. Now herein, I by that wondrous sacrifice, Elijah clearly proclaimed to us the sacramental rite of Baptism that should afterwards be instituted. For the fire was kindled by water thrice poured upon it, so that it is clearly shown that where the mystic water is, there is the kindling, warm, and fiery Spirit, that burns up the ungodly, and illuminates the faithful. Yes, and yet again his disciple Elisha, when Naaman the Syrian, who was diseased with leprosy, had come to him as a suppliant, cleanses the sick man by washing him in Jordan[fn-41-P4184_2765171:28-nf] , clearly indicating what should come, both by the use of water generally, and by the dipping in the river in particular. For Jordan alone of rivers, receiving in itself the first-fruits of sanctification and benediction, conveyed in its channel to the whole world, as it were from some fount in the type afforded by itself, the grace of Baptism. These then are indications in deed and act of regeneration by Baptism. Let us for the rest consider the prophecies of it in words and language. Isaiah cried saying, \"Wash you, make you clean, put away evil from your souls[fn-41-P4185_2765760:29-nf] ;\" and David, \"Draw nigh to Him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed[fn-41-P4186_2765871:30-nf] .\" And Ezekiel, writing more clearly and plainly than them both, says, \"And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I give you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh, and my Spirit will I put within you[fn-41-P4187_2766307:31-nf] .\" Most manifestly also does Zechariah prophesy of Joshua[fn-41-P4188_2766410:32-nf] , who was clothed with the filthy garment (to wit, the flesh of a servant, even ours), and stripping him of his ill-favoured raiment adorns him with the clean arid fair apparel; teaching us by the figurative illustration that verily in the Baptism of Jesus[fn-41-P4189_2766795:33-nf] all we, putting off our sins like some poor and patched garment, are clothed in the holy and most fair garment of regeneration. And where shall we place that oracle of Isaiah, which cries to the wilderness, \"Be glad, O thirsty wilderness: let the desert rejoice and blossom as a lily: and the desolate places of Jordan shall blossom and shall rejoice[fn-41-P4190_2767454:34-nf] \"? For it is clear that it is not to places without soul or sense that he proclaims the good tidings of joy: but he speaks, by the figure of the desert, of the soul that is parched and unadorned, even as David also, when he says, \"My soul is unto Thee as a thirsty land[fn-41-P4191_2767762:35-nf] ,\" and, \"My soul is athirst for the mighty, for the living God[fn-41-P4192_2767852:36-nf] .\" So again the Lord says in the Gospels, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink[fn-41-P4193_2767977:37-nf] ;\" and to the woman of Samaria, \"Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst[fn-41-P4194_2768162:38-nf] .\" And \"the excellency of Carmel\"[fn-41-P4195_2768229:39-nf] is given to the soul that bears the likeness to the desert, that is, the grace bestowed through the Spirit. For since Elijah dwelt in Carmel, and the mountain became famous and renowned by the virtue of him who dwelt there, and since moreover John the Baptist, illustrious in the spirit of Elijah, sanctified the Jordan, therefore the prophet foretold that \"the excellency of Carmel\" should be given to the river. And \"the glory of Lebanon[fn-41-P4196_2768687:40-nf] ,\" from the similitude of its lofty trees, he transfers to the river. For as great Lebanon presents a sufficient cause of wonder in the very trees which it brings forth and nourishes, so is the Jordan glorified by regenerating men and planting them in the Paradise of God: and of them, as the words of the Psalmist say, ever blooming and bearing the foliage of virtues, \"the leaf shall not wither[fn-41-P4197_2769099:41-nf] ,\" and God shall be glad, receiving their fruit in due season, rejoicing, like a good planter, in his own works. And the inspired David, foretelling also the voice which the Father uttered from heaven upon the Son at His Baptism, that He might lead the hearers, who till then had looked upon that low estate of His Humanity which was perceptible by their senses, to the dignity of nature that belongs to the Godhead, wrote in his book that passage, \"The voice of the Lord is upon the waters, the voice of the Lord in majesty[fn-41-P4198_2769663:42-nf] .\" But here we must make an end of the testimonies from the Divine Scriptures: for the discourse would extend to an infinite length if one should seek to select every passage in detail, and set them forth in a single book.","title":"On the Baptism of Christ","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":7,"verse":38,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_43_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"91","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"34.

These prefaces, as if by some prophetic foresight, gave the answer to the calumnies that were coming, thus fulfilling the proverb, \"The antidote before the poison.\" What harm has been done to the churches by my translation?You bought up, as I knew, at great cost the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and the Jewish authors of the fifth and sixth translations. Your Origen, or, that I may not seem to be wounding you with fictitious praises, our Origen,(for I may call him ours for his genius and learning, though not for the truth of his doctrines) in all his books explains and expounds not only the Septuagint but the Jewish versions. Eusebius and Didymus do the same. I do not mention Apollinarius, who, with a laudable zeal though not according to knowledge, attempted to patch up into one garment the rags of all the translations, and to weave a consistent text of Scripture at his own discretion, not according to any sound rule of criticism. The Hebrew Scriptures are used by apostolic men; they are used, as is evident, by the apostles and evangelists. Our Lord and Saviour himself whenever he refers to the Scriptures, takes his quotations from the Hebrew; as in the instance of the words[fn-93-P9367_2564319:65-nf] \"He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water,\" and in the words used on the cross itself, \"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani,\" which is by interpretation \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" not, as it is given by the Septuagint, \"My God, my God, look upon me, why hast thou forsaken me?\" and many similar cases. I do not say this in order to aim a blow at the seventy translators; but I assert that the Apostles of Christ bare an authority superior to theirs. Wherever the Seventy agree with the Hebrew, the apostles took their quotations from that translation; but, where they disagree, they set down in Greek what they had found in the Hebrew. And further, I give a challenge to my accuser. I have shown that many things are set down in the New Testament as coming from the older books, which are not to be found in the Septuagint; and I have pointed out that these exist in the Hebrew. Now let him show that there is anything in the New Testament which comes from tile Septuagint but which is not found in the Hebrew, and our controversy is at an end.","title":"Book II.","author":"Rufinus"},{"chapter":7,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_46_homily_xl_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"11","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Thus, lest they have ground of obstinacy, and of accusing him again of transgression, He convicts them by this example.

Sixthly, let it be asserted that it is written, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do.[fn-45-P4530_1426571:39-nf] The solution of this is as follows:-Can and Cannot are not words with only one meaning, but have many meanings. On the one hand they are used sometimes in respect of deficiency of strength, sometimes in respect of time, and sometimes relatively to a certain object; as for instance, A Child cannot be an Athlete, or, A Puppy cannot see, or fight with so and so. Perhaps some day the child will be an athlete, the puppy will see, will fight with that other, though it may still be unable to fight with Any other. Or again, they may be used of that which is Generally true. For instance,-A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid;[fn-45-P4531_1427218:40-nf] while yet it might possibly be hidden by another higher hill being in a line with it. Or in another sense they are used of a thing which is not reasonable; as, Can the Children of the Bridechamber fast while the Bridegroom is with them;[fn-45-P4532_1427473:41-nf] whether He be considered as visible in bodily form (for the time of His sojourning among us was not one of mourning, but of gladness), or, as the Word. For why should they keep a bodily fast who are cleansed by the Word?[fn-45-P4533_1427713:42-nf] Or, again, they are used of that which is contrary to the will; as in, He could do no mighty works there because of their unbelief,[fn-45-P4534_1427862:43-nf] -i.e. of those who should receive them. For since in order to healing there is need of both faith in the patient and power in the Healer,[fn-45-P4535_1428018:44-nf] when one of the two failed the other was impossible. But probably this sense also is to be referred to the head of the unreasonable. For healing is not reasonable in the case of those who would afterwards be injured by unbelief. The sentence The world cannot hate you,[fn-45-P4536_1428427:45-nf] comes under the same head, as does also How can ye, being evil, speak good things?[fn-45-P4537_1428528:46-nf] For in what sense is either impossible, except that it is contrary to the will? There is a somewhat similar meaning in the expressions which imply that a thing impossible by nature is possible to God if He so wills;[fn-45-P4538_1428764:47-nf] as that a man cannot be born a second time,[fn-45-P4539_1428828:48-nf] or that a needle will not let a camel through it.[fn-45-P4540_1428896:49-nf] For what could prevent either of these things happening, if God so willed?","title":"Oration XXX.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":7,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_50_homily_xliv_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"And what was it they wished to say?

A hard matter has he put to us, my brethren! It is well for us that he should tell us himself how we are to discern them. He is about to tell us: fear not: but first see; mark: see that hereby is expressed the very thing that vain heretics[fn-44-P4403_2379452:47-nf] taunt us withal. Mark, see what he says, \"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they be from God.\" The Holy Spirit is spoken of in the Gospel by the name of water; where the Lord \"cried and said, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\"[fn-44-P4404_2379821:48-nf] But the evangelist has expounded of what He said this: for he goes on to say, \"But this spake He of the Spirit, which they that believed on Him should receive.\" Wherefore did not the Lord baptize many? But what saith he? \"For the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.\" Then seeing those had baptism, and had not yet received the Holy Ghost, whom on the day of Pentecost the Lord sent from heaven, the glorifying of the Lord was first waited for, so that the Spirit might be given. Even before He was glorified, and before He sent the Spirit, He yet invited men to prepare themselves for the receiving of the water of which He said, \"Whoso thirsteth, let him come and drink;\" and, \"He that believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.\" What meaneth, \"Rivers of living water\"? What is that water? Let no man ask me; ask the Gospel. \"But this,\" saith it, \"He said of the Spirit, which they should receive that should believe on Him.\" Consequently, the water of the sacrament is one thing: another, the water which betokens the Spirit of God. The water of the sacrament is visible: the water of the Spirit invisible. That washes the body, and betokens that which is done in the soul. By this Spirit the soul itself is cleansed and fed. This is the Spirit of God, which heretics and all that cut themselves off from the Church, cannot have. And whosoever do not openly cut themselves off, but by iniquity are cut off, and being within, whirl about as chaff and are not grain; these have not this Spirit. This Spirit is denoted by the Lord under the name of water: and we have heard from this epistle, \"Believe not every spirit;\" and those words of Solomon bear witness, \"From strange water keep thee far.\"[fn-44-P4405_2381603:49-nf] What meaneth, \"water\"? Spirit. Does water always signify spirit? Not always: but in some places it signifies the Spirit, in some places it signifies baptism, in some places signifies peoples,[fn-44-P4406_2381819:50-nf] in some places signifies counsel: thus thou findest it said in a certain place, \"Counsel is a fountain of life to them that possess it.\"[fn-44-P4407_2381976:51-nf] So then, in divers places of the Scriptures, the term \"water\" signifies divers things. Now however by the term water ye have heard the Holy Spirit spoken of, not by an interpretation of ours but by witness of the Gospel, where it saith, \"But this said He of the Spirit, which they should receive that should believe on Him.\" If then by the name of water is signified the Holy Spirit, and this epistle saith to us, \"Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they be of God;\" let us understand that of this it is said, \"From strange water keep thee far, and from a strange fountain drink thou not.\"[fn-44-P4408_2382608:52-nf] What meaneth, \"From a strange fountain drink thou not\"?

With respect to the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, if any one desires, after the prophecy of Micah and after the history recorded in the Gospels by the disciples of Jesus, to have additional evidence from other sources, let him know that, in conformity with the narrative in the Gospel regarding His birth, there is shown at Bethlehem the cave[fn-78-P7886_1892502:94-nf] where He was born, and the manger in the cave where He was wrapped in swaddling-clothes. And this sight is greatly talked of in surrounding places, even among the enemies of the faith, it being said that in this cave was born that Jesus who is worshipped and reverenced by the Christians.[fn-78-P7887_1892957:95-nf] Moreover, I am of opinion that, before the advent of Christ, the chief priests and scribes of the people, on account of the distinctness and clearness of this prophecy, taught that in Bethlehem the Christ was to be born. And this opinion had prevailed also extensively among the Jews; for which reason it is related that Herod, on inquiring at the chief priests and scribes of the people, heard from them that the Christ was to be born in Bethlehem of Judea, \"whence David was.\" It is stated also in the Gospel according to John, that the Jews declared that the Christ was to be born in Bethlehem, \"whence David was.\"[fn-78-P7888_1893780:96-nf] But after our Lord's coming, those who busied themselves with overthrowing the belief that the place of His birth had been the subject of prophecy from the beginning, withheld such teaching from the people; acting in a similar manner to those individuals who won over those soldiers of the guard stationed around the tomb who had seen Him arise from the dead, and who instructed these eye-witnesses to report as follows: \"Say that His disciples, while we slept, came and stole Him away.

Or how comes that verse in the Psalms, \"If of a truth ye love justice, judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?\"[fn-32-P3213_1868201:27-nf] But why does the Lord Himself say, \"Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment,\"[fn-32-P3214_1868470:28-nf] if we may not judge any man? Lastly, why, in the case of those traditors, whom they have judged unrighteously, have they themselves ventured to pass any judgments at all on another man's servants? To their own master they were standing or falling. Or why, in the case of the recent followers of Maximianus, have they not hesitated to bring forward the judgment delivered with the infallible voice, as they aver, of a plenary Council, in such terms as to compare them with those first schismatics whom the earth swallowed up alive?

For these are mystical expressions,[fn-46-P4693_2522612:56-nf] in which the point always to be considered is, not what the actual things are, but what they denote as signs: since they are signs of things, and what they are in their essence is one thing, what they are in their signification another.

Thus, if we should say, the rock and the water are one, meaning by the Rock, Christ; by the water, the Holy Ghost: who doubts that rock and water are two different substances? yet because Christ and the Holy Spirit are of one and the same nature, therefore when one says, the rock and the water are one, this can be rightly taken in this behalf, that these two things of which the nature is diverse, are signs of other things of which the nature is one.

But whereas, the signs by which they were signified came forth from the Body of the Lord, herein they figured the Church preaching the Trinity, that it hath one and the same nature: since these Three in threefold manner signified are One, and the Church that preacheth them is the Body of Christ. In this manner then the three things by which they are signified came out from the Body: of the Lord: like as from the Body of the Lord sounded forth the command to \"baptize the nations in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-47-P4700_2526088:63-nf] \"In the name:\" not, In the names: for \"these Three are One,\" and One God is these Three. And if in any other way this depth of mystery which we read in John's epistle can be expounded and understood agreeably with the Catholic faith, which neither confounds nor divides the Trinity, neither believes the substances diverse nor denies that the persons are three, it is on no account to be rejected. For whenever in Holy Scriptures in order to exercise the minds of the faithful any thing is put darkly, it is to be joyfully welcomed if it can be in many ways but not unwisely expounded.","title":"Homily X.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":7,"verse":15,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_61_book_vi_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"ANF-04","text":"In the next place, with regard to the declaration of Jesus against rich men, when He said, \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God,\"[fn-103-P10319_2738729:89-nf] Celsus alleges that this saying manifestly proceeded from Plato, and that Jesus perverted the words of the philosopher, which were, that \"it was impossible to be distinguished for goodness, and at the same time for riches.\"[fn-103-P10320_2738977:90-nf] Now who is there that is capable of giving even moderate attention to affairs-not merely among the believers on Jesus, but among the rest of mankind-that would not laugh at Celsus, on hearing that Jesus, who was born and brought up among the Jews, and was supposed to be the son of Joseph the carpenter, and who had not studied literature-not merely that of the Greeks, but not even that of the Hebrews-as the truth-loving Scriptures testify regarding Him,[fn-103-P10321_2739473:91-nf] had read Plato, and being pleased with the opinion he expressed regarding rich men, to the effect that \"it was impossible to be distinguished for goodness and riches at the same time,\" had perverted this, and changed it into, \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God!\" Now, if Celsus had not perused the Gospels in a spirit of hatred and dislike, but had been imbued with a love of truth, he would have turned his attention to the point why a camel-that one of animals which, as regards its physical structure, is crooked-was chosen as an object of comparison with a rich man, and what signification the \"narrow eye of a needle\" had for him who saw that \"strait and narrow was the way that leadeth unto life;[fn-103-P10322_2740310:92-nf] and to this point also, that this animal. according to the law, is described as \"unclean,\" having one element of acceptability, viz. that it ruminates, but one of condemnation, viz., that it does not divide the hoof. He would have inquired, moreover, how often the camel was adduced as an object of comparison in the sacred Scriptures, and in reference to what objects, that he might thus ascertain the meaning of the Logoj concerning the rich men. Nor would he have left without examination the fact that \"the poor\" are termed \"blessed\" byJesus, while \"the rich\" are designated as \"miserable; \"and whether these words refer to the rich and poor who are visible to the senses, or whether there is any kind of poverty known to the Logoj which is to be deemed \"altogether blessed,\" and any rich man who is to be wholly condemned.

And, in this case how will that first statement of the Lord made about men after the fall stand: \"Behold, Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil?\"[fn-53-P5348_1915089:59-nf] For we cannot think that before, he was such as to be altogether ignorant of good. Otherwise we should have to admit that he was formed like some irrational and insensate beast: which is sufficiently absurd and altogether alien from the Catholic faith. Moreover as the wisest Solomon says: \"God made man upright,\" i.e., always to enjoy the knowledge of good only, \"But they have sought out many imaginations,\"[fn-53-P5349_1915518:60-nf] for they came, as has been said, to know good and evil. Adam therefore after the fall conceived a knowledge of evil which he had not previously, but did not lose the knowledge of good which he had before. Finally the Apostle's words very clearly show that mankind did not lose after the fall of Adam the knowledge of good: as he says: \"For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have not the law, are a law to themselves, as they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to these, and their thoughts within them either accusing or else excusing them, in the day in which God shall judge the secrets of men.\"[fn-53-P5350_1916254:61-nf] And with the same meaning the Lord rebukes by the prophet the unnatural but freely chosen blindness of the Jews, which they by their obstinacy brought upon themselves, saying: \"Hear ye deaf, and ye blind, behold that you may see. Who is deaf but My servant? and blind, but he to whom I have sent My messengers?\"[fn-53-P5351_1916588:62-nf] And that no one might ascribe this blindness of theirs to nature instead of to their own will, elsewhere He says: \"Bring forth the people that are blind and have eyes: that are deaf and have ears;\" and again: \"having eyes, but ye see not; and ears, but ye hear not.\"[fn-53-P5352_1916878:63-nf] The Lord also says in the gospel: \"Because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not neither do they understand.\"[fn-53-P5353_1917028:64-nf] And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says: \"Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand: and seeing ye shall see and shall not see. For the heart of this people is waxed fat, and their ears are dull of hearing: and they have closed their eyes, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and be turned and I should heal them.\"[fn-53-P5354_1917450:65-nf] Finally in order to denote that the possibility of good was in them, in chiding the Pharisees, He says: \"But why of your own selves do ye not judge what is right?\"[fn-53-P5355_1917634:66-nf] And this he certainly would not have said to them, unless He knew that by their natural judgment they could discern what was fair. Wherefore we must take care not to refer all the merits of the saints to the Lord in such a way as to ascribe nothing but what is evil and perverse to human nature: in doing which we are confuted by the evidence of the most wise Solomon, or rather of the Lord Himself, Whose words these are; for when the building of the Temple was finished and he was praying, he spoke as follows: \"And David my father would have built a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel: and the Lord said to David my father: Whereas thou hast thought in thine heart to build a house to My name, thou hast well done in having this same thing in thy mind. Nevertheless thou shall not build a house to My name.\"[fn-53-P5356_1918476:67-nf] This thought then and this purpose of king David, are we to call it good and from God or bad and from man? For if that thought was good and from God, why did He by whom it was inspired refuse that it should be carried into effect? But if it is bad and from man, why is it praised by the Lord? It remains then that we must take it as good and from man. And in the same way we can take our own thoughts today. For it was not given only to David to think what is good of himself, nor is it denied to us naturally to think or imagine anything that is good. It cannot then be doubted that there are by nature some seeds of goodness in every soul implanted by the kindness of the Creator: but unless these are quickened by the assistance of God, they will not be able to attain to an increase of perfection, for, as the blessed Apostle says: \"Neither is he that planteth anything nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.\"[fn-53-P5357_1919433:68-nf] But that freedom of the will is to some degree in a man's own power is very clearly taught in the book termed the Pastor,[fn-53-P5358_1919575:69-nf] where two angels are said to be attached to each one of us, i.e., a good and a bad one, while it lies at a man's own option to choose which to follow. And therefore the will always remains free in man, and can either neglect or delight in the grace of God. For the Apostle would not have commanded saying: \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,\" had he not known that it could be advanced or neglected by us. But that men might not fancy that they had no need of Divine aid for the work of Salvation, he subjoins: \"For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of His good pleasure.\"[fn-53-P5359_1920216:70-nf] And therefore he warns Timothy and says: \"Neglect not the grace of God which is in thee;\" and again: \"For which cause I exhort thee to stir up the grace of God which is in thee.\"[fn-53-P5360_1920418:71-nf] Hence also in writing to the Corinthians he exhorts and warns them not through their unfruitful works to show themselves unworthy of the grace of God, saying: \"And we helping, exhort you that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:\"[fn-53-P5361_1920685:72-nf] for the reception of saving grace was of no profit to Simon doubtless because he had received it in vain; for he would not obey the command of the blessed Peter who said: \"Repent of thine iniquity, and pray God if haply the thoughts of thine heart may be forgiven thee; for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity.\"[fn-53-P5362_1921057:73-nf] It prevents therefore the will of man, for it is said: \"My God will prevent me with His mercy;\"[fn-53-P5363_1921177:74-nf] and again when God waits and for our good delays, that He may put our desires to the test, our will precedes, for it is said: \"And in the morning my prayer shall prevent Thee;\" and again: \"I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;\" and: \"Mine eyes have prevented the morning.\"[fn-53-P5364_1921485:75-nf] For He calls and invites us, when He says: \"All the day long I stretched forth My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people;\"[fn-53-P5365_1921674:76-nf] and He is invited by us when we say to Him: \"All the day long I have stretched forth My hands unto Thee\"[fn-53-P5366_1921796:77-nf] He waits for us, when it is said by the prophet: \"Wherefore the Lord waiteth to have compassion upon us;\"[fn-53-P5367_1921937:78-nf] and He is waited for by us, when we say: \"I waited patiently for the Lord, and He inclined unto me;\" and: \"I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.\"[fn-53-P5368_1922104:79-nf] He strengthens us when He says: \"And I have chastised them, and strengthened their arms; and they have imagined evil against me;\"[fn-53-P5369_1922280:80-nf] and He exhorts us to strengthen ourselves when He says: \"Strengthen ye the weak hands, and make strong the feeble knees.\"[fn-53-P5370_1922422:81-nf] Jesus cries: \"If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink;\"[fn-53-P5371_1922504:82-nf] the prophet also cries to Him: \"I have laboured with crying, my jaws are become hoarse: mine eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.\"[fn-53-P5372_1922663:83-nf] The Lord seeks us, when He says: \"I sought and there was no man.

But he opposed them with such firmness that he did not tell them even his own name, nor that of his nation or city, nor if he were slave or free; but in answer to all these questions, he said in Latin, `I am a Christian.'

Yet not only did no such occurrence take place in regard to him, but even, contrary to every expectation of man, his body unbent itself and became erect in the midst of the subsequent tortures, and resumed its former appearance and the use of its limbs, so that the second torture turned out through the grace of Christ a cure, not an affliction.","title":"The Letter of the Churches of Vienna and Lugdunum to the Churches of Asia and Phrygia","author":"Memoirs of Edessa"},{"chapter":7,"verse":37,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_72_letter_i_for_329_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"3.

To this end He continually nourished His believing disciples with His words, and gave them life by the nearness of His divinity, but to the Canaanitish woman, because she was not yet a believer, He deigned not even a reply, although she stood greatly in need of food from Him.

He therefore who is in a state of wickedness, undoubtedly also wanders from the faith; and he who fails from godliness, falls from the true faith. Paul, for instance, bearing testimony to the same point, advises his disciple, saying, `Avoid profane conversations; for they increase unto more ungodliness, and their word takes hold as doth a canker, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus[fn-93-P9368_3394978:63-nf] .'

Therefore, wishing the disciple to be exercised in godliness unto the end, and to contend for the faith, he counsels them, saying, `Fight the good fight of faith, and lay hold on eternal life[fn-93-P9372_3395985:67-nf] .'

But hitherto, very honourable brethren, you have not given me my due; and this for two reasons. Either you failed to perceive the proper course; or else, under the influence of some of the columnies spread abroad about me, you did not think me deserving of being visited by you in love. Now, therefore, I myself take the initiative. I beg to state that I am perfectly ready to rid myself, in your presence, of the charges urged against me, but only on condition that my revilers are admitted to stand face to face with me before your reverences. If I am convicted, I shall not deny my error. You, after the conviction, will receive pardon from the Lord for withdrawing yourselves from the communion of me a sinner. The successful accusers, too, will have their reward in the publication of my secret wickedness. If, however, you condemn me before you have the evidence before you, I shall be none the worse, barring the loss I shall sustain of a possession I hold most dear-your love: while you, for your part, will suffer the same loss in losing me, and will seem to be running counter to the words of the Gospel: \"Doth our law judge any man before it hear him?\"[fn-49-P4975_1545488:4-nf] The reviler, moreover, if he adduce no proof of what he says, will be shewn to have got nothing from his wicked language but a bad name for himself. For what name can be properly applied to the slanderer[fn-49-P4976_1545709:5-nf] except that which he professes to bear by the very conduct of which be is guilty? Let the reviler, therefore, appear not as slanderer,[fn-49-P4977_1545866:6-nf] but as accuser; nay, I will not call him accuser, I will rather regard him as a brother, admonishing in love, and producing conviction for my amendment. And you must not be hearers of calumny, but triers of proof. Nor must I be left uncured, because my sin is not being made manifest.","title":"Letter CCIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":7,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_222_letter_cciv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"2. [Next, if it tend much towards intimacy to have the same teachers, there are to you and to me the same teachers ofGod's mysteries, and spiritual Fathers, who from the beginning were the founders of your Church. I mean the great Gregory, and all who succeeding in order to the throne of your episcopate, like stars rising one after another, have tracked the same course, so as to leave the tokens of the heavenly polity most clear to all who desire them.] And if natural relationships are not to be despised, but are greatly conducive to unbroken union and fellowship, these rights also exist naturally for you and me. [Why is it, then, O venerable among cities, for through you I address the whole city, that no civil writing comes from you, no welcome voice, but your ears are open to those who aim at slander?] I am therefore the more bound to groan, the more I perceive the end they have in view. There is no doubt as to who is the originator of the slander.[fn-49-P4993_1553140:7-nf] He is known by many evil deeds, but is best distinguished by this particular wickedness, and it is for this reason that the sin is made his name.[fn-49-P4994_1553305:8-nf] But you must pat up with my plain speaking. You have opened both ears to my slanderers. You heartily welcome all you hear without any enquiry. Not one of you distinguishes between lies and truth. Who ever suffered for lack of wicked accusations when struggling all alone? Who was ever convicted of lying in the absence of his victim? What plea does not sound plausible to the hearers when the reviler persists that such and such is the case, and the reviled is neither present nor hears what is urged against him? Does not even the accepted custom of this world teach you, in reference to these matters, that if any one is to be a fair and impartial hearer, he must not be entirely led away by the first speaker, but must wait for the defence of the accused, that so truth may be demonstrated by a comparison of the arguments on both sides? \"Judge righteous judgment.\"[fn-49-P4995_1554237:9-nf] This precept is one of those most necessary for salvation.","title":"Letter CCIV","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":7,"verse":51,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_244_letter_ccxxvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"IT may be that the holy God will grant me the joy of a meeting with you, for I am ever longing to see yon and bear about you, because in no other thing do I find rest for my soul than in your progress and perfection in the commandments of Christ. But so long as this hope remains unrealized I feel bound to visit you through the instrumentality of our dear and God-fearing brethren, and to address you, my beloved friends, by letter. Wherefore I have sent my reverend and dear brother and fellow-worker in the Gospel, Meletius the presbyter. He will tell you my yearning affection for you. and the anxiety of my soul, in that. night and day, I beseech the Lord in your behalf, that I may have boldness in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ through your salvation, and that when your work is tried by the just judgment of God you may shine forth in the brightness of the saints. At the same thee the difficulties of the day cause me deep anxiety, for all Churches have been tossed to and fro, and all souls are being sifted. Some have even opened their mouths without any reserve against their fellow servants. Lies are boldly uttered, and the truth has been hidden. The accused are being condemned without a trial, and the accusers are believed without evidence. I had heard that many letters are being carried about against myself, stinging, gibbeting, and attacking me for matters about which I have my defence ready for the tribunal of truth; and I had intended to keep Silence, as indeed I have done; for now for three years I have been bearing the blows of calumny and the whips of accusation, content to think that I have the Lord, Who knows all secrets, as witness of its falsehood. But I see now that many men have silence as a corroboration of these slanders, and have formed the idea that my silence was due, not to my longsuffering, but to my inability to open my lips in opposition to the truth. For these reasons I have attempted to write to you, beseeching your love in Christ not to accept these partial calumnies as true. because, as it is written, the law judges no man unless it have heard and known his actions.[fn-53-P5365_1688683:2-nf] ","title":"Letter CCXXVI.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":7,"verse":51,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_276_letter_cclviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"3. As to the Church at Antioch (I mean that which is in agreement in the same doctrine), may the Lord grant that one day we may see it united. It is in peril of being specially open to the attacks of the enemy, who is angry with it because there the name of Christian first obtained.[fn-58-P5830_1830031:7-nf] There heresy is divided against orthodoxy, and orthodoxy is divided against herself.[fn-58-P5831_1830165:8-nf] My position, however, is this. The right reverend bishop Meletius was the first to speak boldly for the truth, and fought that good fight in the days of Constantine, Therefore my Church has felt strong affection towards him, for the sake of that brave and firm stand, and has held communion with him. I, therefore, by God's grace, have held him to be in communion up to this time; and, if God will, I shall continue to do so. Moreover the very blessed Pope Athanasius came from Alexandria, and was most anxious that communion should be established between Meletius and himself; but by the malice of counsellors their conjunction was put off to another season. Would that this had not been so! I have never accepted communion with any one of those who have since been introduced into the see, not because I count them unworthy, but because I see no ground for the condemnation of Meletius. Nevertheless I have heard many things about tile brethren, without giving heed to them, because the accused were not brought face to face with their accusers, according to that which is written, \"Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?\"[fn-58-P5832_1831641:9-nf] I cannot therefore at present write to them, right honourable brother, and I ought not to be forced to do so. It will be becoming to your peaceful disposition not to cause union in one direction and disunion in another, but to restore the severed member to the original union. First, then, pray; next, to the utmost of your ability, exhort, that ambition may be driven from their hearts, and that reconciliation may be effected between them both to restore strength to the Church, and to destroy the rage of oar foes. It has given great comfort to my soul that, in addition to your other right and accurate statements in theology, you should acknowledge the necessity of stating that the hypostases are three. Let the brethren at Antioch be instructed by you after this manner. Indeed I am confident that they have been so instructed; for I am sure you would never have accepted communion with them unless you had carefully made sure of this point in them.","title":"Letter CCLVIII.","author":"St. Basil"}]
