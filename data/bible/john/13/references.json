There is a dress proper to every one, as well for daily use as for office and dignity. That famous purple, therefore, and the gold as an ornament of the neck, were, among the Egyptians and Babylonians, ensigns of dignity, in the same way as bordered, or striped, or palm-embroidered togas, and the golden wreaths of provincial priests, are now; but not on the same terms. For they used only to be conferred, under the name of honour, on such as deserved the familiar friendship of kings (whence, too, such used to be styled the \"purpled-men\"[fn-7-P794_325944:132-nf] of kings, just as among us,[fn-7-P795_325997:133-nf] some, from their white toga, are called \"candidates\"[fn-7-P796_326101:134-nf] ); but not on the understanding that that garb should be tied to priesthoods also, or to any idol-ceremonies. For if that were the case, of course men of such holiness and constancy[fn-7-P797_326307:135-nf] would instantly have refused the defiled dresses; and it would instantly have appeared that Daniel had been no zealous slave to idols, nor worshipped Bel, nor the dragon, which long after did appear. That purple, therefore, was simple, and used not at that time to be a mark of dignity[fn-7-P798_326619:136-nf] among the barbarians, but of nobility.[fn-7-P799_326691:137-nf] For as both Joseph, who had been a slave, and Daniel, who through[fn-8-P800_326794:138-nf] captivity had changed his state, attained the freedom of the states of Babylon and Egypt through the dress of barbaric nobility;[fn-8-P801_326944:139-nf] so among us believers also, if need so be, the bordered toga will be proper to be conceded to boys, and the stole to girls,[fn-8-P802_327131:140-nf] as ensigns of birth, not of power; of race, not of office; of rank, not of superstition. But the purple, or the other ensigns of dignities and powers, dedicated from the beginning to idolatry engrafted on the dignity and the powers, carry the spot of their own profanation; since, moreover, bordered and striped togas, and broad-barred ones, are put even on idols themselves; and fasces also, and rods, are borne before them; and deservedly, for demons are the magistrates of this world: they bear the fasces and the purples, the ensigns of one college. What end, then, will you advance if you use the garb indeed, but administer not the functions of it? In things unclean, none can appear clean. If you put on a tunic defiled in itself, it perhaps may not be defiled through you; but you, through it, will be unable to be clean. Now by this time, you who argue about \"Joseph\" and \"Daniel,\" know that things old and new, rude and polished, begun and developed, slavish and free, are not always comparable. For they, even by their circumstances, were slaves; but you, the slave of none,[fn-8-P803_328441:141-nf] in so far as you are the slave of Christ alone,[fn-8-P804_328515:142-nf] who has freed you likewise from the captivity of the world, will incur the duty of acting after your Lord's pattern. That Lord walked in humility and obscurity, with no definite home: for \"the Son of man,\" said He, \"hath not where to lay His head; \"[fn-8-P805_328868:143-nf] unadorned in dress, for else He had not said, \"Behold, they who are clad in soft raiment are in kings' houses: \"[fn-8-P806_329018:144-nf] in short, inglorious in countenance and aspect, just as Isaiah withal had fore-announced.[fn-8-P807_329142:145-nf] If, also, He exercised no right of power even over His own followers, to whom He discharged menial ministry;[fn-8-P808_329272:146-nf] if, in short, though conscious of His own kingdom,[fn-8-P809_329351:147-nf] He shrank back from being made a king,[fn-8-P810_329417:148-nf] He in the fullest manner gave His own an example for turning coldly from all the pride and garb, as well of dignity as of power. For if they were to be used, who would rather have used them than the Son of God? What kind and what number of fasces would escort Him? what kind of purple would bloom from His shoulders? what kind of gold would beam from His head, had He not judged the glory of the world to be alien both to Himself and to His? Therefore what He was unwilling to accept, He has rejected; what He rejected, He has condemned; what He condemned, He has counted as part of the devil's pomp. For He would not have condemned things, except such as were not His; but things which are not God's, can be no other's but the devil's. If you have forsworn \"the devil's pomp,\"[fn-8-P811_330215:149-nf] know that whatever there you touch is idolatry. Let even this fact help to remind you that all the powers and dignities of this world are not only alien to, but enemies of, God; that through them punishments have been determined against God's servants; through them, too, penalties prepared for the impious are ignored. But \"both your birth and your substance are troublesome to you in resisting idolatry.\"[fn-8-P812_330641:150-nf] For avoiding it, remedies cannot be lacking; since, even if they be lacking, there remains that one by which you will be made a happier magistrate, not in the earth, but in the heavens.[fn-8-P813_330951:151-nf] ","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":13,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_10_the_chaplet_or_de_corona_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"33","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Hold fast in the meantime this persuasion, while I examine a question which comes in our way. For I already hear it is said, that many other things as well as crowns have been invented by those whom the world believes to be gods, and that they are notwithstanding to be met with both in our present usages and in those of early saints, and in the service of God, and in Christ Himself, who did His work as man by no other than these ordinary instrumentalities of human life. Well, let it be so; nor shall I inquire any further back into the origin of this things. Let Mercury have been the first who taught the knowledge of letters; I will own that they are requisite both for the business and commerce of life, and for performing our devotion to God. Nay, if he also first strung the chord to give forth melody, I will not deny, when listening to David, that this invention has been in use with the saints, and has ministered to God. Let Â¦sculapius have been the first who sought and discovered cures: Esaias[fn-10-P1068_439686:24-nf] mentions that he ordered Hezekiah medicine when he was sick. Paul, too, knows that a little wine does the stomach good.[fn-10-P1069_439829:25-nf] Let Minerva have been the first who built a ship: I shall see Jonah and the apostles sailing. Nay, there is more than this: for even Christ, we shall find, has ordinary raiment; Paul, too, has his cloak.[fn-10-P1070_440053:26-nf] If at once, of every article of furniture and each household vessel, you name some god of the world as the originator, well, I must recognise Christ, both as He reclines on a couch, and when He presents a basin for the feet of His disciples, and when He pours water into it from a ewer, and when He is girt about with a linen towel[fn-10-P1071_440547:27-nf] -a garment specially sacred to Osiris. It is thus in general I reply upon the point, admitting indeed that we use along with others these articles, but challenging that this be judged in the light of the distinction between things agreeable and things opposed to reason, because the promiscuous employment of them is deceptive, concealing the corruption of the creature, by which it has been made subject to vanity. For we affirm that those things only are proper to be used, whether by ourselves or by those who lived before us, and alone befit the service of God and Christ Himself, which to meet the necessities of human life supply what is simply; useful and affords real assistance and honourable comfort, so that they may be well believed to have come from God's own inspiration, who first of all no doubt provided for and taught and ministered to the enjoyment, I should suppose, of His own man. As for the things which are out of this class, they are not fit to be used among us, especially those which on that account indeed are not to be found either with the world, or in the ways of Christ.","title":"The Chaplet, or De Corona.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":13,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"29. But in the flesh itself, the faith in His resurrection saves and justifies us. For, \"If thou shalt believe,\" he says, \"in thine heart, that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved;\"[fn-6-P619_227258:119-nf] and again, \"Who was delivered,\" he says, \"for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.\"[fn-6-P620_227381:120-nf] So that the reward of our faith is the resurrection of the body of our Lord.[fn-6-P621_227481:121-nf] For even His enemies believe that that flesh died on the cross of His passion, but they do not believe it to have risen again.

Moreover when he writes that, though I seem to be separated from communion with him, I in reality hold communion with him through you and through the church of Rome: he need not go so far afield, for I am connected with him in the same way also here in Palestine. And lest even this should appear distant, in this village of Bethlehem I hold communion with his presbyters as much as I can. Thus it is clear that a private chagrin is not to be taken for the cause of the church, and that one man's choler, or even that of several stirred up by him, ought not to be styled the displeasure of the church.

Let him be satisfied with the pain which he has caused by the insults that he has inflicted upon me in the past. Let him efface old wounds by a little new charity. Let him shew himself what he was before, when of his own choice he bestowed upon me his esteem. Let his words no longer be tinged with a gall that flows from the heart of another.

We read in Isaiah the words, \"the fool will speak folly,\"[fn-55-P5533_1542598:3925-nf] and I am told that some one has been mad enough to put deacons before presbyters, that is, before bishops. For when the apostle clearly teaches that presbyters are the same as bishops, must not a mere server of tables and of widows[fn-55-P5534_1542858:3926-nf] be insane to set himself up arrogantly over men through whose prayers the body and blood of Christ are produced?[fn-55-P5535_1543004:3927-nf] Do you ask for proof of what I say? Listen to this passage: \"Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the bishops and deacons.\"[fn-55-P5536_1543283:3928-nf] Do you wish for another instance? In the Acts of the Apostles Paul thus speaks to the priests[fn-55-P5537_1543396:3929-nf] of a single church: \"Take heed unto yourselves and to all the flock, in the which the Holy Ghost hath made you bishops, to feed the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.\"[fn-55-P5538_1543603:3930-nf] And lest any should in a spirit of contention argue that there must then have been more bishops than one in a single church, there is the following passage which clearly proves a bishop and a presbyter to be the same. Writing to Titus the apostle says: \"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain presbyters[fn-55-P5539_1544004:3931-nf] in every city, as I had appointed thee: if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. For a bishop must be blameless as the steward of God.\"[fn-55-P5540_1544227:3932-nf] And to Timothy he says: \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.\"[fn-55-P5541_1544398:3933-nf] Peter also says in his first epistle: \"The presbyters which are among you I exhort, who am your fellow-presbyter and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: feed the flock of Christ[fn-55-P5542_1544657:3934-nf] ...taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly, according unto God.\"[fn-55-P5543_1544766:3935-nf] In the Greek the meaning is still plainer, for the word used is episkopountej, that is to say, overseeing, and this is the origin of the name overseer or bishop.[fn-55-P5544_1544988:3936-nf] But perhaps the testimony of these great men seems to you insufficient. If so, then listen to the blast of the gospel trumpet, that son of thunder,[fn-55-P5545_1545156:3937-nf] the disciple whom Jesus loved[fn-55-P5546_1545209:3938-nf] and who reclining on the Saviour's breast drank in the waters of sound doctrine. One of his letters begins thus: \"The presbyter unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth;\"[fn-55-P5547_1545425:3939-nf] and another thus: \"The presbyter unto the well-beloved Gains whom I love in the truth.\"[fn-55-P5548_1545532:3940-nf] When subsequently one presbyter was chosen to preside over the rest, this was done to remedy schism and to prevent each individual from rending the church of Christ by drawing it to himself. For even at Alexandria from the time of Mark the Evangelist until the episcopates of Heraclas and Dionysius the presbyters always named as bishop one of their own number chosen by themselves and set in a more exalted position, just as an army elects a general, or as deacons appoint one of themselves whom they know to be diligent and call him archdeacon. For what function, excepting ordination, belongs to a bishop that does not also belong to a presbyter? It is not the case that there is one church at Rome and another in all the world beside. Gaul and Britain, Africa and Persia, India and the East worship one Christ and observe one rule of truth. If you ask for authority, the world outweighs its capital.[fn-55-P5549_1546456:3941-nf] Wherever there is a bishop, whether it be at Rome or at Engubium, whether it be at Constantinople or at Rhegium, whether it be at Alexandria or at Zoan, his dignity is one and his priesthood is one. Neither the command of wealth nor the lowliness of poverty makes him more a bishop or less a bishop.

Consider again. What does he say? Hath Christ spoken falsely? Where, I ask thee? \"Where He says, `I go not up to the feast day;' and went up.\" For my part, I should wish thoroughly to examine this place, if so be we may see that Christ did not speak falsely. Yea rather, seeing that I have no doubt that Christ did not speak falsely, I will either thoroughly examine this passage and understand it, or, not understanding it, I will defer it. Yet that Christ spoke falsely will I never say. Grant that I have not understood it; I will depart in my ignorance. For better is it with piety to be ignorant, than with madness to pronounce judgment. Notwithstanding we are trying to examine, if so be by His assistance, who is the Truth, we may find something, and be found something ourselves, and this something will not be in the Truth a lie. For if in searching I find a lie, I find not a something but a nothing. Let us then look where it is thou sayest that Christ lied. He will say, \"In that He said, `I go not up to this feast,' and went up.\" Whence dost thou know that He said so? What if I were to say, nay, not I, but any one, for God forbid that I should say it; what if another were to say, \"Christ did not say this;\" whereby dost thou refute him, whereby wilt thou prove it? Thou wouldest open the book, find the passage, point it out to the man, yea with great confidence force the book upon him if he resisted, \"Hold it, mark, read, it is the Gospel you have in your hands.\" But why, I ask thee, why dost thou so rudely accost[fn-63-P6368_2690546:21-nf] this feeble one? Do not be so eager; speak more composedly, more tranquilly. See, it is the Gospel I have in my hands; and what is there in it? He answers: \"The Gospel declares that Christ said what thou deniest.\" And wilt thou believe that Christ said it, because the Gospel declares it? \"Decidedly for that reason,\" says he. I marvel exceedingly how thou shouldest say that Christ lieth, anti the Gospel doth not lie. But test haply when I speak of the Gospel, thou shouldest think of the book itself, and imagine the parchment and ink to be the Gospel, see what the Greek word means; Gospel is \"a good messenger,\" or \"a good message.\" The messenger then doth not lie, and doth He who sent him, lie? This messenger, the Evangelist to wit, to give his name also, this John who wrote this, did he lie concerning Christ, or say the truth? Choose which you will, I am ready to hear you on either side. If he spake falsely, you have no means of proving that Christ spake those words. If he said the truth, truth cannot flow from the fountain of falsehood. Who is the Fountain? Christ: let John be the stream. The stream comes to me, and you say to me, \"Drink securely;\" yea, whereas you alarm me as to the Fountain Himself, whereas you tell me there is falsehood in the Fountain, you say to me, \"Drink securely.\" What do I drink? What said John, that Christ spake falsely? Whence came John? From Christ. Is he who came from Him, to tell me truth, when He from whom he came lied? I have read in the Gospel plainly, \"John lay on the Lord's Breast;\"[fn-63-P6369_2692106:22-nf] but I conclude that he drank in truth. What saw he as he lay on the Lord's Breast? What drank he in? what, but that which he poured forth? \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The Same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made. That which was made in Him was life, and the Life wasthe Light of men; And the Light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended It not;\"[fn-63-P6370_2692594:23-nf] nevertheless It shineth, and though I chance to have some obscurity, and cannot thoroughly comprehend It, still It shineth. \"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John; he came to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. He was not the Light:\" who? John: who? John the Baptist. For of him saith John the Evangelist, \"He was not the Light;\" of whom the Lord saith, \"He was a burning, and a shining lamp.\"[fn-63-P6371_2693053:24-nf] But a lamp can be lighted, and extinguished. What then? whence drawest thou the distinction? of what place art thou enquiring? He to whom the lamp bare witness, \"was the True Light.\"[fn-63-P6372_2693253:25-nf] Where John added, \"the True,\" there art thou looking out for a lie. But hear still the same Evangelist John pouring forth what he had drunk in; \"And we beheld,\" saith he, \"His glory.\" What did he behold? what glory beheld he? \"The glory as of the Only-Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\"[fn-63-P6373_2693571:26-nf] See then, see, if we ought not haply to restrain weak or rash disputings, and to presume nothing false of the truth, to give to the Lord what is His due; let us give glory to the Fountain, that we may fill ourselves securely. \"Now God is true, but every man a liar.\"[fn-63-P6374_2693856:27-nf] What is this? God is fill; every man is empty; if he will be filled, let him come to Him That is full. \"Come unto Him, and be enlightened.\"[fn-63-P6375_2694014:28-nf] Moreover, if man is empty, in that he is a liar, and he seeks to be filled, and with haste and eagerness runs to the fountain, he wishes to be filled, he is empty.

Then Christ ought to have said, \"Pray in such wise now;\" and to have given them, when spiritual, another prayer. It is one andthe same. He who gave it is One and theSame; use it then in prayer in the Church. But we will take away all controversy, when you say the Holy Apostles were spiritual, up to the time of the Lord's Passion they were carnal; this you must say.

Coming to the Gospel he sets before us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his mother-in-law, and, with a shamelessness to which we have now grown accustomed, fails to understand that they, too, ought to have been reckoned among those who served the Law. For the Gospel had no being before the crucifixion of Christ-it was consecrated by His passion and by His blood. In accordance with this rule Peter and the other Apostles (I must give Jovinianus something now and then out of my abundance) had indeed wives, but those which they had taken before they knew the Gospel. But once they were received into the Apostolate, they forsook the offices of marriage. For when Peter, representing the Apostles, says to the Lord:[fn-63-P6320_1936460:161-nf] \"Lo we have left all and followed thee,\" the Lord answered him,[fn-63-P6321_1936546:162-nf] \"Verily I say unto you, there is no man that hath left house or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.\" But if, in order to show that all the Apostles had wives, he meets us with the words[fn-63-P6322_1936898:163-nf] \"Have we no right to lead about women or wives\" (for gunh in Greek has both meanings) \"even as the rest of the apostles, and Cephas, and the brethren of the Lord?\" let him add what is found in the Greek copies, \"Have we no right to lead about women that are sisters, or wives?\" This makes it clear that the writer referred to other holy women, who, in accordance with Jewish custom, ministered to their teachers of their substance, as we read was the practice with even our Lord himself. Where there is a previous reference to eating and drinking, and the outlay of money, and mention is afterwards made of women that are sisters, it is quite clear, as we have said, that we must understand, not wives, but those women who ministered of their substance. And we read the same account in the Old Testament of the Shunammite who was wont to welcome Elisha, and to put for him a table, and bread, and a candlestick, and the rest. At all events if we take gunaikaj to mean wives, not women, the addition of the word sisters destroys the effect of the word wives, and shews that they were related in spirit, not by wedlock. Nevertheless, with the exception of the Apostle Peter, it is not openly stated that the Apostles had wives; and since the statement is made of one while nothing is said about the rest, we must understand that those of whom Scripture gives no such description had no wives. Yet Jovinianus, who has arrayed against us Zacharias and Elizabeth, Peter and his wife's mother, should know, that John was the son of Zacharias and Elizabeth, that is, a virgin was the offspring of marriage, the Gospel of the law, chastity of matrimony; so that by a virgin prophet the virgin Lord might be both announced and baptized. But we might say concerning Peter, that he had a mother-in-law when he believed, and no longer had a wife, although in the[fn-63-P6323_1939524:164-nf] \"Sentences\" we read of both his wife and daughter. But for the present our argument must be based wholly on Scripture. He has made his appeal to the Apostles, because he thinks that they, who hold the chief authority in our moral system and are the typical Christian teachers, were not virgins. If, then, we allow that they were not virgins (and, with the exception of Peter, the point cannot be proved), yet I must tell him that it is to the Apostles that the words of Isaiah relate:[fn-63-P6324_1940049:165-nf] \"Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.\" So, then, they who were by birth Jews could not under the Gospel recover the virginity which they had lost in Judaism. And yet John, one of the disciples, who is related to have been the youngest of the Apostles, and who was a virgin when he embraced Christianity, remained a virgin, and on that account was more beloved by our Lord, and lay upon the breast of Jesus. And what Peter, who had had a wife, did not dare ask,[fn-63-P6325_1940620:166-nf] he requested John to ask. And after the resurrection, when Mary Magdalene told them that the Lord had risen,[fn-63-P6326_1940754:167-nf] they both ran to the sepulchre, but John outran Peter. And when they were fishing in the ship on the lake of Gennesaret, Jesus stood upon the shore, and the Apostles knew not who it was they saw;[fn-63-P6327_1940972:168-nf] the virgin alone recognized a virgin, and said to Peter, \"It is the Lord.\" Again, after hearing the prediction that he must be bound by another, and led whither he would not, and must suffer on the cross. Peter said, \"Lord what shall this man do?\" being unwilling to desert John, with whom he had always been united. Our Lord said to him, \"What is that to thee if I wish him so to be?\" Whence the saying went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die. Here we have a proof that virginity does not die, and that the defilement of marriage is not washed away by the blood of martyrdom, but virginity abides with Christ, and its sleep is not death but a passing to another state. If, however, Jovinianus should obstinately contend that John was not a virgin, (whereas we have maintained that his virginity was the cause of the special love our Lord bore to him), let him explain, if he was not a virgin, why it was that he was loved more than the other Apostles. But you say,[fn-63-P6328_1941990:169-nf] the Church was rounded upon Peter: although[fn-63-P6329_1942059:170-nf] elsewhere the same is attributed to all the Apostles, and they all receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the strength of the Church depends upon them all alike, yet one among the twelve is chosen so that when a head has been appointed, there may be no occasion for schism. But why was not John chosen, who was a virgin? Deference was paid to age, because Peter was the eider: one who was a youth, I may say almost a boy, could not be set over men of advanced age; and a good master who was bound to remove every occasion of strife among his disciples, and who had said to them,[fn-63-P6330_1942702:171-nf] \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,\" and,[fn-63-P6331_1942783:172-nf] \"He that is the greater among you, let him be the least of all,\" would not be thought to afford cause of envy against the youth whom he had loved. We maybe sure that John was then a boy because ecclesiastical history most clearly proves that he lived to the reign of Trajan, that is, he fell asleep in the sixty-eighth year after our Lord's passion, as I have briefly noted in my treatise on Illustrious Men.[fn-63-P6332_1943234:173-nf] Peter is an Apostle, and John is an Apostle-the one a married man, the other a virgin; but Peter is an Apostle only, John is both an Apostle and an Evangelist, and a prophet. An Apostle, because he wrote to the Churches as a master; an Evangelist, because he composed a Gospel, a thing which no other of the Apostles, excepting Matthew, did; a prophet, for he saw in the island of Patmos, to which he had been banished by the Emperor Domitian as a martyr for the Lord, an Apocalypse containing the boundless mysteries of the future Tertullian, more over, relates that he was sent to Rome, and that having been plunged into a jar of boiling oil he came out fresher and more active than when he went in. But his very Gospel is widely different from the rest. Matthew as though he were writing of a man begins thus: \"The book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham;\" Luke begins with the priesthood of Zacharias; Mark with a prophecy of the prophets Malachi and Isaiah. The first has the face of a man, on account of the genealogical table; the second, the face of a calf, on account of the priesthood; the third, the face of a lion, on account of the voice of one crying in the desert,[fn-63-P6333_1944501:174-nf] \"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.\" But John like an eagle soars aloft, and reaches the Father Himself, and says,[fn-63-P6334_1944656:175-nf] \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God,\" and so on. The virgin writer expounded mysteries which the married could not, and to briefly sum up all and show how great was the privilege of John, or rather of virginity in John, the Virgin Mother[fn-63-P6335_1944999:176-nf] was entrusted by the Virgin Lord to the Virgin disciple.","title":"Book I.","author":false},{"chapter":13,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf2_01_npnf2_01_12_book_vii_","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"194","folder":"NPNF2-01","text":"12 \"But that he who wrote these things was called John must be believed, as he says it; but who he was does not appear.

The apostle Peter, to whom it was said,[fn-66-P6611_2070323:21-nf] \"He that is bathed needeth not to wash again,\" and[fn-66-P6612_2070397:22-nf] \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church,\" through fear of a maid-servant denied Him. Our Lord himself says,[fn-66-P6613_2070547:23-nf] \"Simon, Simon, behold Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat. But I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not.\" And in the same place, \"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" If you reply that this was said before the Passion, we certainly say after the Passion, in the Lord's prayer,[fn-66-P6614_2070948:24-nf] \"Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.\" If we do not sin after baptism, why do we ask that we may be forgiven our sins, which were already forgiven in baptism? Why do we pray that we may not enter into temptation, and that we may be delivered from the evil one, if the devil cannot tempt those who are baptized? The case is different if this prayer belongs to the Catechumens, and is not adapted to faithful Christians. Paul, the chosen vessel,[fn-66-P6615_2071498:25-nf] chastised his body, and brought it into subjection, lest after preaching to others he himself should be found a reprobate, and[fn-66-P6616_2071645:26-nf] he tells that there was given to him \"a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet\" him. And to the Corinthians he writes:[fn-66-P6617_2071797:27-nf] \"I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ.\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6618_2071981:28-nf] \"But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the person of Christ: that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.\" And again:[fn-66-P6619_2072287:29-nf] \"There hath no temptation taken you, but such as man can bear; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.\" And,[fn-66-P6620_2072550:30-nf] \"Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.\" And to the Galatians:[fn-66-P6621_2072652:31-nf] \"Ye were running well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?\" And elsewhere:[fn-66-P6622_2072761:32-nf] \"We would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.\" And to the married he says:[fn-66-P6623_2072893:33-nf] \"Be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.\" And again:[fn-66-P6624_2073000:34-nf] \"But I say, walk by the Spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other: that ye may not do the things that ye would.\" We are a compound of the two, and must endure the strife of the two substances. And to the Ephesians:[fn-66-P6625_2073376:35-nf] \"Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\" Does any one think that we are safe, and that it is right to fall asleep when once we have been baptized? And so, too, in the epistle to the Hebrews:[fn-66-P6626_2073753:36-nf] \"For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.\" Surely we cannot deny that they have been baptized who have been illuminated, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God. Butif the baptized cannot sin, how is it now that the Apostle says, \"And have fallen away\"?[fn-66-P6627_2074420:37-nf] Montanus and[fn-66-P6628_2075404:38-nf] Novatus would smile at this, for they contend that it is impossible to renew again through repentance those who have crucified to themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame. He therefore corrects this mistake by saying:[fn-66-P6629_2076011:39-nf] \"But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak; for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye shewed towards his name, in that ye ministered unto the Saints, and still do minister.\" And truly the unrighteousness of God would be great, if He merely punished sin, and did not welcome good works. I have so spoken, says the Apostle, to withdraw you from your sins, and to make you more careful through fear of despair. But, beloved, I am persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation. For it is not accordant with the righteousness of God to forget good works, and the fact that you have ministered and do minister to the Saints for His name's sake, and to remember sins only. The Apostle James also, knowing that the baptized can be tempted, and fall of their own free choice, says:[fn-66-P6630_2076919:40-nf] \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.\" And that we may not think that we are tempted by God, as we read in Genesis Abraham was, he adds: \"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, and He Himself tempteth no man. But each man is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is full grown, bringeth forth death.\" God created us with free will, and we are not forced by necessity either to virtue or to vice. Otherwise, if there be necessity, there is no crown. As n good works it is God who brings them to perfection, for it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that pitieth and gives us help that we may be able to reach the goal: so in things wicked and sinful, the seeds within us give the impulse, and these are brought to maturity by the devil. When he sees that we are building upon the foundation of Christ, hay, wood, stubble, then he applies the match. Let us then build gold, silver, costly stones, and he will not venture to tempt us: although even thus there is not sure and safe possession. For the lion lurks in ambush to slay the innocent.[fn-66-P6631_2078282:41-nf] \"Potters' vessels are proved by the furnace, and just men by the trial of tribulation.\" And in another place it is written:[fn-66-P6632_2078429:42-nf] \"My son, when thou comest to serve the Lord, prepare thyself for temptation.\" Again, the same James says:[fn-66-P6633_2078555:43-nf] \"Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only. For if any one is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror: for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.\" It was useless to warn them to add works to faith, if they could not sin after baptism. He tells us that[fn-66-P6634_2078944:44-nf] \"whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.\" Which of us is without sin?[fn-66-P6635_2079087:45-nf] \"God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.\" Peter also says:[fn-66-P6636_2079199:46-nf] \"The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation.\" And concerning false teachers:[fn-66-P6637_2079310:47-nf] \"These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved. For, uttering proud wordsof vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who had just escaped, and have turned back to error.\" Does not the Apostle in these words seem to you to have depicted the new party of ignorance? For, as it were, they open the fountains of knowledge and yet have no water: they promise a shower of doctrine like prophetic clouds which have been visited by the truth of God, and are driven by the storms of devils and vices. They speak great things, and their talk is nothing but pride:[fn-66-P6638_2080000:48-nf] \"But every one is unclean with God who is lifted up in his own heart.\" Like those who had just escaped from their sins, they return to their own error, and persuade men to luxury, and to the delights of eating and the gratification of the flesh. For who is not glad to hear them say: \"Let us eat and drink, and reign for ever\"? The wise and prudent they call corrupt, but pay more attention to the honey-tongued. John the apostle, or rather the Saviour in the person of John, writes thus to the angel of the Church of Ephesus:[fn-66-P6639_2080552:49-nf] \"I know thy works and thy toil and patience, and that thou didst bear for my name's sake, and hast not grown weary. But I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.\" Similarly He urges the other churches, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, to repentance, and threatens them unless they return to the former works. And in Sardis He says He has a few who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Him in white, for they are worthy. But they to whom He says: \"Remember from whence thou art fallen \"; and, \"Behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried\"; and, \"I know where thou dwellest, even where Satan's throne is\"; and, \"Remember how thou hast received, and didst hear, and keep it, and repent,\" and so on, were of course believers, and baptized, who once stood, but fell through sin.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":13,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":85,"source_paragraph":"256","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"But \"the precepts of the law are very good,\" if we use them lawfully.[fn-23-P2363_970008:222-nf] Indeed, by the very fact (of which we have the firmest conviction) \"that the just and good God could not possibly have enjoined impossibilities,\" we are admonished both what to do in easy paths and what to ask for when they are difficult. Now all things are easy for love to effect, to which (and which alone) \"Christ's burden is light,\"[fn-23-P2364_970371:223-nf] -or rather, it is itself alone the burden which is light. Accordingly it is said, \"And His commandments are not grievous;\"[fn-23-P2365_970515:224-nf] so that whoever finds them grievous must regard the inspired statement about their \"not being grievous\" as having been capable of only this meaning, that there may be a state of heart to which they are not burdensome, and he must pray for that disposition which he at present wants, so as to be able to fulfil all that is commanded him. And this is the purport of what is said to Israel in Deuteronomy, if understood in a godly, sacred and spiritual sense, since the apostle, after quoting the passage, \"The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart\"[fn-23-P2366_971098:225-nf] (and, as the verse also has it, in thine hands,[fn-23-P2367_971186:226-nf] for in man's heart are his spiritual hands), adds in explanation, \"This is the word of faith which we preach.\"[fn-23-P2368_971487:227-nf] No man, therefore, who \"returns to the Lord his God,\" as he is there commanded, \"with all his heart and with all his sol,\"[fn-23-P2369_971628:228-nf] will find God's commandment \"grievous.\" How, indeed, can it be grievous, when it is the precept of love? Either, therefore, a man has not love, and then it is grievous; or he has love, and then it is not grievous. But he possesses love if he does what is there enjoined on Israel, by returning to the Lord his God with all his heart and with alI his soul. \"A new commandment\" says He, \"do I give unto you, that ye love one another; \"[fn-23-P2370_972083:229-nf] and \"He that loveth his neighbour hath fulfilled the law;\"[fn-23-P2371_972164:230-nf] and again, \"Love is the fulfilling of the law.\"[fn-23-P2372_972233:231-nf] In accordance with these sayings is that passage, \"Had they trodden good paths, they would have found, indeed, the ways of righteousness easy.\"[fn-23-P2373_972399:232-nf] How then is it written, \"Because of the words of Thy lips, I have kept the paths of difficulty,\"[fn-23-P2374_972516:233-nf] except it be that both statements are true: These paths are paths of difficulty to fear; but to love they are easy?","title":"On Nature and Grace, Against Pelagius","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":34,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_21_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_smyrnaeans","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Let no man deceive himself.

For what is to nod or beckon, except to speak in some way to the sight? And Holy Scripture gives its testimony to this; for we read in the Gospel according to John: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.

Apprehending, therefore, the importance of this utterance of the prophet, we have spoken this present brotherly word for love's sake, and by no means seeking, or meaning to seek, our own things. For it is not good to repay detraction with detraction, or according to the common proverb to cast out a beam with a beam (excutere palum palo). Be it far from us. Such manners are not ours. May the Godhead indeed forbid it. By the just judgment of God, power is given sometimes to sinners to persecute His saints, in order that they who are aided and borne on by the Spirit of God may become more glorious through the discipline of sufferings. But to those very persons who persecute, and reproach, and injure them, there will doubtless be woe. Woe, woe to those who injure the servants of God; for injury done to them concerns Him whose service they discharge, and whose function they execute. But we pray that a door of enclosure be placed upon their mouths, as we desire that no one perish or be defiled by their lips, and that they think or publish with their mouth no hurtful word. Whence also the Lord speaks by the prophet, \"I said I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue.\"[fn-89-P8924_2903416:16-nf] May the Lord Almighty, and His only-begotten Son and our Saviour Jesus Christ, give you this incitement, that with all means in your power you aid all the brethren under whatsoever tribulations they labour, and esteem, as is meet, their sufferings your own.

These three evangelists, however, were for the most part engaged with those things which Christ did through the vehicle of the flesh of man, and after the temporal fashion.[fn-10-P1067_417932:21-nf] But John, on the other hand, had in view that true divinity of the Lord in which He is the Father's equal, and directed his efforts above all to the setting forth of the divine nature in his Gospel in such a way as he believed to be adequate to men's needs and notions.[fn-10-P1068_418222:22-nf] Therefore he is borne to loftier heights, in which he leaves the other three far behind him; so that, while in them you see men who have their conversation in a certain manner with the man Christ on earth, in him you perceive one who has passed beyond the cloud in which the whole earth is wrapped, and who has reached the liquid heaven from which, with clearest and steadiest mental eye, he is able to look upon God the Word, who was in the beginning with God, and by whom all things were made.[fn-10-P1069_418766:23-nf] And there, too, he can recognise Him who was made flesh in order that He might dwell amongst us;[fn-10-P1070_418882:24-nf] [that Word of whom we say,] that He assumed the flesh, not that He was changed into the flesh. For had not this assumption of the flesh been effected in such a manner as at the same time to conserve the unchangeable Divinity, Such a word as this could never have been spoken,-namely, \"I and the Father are one.\"[fn-10-P1071_419212:25-nf] For surely the Father and the flesh are not one. And the same John is also the only one who has recorded that witness which the Lord gave concerning Himself, when He said: \"He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father also;\" and, \"I am in the Father, and the Father is in me;\"[fn-10-P1072_419504:26-nf] \"that they may be one, even as we are one;\"[fn-10-P1073_419570:27-nf] and, \"Whatsoever the Father doeth, these same things doeth the Son likewise.\"[fn-10-P1074_419668:28-nf] And whatever other statements there may be to the same effect, calculated to betoken, to those who are possessed of right understanding, that divinity of Christ in which He is the Father's equal, of all these we might almost say that we are indebted for their introduction into the Gospel narrative to John alone.

Let us commence here, accordingly, with the notice presented by Matthew, [which runs thus]: \"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to His disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.\"[fn-22-P2245_947644:3-nf] Both Mark and Luke also gave this section.[fn-22-P2246_947706:4-nf] It is true that Luke has made mention of the cup twice over: first before He gave the bread; and, secondly, after the bread has been given. But the fact is, that what is stated in that earlier connection has been introduced, according to this writer's habit, by anticipation, while the words which he has inserted here in their proper order are left unrecorded in those previous verses, and the two passages when put together make up exactly what stands expressed by those other evangelists.[fn-22-P2247_948230:5-nf] John, on the other hand, has said nothing about the body and blood of the Lord in this context; but he plainly certifies that the Lord spake to that effect on another occasion,[fn-22-P2248_948525:6-nf] with much greater fulness than here. At present, however, after recording how the Lord rose from supper and washed the disciples' feet, and after telling us also the reason why the Lord dealt thus with them, in expressing which He had intimated, although still obscurely, and by the use of a testimony of Scripture, the fact that He was being betrayed by the man who was to eat of His bread, at this point John comes to the section in question, which the other three evangelists also unite in introducing. He presents it thus: \"When Jesus had thus said, He was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, That one of you shall betray me. Then the disciples looked (as the same John subjoins) one on another, doubting of whom He spake.\"[fn-22-P2249_949313:7-nf] \"And (as Matthew and Mark tell us) they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto Him, Is it I? And He answered and said (as Matthew proceeds to state), He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.\" Matthew also goes on to make the following addition to the preceding: \"The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of Him; but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.\"[fn-22-P2250_949831:8-nf] Mark, too, is at one with him here as regards both the words themselves and the order of narration.[fn-22-P2251_949953:9-nf] Then Matthew continues thus: \"Then Judas, which betrayed Him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.\" Even these words did not say explicitly whether he was himself the man. For the sentence still admits of being understood as if its point was this, \"I am not the person who has said so.\"[fn-22-P2252_950294:10-nf] All this, too, may quite easily have been uttered by Judas and answered by the Lord without its being noticed by all the others.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"4.

Still we might easily suppose, either that it has been inserted in the way of a recapitulation by the one couple of evangelists, or that it has been inserted in the way of an anticipation by the other; only such a supposition may be made more doubtful by the circumstance that there is so remarkable a diversity, not only in the Lord's words, but even in those sentiments of His by which the incident in question is introduced, and by which Peter was moved to venture his presumptuous asseveration that he would die with the Lord or for the Lord. These considerations may constrain us rather to understand the narratives really to import that the man uttered his presumptuous declaration thrice over, as it was called forth by different occasions in the series of Christ's discourses, and that also three several times the answer was returned him by the Lord, which intimated that before the cock crew he would deny Him thrice.","title":"Book III","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_14_book_iii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"37","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"6.

I will lay down my life for Thy sake.\"[fn-22-P2269_958678:21-nf] And to this presumptuous declaration the Lord responded by predicting his denial. Luke, again, first mentions how the Lord said, \"Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and, when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren:\" next he proceeds immediately to tell us how Peter replied to this effect: \"Lord, I am ready to go with Thee, both unto prison and to death;\" and then he continues thus: \"And He said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.\"[fn-22-P2270_959309:22-nf] Now, who can fail to perceive that this is an occasion by itself, and that the incident in connection with which Peter was incited to make the presumptuous declaration already referred to is an entirely different one? But, once more, Matthew presents us with the following passage: \"And when they had sung an hymn,\" he says, \"they went out into the Mount of Olives.

Finally, He here commits His sheep to the care of Peter, who loves Him, and thrice confesses that love, and then He states that He wills this very John so to tarry until He comes.[fn-28-P2856_1263485:78-nf] In which utterance, again, He seems to me to have conveyed in a profound and mystical way the fact that this[fn-28-P2857_1263635:79-nf] evangelical stewardship of John's, in which he is borne aloft into the most liquid light of the Word,[fn-28-P2858_1263926:80-nf] where it is possible to behold the equality and unchangeableness of the Trinity, and in which, above all, we see at what a distance from all others in respect of essential character that humanity stands by whose assumption it occurred that the Word was made flesh, cannot be clearly discerned and recognised until the Lord Himself comes. Consequently, it will tarry thus until He comes. At present it will tarry in the faith of believers, but hereafter it will be possible to contemplate it face to face,[fn-28-P2859_1264453:81-nf] when He, our Life, shall appear, and when we shall appear with Him in glory.[fn-28-P2860_1264548:82-nf] But if any one supposes that with man, living, as he still does, in this mortal life, it may be possible for a person to dispel and clear off every obscurity induced by corporeal and carnal fancies, and to attain to the serenest light of changeless truth, and to cleave constantly and unswervingly to that with a mind thoroughly estranged from the course of this present life, that man understands neither what he asks, nor who he is that put such a supposition. Let such an individual rather accept the authority, at once lofty and free from all deceitfulness, which tells us that, as long as we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord, and that we walk by faith find not by sight? And thus, with all perseverance keeping and guarding his faith and hope and charity, let him look forward to the sight which is promised, in accordance with that earnest which we have received of the Holy Ghost, who shall teach us all truth,[fn-28-P2861_1265499:83-nf] when God, who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall also quicken our mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in us.[fn-28-P2862_1265642:84-nf] But before this body, which is dead by reason of sin, is quickened, it is without doubt corruptible, and presseth down the soul.[fn-28-P2863_1265795:85-nf] And if, in the body, man is ever helped to reach beyond the cloud with which the whole earth is covered,[fn-28-P2864_1265927:86-nf] -that is to say, beyond this carnal darkness with which the whole life of earth is covered,-it is simply as if he were touched with a rapid coruscation, only to sink swiftly into his natural infirmity, the desire surviving by which he may again be excited (to what is evil), and the purity being insufficient to establish him (in what is good). The more, however, any one can do this, the greater is he; while the less he can do so, the less is he. And if the mind of a man has as yet had no such experience-in which mind nevertheless Christ dwells by faith-he ought to strive earnestly to diminish the lusts of this world, and to make an end of them by the exercise of moral virtue, walking, as it were, in the company of these three evangelists with Christ the Mediator. And, with the joy of large hope, let him in faith hold Him who is alway the Son of God, but who, for our sakes, became the Son of man, in order that His eternal power and Godhead might be united with[fn-28-P2865_1266922:87-nf] our weakness and mortality, and, on the basis of what is ours, make a way for us in Himself and to Himself. That a man may be kept from sinning, he should be ruled by Christ the King. If he happens to sin, he may obtain remission from Christ, who is also priest. And thus, nurtured in the exercise of a good conversation and life, and borne out of the atmosphere of earth on the wings of a twofold love, as on a pair of strong pinions, so may he be enlightened by the same Christ, who is also the Word, the Word who was in the beginning, the Word who was with God, and the Word who was God; and although that will still be through a glass darkly, it will be a sublime kind of illumination far superior to every corporeal similitude. Wherefore, although it is the gifts of the active virtue that shine pre-eminent in the first three evangelists, while it is the gift of the contemplative virtue that discerns such subjects, nevertheless, this Gospel of John, in so far as it also is in part, will so tarry until that which is perfect comes.[fn-28-P2866_1267998:88-nf] And to one, indeed, is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit.[fn-28-P2867_1268143:89-nf] One man regardeth the day to the Lord;[fn-28-P2868_1268202:90-nf] another receives a clearer draught from the breast of the Lord; another is caught up even to the third heaven, and hears unspeakable words.[fn-28-P2869_1268360:91-nf] But all, as long as they are in the body, are absent from the Lord.[fn-28-P2870_1268450:92-nf] And for all believers living in the good hope, whose names are written in the book of life, there is still in reserve that which is referred to in the words, \"And I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him.\"[fn-28-P2871_1268684:93-nf] Nevertheless, the greater the advance which a man may make in the apprehension and knowledge of this theme during the time of this absence from the Lord, all the more carefully should he guard against those devilish vices, pride and envy. Let him remember that this very Gospel of John, which urges us so pre-eminently to the contemplation of truth, gives a no less remarkable prominence to the inculcation of the sweet grace of charity. Let him also consider that most true and wholesome precept which is couched in the words, \"The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all.\"[fn-28-P2872_1269287:94-nf] For the evangelist who presents Christ to us in a far loftier strain of teaching than all the others, is also the one in whose narrative the Lord washes the disciples' feet.[fn-28-P2873_1269483:95-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_31_on_continence_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"25. But, say they, how is the flesh by a certain likeness compared unto the Church? What! doth the Church lust against Christ? whereas the same Apostle said, \"The Church is subject unto Christ.\"[fn-36-P3690_1741741:92-nf] Clearly the Church is subject unto Christ; because the spirit therefore lusteth against the flesh, that on every side the Church may be made subject to Christ; but the flesh lusteth against the spirit, because not as yet hath the Church received that peace which was promised perfect. And for this reason the Church is made subject unto Christ for the pledge of salvation, and the flesh lusteth against the spirit from the weakness of sickness. For neither were those other than members of the Church, unto whom he thus spake, \"Walk in the spirit, and fulfill not the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed the one to the other; that ye do not what we would.\"[fn-36-P3691_1742498:93-nf] These things were assuredly spoken unto the Church, which if it were not made subject unto Christ, the spirit would not in it lust against the flesh through continence. By reason of which they were indeed able not to perfect the lusts of the flesh, but through the flesh lusting against the Spirit they were not able to do the things which they would, that is, not even to have the very lusts of the flesh. Lastly, why should we not confess that in spiritual men the Church is subject unto Christ, but in carnal men yet lusteth against Christ? Did not they lust against Christ unto whom it was said, \"Is Christ divided?\"[fn-36-P3692_1743141:94-nf] and, \"I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. I have given unto yon milk to drink as unto babes in Christ, not meat, for ye were not as yet able; but not even now are ye able: for ye are still carnal. For whereas there is among you emulation, and strife, are ye not carnal?\"[fn-36-P3693_1743461:95-nf] Against whom doth emulation and strife lust, but against Christ? For these lusts of the flesh Christ healeth in His own, but loveth in none. Whence the holy Church, so long as it hath such members, is not yet without spot or wrinkle. To these are added those other sins also, for which the daily cry of the whole Church is, \"Forgive us our debts:\"[fn-36-P3694_1743835:96-nf] and, that we should not think spiritual persons exempt from these, not any one soever of carnal persons, nor any one soever of spiritual persons themselves, but he, who lay on the breast of the Lord,[fn-36-P3695_1744054:97-nf] and whom He loved before others, saith, \"If we shall say that we have not sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\"[fn-36-P3696_1744204:98-nf] But in every sin, more in what is greater, less in what is less, there is an act of lust against righteousness. And of Christ it is written: \"Who was made unto us by God, Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption.\"[fn-36-P3697_1744457:99-nf] In every sin therefore without doubt there is an act of lust against Christ. But when He, Who \"healeth all our sicknesses,\"[fn-36-P3698_1744601:100-nf] a shall have led His Church unto the promised healing of sickness, then in none of its members shall there be any, even the very least spot or wrinkle. Then in no way shall the flesh lust against the spirit, and therefore there shall be no cause why the spirit also lust against the flesh. Then all this conflict shall come to an end, then there shall be the highest concord of both substances; then to such a degree shall no one there be carnal, that even the flesh itself shall be spiritual. What therefore each one living after Christ doth with his flesh, whereas he both lusts against its evil lust, which he restrains, hereafter to be healed, which he holds, not yet healed; and yet nourisheth and cherisheth its good nature, since \"no one ever hated his own flesh,\"[fn-36-P3699_1745393:101-nf] this also Christ doth with the Church, so far as it is lawful to compare lesser with greater matters. For He both represses it with rebukes, that it burst not being puffed up with impunity; and raises it up with consolations, that it sink not being weighed down with infirmity. Hence is that of the Apostle, \"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged; but when we are judged, we are rebuked of the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.\"[fn-37-P3700_1745874:102-nf] And that in the Psalm, \"After the multitude of my griefs in my heart, Thy consolations have gladdened my soul.\"[fn-37-P3701_1746012:103-nf] We are therefore then to hope for perfect soundness of our flesh without any opposition, when there shall be sure security of the Church of Christ without any fear.","title":"On Continence.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_115_letter_lxi_letter_to_maximus_written_about_371_a_d_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"2.

But, to explain the point in hand: If Christ, in adding the words, \"But I say unto you,\" to the quotations He makes of ancient sayings, neither fulfilled the law of primitive times by His additions, nor destroyed the law given to Moses by opposite precepts, but rather paid such deference to the Hebrew law in all the quotations He made from it, as to make His own remarks chiefly explanatory of what the law stated less distinctly, or a means of securing the design intended by the law, it follows that from the words, \"I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it\" we are not to understand that Christ by His precepts filled up what was wanting in the law; but that what the literal command failed in doing from the pride and disobedience of men, is accomplished by grace in those who are brought to repentance and humility. The fulfillment is not in additional words, but in acts of obedience. So the apostle says \"Faith worketh by love;\"[fn-18-P1887_1075375:50-nf] and again, He that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.\"[fn-18-P1888_1075450:51-nf] This love, by which also the righteousness of the law can be fulfilled was bestowed in its significance by Christ in His coming, through the spirit which He sent according to His promise; and therefore He said, \"I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it.\" This is the New Testament in which the promise of the kingdom of heaven is made to this love; which was typified in the Old Testament, suitably to the times of that dispensation.

Wherefore a few witnesses, which the Lord deigns to suggest to my mind, I proceed to mention, from out the teaching of Christ concerning humility, such as perhaps may be enough for my purpose. His discourse, the first which He delivered to His disciples at greater length, began from this. \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.\"[fn-39-P3985_1894979:81-nf] And these without all controversy we take to be humble. The faith of that Centurion He on this account chiefly praised, and said that He had not found in Israel so great faith, because he believed with so great humility as to say, \"I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.\"[fn-39-P3986_1895286:82-nf] Whence also Matthew for no other reason said that he \"came\" unto Jesus, (whereas Luke most plainly signifies that he came not unto Him himself, but sent his friends,) save that by his most faithful humility he himself came unto Him more than they whom he sent. Whence also is that of the Prophet, \"The Lord is very high, and hath respect unto things that are lowly: but what are very high He noteth afar off;\"[fn-39-P3987_1895735:83-nf] assuredly as not coming unto Him. Whence also He saith to that woman of Canaan, \"O woman, great is thy faith; be it done unto thee as thou wilt;\"[fn-39-P3988_1895903:84-nf] whom above He had called a dog, and had made answer that the bread of the sons was not to be cast to her. And this she taking with humility had said, \"Even so, Lord; for the dogs also eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.\" And thus what by continual crying she obtained not, by humble confession she earned.[fn-39-P3989_1896251:85-nf] Hence also those two are set forth praying in the Temple, the one a Pharisee, and the other a Publican, for the sake of those who seem to themselves just and despise the rest of men, and the confession of sins is set before the reckoning up of merits. And assuredly the Pharisee was rendering thanks unto God by reason of those things wherein he was greatly self-satisfied. \"I render thanks to Thee,\" saith he, \"that I am not even as the rest of men, unjust, extortioners, adulterers, even as also this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things whatsoever I possess. But the Publican was standing afar off, not daring to lift up his eyes to Heaven, but beating his breast, saying, God be merciful unto me a sinner.\" But there follows the divine judgment, \"Verily I say unto you, the Publican went down from the Temple justified more than that Pharisee.\"[fn-39-P3990_1897144:86-nf] Then the cause is shown, why this is just; \"Forasmuch as he who exalteth himself shall be humbled, and whoso humbleth himself shall be exalted.\" Therefore it may come to pass, that each one both shun real evils, and reflect on real goods in himself, and render thanks for these unto \"the Father of lights, from Whom cometh down every best gift, and every perfect gift,\"[fn-39-P3991_1897538:87-nf] and yet be rejected by reason of the sin of haughtiness, if through pride, even in his thought alone, which is before God, he insult other sinners, and specially when confessing their sins in prayer, unto whom is due not upbraiding with arrogance, but pity without despair. What is it that, when His disciples were questioning among themselves, who of them should be greater, He set a little child before their eyes, saying, \"Unless ye shall be as this child, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?\"[fn-39-P3992_1898064:88-nf] Did He not chiefly commend humility, and set in it the desert of greatness? Or when unto the sons of Zebedee desiring to be at His side in lofty seats He so made answer,[fn-39-P3993_1898257:89-nf] as that they should rather think of having to drink the Cup of His Passion, wherein He humbled Himself even unto death, even the death of the Cross,[fn-39-P3994_1898429:90-nf] than with proud desire demand to be preferred to the rest; what did He show, save, that He would be a bestower of exaltation upon them, who should first follow Him as a teacher of humility? And now, in that, when about to go forth unto His Passion, He washed the feet of His disciples, and most openly taught them to do for their fellow-disciples and fellow-servants this, which He their Lord and Master had done for them; how greatly did He commend humility?[fn-39-P3995_1898908:91-nf] And in order to commend this He chose also that time, wherein they were looking on Him, as immediately about to die, with great longing; assuredly about to retain in their memory this especially, which their Master, Whom they were to imitate, had pointed out to them as the last thing. But He did this at that time, which surely He could have done on other days also before, wherein He had been conversant with them; at which time if it were done, this same would indeed be delivered, but certainly would not be so received.","title":"Of Holy Virginity.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_33_of_holy_virginity_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"38.

If, indeed, he had been, the remission of his sins which he would have received in that case from God would not have protected him from the sentence of public law, so far as appertained to the death of the body.

As for Dinocrates, he was a child of seven years of age; and as children who are baptized so old as that can now recite the creed and answer for themselves in the usual examination, I know not why he may not be supposed after his baptism to have been recalled by his unbelieving father to the sacrilege and profanity of heathen worship, and for this reason to have been condemned to the pains from which he was liberated at his sister's intercession. For in the account of him you have never read, either that he was never a Christian, or died a catechumen.

The Son of God says in one passage, \"I am the light of the world,\" and in another, \"I am the resurrection,\" and again, \"I am the way and the truth and the life.\" It is also written, \"I am the door,\" and we have the saying, \"I am the good shepherd,\" and when the woman of Samaria says, \"We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He comes, He will tell us all things,\" Jesus answers, \"I that speak unto thee am He.\" Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared Himself in these words[fn-62-P6254_982473:92-nf] to be their Master and Lord: \"You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.\" He also distinctly announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says,[fn-62-P6255_982654:93-nf] \"He whom the Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? \"and[fn-62-P6256_982806:94-nf] \"Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify Thee.\" We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He answers Pilate's question,[fn-62-P6257_982993:95-nf] \"Art Thou the King of the Jews? \"by saying, \"My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence.\" We have also read the words,[fn-62-P6258_983272:96-nf] \"I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman,\" and again, \"I am the vine, ye are the branches.\" Add to these testimonies also the saying,[fn-62-P6259_983437:97-nf] \"I am the bread of life, that came down from heaven and giveth life to the world.\" These texts will suffice for the present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels, and in all of which He claims to be the Son of God. But in the Apocalypse of John, too, He says,[fn-62-P6260_983747:98-nf] \"I am the first and the last, and the living One, and I was dead. Behold, I am alive for evermore.\" And again,[fn-62-P6261_983876:99-nf] \"I am the A and the W, and the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" The careful student of the sacred books, moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as where He calls Himself[fn-62-P6262_984111:100-nf] a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,[fn-62-P6263_984170:101-nf] and a light of the Gentiles.[fn-62-P6264_984225:102-nf] Isaiah also says,[fn-62-P6265_984264:103-nf] \"From my mother's womb hath He called me by my name, and He made my mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide me, and He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will I be glorified.\" And a little farther on: \"And my God shall be my strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for thee to be called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the diaspora of Israel. Behold I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.\" And in Jeremiah too[fn-62-P6266_984857:104-nf] He likens Himself to a lamb, as thus: \"I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.\" These and other similar sayings He applies to Himself. In addition to these one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets proclaim in advance His coining advent and announce the things concerning Him under various names. Thus John calls Him the Lamb of God, saying,[fn-62-P6267_985471:105-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world,\" and in these words he declares Him as a man,[fn-62-P6268_985601:106-nf] \"This is He about whom I said, that there cometh after me a man who is there before me; for He was before me.\" And in his Catholic Epistle John says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as thus:[fn-62-P6269_985836:107-nf] \"And if any one sin, we have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,\" and he adds that He is a propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a propitiation:[fn-62-P6270_986050:108-nf] \"Whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast sins, in the forbearance of God.\" According to Paul, too, He is declared to be the wisdom and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:[fn-62-P6271_986344:109-nf] \"Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\" It is added that He is also sanctification and redemption: \"He was made to us of God,\" he says, \"wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.\" But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that Christ is a High-Priest:[fn-62-P6272_986654:110-nf] \"Having, therefore, a great High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.\" And the prophets have other names for Him besides these. Jacob in his blessing of his sons[fn-62-P6273_986898:111-nf] says, \"Judah, thy brethren shall extol thee; thy hands are on the necks of thine enemies. A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art thou sprung up; thou hast lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken him? \"We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is said of Judah applies to Christ. What may be quoted against this view, viz., \"A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved; \"this can better be cleared up on another occasion . But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the names of Jacob and Israel, when he says,[fn-62-P6274_987528:112-nf] \"Jacob is my servant, I will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted Him. He shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any one hear His voice on the streets. A bruised rod shall He not break. and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope.\" That it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says:[fn-62-P6275_988040:113-nf] \"That the saying might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry,\" etc. David also is called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds as from the mouth of God:[fn-62-P6276_988248:114-nf] \"I will raise up David my servant, who shall be their shepherd.\" For it is not the patriarch David who is to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ. Isaiah also called Christ the rod and the flower:[fn-62-P6277_988483:115-nf] \"There shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of tits root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel slid of might, the spirit of knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the fear of the Lord.\" And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as follows:[fn-62-P6278_988887:116-nf] \"The stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the comer. It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes.\" And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows:[fn-62-P6279_989155:117-nf] \"Have ye never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of the corner. Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.\" And Luke writes in Acts:[fn-62-P6280_989407:118-nf] \"This is the stone, which was set at naught of you the builders, which has become the head of the corner.\" And one of the names applied to the Saviour is that which He Himself does not utter, but which John records;-the Word who was in the beginning with God, God the Word. And it is worth our while to fix our attention for a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one. As to the former titles, they look for any account of them that any one may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and ask, What is the Son of God when called the Word? The passage they employ most is that in the Psalms,[fn-62-P6281_990132:119-nf] \"My heart hath produced a good Word; \"and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor are they clear about His essence. I do not mean that they confuse its qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own. For no one can understand how that which is said to be \"Word\" can be a Son. And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father, and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is a Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an essence of His own. We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it suggests slid apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him called the Word. What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a different course. To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have to say on the question, how the Son of God is the Word, we must begin with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him. This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a digression, but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask as to the concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these matters will clear the way for what is coming. And once we have entered upon the theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what diligence we can and find the various things that are taught about Him, we shall necessarily understand more about Him not only in His character as the Word, but in His other characters also.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":13,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_37_book_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"ANF-10","text":"It is plain to all how our Lord is a teacher and an interpreter for those who are striving towards godliness, and on the other hand a master of those servants who have the spirit of bondage to fear,[fn-63-P6327_1008501:141-nf] who make progress and hasten towards wisdom, and are found worthy to possess it.

(At another time) He said: \"I am come in my Father's name.\"[fn-107-P10755_3018185:309-nf] Accordingly, the Son's voice was indeed alone sufficient, (when addressed) to the Father. But, behold, with an abundance (of evidence)[fn-107-P10756_3018339:310-nf] the Father from heaven replies, for the purpose of testifying to the Son: \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.\"[fn-107-P10757_3018510:311-nf] So, again, in that asseveration, \"I have both glorified, and will glorify again,\"[fn-107-P10758_3018614:312-nf] how many Persons do you discover, obstinate Praxeas? Are there not as many as there are voices? You have the Son on earth, you have the Father in heaven. Now this is not a separation; it is nothing but the divine dispensation. We know, however, that God is in the bottomless depths, and exists everywhere; but then it is by power and authority. We are also sure that the Son, being indivisible from Him, is everywhere with Him. Nevertheless, in the Economy or Dispensation itself, the Father willed that the Son should be regarded[fn-107-P10759_3019166:313-nf] as on earth, and Himself in heaven; whither the Son also Him. self looked up, and prayed, and made supplication of the Father; whither also He taught us to raise ourselves, and pray, \"Our Father which art in heaven,\" etc.,[fn-107-P10760_3019414:314-nf] -although, indeed, He is everywhere present. This heaven the Father willed to be His own throne; while He made the Son to be \"a little lower than the angels,\"[fn-107-P10761_3019593:315-nf] by sending Him down to the earth, but meaning at the same time to \"crown Him with glory and honour,\"[fn-107-P10762_3019714:316-nf] even by taking Him back to heaven. This He now made good to Him when He said: \"I have both glorified Thee, and will glorify Thee again.\" The Son offers His request from earth, the Father gives His promise from heaven. Why, then, do you make liars of both the Father and the Son? If either the Father spake from heaven to the Son when He Himself was the Son on earth, or the Son prayed to the Father when He was Himself the Son in heaven, how happens it that the Son made a request of His own very self, by asking it of the Father, since the Son was the Father? Or, on the other hand, how is it that the Father made a promise to Himself, by making it to the Son, since the Father was the Son? Were we even to maintain that they are two separate gods, as you are so fond of throwing out against us, it would be a more tolerable assertion than the maintenance of so versatile and changeful a God as yours! Therefore it was that in the passage before us the Lord declared to the people present: \"Not on my own account has this voice addressed me, but for your sakes,\"[fn-107-P10763_3020795:317-nf] that these likewise may believe both in the Father and in the Son, severally, in their own names and persons and positions. \"Then again, Jesus exclaims, and says, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on Him that sent me; \"[fn-107-P10764_3021052:318-nf] because it is through the Son that men believe in the Father, while the Father also is the authority whence springs belief in the Son. \"And he that seeth me, seeth Him that sent me.\"[fn-107-P10765_3021256:319-nf] How so? Even because, (as He afterwards declares, ) \"I have not spoken from myself, but the Father which sent me: He hath given me a commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.\"[fn-107-P10766_3021462:320-nf] For \"the Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know when I ought to speak\"[fn-107-P10767_3021584:321-nf] the word which I actually speak. \"Even as the Father hath said unto me, so do I speak.\"[fn-107-P10768_3021690:322-nf] Now, in what way these things were said to Him, the evangelist and beloved disciple John knew better than Praxeas; and therefore he adds concerning i his own meaning: \"Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God, and was going to God.\"[fn-107-P10769_3022035:323-nf] Praxeas, however, would have it that it was the Father who proceeded forth from Himself, and had returned to Himself; so that what the devil put into the heart of Judas was the betrayal, not of the Son, but of the Father Himself. But for the matter of that, things have not turned out well either for the devil or the heretic; because, even in the Son's case, the treason which the devil wrought against Him contributed nothing to his advantage. It was, then, the Son of God, who was in the Son of man, that was betrayed, as the Scripture says afterwards: \"Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.\"[fn-107-P10770_3022679:324-nf] Who is here meant by \"God? \"Certainly not the Father, but the Word of the Father, who was in the Son of man-that is in the flesh, in which Jesus had been already glorified by the divine power and word. \"And God,\" says He, \"shall also glorify Him in Himself; \"[fn-107-P10771_3022955:325-nf] that is to say, the Father shall glorify the Son, because He has Him within Himself; and even though prostrated to the earth, and put to death, He would soon glorify Him by His resurrection, and making Him conqueror over death.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":13,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_38_homily_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"107","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"But if thou wouldest work miracles also, be rid of transgressions, and thou hast quite accomplished it.

These words also the apostle made use of when he says, \"Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.\"[fn-64-P6490_2479167:98-nf] And setting forth why with fear and trembling, he says, \"For it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do for His good pleasure.\"[fn-64-P6491_2479329:99-nf] For he had not this fear and trembling who said in his abundance, \"I shall not be moved for ever.\"[fn-64-P6492_2479447:100-nf] But because he was a child of the promise, not of perdition, he experienced in God's desertion for a little while what he himself was: \"Lord,\" said he, \"in Thy favour Thou gavest strength to my honour; Thou turnedst away Thy face from me, and I became troubled.\"[fn-64-P6493_2479729:101-nf] Behold how much better instructed, and for this reason also more humble, he held on his way, at length seeing and confessing that by His will God had endowed his honour with strength; and this he had attributed to himself and presumed to be from himself, in such abundance as God had afforded it, and not from Him who had given it, and so had said, \"I shall not be moved for ever!\" Therefore he became troubled so that he found himself, and being lowly minded learnt not only of eternal life, but, moreover, of a pious conversation and perseverance in this life, as that in which hope should be maintained. This might moreover be the word of the Apostle Peter, because he also had said in his abundance, \"I will lay down my life for Thy sake;\"[fn-64-P6494_2480493:102-nf] attributing to himself, in his eagerness, what was afterwards to be bestowed on him by his Lord.

You have intimated, besides, that very many notice that not a few in places of ecclesiastical dignity do not live in a manner conformable to the discourses and sacraments with which the people are served by their means. O miserable men, who in looking at these forget Christ, who long since indeed told us how that the law of God should be obeyed, rather than that those should be looked to for imitation who do not the things which they say; and bearing with the traitor himself even to the end, He sent him also along with the rest to preach the Gospel. For the apostles had no such custom, neither did they teach that it was one fit to be had. And to like effect their successors also, foreseeing by the Spirit of God things to come, have determined largely on such subject. Besides, as you read in the Acts of the Apostles, \"There was at that time among them that believed one heart and one soul; neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.\"[fn-92-P9228_3002494:2-nf] For there was no laying of accusations against each other among them, except what was friendly; neither ought there ever to be such among their followers or among believers: for the Lord says, \"Do not that to another which thou wouldst not have done to thyself.\"[fn-92-P9229_3002773:3-nf] And He says also, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; \"[fn-92-P9230_3002863:4-nf] and,\" Love worketh no ill to his neighbour.\"[fn-92-P9231_3002941:5-nf] In accordance herewith, the apostles themselves and their successors decreed of old time that those persons should not be admitted to lay accusations who were under suspicion, or who but yesterday, or the day before, or a little time ago, were at enmity, as they come thus under suspicion, Or who are not of good conversation, or whose life is reprehensible, or who are doubtful in the matter of the true faith. In like manner is it decided to be with those whose faith and life and liberty are unknown, or who are marked with the stains of infamy, or entangled in the snares of offences. Again, those have neither the right nor the power to accuse the priests or the clergy, who are incapable themselves of being made priests legitimately, and are not of their order; for just as the, priests and the other members of the clerical order are debarred from laying accusations against the secular laity, so these latter, too, should be debarred and excluded from the right of bringing charges against the former. And as the former should not be admired by the latter, so the latter should not be; admired by the former: for as the conversation of the priests of the Lord ought to be something separate from the conversation of these others, so should they be separate from them also in the matter of litigation; \"for the servant of the Lord ought not to strive.\"[fn-92-P9232_3004321:6-nf] To the utmost of your power, dearly beloved brethren, do ye prohibit such accusations, and all unrighteous and injurious emulations, because contention is to be avoided by all means. \"For a just man will fall seven times in a day, and will rise again; but the wicked shall fall into mischief. Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,\" saith Solomon, \"and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth; lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him, and He turn away His wrath from him. Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious at the wicked: for the evil have not the hope of the future, and the candle of the wicked shall be put out. Envy not evil men neither be thou desirous to be with them; for their mind meditates rapine, and their lips speak deceits.\"[fn-92-P9233_3005115:7-nf] Dearly beloved, beware of these things. Ponder these things, and minister comfort to the brethren in all things; for, as the Truth says in His own person, \"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\"[fn-92-P9234_3005381:8-nf] For if in things secular each man's right and his proper position are kept for him, how much more ought there to be no confusion induced in matters of ecclesiastical order! And this is a right which will be duly observed if no deference is paid to mere power, but all to equity. Whence it is an established duty, that the bishops of each several district should exercise a watchful care over all those who live under their rule, and in the fear of God should dispose of all cases in which they are concerned, and of all matters in which they are interested. It is therefore extremely inequitable that any bishops should neglect their own cases, and mix themselves up with those of others. But those whose part it is to ordain such persons to the priesthood, and by whom they have been already ordained, ought to order the life and judgment of such by the exercise of a competent and regular administration; for, as the law says, \"Cursed is every one that removeth his neighbour's landmarks. And all the people said Amen.\"[fn-92-P9235_3006421:9-nf] To this therefore, brethren, has God foreordained you, and all who hold the highest office of the priesthood, that ye should put all injustice out of the way, and cut off presumption, and help those who labour in the priesthood, and give no occasion for their reproach and trouble, but bring assistance to him who endures calumny and reproach, and cut off him who works calumny and reproach, and act for the help of the Lord in His priests. The Lord, moreover, has chosen the priests for Himself, that they should sacrifice to Him, and offer oblations to their Lord. He commanded the Levites also to be under them in their ministries. Whence He speaks to Moses in these terms: \"And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.\"[fn-92-P9236_3007277:10-nf] For of these the Lord spake to Moses in this wise: \"Take the Levites instead of the first-horn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the Lord.\"[fn-92-P9237_3007523:11-nf] If the Lord willed the Levites to be His own, how much more has He taken the priests for Himself! And of these He says: \"If any stranger cometh nigh, he shall be put to death.\"[fn-92-P9238_3007719:12-nf] All objects, moreover, that are the Lord's are to be handled carefully, and are not lightly to be injured; for even among men, those are reckoned faithful who attend to the interests of their masters rightly, and deal with them faithfully, and rightly observe the commands of their masters, and transgress them not.And those, on the other hand, are reputed unfaithful who deal with the interests of their masters carelessly and negligently, and despise their commands, and do not observe them as they ought.","title":"The Second Epistle","author":"The Decretals"},{"chapter":13,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_47_on_repentance_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Whatever, then, our poor ability has attempted to suggest with reference to laying hold of repentance once for all, and perpetually retaining it, does indeed bear upon all who are given up to the Lord, as being all competitors for salvation in earning the favour of God; but is chiefly urgent in the case of those young novices who are only just beginning to bedew[fn-113-P11327_3211450:45-nf] their ears with divine discourses, and who, as whelps in yet early infancy, and with eyes not yet perfect, creep about uncertainly, and say indeed that they renounce their former deed, and assume (the profession of) repentance, but neglect to complete it.[fn-113-P11328_3211727:46-nf] For the very end of desiring importunes them to desire somewhat of their former deeds; just as fruits, when they are already beginning to turn into the sourness or bitterness of age, do yet still in some part flatter[fn-113-P11329_3211967:47-nf] their own loveliness. Moreover, a presumptuous confidence in baptism introduces all kind of vicious delay and tergiversation with regard to repentance; for, feeling sure of undoubted pardon of their sins, men meanwhile steal the intervening time, and make it for themselves into a holiday-time[fn-113-P11330_3212277:48-nf] for sinning, rather than a time for learning not to sin. Further, how inconsistent is it to expect pardon of sins (to be granted) to a repentance which they have not fulfilled! This is to hold out your hand for merchandise, but not produce the price. For repentance is the price at which the Lord has determined to award pardon: He proposes the redemption[fn-113-P11331_3212703:49-nf] of release from penalty at this compensating exchange of repentance. If, then, sellers first examine the coin with which they make their bargains, to see whether it be cut, or scraped, or adulterated,[fn-113-P11332_3212927:50-nf] we believe likewise that the Lord, when about to make us the grant of so costly merchandise, even of eternal life, first institutes a probation of our repentance. \"But meanwhile let us defer the reality of our repentance: it will then, I suppose, be clear that we are amended when we are absolved.\"[fn-113-P11333_3213259:51-nf] By no means; (but our amendment should be manifested) while, pardon being in abeyance, there is still a prospect of penalty; while the penitent does not yet merit-so far as merit we can-his liberation; while God is threatening, not while He is forgiving. For what slave, after his position has been changed by reception of freedom, charges himself with his (past) thefts and desertions? What soldier, after his discharge, makes satisfaction for his (former) brands? A sinner is bound to bemoan himself before receiving pardon, because the time of repentance is coincident with that of peril and of fear. Not that I deny that the divine benefit-the putting away of sins, I mean-is in every way sure to such as are on the point of entering the (baptismal) water; but what we have to labour for is, that it may be granted us to attain that blessing. For who will grant to you, a man of so faithless repentance, one single sprinkling of any water whatever? To approach it by stealth, indeed, and to get the minister appointed over this business misled by your asseverations, is easy; but God takes foresight for His own treasure, and suffers not the unworthy to steal a march upon it. What, in fact, does He say? \"Nothing hid which shall not be revealed.\"[fn-113-P11334_3214534:52-nf] Draw whatever (veil of) darkness you please over your deeds, \"God is light.\"[fn-113-P11335_3214631:53-nf] But some think as if God were under a necessity of bestowing even on the unworthy, what He has engaged (to give); and they turn His liberality into slavery. But if it is of necessity that God grants us the symbol of death,[fn-113-P11336_3214872:54-nf] then He does so unwilling. But who permits a gift to be permanently retained which he has granted unwillingly? For do not many afterward fall out of (grace)? is not this gift taken away from many? These, no doubt, are they who do steal a march upon (the treasure), who, after approaching to the faith of repentance, set up on the sands a house doomed to ruin. Let no one, then, flatter himself on the ground of being assigned to the \"recruit-classes\" of learners, as if on that account he have a licence even now to sin. As soon as you \"know the Lord,[fn-113-P11337_3215496:55-nf] you should fear Him; as soon as you have gazed on Him, you should reverence Him. But what difference does your \"knowing\" Him make, while you rest in the same practises as in days bygone, when you knew Him not? What, moreover, is it which distinguishes you from a perfected[fn-113-P11338_3215821:56-nf] servant of God? Is there one Christ for the baptized, another for the learners? Have they some different hope or reward? some different dread of judgment? some different necessity for repentance? That baptismal washing is a sealing of faith, which faith is begun and is commended by the faith of repentance. We are not washed in order that we may cease sinning, but because we have ceased, since in heart we have been bathed[fn-113-P11339_3216269:57-nf] already. For the first baptism of a learner is this, a perfect fear;[fn-113-P11340_3216382:58-nf] thenceforward, in so far as you have understanding of the Lord faith is sound, the conscience having once for all embraced repentance. Otherwise, if it is (only) after the baptismal waters that we cease sinning, it is of necessity, not of free-will, that we put on innocence. Who, then, is pro-eminent in goodness? he who is not allowed, or he whom it displeases, to be evil? he who is bidden, or he whose pleasure it is, to be free from crime? Let us, then, neither keep our hands from theft unless the hardness of bars withstand us, nor refrain our eyes from the concupiscence of fornication unless we be withdrawn by guardians of our persons, if no one who has surrendered himself to the Lord is to cease sinning unless he be bound thereto by baptism. But if any entertain this sentiment, I know not whether he, after baptism, do not feel more sadness to think that he has ceased from sinning, than gladness that he hath escaped from it. And so it is becoming that learners desire baptism, but do not hastily receive it: for he who desires it, honours it; he who hastily receives it, disdains it: in the one appears modesty, in the other arrogance; the former satisfies, the latter neglects it; the former covets to merit it, but the latter promises it to himself as a due return; the former takes, the latter usurps it. Whom would you judge worthier, except one who is more amended? whom more amended, except one who is more timid, and on that account has fulfilled the duty of true repentance? for he has feared to continue still in sin, lest he should not merit the reception of baptism. But the hasty receiver, inasmuch as he promised it himself (as his due), being forsooth secure (of obtaining it), could not fear: thus he fulfilled not repentance either, because he lacked the instrumental agent of repentance, that is, fear.[fn-113-P11341_3218238:59-nf] Hasty reception is the portion of irreverence; it inflates the seeker, it despises the Giver. And thus it sometimes deceives,[fn-113-P11342_3218376:60-nf] for it promises to itself the gift before it be due; whereby He who is to furnish the gift is ever offended.","title":"On Repentance.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":13,"verse":27,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"62","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Let us now look also to the New Testament, where Satan approaches the Saviour, and tempts Him: wherein also it is stated that evil spirits and unclean demons, which had taken possession of very many, were expelled by the Saviour from the bodies of the sufferers, who are said also to be made free by Him. Even Judas, too, when the devil had already put it in his heart to betray Christ, afterwards received Satan wholly into him; for it is written, that after the sop \"Satan entered into him.\"[fn-71-P7115_1560283:267-nf] And the Apostle Paul teaches us that we ought not to give place to the devil; but \"put on,\" he says, \"the armour of God, that ye may be able to resist the wiles of the devil: \"[fn-71-P7116_1560486:268-nf] pointing out that the saints have to \"wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\"[fn-71-P7117_1560721:269-nf] Nay, he says that the Saviour even was crucified by the princes of this world, who shall come to nought,[fn-71-P7118_1560846:270-nf] whose wisdom also, he says, he does not speak.

With respect to the thoughts which proceed from our heart, or the recollection of things which we have done, or the contemplation of any things or causes whatever, we find that they sometimes proceed from ourselves, and sometimes are originated by the opposing powers; not seldom also are they suggested by God, or by the holy angels. Now such a statement will perhaps appear incredible,[fn-71-P7137_1571976:286-nf] unless it be confirmed by the testimony of holy Scripture, That, then, thoughts arise within ourselves, David testifies in the Psalms, saying, \"The thought of a man will make confession to Thee, and the rest of the thought shall observe to Thee a festival day.\"[fn-71-P7138_1572256:287-nf] That this, however, is also brought about by the opposing powers, is shown by Solomon in the book of Ecclesiastes in the following manner: \"If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for soundness restrains great offences.\"[fn-71-P7139_1572638:288-nf] The Apostle Paul also will bear testimony to the same point in the words: \"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of Christ.\"[fn-71-P7140_1572857:289-nf] That it is an effect due to God, nevertheless, is declared by David, when he says in the Psalms, \"Blessed is the man whose help is in Thee, O Lord, Thy ascents (are) in his heart.\"[fn-71-P7141_1573058:290-nf] And the apostle says that \"God put it into the heart of Titus.\"[fn-71-P7142_1573480:291-nf] That certain thoughts are suggested to men's hearts either by good or evil angels, is shown both by the angel that accompanied Tobias,[fn-71-P7143_1573639:292-nf] and by the language of the prophet, where he says, \"And the angel who spoke in me answered.\"[fn-71-P7144_1573777:293-nf] The book of the Shepherd[fn-71-P7145_1573933:294-nf] declares the same, saying that each individual is attended by two angels; that whenever good thoughts arise in our hearts, they are suggested by the good angel; but when of a contrary kind, they are the instigation of the evil angel. The same is declared by Barnabas in his Epistle,[fn-71-P7146_1574279:295-nf] where he says there are two ways, one of light and one of darkness, over which he asserts that certain angels are placed;-the angels of God over the way of light, the angels of Satan over the way of darkness. We are not, however, to imagine that any other result follows from what is suggested to our heart, whether good or bad, save a (mental) commotion only, and an incitement instigating us either to good or evil. For it is quite within our reach, when a malignant power has begun to incite us to evil, to cast away from us the wicked suggestions, and to resist the vile inducements, and to do nothing that is at all deserving of blame. And, on the other hand, it is possible, when a divine power calls us to better things, not to obey the call; our freedom of will being preserved to us in either case. We said, indeed, in the foregoing pages, that certain recollections of good or evil actions were suggested to us either by the act of divine providence or by the opposing powers, as is shown in the book of Esther, when Artaxerxes had not remembered the services of that just man Mordecai, but, when wearied out with his nightly vigils, had it put into his mind by God to require that the annals of his great deeds should be read to him; whereon, being reminded of the benefits received from Mordecai, he ordered his enemy Haman to be hanged, but splendid honours to be conferred on him, and impunity from the threatened danger to be granted to the whole of the holy nation. On the other hand, however, we must suppose that it was through the hostile influence of the devil that the suggestion was introduced into the minds of the high priests and the scribes which they made to Pilate, when they came and said, \"Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.\"[fn-71-P7147_1576156:296-nf] The design of Judas, also, respecting the betrayal of our Lord and Saviour, did not originate in the wickedness of his mind alone. For Scripture testifies that the \"devil had already put it into his heart to betray Him.\"[fn-71-P7148_1576401:297-nf] And therefore Solomon rightly commanded, saying, \"Keep thy heart with all diligence.\"[fn-71-P7149_1576508:298-nf] And the Apostle Paul warns us: \"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest perhaps we should let them slip.\"[fn-71-P7150_1576684:299-nf] And when he says, \"Neither give place to the devil,\"[fn-71-P7151_1576756:300-nf] he shows by that injunction that it is through certain acts, or a kind of mental slothfulness, that room is made for the devil, so that, if he once enter our heart, he will either gain possession of us, or at least will pollute the soul, if he has not obtained the entire mastery over it, by casting on us his fiery darts; and by these we are sometimes deeply wounded, and sometimes only set on fire. Seldom indeed, and only in a few instances, are these fiery darts quenched, so as not to find a place where they may wound, i.e., when one is covered by the strong and mighty shield of faith. The declaration, indeed, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places,\"[fn-71-P7152_1577608:301-nf] must be so understood as if \"we\" meant, \"I Paul, and you Ephesians, and all who have not to wrestle against flesh and blood: \"for such have to struggle against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, not like the Corinthians, whose struggle was as yet against flesh and blood, and who had been overtaken by no temptation but such as is common to man.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":13,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_49_on_baptism_","source_chapter":11,"source_paragraph":"41","folder":"ANF-03","text":"How many, therefore, are the pleas[fn-115-P11571_3266982:76-nf] of nature, how many the privileges of grace, how many the solemnities of discipline, the figures, the preparations, the prayers, which have ordained the sanctity of water?

Sharp arrows of the mighty, with desolating coals;\" which means (according to him) that the arrows of God's precepts (concerning which the Prophet says in another place,[fn-92-P9267_2493718:19-nf] \"I lived in misery while a thorn pierces me\") should wound and strike through the crafty tongue, and make an end of sins in it. He also interprets the place where the Lord testifies saying:[fn-92-P9268_2493970:20-nf] \"I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish that it may burn\" as meaning \"I wish that all may repent, and burn out through the Holy spirit their vices and their sins; for I am he of whom it is written,[fn-92-P9269_2494197:21-nf] \"Our God is a consuming fire;\" it is no great thing then to say this of the devil, since it is prepared also for men.\" You ought rather to have said, if you wished to avoid the suspicion of believing in the salvation of the devil;[fn-92-P9270_2494461:22-nf] \"Thou hast become perdition and shalt not be for ever;\" and as the Lord speaks to Job concerning the devil,[fn-92-P9271_2494600:23-nf] \"Behold his hope shall fail him and in the sight of all shall he be cast down.

There are great proofs of this existing on the part of the blessed martyr Cyprian, in his letters,-to come at last to him of whose authority they carnally flatter themselves they are possessed, whilst by his love they are spiritually overthrown. For at that time, before the consent of the whole Church had declared authoritatively, by the decree of a plenary Council,[fn-31-P3146_1837518:54-nf] what practice should be followed in this matter, it seemed to him, in common with about eighty of his fellow bishops of the African churches, that every man who had been baptized outside the communion of the Catholic Church should, on joining the Church, be baptized anew. And I take it, that the reason why the Lord did not reveal the error in this to a man of such eminence, was, that his pious humility and charity in guarding the peace and health of the Church might be made manifest, and might be noticed, so as to serve as an example of healing power, so to speak, not only to Christians of that age, but also to those who should come after. For when a bishop of so important a Church, himself a man of so great merit and virtue, endowed with such excellence of heart and power of eloquence, entertained an opinion about baptism different from that which was to be confirmed by a more diligent searching into the truth; though many of his colleagues held what was not yet made manifest by authority, but was sanctioned by the past custom of the Church, and afterwards embraced by the whole Catholic world; yet under these circumstances he did not sever himself, by refusal of communion, from the others who thought differently, and indeed never ceased to urge on the others that they should \"forbear one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\"[fn-31-P3147_1838935:55-nf] For so, while the framework of the body remained whole, if any infirmity occurred in certain of its members, it might rather regain its health from their general soundness, than be deprived of the chance of any healing care by their death in severance from the body. And if he had severed himself, how many were there to follow! what a name was he likely to make for himself among men! how much more widely would the name of Cyprianist have spread than that of Donatist! But he was not a son of perdition, one of those of whom it is said, \"Thou castedst them down while they were elevated;\"[fn-31-P3148_1839546:56-nf] but he was the son of the peace of the Church, who in the clear illumination of his mind failed to see one thing, only that through him another thing might be more excellently seen. \"And yet,\" says the apostle, \"show I unto you a more excellent way: though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.\"[fn-31-P3149_1839959:57-nf] He had therefore imperfect insight into the hidden mystery of the sacrament. But if he had known the mysteries of all sacraments, without having charity, it would have been nothing. But as he, with imperfect insight into the mystery, was careful to preserve charity with all courage and humility and faith, he deserved to come to the crown of martyrdom; so that, if any cloud had crept over the clearness of his intellect from his infirmity as man, it might be dispelled by the glorious brightness of his blood. For it was not in vain that our Lord Jesus Christ, when He declared Himself to be the vine, and His disciples, as it were, the branches in the vine, gave command that those which bare no fruit should be cut off, and removed from the vine as useless branches.[fn-31-P3150_1840760:58-nf] But what is really fruit, save that new offspring, of which He further says, \"A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another?\"[fn-31-P3151_1840919:59-nf] This is that very charity, without which the rest profiteth nothing. The apostle also says: \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance;\"[fn-31-P3152_1841149:60-nf] which all begin with charity, and with the rest of the combination forms one unity in a kind of wondrous cluster.[fn-31-P3153_1841284:61-nf] Nor is it again in vain that our Lord added, \"And every branch that beareth fruit, my Father purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit,\"[fn-31-P3154_1841439:62-nf] but because those who are strong in the fruit of charity may yet have something which requires purging, which the Husbandman will not leave untended. Whilst then, that holy man entertained on the subject of baptism an opinion at variance with the true view, which was afterwards thoroughly examined and confirmed after most diligent consideration, his error was compensated by his remaining in catholic unity, and by the abundance of his charity; and finally it was cleared away by the pruning-hook of martyrdom.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":34,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_137_homily_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4. \"Beloved, if our heart think not ill of us, we have confidence towards God:\"[fn-43-P4367_2361685:18-nf] -What meaneth, \"If our heart think not ill\"?

But which is the worse, not to be baptized at all, or to be twice baptized, it is difficult to decide. I see, indeed, which is more repugnant and abhorrent to men's feelings; but when I have recourse to that divine balance, in which the weight of things is determined, not by man's feelings, but by the authority of God, I find a statement by our Lord on either side. For He said to Peter, \"He who is washed has no need of washing a second time;\"[fn-32-P3262_1891330:53-nf] and to Nicodemus, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\"[fn-32-P3263_1891693:54-nf] What is the purport of the more secret determination of God, it is perhaps difficult for men like us to learn; but as far as the mere words are concerned, any one may see what a difference there is between \"has no need of washing,\" and \"cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.\" The Church, lastly, herself holds as her tradition, that without baptism she cannot admit a man to her altar at all; but since it is allowed that one who has been rebaptized may be admitted after penance, surely this plainly proves that his baptism is considered valid. If, therefore, Cyprian thought that those whom he considered to be unbaptized yet had some share in pardon, in virtue of the bond of unity, the Lord has power to be reconciled even to the rebaptized by means of the simple bond of unity and peace, and by this same compensating power of peace to mitigate His displeasure against those by whom they were rebaptized, and to pardon all the errors which they had committed while in error, on their offering the sacrifice of charity, which covereth the multitude of sins; so that He looks not to the number of those who have been wounded by their separation, but to the greater number who have been delivered from bondage by their return. For in the same bond of peace in which Cyprian conceived that, through the mercy of God, those whom he considered to have been admitted to the Church without baptism, were yet not severed from the gifts of the Church, we also believe that through the same mercy of God the rebaptized can earn their pardon at His hands.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":13,"verse":8,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_56_book_ii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"92","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Moreover, let them show where there is to be found even the appearance of language dictated by arrogance[fn-80-P8036_1961976:20-nf] and proceeding from Jesus.

The Apostle Paul also speaks of certain men who had erred concerning the truth, and were overthrowing the faith of some; whose word was eating as a canker. Yet in saying that they should be avoided, he nevertheless intimates that they were all in one great house, but as vessels to dishonor,-I suppose because they had not as yet gone out. Or if they had already gone out, how can he say that they were in the same great house with the honorable vessels, unless it was in virtue of the sacraments themselves, which even in the severed meetings of heretics are not changed, that he speaks of all as belonging to the same great house, though in different degrees of esteem, some to honor and some to dishonor? For thus he speaks in his Epistle to Timothy: \"But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness. And their word will eat as doth a canker; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, andsome to dishonor.

Wherefore, as the apostle said of the law, \"The law is good, if a man use it lawfully,\"[fn-36-P3658_2049499:8-nf] so we may fairly say of baptism, Baptism is good, if a man use it lawfully. And as they who used the law unlawfully could not in that case cause that it should not be in itself good, or make it null and void, so any one who uses baptism unlawfully, either because he lives in heresy, or because he lives the worst of lives, yet cannot cause that the baptism should be otherwise than good, or altogether null and void. And so, when he is converted either to Catholic unity, or to a mode of living worthy of so great a sacrament, he begins to have not another and a lawful baptism, but that same baptism in a lawful manner. Nor does the remission of irrevocable sins follow on baptism, unless a man not only have lawful baptism, but have it lawfully; and yet it does not follow that if a man have it not lawfully, so that his sins are either not remitted, or, being remitted, are brought on him again, therefore the sacrament of baptism should be in the baptized person either bad or null and void. For as Judas, to whom the Lord gave a morsel, gave a place within himself of the devil, not by receiving what was bad, but by receiving it badly,[fn-36-P3659_2050659:9-nf] so each person, on receiving the sacrament of the Lord, does not cause that it is bad because he is bad himself, or that he has received nothing because he has not received it to salvation.

Avarice will enjoin thee labors, perils, sore hardships and tribulations; and thou wilt do its bidding. To what end? That thou mayest have that with which thou shalt fill thy chest, and lose thy peace of mind. Thou didst feel thyself haply more secure before thou hadst it, than since thou didst begin to have. See what avarice has enjoined thee. Thou hast filled thine house, and art in dread of robbers; hast gotten gold, lost thy sleep. See what avarice has enjoined thee. Do, and thou didst. What does God enjoin thee! Love me. Thou lovest gold, thou wilt seek gold, and perchance not find it: whoso seeks me, I am with him. Thou wilt love honor, and perchance not attain unto it: who ever loved me, and did not attain? God saith to thee, thou wouldest make thee a patron, or a powerful friend: thou seekest a way to his favor by means of another inferior. Love me, saith God to thee: favor with me is not had by making interest with some other: thy love itself makes me present to thee. What sweeter than this love, brethren?

But do ye, says He, learn this of Me, \"for I am meek and lowly of heart.\"[fn-56-P5638_2012112:18-nf] For this it is which it is possible for all men generally to learn and practise, but the working of miracles and signs is not always necessary, nor goodfor all, nor granted to all. Humility therefore is the mistress of all virtues, it is the surest foundation of the heavenly building, it is the special and splendid gift of the Saviour. For he can perform all the miracles which Christ wrought, without danger of being puffed up, who follows the gentle Lord not in the grandeur of His miracles, but in the virtues of patience and humility. But he who aims at commanding unclean spirits, or bestowing gifts of healing, or showing some wonderful miracle to the people, even though when he is showing off he invokes the name of Christ, yet he is far from Christ, because in his pride of heart he does not follow his humble Teacher. For when He was returning to the Father, He prepared, so to speak, His will and left this to His disciples: \"A new commandment,\" said He, \"give I unto you that ye love one another; as I have loved you, so do ye also love one another:\" and at once He subjoined: \"By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love to one another.\"[fn-56-P5639_2013316:19-nf] He says not: \"if ye do signs and miracles in the same way,\" but \"if ye have to one another;\" and thisit is certain that none but the meek andhumble can keep. Wherefore our predecessors never reckoned those as good monks orfree from the fault of vainglory, who professed themselves exorcists among men, andproclaimed with boastful ostentation amongadmiring crowds the grace which they hadeither obtained or which they claimed. Butin vain, for \"he who trusteth in lies feedeththe winds: and the same runneth after birdsthat fly away.\"[fn-56-P5640_2013876:20-nf] For without doubt that willhappen to them which we find in Proverbs:\"As the winds and clouds and rain are veryclear so are these who boast of a fictitiousgift.\"[fn-56-P5641_2014054:21-nf] And so if any one does any of thesethings in our presence, he ought to meet withcommendation from us not from admirationof his miracles, but from the beauty of his life,nor should we ask whether the devils are subject to him, but whether he possesses thosefeatures of love which the Apostle describes.","title":"XV.

For it is utterly wrong and unjustifiable if, after the vanity of the world and all that is in it has been renounced, whatever miserable furniture remains is more regarded than what is most valuable; viz., the love of a brother. The second is for each man so to prune his own wishes that he may not imagine himself to be a wise and experienced person, and so prefer his own opinions to those of his neigh-bout. The third is for him to recognize that everything, even what he deems useful ant necessary, must come after the blessing of love and peace. The fourth for him to realize that he should never be angry for any reason good or bad. The fifth for him to try to cure any wrath which a brother may have conceived against him however unreasonably, in the same way that he would cure his own, knowing that the vexation of another is equally bad for him, as if he himself were stirred against another, unless he removes it, to the best of his ability, from his brother's mind. The last is what is undoubtedly generally decisive in regard to all faults; viz., that he should realize daily that he is to pass away from this world; as the realization of this not only permits no vexation to linger in the heart, but also represses all the motionsof lusts and sins of all kinds. Whoever then has got hold of this, can neither suffer nor be the cause of bitter wrath and discord. But when this fails, as soon as he who is jealous of love has little by little infused the poison of vexation in the hearts of friends, it is certain that owing to frequent quarrels love will gradually grow cool, and at sometime or other he will part the hearts of the lovers, that have been for a long while exasperated. For if one is walking along the course previously marked out, how can he ever differ from his friend, for if he claims nothing for himself, he entirely cuts off the first cause of quarrel (which generally springs from trivial things and most unimportant matters), as he observes to the best of his power what we read in the Acts of the Apostles on the unity of believers: \"But the multitude of believers was of one heart and soul; neither did any of them say that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common.\"[fn-56-P5692_2029638:6-nf] Then how can any seeds of discussion arise from him who serves not his own but his brother's will, and becomes a follower of his Lord and Master, who speaking in the character[fn-56-P5693_2029830:7-nf] of man which He had taken, said: \"I am not come to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me?\"[fn-56-P5694_2029973:8-nf] But how can he arouse any incitement to contention, who has determined to trust not so much to his own judgment as to his brother's decision, on his own intelligence and meaning, in accordance with his will either approving or disapproving his discoveries, and fulfilling in the humility of a pious heart these words from the Gospel: \"Nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-56-P5695_2030375:9-nf] Or in what way will he admit anything which grieves the brother, who thinks that nothing is more precious than the blessing of peace, and never forgets these words of the Lord: \"By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, that ye love one another;\"[fn-56-P5696_2030656:10-nf] for by this, as by a special mark, Christ willed that the flock of His sheep should be known in this world, and be separated from all others by this stamp, so to speak? But on what grounds will he endure either to admit the rancour of vexation in himself or for it to remain in another, if his firm decision is that there cannot be any good ground for anger, as it is dangerous and wrong, and that when his broker is angry with him he cannot pray, in just the same way as when he himself is angry with his brother, as he ever keeps in an humble heart these words of our Lord and Saviour: \"If thou bring thy gift to the altar and there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift at the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.\"[fn-56-P5697_2031487:11-nf] For it will be of no use for you to declare that you are not angry, and to believe that you are fulfilling the command which says: \"Let not the sun go down upon thy wrath;\" and: \"Whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be in danger of the judgment,\"[fn-56-P5698_2031765:12-nf] if you are with obstinate heart disregarding the vexation of another which you could smooth down by kindness on your part. For in the same way you will be punished for violating the Lord's command. For He who said that you should not be angry with another, said also that you should not disregard the vexations of another, for it makes no difference in the sight of God, \"Who willeth all men to be saved,\"[fn-56-P5699_2032205:13-nf] whether you destroy yourself or someone else. Since the death of any one is equally a loss to God, and at the same time it is equally a gain to him to whom all destruction is delightful, whether it is acquired by your death or by the death of your brother. Lastly, how can he retain even the least vexation with his brother, who realizes daily that he is presently to depart from this world?","title":"XVI.

For in one way we love our parents, in another our wives, in another our brothers, in another our children, and there is a wide difference in regard to the claims of these feelings of affection, nor is the love of parents towards their children always equal. As is shown by the case of the patriarch Jacob, who, though he was the father of twelve sons and loved them all with a father's love, yet loved Joseph with deeper affection, as Scripture clearly shows: \"But his brethren envied him, because his father loved him;\"[fn-57-P5740_2040288:22-nf] evidently not that that good man his father failed in greatly loving the rest of his children, but that in his affection he clung to this one, because he was a type of the Lord, more tenderly and indulgently. This also, we read, was very clearly shown in the case of John the Evangelist, where these words are used of him: \"that disciple whom Jesus loved,\"[fn-57-P5741_2040666:23-nf] though certainly He embraced all the other eleven, whom He had chosen in the same way, with His special love, as this He shows also by the witness of the gospel, where He says: \"As I have loved you, so do ye also love one another;\" of whom elsewhere also it is said: \"Loving His own who were in the world, He loved them even to the end.\"[fn-57-P5742_2041027:24-nf] But this love of one in particular did not indicate any coldness in love for the rest of the disciples, but only a fuller and more abundant love towards the one, which his prerogative of virginity and the purity of his flesh bestowed upon him. And therefore it is marked by exceptional treatment, as being something more sublime, because no hateful comparison with others, but a richer grace of superabundant love singled it out. Some-thing of this sort too we have in the character of the bride in the Song of Songs, where she says: \"Set in order love in me.\"[fn-57-P5743_2041609:25-nf] For this is true love set in order, which, while it hates no one, yet loves some still more by reason of their deserving it, and which, while it loves all in general, singles out for itself some from those, whom it may embrace with a special affection, and again among those, who are the special and chief objects of its love, singles out some who are preferred to others in affection.","title":"XVI.

In everything then we must consider the end, and must according to it direct our course and aim, and if when some wiser counsel supervenes, we see it diverging to the worse part, it is better to discard the unsuitable arrangement, and to come to a better mind rather than to cling obstinately to our engagements and so become involved in worse sins.","title":"XVII.

Further because we admit that the discursive lightness of the human mind cannot get rid of these idle and empty things, we thus consequently confess with truth that we are not without sin. For with whatever care a man tries to keep his heart, he can never, owing to the resistance of the nature of the flesh, keep it according to the desire of his spirit. For however far the human mind may have advanced and progressed towards a finer purity of contemplation, so much the more will it see itself to be unclean, as it were in the mirror of its purity, because while the soul raises itself for a loftier vision and as it looks forth yearns for greater things than it performs, it is sure always to despise as inferior and worthless the things in which it is mixed up. Since a keener sight notices more; and a blameless life produces greater sorrow when found fault with; and amendment of life, and earnest striving after goodness multiplies groans and sighs. For no one can rest content with that stage to which he has advanced, and however much a man may be purified in mind, so much the more does he see himself to be foul, and find grounds for humiliation rather than for pride, and, however swiftly he may climb to greater heights, so much more does he see above him whither he is tending.

Thou hast two short, without which the rest avail not, if thou have not the two commandments which conduct unto salvation. \"If I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

When Judas, therefore, at the devil's persuasion, departed from Christ, and cut himself off from the unityof the Apostolic body, the Lord, without bring disturbed by any fear, but anxious only for the salvation of those He came to redeem, spent all the time that was free from His persecutors' attack on mystic conversation and holy teaching, as is declared in St. John's gospel: raising His eyes to heaven and beseeching the Father for the whole Church that all whom the Father had and would give the Son might become one and remain undivided to the Redeemer's glory, and adding lastly that prayer in which He says, \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me[fn-36-P3623_909999:5-nf] .\" Wherein it is not to be thought that the Lord Jesus wished to escape the Passion and the Death, the sacraments of which He had already committed to His disciples' keeping, seeing that He Himself forbids Peter, when he was burning with devoted faith and love, to use the sword, saying, \"The cup which the Father hath given Me, shall I not drink it[fn-36-P3624_910371:6-nf] ?\" and seeing that that is certain which the Lord also says, according to John's Gospel, \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him may not perish, but have eternal life[fn-36-P3625_910618:7-nf] ;\" as also what the Apostle Paul says, \"Christ loved us and gave Himself for us, a victim to God for a sweet-smelling savour[fn-36-P3626_910759:8-nf] .\" For the saving of all through the Cross of Christ was the common will and the common plan of the Father and the Son; nor could that by any means be disturbed which before eternal ages had been mercifully determined and unchangeably fore-ordained. Therefore in assuming true and entire manhood He took the true sensations of the body and the true feelings of the mind. And it does not follow because everything in Him was full of sacraments, full of miracles, that therefore He either shed false tears or took food from pretended hunger or reigned slumber. It was in our humility that He was despised, with our grief that He was saddened,with our pain that He was racked on thecross. For His compassion underwent the sufferings of our mortality with the purpose of healing them, and His power encountered them with the purpose of conquering them. And this Isaiah has most plainly prophesied, saying, \"He carries our sins and is pained for us, and we thought Him to be in pain and in stripes and in vexation.

The judges said: He has given demonstration enough of the origin of the devil. And as both sides admit that there will be a judgment, it is necessarily involved in that admission that every individual is shown to have free-will; and since this is brought clearly out, there can be no doubt that every individual, in the exercise of his own proper power of will, may shape his course in whatever direction he pleases.[fn-35-P3577_987923:306-nf] Manes said: If (only) the good is from (your) God, as you allege, then you make Jesus Himself a liar.[fn-35-P3578_988369:307-nf] Archelaus said: In the first place, admit that the account of what we have adduced is true, and then I will give you proof about the \"father of him.\"[fn-35-P3579_988777:308-nf] Manes said.' If you prove to me that his father is a liar, and yet show me that for all that you ascribe no such (evil) notion to God, then credit will be given you on all points. Archelaus said: Surely when a full account of the devil has once been presented, and the dispensation set forth, any one now, with an ordinarily vigorous understanding, might simply, by turning the matter carefully over in his own mind, get an idea of who this is that is here called the father of the devil. But though you give yourself out to be the Paraclete, you come very far short of the ordinary sagacity of men. Wherefore, as you have betrayed your ignorance, I shall tell you what is meant by this expression, the \"father of the devil.\" Manes said: I say so[fn-35-P3580_990206:309-nf] ...; and he added: Every one who is the founder or maker of anything may be called the father, parent, of that which he has made. Archelaus said: Well, I am verily astonished that you have made so correct an admission in reply to what I have said, and have not concealed either your intelligent apprehension of the affirmation, or the real nature of the same. Now, from this learn who is this father of the devil. When he fell from the kingdom of heaven, he came to dwell upon earth, and there he remained, ever watching and seeking out some one to whom he might attach himself, and whom, through an alliance with himself, he might also make a partner in his own wickedness. Now as long, indeed, as man was not yet existent, the devil was never called either a murderer or a liar together with his father. But subsequently, when man had once been made, and when further he had been deceived by the devil's lies and craftiness, and when the devil had also introduced himself into the body of the serpent, which was the most sagacious of all the beasts, then from that time the devil was called a liar together with his father, and then[fn-35-P3581_991595:310-nf] also the curse was made to rest not only on himself, but also on his father. Accordingly, when the serpent had received him, and had indeed admitted him wholly into its own being, it was, as it were, rendered pregnant, for it bore the burden of the devil's vast wickedness; and it was like one with child, and under the strain of parturition, as it sought to eject the agitations[fn-35-P3582_992036:311-nf] of his malignant suggestions. For the serpent, grudging the glory of the first man, made its way into paradise; and harbouring these pains of parturition in itself,[fn-35-P3583_992266:312-nf] it began to produce mendacious addresses, and to generate death for the men who had been fashioned by God, and who had received the gift of life. The devil, however, was not able to manifest himself completely through the serpent; but he reserved his perfection for a time, in order that he might demonstrate it through Cain, by whom he was generated completely. And thus through the serpent, on the one hand, he displayed his hypocrisies and deceits to Eve; while through Cain, on the other hand, he effected the beginning of murder, introducing himself into the firstlings of the \"fruits,\" which that man administered so badly. From this the devil has been called a murderer from the beginning, and also a liar, because he deceived the parties to whom he said, \"Ye shall be as gods; \"[fn-35-P3584_993087:313-nf] for those very persons whom he falsely declared destined to be gods were afterwards cast out of paradise. Wherefore the serpent which conceived him in its womb, and bore him, and brought him forth to the light of day, is constituted the devil's first father; and Cain is made his second father, who through the conception of iniquities produced pains and parricide: for truly the taking of life was the perpetrating of iniquity, unrighteousness, and impiety all together. Furthermore, all who receive him, and do his lusts, are constituted his brothers. Pharaoh is his father in perfection. Every impious man is made his father. Judas became his father, since he conceived him indeed, though he miscarried: for he did not present a perfect parturition there, since it was really a greater person who was assailed through Judas; and consequently, as I say, it proved an abortion. For just as the woman receives the man's seed, and thereby also becomes sensible of a daily growth within her, so also did Judas make daily advances in evil, the occasions for that being furnished him like seed by the wicked one. And the first seed of evil in him, indeed, was the lust of money; and its increment was theft, for he purloined the moneys which were deposited in the bag. Its offspring, moreover, consisted of less vexations, and compacts with the Pharisees, and the scandalous bargain for a price; yet it was the abortion, and not the birth, that was witnessed in the horrid noose by which he met his death. And exactly in the same way shall it stand also with you: if you bring the wicked one to light in your own deeds, and do his lusts, you have conceived him, and will be called his father; but, on the other hand, if you cherish penitence, and deliver yourself of your burden, you will be like one that brings to the birth.[fn-35-P3585_994931:314-nf] For, as in school exercises, if one gets the subject-matter from the master, and then creates and produces the whole body of an oration by himself, he is said to be the author of the compositions to which he has thus given birth;[fn-35-P3586_995345:315-nf] so he who has taken in any little leaven of evil from the prime evil, is of necessity called the father and pro-creator of that wicked one, who from the beginning has resisted the truth. The case may be the same, indeed, with those who devote themselves to virtue; for I have heard the most valiant men say to God, \"For Thy fear, O Lord, we have conceived in the womb, and we have been in pain, and have brought forth the spirit of salvation.\"[fn-35-P3587_995852:316-nf] And so those, too, who conceive in respect of the fear of the wicked one, and bring forth the spirit of iniquity, must needs be called the fathers of the same. Thus, on the one hand, they are called sons of that wicked one, so long as they are still yielding obedience to his service; but, on the other hand, they are called fathers if they have attained to the perfeCtion of iniquity. For it is with this view that our Lord says to the Pharisees, \"Ye are of your father the devil,\"[fn-35-P3588_996405:317-nf] thereby making them his sons, as long as they appeared still to be perturbed[fn-35-P3589_996504:318-nf] by him, and meditated in their hearts evil for good toward the righteous. Accordingly, while they deliberated in such a spirit with their own hearts, and while their wicked devices were made chargeable upon[fn-35-P3590_996730:319-nf] themselves, Judas, as the head of all the evil, and as the person who carried out their iniquitous counsels to their consummation, was constituted the father of the crime, having received at their hands the recompense of thirty pieces of silver for his impious cruelty. For \"after the sop Satan entered into him\"[fn-35-P3591_997068:320-nf] completely. But, as we have said, when his womb was enlarged, and the time of his travail came on, he delivered himself only of an abortive burden in the conception of unrighteousness, and consequently he could not be called the father in perfection, except only at that very time when the conception was still in the womb; and afterwards, when he betook himself to the hangman's rope, he showed that he had not brought it to a complete birth, because remorse[fn-35-P3592_997550:321-nf] followed.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":13,"verse":35,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_209_letter_cxci","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"ON reading the letter of your reverence I heartily thanked God.
