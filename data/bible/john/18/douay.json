{"verses":["When Jesus had said these things, he went forth with his\ndisciples over the brook Cedron, where there was a garden, into which\nhe entered with his disciples.","And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place:  because Jesus\nhad often resorted thither together with his disciples.","Judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants\nfrom the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns\nand torches and weapons.","Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,\nwent forth and said to them:  Whom seek ye?","They answered him:  Jesus of Nazareth.  Jesus saith to them:  I am\nhe.  And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.","As soon therefore as he had said to them:  I am he; they went\nbackward and fell to the ground.","Again therefore he asked them:  Whom seek ye?  And they said:\nJesus of Nazareth.","Jesus answered:  I have told you that I am he.  If therefore you\nseek me, let these go their way,","That the word might be fulfilled which he said:  Of them whom thou\nhast given me, I have not lost any one.","Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant\nof the high priest and cut off his right ear.  And the name of thee\nservant was Malchus.","Jesus therefore said to Peter:  Put up thy sword into the\nscabbard.  The chalice which my father hath given me, shall I not drink\nit?","Then the band and the tribune and the servants of the Jews took\nJesus and bound him.","And they led him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law\nto Caiphas, who was the high priest of that year.","Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews:  That\nit was expedient that one man should die for the people.","And Simon Peter followed Jesus:  and so did another disciple.  And\nthat disciple was known to the high priest and went in with Jesus into\nthe court of the high priest.","But Peter stood at the door without.  The other disciple\ntherefore, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the\nportress and brought in Peter.","The maid therefore that was portress saith to Peter:  Art not\nthou also one of this man's disciple?  He saith I am not.","Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals, because\nit was cold, and warmed themselves.  And with them was Peter also,\nstanding and warming himself.","The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples and of\nhis doctrine.","Jesus answered him:  I have spoken openly to the world.  I have\nalways taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither all the Jews\nresort:  and in secret I have spoken nothing.","Why askest thou me?  Ask them who have heard what I have spoken\nunto them.  Behold they know what things I have said.","And when he had said these things, one of the servants standing\nby gave Jesus a blow, saying:  Answerest thou the high priest so?","Jesus answered him:  If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the\nevil; but if well, why strikest thou me?","And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high priest.","And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself.  They said\ntherefore to him:  Art not thou also one of his disciples?  He denied it\nand said:  I am not.","One of the servants of the high priest (a kinsman to him whose\near Peter cut off) saith to him:  Did not I see thee in the garden with\nhim?","Again therefore Peter denied:  and immediately the cock crew.","Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governor's hall.  And it\nwas morning:  and they went not into the hall, that they might not be\ndefiled, but that they might eat the pasch.","Pilate therefore went out to them, and said:  What accusation\nbring you against this man?","They answered and said to him:  If he were not a malefactor, we\nwould not have delivered him up to thee.","Pilate therefore said to them:  Take him you, and judge him\naccording to your law.  The Jews therefore said to him:  It is not lawful\nfor us to put any man to death.","That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he said,\nsignifying what death he should die.","Pilate therefore went into the hall again and called Jesus and\nsaid to him:  Art thou the king of the Jews?","Jesus answered:  Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have\nothers told it thee of me?","Pilate answered:  Am I a Jew?  Thy own nation and the chief\npriests have delivered thee up to me.  What hast thou done?","Jesus answered:  My kingdom is not of this world.  If my kingdom\nwere of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should\nnot be delivered to the Jews:  but now my kingdom is not from hence.","Pilate therefore said to him:  Art thou a king then?  Jesus\nanswered:  Thou sayest that I am a king.  For this was I born, and for\nthis came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the truth.\nEvery one that is of the truth heareth my voice.","Pilate saith to him:  What is truth?  And when he said this, he\nwent out again to the Jews and saith to them:  I find no cause in him.","But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the\nPasch.  Will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the\nJews?","Then cried they all again, saying:  Not this man, but Barabbas.\nNow Barabbas was a robber."]}
