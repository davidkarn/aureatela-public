{"verses":["And Jesus passing by, saw a man who was blind from his birth.","And his disciples asked him:  Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man or\nhis parents, that he should be born blind?","Jesus answered:  Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but\nthat the works of God should be made manifest in him.","I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day:  the\nnight cometh, when no man can work.","As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.","When he had said these things, he spat on the ground and made clay\nof the spittle and spread the clay upon his eyes,","And said to him:  Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is\ninterpreted, Sent.  He went therefore and washed:  and he came seeing.","The neighbours, therefore, and they who had seen him before that\nhe was a beggar, said:  Is not this he that sat and begged?  Some said:\nThis is he.","But others said:  No, but he is like him.  But he said:  I am he.","They said therefore to him:  How were thy eyes opened?","He answered:  That man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed\nmy eyes and said to me:  Go to the pool of Siloe and wash.  And I went:\nI washed:  and I see.","And they said to him:  Where is he?  He saith:  I know not.","They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.","Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay and opened his\neyes.","Again therefore the Pharisees asked him how he had received his\nsight.  But he said to them:  He put clay upon my eyes:  and I washed:\nand I see.","Some therefore of the Pharisees said:  This man is not of God, who\nkeepeth not the sabbath.  But others said:  How can a man that is a\nsinner do such miracles?  And there was a division among them.","They say therefore to the blind man again:  What sayest thou of\nhim that hath opened thy eyes?  And he said:  He is a prophet.","The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been\nblind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him\nthat had received his sight,","And asked them, saying:  Is this your son, who you say was born\nblind?  How then doth he now see?","His parents answered them and said:  We know that this is our son\nand that he was born blind:","But how he now seeth, we know not:  or who hath opened his eyes,\nwe know not.  Ask himself:  he is of age:  Let him speak for himself.","These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews:  for\nthe Jews had already agreed among themselves that if any man should\nconfess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.","Therefore did his parents say:  He is of age.  Ask himself.","They therefore called the man again that had been blind and said\nto him:  Give glory to God.  We know that this man is a sinner.","He said therefore to them:  If he be a sinner, I know not.  One\nthing I know, that whereas I was blind.  now I see.","They said then to him:  What did he to thee?  How did he open thy\neyes?","He answered them:  I have told you already, and you have heard.\nWhy would you hear it again?  Will you also become his disciples?","They reviled him therefore and said:  Be thou his disciple; but we\nare the disciples of Moses.","We know that God spoke to Moses:  but as to this man, we know not\nfrom whence he is.","The man answered and said to them:  why, herein is a wonderful\nthing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.","Now we know that God doth not hear sinners:  but if a man be a\nserver of God and doth his, will, him he heareth.","From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any\nman hath opened the eyes of one born blind.","Unless this man were of God, he could not do anything.","They answered and said to him:  Thou wast wholly born in sins; and\ndost thou teach us?  And they cast him out.","Jesus heard that they had cast him out.  And when he had found\nhim, he said to him:  Dost thou believe in the Son of God?","He answered, and said:  Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in\nhim?","And Jesus said to him:  Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that\ntalketh with thee.","And he said:  I believe, Lord.  And falling down, he adored him.","And Jesus said:  For judgment I am come into this world:  that they\nwho see not may see; and they who see may become blind.","And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard:  and they\nsaid unto him:  Are we also blind?","Jesus said to them:  If you were blind, you should not have sin:\nbut now you say:  We see.  Your sin remaineth."]}
