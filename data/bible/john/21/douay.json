{"verses":["After this, Jesus shewed himself to the disciples at the sea of\nTiberias.  And he shewed himself after this manner.","There were together:  Simon Peter and Thomas, who is called\nDidymus, and Nathanael, who was of Cana of Galilee, and the sons of\nZebedee and two others of his disciples.","Simon Peter saith to them:  I go a fishing.  They say to him:  We\nalso come with thee.  And they went forth and entered into the ship:  and\nthat night they caught nothing.","But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore:  yet the\ndisciples knew not that it was Jesus.","Jesus therefore said to them:  Children, have you any meat?  They\nanswered him:  No.","He saith to them:  Cast the net on the right side of the ship; and\nyou shall find.  They cast therefore:  and now they were not able to draw\nit, for the multitude of fishes.","That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter:  It is the\nLord.  Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord, girt his coat\nabout him (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea.","But the other disciples came in the ship (for they were not far\nfrom the land, but as it were two hundred cubits) dragging the net with\nfishes.","As soon then as they came to land they saw hot coals lying, and a\nfish laid thereon, and bread.","Jesus saith to them:  Bring hither of the fishes which you have\nnow caught.","Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of great\nfishes, one hundred and fifty-three.  And although there were so many,\nthe net was not broken.","Jesus saith to them:  Come and dine.  And none of them who were at\nmeat, durst ask him:  Who art thou?  Knowing that it was the Lord.","And Jesus cometh and taketh bread and giveth them:  and fish in\nlike manner.","This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his\ndisciples, after he was risen from the dead.","When therefore they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter:\nSimon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these?  He saith to him:\nYea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.  He saith to him:  Feed my\nlambs.","He saith to him again:  Simon, son of John, lovest thou me?  He\nsaith to him:  yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.  He saith to\nhim:  Feed my lambs.","He said to him the third time:  Simon, son of John, lovest thou\nme?  Peter was grieved because he had said to him the third time:  Lovest\nthou me?  And he said to him:  Lord, thou knowest all things:  thou\nknowest that I love thee.  He said to him:  Feed my sheep.","Amen, amen, I say to thee, When thou wast younger, thou didst\ngird thyself and didst walk where thou wouldst.  But when thou shalt be\nold, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee\nand lead thee whither thou wouldst not.","And this he said, signifying by what death he should glorify\nGod.  And when he had said this, he saith to him:  Follow me.","Peter turning about, saw that disciple whom Jesus loved\nfollowing, who also leaned on his breast at supper and said:  Lord, who\nis he that shall betray thee?","Him therefore when Peter had seen, he saith to Jesus:  Lord, and\nwhat shall this man do?","Jesus saith to him:  So I will have him to remain till I come,\nwhat is it to thee?  Follow thou me.","This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren, that that\ndisciple should not die.  And Jesus did not say to him:  He should not\ndie; but:  So I will have him to remain till I come, what is it to thee?","This is that disciple who giveth testimony of these things and\nhath written these things:  and we know that his testimony is true.","But there are also many other things which Jesus did which, if\nthey were written every one, the world itself.  I think, would not be\nable to contain the books that should be written."]}
