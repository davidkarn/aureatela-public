Will the time never come when a breathless messenger shall bring the news that our dear Marcella has reached the shores of Palestine, and when every band of monks and every troop of virgins shall unite in a song of welcome? In our excitement we are already hurrying to meet you: without waiting for a vehicle, we hasten off at once on foot. We shall clasp you by the hand, we shall look upon your face; and when, after long waiting, we at last embrace you, we shall find it hard to tear ourselves away.

In short, they overlook the fact that while they pretend to upbraid us with `cowardice,' they are really criminating themselves: for if it be disgraceful to flee, it is still more so to pursue, since the one is only endeavoring to avoid being murdered, while the other is seeking to commit the deed. But Scripture itself directs us to flee:[fn-10-P1062_473279:27-nf] and those who persecute unto death, in attempting to violate the law, constrain us to have recourse to flight. They should rather, therefore, be ashamed of their persecution, than reproach us for having sought to escape from it: let them cease to harass, and those who flee will also cease. Nevertheless they set no bounds to their malevolence, using every art to entrap us, in the consciousness that the flight of the persecuted is the strongest condemnation of the persecutor: for no one runs away from a mild and beneficent person, but from one who is of a barbarous and cruel disposition. Hence it was that `Every one that was discontented and in debt' fled from Saul to David.[fn-10-P1063_473979:28-nf] Wherefore these [foes of ours] in like manner desire to kill such as conceal themselves, that no evidence may exist to convict them of their wickedness.

If they act the part of assassins, the voice of the blood which is shed will cry against them the louder: and if they condemn to banishment, they will raise so everywhere living monuments-of their own injustice and oppression. Surely unless their intellects were unsound they would perceive the dilemma in which their own counsels entangle them. But since they have lost sound judgment, their folly is exposed when they vanish, and when they seek to stay they do not see their wickedness.[fn-10-P1064_474846:29-nf] But if they reproach those who succeed in secreting themselves from the malice of their blood-thirsty adversaries, and revile such as flee from their persecutors, what will they say to Jacob's retreat from the rage of his brother Esau,[fn-10-P1065_475109:30-nf] and to Moses[fn-10-P1066_475140:31-nf] retiring into the land of Midian for fear of Pharaoh? And what apology will these babblers make for David's[fn-10-P1067_475265:32-nf] flight from Saul, when he sent messengers from his own house to dispatch him; and for his concealment in a cave, after contriving to extricate himself from the treacherous designs of Abimelech,[fn-10-P1068_475480:33-nf] by feigning madness? What will these reckless asserters of whatever suits their purpose answer, when they are reminded of the great prophet Elijah,[fn-10-P1069_475679:34-nf] who by calling upon God had recalled the dead to life, hiding himself from dread of Ahab, and fleeing on account of Jezebel's menaces? At which time the sons of the prophets also, being sought for in order to be slain, withdrew, and were concealed in caves by Obadiah;[fn-10-P1070_475969:35-nf] or are they unacquainted with these instances because of their antiquity? Have they forgotten also what is recorded in the Gospel, that the disciples retreated and hid themselves for fear of the Jews?[fn-10-P1071_476193:36-nf] Paul,[fn-10-P1072_476220:37-nf] when sought for by the governor [of Damascus] `was let down from the wall in a basket, and thus escaped the hands of him that sought him.' Since then Scripture relates these circumstances concerning the saints, what excuse can they fabricate for their temerity? If they charge us with `cowardice,' it is in utter insensibility to the condemnation it pronounces on themselves. If they asperse these holy men by asserting that they acted contrary to the will of God, they demonstrate their ignorance of Scripture. For it was commanded in the Law that `cities of refuge' should be constituted,[fn-10-P1073_476846:38-nf] by which provision was made that such as were pursued in order to be put to death might have means afforded of preserving themselves. Again in the consummation of the ages, when the Word of the Father, who had before spoken by Moses, came himself to the earth, he gave this express injunction, `When they persecute you in one city, flee unto another:'[fn-10-P1074_477219:39-nf] and shortly after, `When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (let whosoever reads, understand), then let those in Judea flee unto the mountains: let him that is on the house-top not come down to take anything out of his house; nor him that is in the fields return to take his clothes.'[fn-10-P1075_477598:40-nf] The saints therefore knowing these precepts, had such a sort of training for their action: for what the Lord then commanded, he had before his coming in the flesh already spoken of by his servants. And this is a universal rule for man, leading to perfection, `to practice whatever God has enjoined.' On this account the Word himself, becoming incarnate for our sake, deigned to conceal himself when he was sought for;[fn-10-P1076_478040:41-nf] and being again persecuted, condescended to withdraw to avoid the conspiracy against him. For thus it became him, by hungering and thirsting and suffering other afflictions, to demonstrate that he was indeed made man.[fn-10-P1077_478278:42-nf] For at the very commencement, as soon as he was born, he gave this direction by an angel to Joseph: `Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, for Herod will seek the infant's life.'[fn-10-P1078_478521:43-nf] And after Herod's death, it appears that for fear of his son Archelaus he retired to Nazareth. Subsequently; when he gave unquestionable evidence of his Divine character by healing the withered hand, `when the Pharisees took council how they might destroy him,[fn-10-P1079_478815:44-nf] Jesus knowing their wickedness withdrew himself thence.' Moreover, when he had raised Lazarus from the dead, and they had become still more intent on destroying him, [we are told that] `Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews,[fn-10-P1080_479080:45-nf] but retired into a region on the borders of the desert.' Again when the Saviour said, `Before Abraham was, I am;'[fn-10-P1081_479225:46-nf] and the Jews took up stones to cast at him; Jesus concealed himself, and going through the midst of them out of the Temple, went away thence, and so escaped. Since then they see these things, or rather understand them,[fn-10-P1082_479464:47-nf] (for they will not see,) are they not deserving of being burnt with fire, according to what is written, for acting and speaking so plainly contrary to all that the Lord did and taught? Finally, when John had suffered martyrdom, and his disciples had buried his body, Jesus having heard what was done, departed thence by ship into a desert place apart.[fn-10-P1083_479849:48-nf] Now the Lord did these things and so taught. But would that these men of whom I speak, had the modesty to confine their rashness to men only, without daring to be guilty of such madness as to accuse the Saviour himself of `cowardice'; especially after having already uttered blasphemies against him. But even if they be insane they will not be tolerated and their ignorance of the gospels be detected by every one. The cause for retreat and flight under such circumstances as these is reasonable and valid, of which the evangelists have afforded us precedents in the conduct of our Saviour himself: from which it may be inferred that the saints have always been justly influenced by the same principle, since whatever is recorded of him as man, is applicable to mankind in general. For he took on himself our nature, and exhibited in himself the affections of our infirmity, which John has thus indicated: `Then they sought to take him; but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.'[fn-10-P1084_480887:49-nf] Moreover, before that hour came, he himself said to his mother, `Mine hour is not yet come;'[fn-10-P1085_480999:50-nf] and to those who were denominated his brethren, `My time is not yet come.' Again when the time had arrived, he said to his disciples, `Sleep on now, and take your rest: for behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.'[fn-10-P1086_481295:51-nf] ... So[fn-10-P1087_481321:52-nf] that he neither permitted himself to be apprehended before the time came; nor when the time was come did he conceal himself, but voluntarily gave himself up to those who had conspired against him.[fn-10-P1088_481543:53-nf] ...Thus also the blessed martyrs have guarded themselves in times of persecution: being persecuted they fled, and kept themselves concealed; but being discovered they suffered martyrdom.","title":"Book III.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_02_npnf2_02_08_book_iii_","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"NPNF2-02","text":"On this occasion Athanasius read to those present the Defense which he had composed some time before in justification of his flight; a few passages from which it may be of service to introduce here, leaving the entire production, which is too long to be transcribed, to be sought out and perused by the studious.[fn-10-P1061_472594:26-nf] See the daring enormities of the impious persons!

On this account the Word himself, becoming incarnate for our sake, deigned to conceal himself when he was sought for;[fn-10-P1076_478040:41-nf] and being again persecuted, condescended to withdraw to avoid the conspiracy against him. For thus it became him, by hungering and thirsting and suffering other afflictions, to demonstrate that he was indeed made man.[fn-10-P1077_478278:42-nf] For at the very commencement, as soon as he was born, he gave this direction by an angel to Joseph: `Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, for Herod will seek the infant's life.'[fn-10-P1078_478521:43-nf] And after Herod's death, it appears that for fear of his son Archelaus he retired to Nazareth. Subsequently; when he gave unquestionable evidence of his Divine character by healing the withered hand, `when the Pharisees took council how they might destroy him,[fn-10-P1079_478815:44-nf] Jesus knowing their wickedness withdrew himself thence.' Moreover, when he had raised Lazarus from the dead, and they had become still more intent on destroying him, [we are told that] `Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews,[fn-10-P1080_479080:45-nf] but retired into a region on the borders of the desert.' Again when the Saviour said, `Before Abraham was, I am;'[fn-10-P1081_479225:46-nf] and the Jews took up stones to cast at him; Jesus concealed himself, and going through the midst of them out of the Temple, went away thence, and so escaped. Since then they see these things, or rather understand them,[fn-10-P1082_479464:47-nf] (for they will not see,) are they not deserving of being burnt with fire, according to what is written, for acting and speaking so plainly contrary to all that the Lord did and taught? Finally, when John had suffered martyrdom, and his disciples had buried his body, Jesus having heard what was done, departed thence by ship into a desert place apart.[fn-10-P1083_479849:48-nf] Now the Lord did these things and so taught. But would that these men of whom I speak, had the modesty to confine their rashness to men only, without daring to be guilty of such madness as to accuse the Saviour himself of `cowardice'; especially after having already uttered blasphemies against him. But even if they be insane they will not be tolerated and their ignorance of the gospels be detected by every one. The cause for retreat and flight under such circumstances as these is reasonable and valid, of which the evangelists have afforded us precedents in the conduct of our Saviour himself: from which it may be inferred that the saints have always been justly influenced by the same principle, since whatever is recorded of him as man, is applicable to mankind in general. For he took on himself our nature, and exhibited in himself the affections of our infirmity, which John has thus indicated: `Then they sought to take him; but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.'[fn-10-P1084_480887:49-nf] Moreover, before that hour came, he himself said to his mother, `Mine hour is not yet come;'[fn-10-P1085_480999:50-nf] and to those who were denominated his brethren, `My time is not yet come.' Again when the time had arrived, he said to his disciples, `Sleep on now, and take your rest: for behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.'[fn-10-P1086_481295:51-nf] ... So[fn-10-P1087_481321:52-nf] that he neither permitted himself to be apprehended before the time came; nor when the time was come did he conceal himself, but voluntarily gave himself up to those who had conspired against him.[fn-10-P1088_481543:53-nf] ...Thus also the blessed martyrs have guarded themselves in times of persecution: being persecuted they fled, and kept themselves concealed; but being discovered they suffered martyrdom.","title":"Book III.","author":"Socrates Scholasticus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_01_npnf1_01_13_book_v_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"NPNF1-01","text":"4.

It never entered his mind, however, along with this conceit, to venture to affirm that children of men are born without original sin. If, indeed, he had added such an opinion, the women might have more readily consented to marry, to give birth to such pure offspring. When this man's writings (for he dared to write) were by the brethren forwarded to Jerome to refute, he not only discovered no such error in them, but, while looking out his conceits for refutation, he found among other passages this very clear testimony to the doctrine of man's original sin, from which Jerome indeed felt satisfied of the man's belief of that doctrine.[fn-11-P1183_616709:28-nf] These are his words when treating of it: \"He who says that he abides in Christ, ought himself also to walk even as He walked.[fn-11-P1184_616900:29-nf] We give our opponent the option to choose which alternative he likes.

Moreover, by superadding, \"But such indeed ye have been; but ye have received ablution, but ye have been sanctified, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God; \"[fn-15-P1507_441754:166-nf] in as far as he puts on the paid side of the account such sins before baptism, in so far after baptism he determines them irremissible, if it is true, (as it is), that they are not allowed to \"receive ablution\" anew. Recognise, too, in what follows, Paul (in the character of) an immoveable column of discipline and its rules: \"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: God maketh a full end both of the one and of the others; but the body (is) not for fornication, but for God: \"[fn-15-P1508_442266:167-nf] for \"Let Us make man,\" said God, \"(conformable) to Our image and likeness.\" \"And God made man; (conformable) to the image and likeness of God made He him.\"[fn-15-P1509_442438:168-nf] \"The Lord for the body: \"yes; for \"the Word was made flesh.\"[fn-15-P1510_442528:169-nf] \"Moreover, God both raised up the Lord, and will raise up us through His own power; \"[fn-15-P1511_442633:170-nf] on account, to wit, of the union of our body with Him. And accordingly, \"Know ye not your bodies (to be) members of Christ? \"because Christ, too, is God's temple. \"Overturn this temple, and I will in three days' space resuscitate it.\"[fn-15-P1512_442890:171-nf] \"Taking away the members of Christ, shall I make (them) members of an harlot? Know ye not, that whoever is agglutinated to an harlot is made one body? (for the two shall be (made) into one flesh): but whoever is agglutinated to the Lord is one spirit? Flee fornication.\"[fn-15-P1513_443181:172-nf] If revocable by pardon, in what sense am I to flee it, to turn adulterer anew? I shall gain nothing if I do flee it: I shall be \"one body,\" to which by communion I shall be agglutinated. \"Every sin which a human being may have committed is extraneous to the body; but whoever fornicateth, sinneth against his own body.\"[fn-15-P1514_443526:173-nf] And, for fear you should fly to that statement for a licence to fornication, on the ground that you will be sinning against a thing which is yours, not the Lord's, he takes you away from yourself, and awards you, according to his previous disposition, to Christ: \"And ye are not your own; \"immediately opposing (thereto), \"for bought ye are with a price\"-the blood, to wit, of the Lord:[fn-15-P1515_443935:174-nf] \"glorify and extol the Lord in your body.\"[fn-15-P1516_444031:175-nf] See whether he who gives this injunction be likely to have pardoned one who has disgraced the Lord, and who has cast Him down from (the empire of) his body, and this indeed through incest. If you wish to imbibe to the utmost all knowledge of the apostle, in order to understand with what an axe of censorship he lops, and eradicates, and extirpates, every forest of lusts, for fear of permitting aught to regain strength and sprout again; behold him desiring souls to keep a fast from the legitimate fruit of nature-the apple, I mean, of marriage: \"But with regard to what ye wrote, good it is for a man to have no contact with a woman; but, on account of fornication, let each one have his own wife: let husband to wife, and wife to husband, render what is due.\"[fn-15-P1517_444834:176-nf] Who but must know that it was against his will that he relaxed the bond of this \"good,\" in order to prevent fornication? But if he either has granted, or does grant, indulgence to fornication, of course he has frustrated the design of his own remedy. and will be bound forthwith to put the curb upon the nuptials of continence, if the fornication for the sake of which those nuptials are permitted shall cease to be feared. For (a fornication) which has indulgence granted it will not be feared. And yet he professes that he has granted the use of marriage \"by way of indulgence, not of command.\"[fn-15-P1518_445455:177-nf] For he \"wills\" all to be on a level with himself. But when things lawful are (only) granted by way of indulgence, who hope for things unlawful? \"To the unmarried\" also, \"and widows,\" he says, \"It is good, by his example, to persevere\" (in their present state); \"but if they were too weak, to marry; because it is preferable to marry than to bum.\"[fn-15-P1519_445823:178-nf] With what fires, I pray you, is it preferable to \"burn\"-(the fires) of concupiscence, or (the fires) of penalty? Nay, but if fornication is pardonable, it will not be an object of concupiscence. But it is more (the manner) of an apostle to take forethought for the fires of penalty. Wherefore, if it is penalty which \"burns,\" it follows that fornication, which penalty awaits, is not pardonable. Meantime withal, while prohibiting divorce, he uses the Lord's precept against adultery as an instrument for providing, in place of divorce, either perseverance in widowhood, or else a reconciliation of peace: inasmuch as \"whoever shall have dismissed a wife (for any cause) except the cause of adultery, maketh her commit adultery; and he who marrieth one dismissed by a husband committeth adultery.\"[fn-15-P1520_446646:179-nf] What powerful remedies does the Holy Spirit furnish, to prevent, to wit, the commission anew of that which He wills not should anew be pardoned!","title":"VII.

This would be a real difficulty and one for ever incapable of solution were it not solved by the witness of John himself, who immediately goes on to say,[fn-65-P6593_2064420:4-nf] \"My little children, guard yourselves from idols.\" If everyone that is born of God sinneth not, and cannot be tempted by the devil, how is it that he bids them beware of temptation? Again in the same Epistle we read:[fn-65-P6594_2064654:5-nf] \"If we say that we have no sins, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.\" I suppose that John was baptized and was writing to the baptized: I imagine too that all sin is of the devil. Now John confesses himself a sinner, and hopes for forgiveness of sins after baptism. My friend Jovinianus says,[fn-65-P6595_2065178:6-nf] \"Touch me not, for I am clean.\" What then? Does the Apostle contradict himself? By no means. In the same passage he gives his reason for thus speaking:[fn-65-P6596_2065429:7-nf] \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. And hereby know we that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby know we that we are in him: he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.\" My reason for telling you, little children, that everyone who is born of God sinneth not, is that you may not sin, and that you may know that so long as you sin not I you abide in the birth which God has given you. Yea, they who abide in that birth cannot sin.[fn-65-P6597_2066320:8-nf] \"For what communion hath light with darkness? Or Christ with Belial?\" As day is distinct from night, so righteousness and unrighteousness, sin and good works, Christ and Antichrist cannot blend. If we give Christ a lodging-place in our hearts, we banish the devil from thence. If we sin and the devil enter through the gate of sin, Christ will immediately withdraw. Hence David after sinning says:[fn-65-P6598_2066751:9-nf] \"Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation,\" that is, the joy which he had lost by sinning.[fn-65-P6599_2066858:10-nf] \"He who saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.\" Christ is called the truth:[fn-66-P6600_2067007:11-nf] \"I am the way, the truth, and the life.\" In vain do we make our boast in him whose commandments we keep not. To him that knoweth what is good, and doeth it not, it is sin.[fn-66-P6601_2067199:12-nf] \"As the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.\" And we must not think it a great matter to know the only God, when even devils believe and tremble. \"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.\" Our opponent may choose whichever of the two he likes; we give him his choice. Does he abide in Christ, or not? If he abide, let him then walk as Christ walked. But if there is[fn-66-P6602_2067660:13-nf] rashness in professing to copy the virtues of our Lord, he does not abide in Christ, for he does not walk as did Christ.[fn-66-P6603_2068078:14-nf] \"He did not sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: when he was reviled, he reviled not again, and as a lamb is dumb before its shearer, so opened he not his mouth.\" To Him came the prince of this world, and found nothing in Him: although He had done no sin, God made Him sin for us. But we, according to the Epistle of James,[fn-66-P6604_2068429:15-nf] \"all stumble in many things,\" and[fn-66-P6605_2068482:16-nf] \"no one is pure from sin, no not if his life be but a day long.\"[fn-66-P6606_2068582:17-nf] For who will boast \"that he has a clean heart? or who will be sure that he is pure from sin?\" And we are held guilty after the similitude of Adam's transgression. Hence David says,[fn-66-P6607_2068781:18-nf] \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" And the blessed Job,[fn-66-P6608_2068892:19-nf] \"Though I be righteous my mouth will speak wickedness, and though I be perfect, I shall be found perverse. If I wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean, yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me.\" But that we may not utterly despair and think that if we sin after baptism we cannot be saved, he immediately checks the tendency:[fn-66-P6609_2069307:20-nf] \"And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins. And not for ours only, but also for the whole world.\" He addresses this to baptized believers, and he promises them the Lord as an advocate for their offences. He does not say: If you fall into sin, you have an advocate with the Father, Christ, and He is the propitiation for your sins: you might then say that he was addressing those whose baptism had been destitute of the true faith: but what he says is this, \"We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, and he is the propitiation for our sins.\" And not only for the sins of John and his contemporaries, but for those of the whole world. Now in \"the whole world\" are included apostles and all the faithful, and a clear proof is established that sin after baptism is possible. It is useless for us to have an advocate Jesus Christ, if sin be impossible.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":2,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_01_anf01_21_the_epistle_of_ignatius_to_the_smyrnaeans","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"25","folder":"ANF-01","text":"Now, He suffered all these things for us; and He suffered them really, and not in appearance only, even as also He truly rose again.

What need is there of any words of ours to reveal how great is the profanity of such a notion, when the heretical utterance of itself proclaims aloud its monstrosity? For if He was obedient for this reason only that He was so made, then of course He is not on an equal footing even with humanity, since on this theory, while our soul is self-determining and independent, choosing as it will with sovereignty over itself that which is pleasing to it, He on the contrary exercises, or rather experiences, obedience under the constraint of a compulsory law of His nature, while His nature suffers Him not to disobey, even if He would. For it was \"as the result of being Son, and being begotten, that He has thus shown Himself obedient in words and obedient in acts.\" Alas, for the brutish stupidity of this doctrine! Thou makest the Word obedient to words, and supposest other words prior to Him Who is truly the Word, and another Word of the Beginning is mediator between the Beginning and the Word that was in the Beginning, conveying to Him the decision.

For He that said, \"Unto Thee shall all flesh come[fn-12-P1220_663010:208-nf] ,\" does not mean that the flesh will be presented before the Judge apart from the souls: and when we read in sacred History that Jacob went down into Egypt with seventy-five souls[fn-12-P1221_663210:209-nf] we understand the flesh also to be intended together with the souls.

Now let us see what he says about the Holy Spirit. \"After Him, we believe,\" he says, \"on the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth.\" I think it will be plain to all who come across this passage what object he has in view in thus perverting the declaration of the faith delivered to us by the Lord, in his statements concerning the Son and the Father. Though this absurdity has already been exposed, I will nevertheless endeavour, in few words, to make plain the aim of his knavery. As in the former case, he avoided using the name \"Father,\" that so he might not include the Son in the eternity of the Father, so he avoided employing the title Son, that he might not by it suggest His natural affinity to the Father; so here, too, he refrains from saying \"Holy Spirit,\" that he may not by this name acknowledge the majesty of His glory, and His complete union with the Father and the Son. For since the appellation of \"Spirit,\" and that of \"Holy,\" are by the Scriptures equally applied to the Father and the Son (for \"God is a Spirits[fn-12-P1225_665183:210-nf] ,\" and \"the anointed Lord is the Spirit before our face[fn-12-P1226_665262:211-nf] ,\" and \"the Lord our God is Holy[fn-12-P1227_665326:212-nf] ,\" and there is \"one Holy, one Lord Jesus Christ[fn-12-P1228_665395:213-nf] \") lest there should, by the use of these terms, be bred in the minds of his readers some orthodox conception of the Holy Spirit, such as would naturally arise in them from His sharing His glorious appellation with the Father and the Son, for this reason, deluding the ears of the foolish, he changes the words of the Faith as set forth by God in the delivery of this mystery, making a way, so to speak, by this sequence, for the entrance of his impiety against the Holy Spirit. For if he had said, \"We believe in the Holy Spirit,\" and \"God is a Spirit,\" any one instructed in things divine would have interposed the remark, that if we are to believe in the Holy Spirit, while God is called a Spirit, He is assuredly not distinct in nature from that which receives the same titles in a proper sense. For of all those things which are indicated not unreally, nor metaphorically, but properly and absolutely, by the same names, we are necessarily compelled to acknowledge that the nature also, which is signified by this identity of names, is one and the same. For this reason it is that, suppressing the name appointed by the Lord in the formula of the faith, he says, \"We believe in the Comforter.\" But I have been taught that this very name is also applied by the inspired Scripture to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost alike. For the Son gives the name of \"Comforter\" equally to Himself and to the Holy Spirit[fn-12-P1229_666903:214-nf] ; and the Father, where He is said to work comfort, surely claims as His own the name of \"Comforter.\" For assuredly he Who does the work of a Comforter does not disdain the name belonging to the work: for David says to the Father, \"Thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me[fn-12-P1230_667203:215-nf] ,\" and the great Apostle applies to the Father the same language, when he says, \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1231_667403:216-nf] \"; and John, in one of his Catholic Epistles, expressly gives to the Son the name of Comforter[fn-12-P1232_667520:217-nf] . Nay, more, the Lord Himself, in saying that another Comforter would be sent us, when speaking of the Spirit, clearly asserted this title of Himself in the first place. But as there are two senses of the parakalein[fn-12-P1233_667807:218-nf] ,-one to beseech, by words and gestures of respect, to induce him to whom we apply for anything, to feel with us in respect of those things for which we apply,-the other to comfort, to take remedial thought for affections of body and soul,-the Holy Scripture affirms the conception of the Paraclete, in either sense alike, to belong to the Divine nature. For at one time Paul sets before us by the word parakalein the healing power of God, as when he says, \"God, Who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus[fn-12-P1234_668424:219-nf] \"; and at another time he uses this word in its other meaning, when he says, writing to the Corinthians, \"Now we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God[fn-12-P1235_668680:220-nf] .\" Now since these things are so, in whatever way you understand the title \"Paraclete,\" when used of the Spirit, you will not in either of its significations detach Him from His community in it with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, he has not been able, even though he wished it, to belittle the glory of the Spirit by ascribing to Him the very attribute which Holy Scripture refers also to the Father and to the Son. But in styling Him \"the Spirit of Truth,\" Eunomius' own wish, I suppose, was to suggest by this phrase subjection, since Christ is the Truth, and he called Him the Spirit of Truth, as if one should say that He is a possession and chattel of the Truth, without being aware that God is called a God of righteousness[fn-12-P1236_669437:221-nf] ; and we certainly do not understand thereby that God is a possession of righteousness. Wherefore also, when we hear of the \"Spirit of Truth,\" we acquire by that phrase such a conception as befits the Deity, being guided to the loftier interpretation by the words which follow it. For when the Lord said \"The Spirit of Truth,\" He immediately added \"Which proceedeth from the Father[fn-12-P1237_669966:222-nf] ,\" a fact which the voice of the Lord never asserted of any conceivable thing in creation, not of aught visible or invisible, not of thrones, principalities, powers, or dominions, nor of any other name that is named either in this world or in that which is to come. It is plain then that that, from share in which all creation is excluded, is something special and peculiar to uncreated being. But this man bids us believe in \"the Guide of godliness.\" Let a man then believe in Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and all those by whom we have been led into the way of thefaith. For if we are to believe in \"that which guides us to godliness,\" along with the Father and the Son, all the prophets and lawgivers and patriarchs, heralds, evangelists, apostles, pastors,and teachers, have equal honour with the Holy Spirit, as they bare been \"guides to godliness\" to those who came after them. \"Who came into being,\" he goes on, \"by the only God through the Only-begotten.\" In these words he gathers up in one head all his blasphemy. Once more he calls the Father \"only God,\" who employs the Only-begotten as an instrument for the production of the Spirit. What shadow of such a notion did he find in Scripture, that he ventures upon this assertion? by deduction from what premises did he bring his profanity to such a conclusion as this?Which of the Evangelists says it? what apostle? what prophet? Nay, on the contrary every scripture divinely inspired, written by the afflatus of the Spirit, attests the Divinity of the Spirit. For example (for it is better to prove my position from the actual testimonies), those who receive power to become children of God bear witness to the Divinity of the Spirit. Who knows not that utterance of the Lord which tells us that they who are born of the Spirit are the children of God? For thus He expressly ascribes the birth of the children of God to the Spirit, saying, that as that which is born of the flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. But as many as are born of the Spirit are called the children of God[fn-12-P1238_672086:223-nf] . So also when the Lord by breathing upon His disciples had imparted to them the Holy Spirit, John says, \"Of His fulness have all we received[fn-12-P1239_672321:224-nf] .\" And that \"in Him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead[fn-12-P1240_672419:225-nf] ,\" the mighty Paul attests: yea, moreover, through the prophet Isaiah it is attested, as to the manifestation of the Divine appearance vouchsafed to him, when he saw Him that sat \"on the throne high and lifted up[fn-12-P1241_672651:226-nf] ;\" the older tradition, it is true, says that it was the Father Who appeared to him, but the evangelist John refers the prophecy to our Lord, saying, touching those of the Jews who did not believe the words uttered by the prophet concerning the Lord, \"These things said Esaias, when he saw His glory and spoke of Him[fn-12-P1242_672986:227-nf] .\" But the mighty Paul attributes the same passage to the Holy Spirit in his speech made to the Jews at Rome, when he says, \"Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet concerning you, saying, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand[fn-12-P1243_673333:228-nf] ,\" showing, in my opinion, by Holy Scripture itself, that every specially divine vision, every theophany, every word uttered in the Person of God, is to be understood to refer to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hence when David says, \"they provoked God in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert[fn-12-P1244_673719:229-nf] ,\" the apostle refers to the Holy Spirit the despite done by the Israelites to God, in these terms: \"Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me[fn-12-P1245_674004:230-nf] ,\" and goes on to refer all that the prophecy refers to God, to the Person of the Holy Ghost. Those who keep repeating against us the phrase \"three Gods,\" because we hold these views, have perhaps not yet learnt how to count. For if the Father and the Son are not divided into duality, (for they are, according to the Lord's words, One, and not Two[fn-12-P1246_674374:231-nf] ) and if the Holy Ghost is also one, how can one added to one be divided into the number of three Gods? Is it not rather plain that no one can charge us with believing in the number of three Gods, without himself first maintaining in his own doctrine a pair of Gods? For it is by being added to two that the one completes the triad of Gods. But what room is there for the charge of tritheism against those by whom one God is worshipped, the God expressed by the Name ofthe Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost?","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":2,"verse":4,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_11_book_vii_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"78","folder":"ANF-05","text":"When, therefore, he says, the entire Sonship shall have come, and shall be above the conterminous spirit, then the creature will become the object of mercy. For (the creature) groans until now,[fn-18-P1873_581194:54-nf] and is tormented, and waits for the manifestation of the sons of God, in order that all who are men of the Sonship may ascend from thence. When this takes place, God, he says, will bring upon the whole world enormous ignorance, that all things may continue according to nature, and that nothing may inordinately desire anything of the things that are contrary to nature. But (far from it); for all the souls of this quarter of creation, as many as possess the nature of remaining immortal in this (region) only, continue (in it), aware of nothing superior or better (than their present state). And there will not prevail any rumour or knowledge in regions below, concerning beings whose dwelling is placed above, lest subjacent souls should be wrung with torture from longing after impossibilities. (It would be) just as if a fish were to crave to feed on the mountains along with sheep. (For) a wish of this description would, he says, be their destruction. All things, therefore, that abide in (this) quarter[fn-18-P1874_582228:55-nf] are incorruptible, but corruptible if they are disposed to wander and cross over from the things that are according to nature. In this way the Archon of the Hebdomad will know nothing of superjacent entities. For enormous ignorance will lay hold on this one likewise, in order that sorrow, and grief, and groaning may depart from him; for he will not desire aught of impossible things, nor will he be visited with anguish. In like manner, however, the same ignorance will lay hold also on the Great Archon of the Ogdoad, and similarly on all the creatures that are subject unto him, in order that in no respect anything may desire aught of those things that are contrary to nature, and may not (thus) be overwhelmed with sorrow. And so there will be the restitution of all things which, in conformity with nature, have from the beginning a foundation in the seed of the universe, but will be restored at (their own) proper periods.

This is, according to these (Basilidians), he who has been conceived as the inner spiritual man in what is natural (now this is the Sonship which left there the soul, not (that it might be) mortal, but that it might abide here according to nature, just as the first Sonship left above in its proper locality the Holy Spirit, (that is, the spirit) which is conterminous),-(this, I say, is he who has been conceived as the inner spiritual man, and) has then been arrayed in his own peculiar soul.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Hippolytus"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_22_a_treatise_on_the_soul_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"101","folder":"ANF-03","text":"Then, again, when we encounter the question (as to the veracity of those five senses which we learn with our alphabet; since from this source even there arises some support for our heretics. They are the faculties of seeing, and hearing, and smelling, and tasting, and touching. The fidelity of these senses is impugned with too much severity by the Platonists,[fn-27-P2737_915262:118-nf] and according to some by Heraclitus also, and Diocles, and Empedocles; at any rate, Plato, in the Timµus, declares the operations of the senses to be irrational, and vitiated[fn-27-P2738_915455:119-nf] by our opinions or beliefs. Deception is imputed to the sight, because it asserts that oars, when immersed in the water, are inclined or bent, notwithstanding the certainty that they are straight; because, again, it is quite sure that distant tower with its really quadrangular contour is round; because also it will discredit the fact of the truly parallel fabric of yonder porch or arcade, by supposing it to be narrower and narrower towards its end; and because it will join with the sea the sky which hangs at so great a height above it. In the same way, our hearing is charged with fallacy: we think, for instance, that is a noise in the sky which is nothing else than the rumbling of a carriage; or, if you prefer it[fn-27-P2739_916255:120-nf] the other way, when the thunder rolled at a distance, we were quite sure that it was a carriage which made the noise. Thus, too, are our faculties of smell and taste at fault, because the selfsame perfumes and wines lose their value after we have used them awhile. On the same principle our touch is censured, when the identical pavement which seemed rough to the hands is felt by the feet to be smooth enough; and in the baths a stream of warm water is pronounced to be quite hot at first, and beautifully temperate afterwards. Thus, according to them, our senses deceive us, when all the while we are (the cause of the discrepancies, by) changing our opinions. The Stoics are more moderate in their views; for they do not load with the obloquy of deception every one of the senses, and at all times. The Epicureans, again, show still greater consistency, in maintaining that all the senses are equally true in their testimony, and always so-only in a different way. It is not our organs of sensation that are at fault, but our opinion. The senses only experience sensation, they do not exercise opinion; it is the soul that opines. They separated opinion from the senses, and sensation from the soul. Well, but whence comes opinion, if not from the senses? Indeed, unless the eye had descried a round shape in that tower, it could have had no idea that it possessed roundness. Again, whence arises sensation if not from the soul? For if the soul had no body, it would have no sensation. Accordingly, sensation comes from the soul, and opinion from sensation; and the whole (process) is the soul. But further, it may well be insisted on that there is a something which causes the discrepancy between the report of the senses and the reality of the facts. Now, since it is possible, (as we have seen), for phenomena to be reported which exist not in the objects, why should it not be equally possible for phenomena to be reported which are caused not by the senses, but by reasons and conditions which intervene, in the very nature of the case? If so, it will be only right that they should be duly recognised. The truth is, that it was the water which was the cause of the oar seeming to be inclined or bent: out of the water, it was perfectly straight in appearance (as well as in fact). The delicacy of the substance or medium which forms a mirror by means of its luminosity, according as it is struck or shaken, by the vibration actually destroys the appearance of the straightness of a right line. In like manner, the condition of the open space which fills up the interval between it and us, necessarily causes the true shape of the tower to escape our notice; for the uniform density of the surrounding air covering its angles with a similar light obliterates their outlines. So, again, the equal breadth of the arcade is sharpened or narrowed off towards its termination, until its aspect, becoming more and more contracted under its prolonged roof, comes to a vanishing point in the direction of its farthest distance. So the sky blends itself with the sea, the vision becoming spent at last, which had maintained duly the boundaries of the two elements, so long as its vigorous glance lasted. As for the (alleged cases of deceptive) hearing, what else could produce the illusion but the similarity of the sounds? And if the perfume afterwards was less strong to the smell, and the wine more flat to the taste, and the water not so hot to the touch, their original strength was after all found in the whole of them pretty well unimpaired. In the matter, however, of the roughness and smoothness of the pavement, it was only natural and right that limbs like the hands and the feet, so different in tenderness and callousness, should have different impressions. In this way, then, there cannot occur an illusion in our senses without an adequate cause. Now if special causes, (such as we have indicated, ) mislead our senses add (through our senses) our opinions also, then we must no longer ascribe the deception to the senses, which follow the specific causes of the illusion, nor to the opinions we form; for these are occasioned and controlled by our senses, which only follow the causes. Persons who are afflicted with madness or insanity, mistake one object for another. Orestes in his sister sees his mother; Ajax sees Ulysses in the slaughtered herd; Athamas and Agave descry wild beasts in their children. Now is it their eyes or their phrenzy which you must blame for so vast a fallacy? All things taste bitter, in the redundancy of their bile, to those who have the jaundice. Is it their taste which you will charge with the physical prevarication, or their ill state of health? All the senses, therefore, are disordered occasionally, or imposed upon, but only in such a way as to be quite free of any fault in their own natural functions. But further still, not even against the specific causes and conditions themselves must we lay an indictment of deception. For, since these physical aberrations happen for stated reasons, the reasons do not deserve to be regarded as deceptions. Whatever ought to occur in a certain manner is not a deception. If, then, even these circumstantial causes must be acquitted of all censure and blame, how much more should we free from reproach the senses, over which the said causes exercise a liberal sway! Hence we are bound most certainly to claim for the senses truth, and fidelity, and integrity, seeing that they never render any other account of their impressions than is enjoined on them by the specific causes or conditions which in all cases produce that discrepancy which appears between the report of the senses and the reality of the objects. What mean you, then, O most insolent Academy? You overthrow the entire condition of human life; you disturb the whole order of nature; you obscure the good providence of God Himself: for the senses of man which God has appointed over all His works, that we might understand, inhabit, dispense, and enjoy them, (you reproach) as fallacious and treacherous tyrants! But is it not from these that all creation receives our services? Is it not by their means that a second form is impressed even upon the world?-so many arts, so many industrious resources, so many pursuits, such business, such offices, such commerce, such remedies, counsels, consolations, modes, civilizations, and accomplishments of life! All these things have produced the very relish and savour of human existence; whilst by these senses of man, he alone of all animated nature has the distinction of being a rational animal, with a capacity for intelligence and knowledge-nay, an ability to form the Academy itself! But Plato, in order to disparage the testimony of the senses, in the Phµdrus denies (in the person of Socrates) his own ability to know even himself, according to the injunction of the Delphic oracle; and in the Theµtetus he deprives himself of the faculties of knowledge and sensation; and again, in the Phµdrus he postpones till after death the posthumous knowledge, as he calls it, of the truth; and yet for all he went on playing the philosopher even before he died. We may not, I say, we may not call into question the truth of the (poor vilified) senses,[fn-27-P2740_923523:121-nf] lest we should even in Christ Himself, bring doubt upon[fn-27-P2741_923600:122-nf] the truth of their sensation; lest perchance it should be said that He did not really \"behold Satan as lightning fall from heaven; \"[fn-27-P2742_923753:123-nf] that He did not really hear the Father's voice testifying of Himself;[fn-27-P2743_923842:124-nf] or that He was deceived in touching Peter's wife's mother;[fn-27-P2744_923923:125-nf] or that the fragrance of the ointment which He afterwards smelled was different from that which He accepted for His burial;[fn-27-P2745_924070:126-nf] and that the taste of the wine was different from that which He consecrated in memory of His blood.[fn-27-P2746_924195:127-nf] On this false principle it was that Marcion actually chose to believe that He was a phantom, denying to Him the reality of a perfect body.

The Father bears witness from heaven, This is My Son; the Son on His part speaks of My Father's house, and My Father. The confession of that name gives salvation, when faith is demanded in the question, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? The pronoun My indicates that the noun which follows belongs to the speaker. What right, I demand, have you heretics to suppose it otherwise? You contradict the Father's word the Son's assertion; you empty language of its meaning, and distort the words of God into a sense they cannot bear.

Let us hear, then, how Israel, when dying in Egypt, in blessing his sons, prophetically blessed Judah. He says: \"Judah, thy brethren shall praise thee: thy hands shall be on the back of thine enemies; thy father's children shall adore thee. Judah is a lion's whelp: from the sprouting, my son, thou art gone up: lying down, thou hast slept as a lion, and as a lion's whelp; who shall awake him?

That power He Himself proclaims in the gospel, saying, \"I have the power of laying down my life, and I have the power of taking it again. No man taketh it from me; but I lay it down of myself, and take it again.\"[fn-29-P2990_1658946:115-nf] So the lion roared, so He fulfilled what He said.

Then we mention the Holy Church. And thus we are made to understand that the intelligent creation, which constitutes the free Jerusalem,[fn-24-P2456_1187752:99-nf] ought to be subordinate in the order of speech to the Creator, the Supreme Trinity: for all that is said of the man Christ Jesus has reference, of course, to the unity of the person of the Only-begotten. Therefore the true order of the Creed demanded that the Church should be made subordinate to the Trinity, as the house to Him who dwells in it, the temple to God who occupies it, and the city to its builder. And we are here to understand the whole Church, not that part of it only which wanders as a stranger on the earth, praising the name of God from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, and singing a new song of deliverance from its old captivity; but that part also which has always from its creation remained steadfast to God in heaven, and has never experienced the misery consequent upon a fall. This part is made up of the holy angels, who enjoy uninterrupted happiness; and (as it is bound to do) it renders assistance to the part which is still wandering among strangers: for these two parts shall be one in the fellowship of eternity, and now they are one in the bonds of love, the whole having been ordained for the worship of the one God. Wherefore, neither the whole Church, nor any part of it, has any desire to be worshipped instead of God, nor to be God to any one who belongs to the temple of God-that temple which is built up of the saints who were created by the uncreated God. And therefore the Holy Spirit, if a creature, could not be the Creator, but would be a part of the intelligent creation. He would simply be the highest creature, and therefore would not be mentioned in the Creed before the Church; for He Himself would belong to the Church. to that part of it which is in the heavens. And He would not have a temple, for He Himself would be part of a temple. Now He has a temple, of which the apostle says: \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?\"[fn-24-P2457_1189732:100-nf] Of which body he says in another place: \"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?\"[fn-24-P2458_1189853:101-nf] How, then, is He not God, seeing that He has a temple? and how can He be less than Christ, whose members are His temple?

It is foolish and absurd, that He should fear death, Who could lay down His soul, and take it up again, Who, to fulfil the mystery of human life, was about to die of His own free will. He cannot fear death Whose power and purpose in dying is to die but for a moment: fear is incompatible with willingness to die, and the power to live again, for both of these rob death of his terrors.","title":"Book X","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":2,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_17_book_x","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"64","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":" 59. How does He then lay down His soul, or take it up again? What is the meaning of this command He received? God could not lay it down that is, die, or take it up again, that is, come to life.

For from the rising even to the going down of the sun, my name is great among the nations; and in every place sacrifice shall be made, and a pure oblation shall be offered unto my name: for my name shall be great among the nations, saith the Lord.\"[fn-34-P3488_1884343:72-nf] Since we can already see this sacrifice offered to God in every place, from the rising of the sun to his going down, through Christ's priesthood after the order of Melchisedec, while the Jews, to whom it was said, \"I have no pleasure in you, neither will I accept a gift at your hand,\" cannot deny that their sacrifice has ceased, why do they still look for another Christ, when they read this in the prophecy, and see it fulfilled, which could not be fulfilled except through Him? And a little after he says of Him, in the person of God, \"My covenant was with Him of life and peace: and I gave to Him that He might fear me with fear, and be afraid before my name. The law of truth was in His mouth: directing in peace He hath walked with me, and hath turned many away from iniquity. For the Priest's lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at His mouth: for He is the Angel of the Lord Almighty.\"[fn-34-P3489_1885277:73-nf] Nor is it to be wondered at that Christ Jesus is called the Angel of the Almighty God. For just as He is called a servant on account of the form of a servant in which He came to men, so He is called an angel on account of the evangel which He proclaimed to men. For if we interpret these Greek words, evangel is \"good news,\" and angel is \"messenger.\" Again he says of Him, \"Behold I will send mine angel, and He will look out the way before my face: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come into His temple, even the Angel of the testament, whom ye desire. Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand at His appearing?\"[fn-34-P3490_1885985:74-nf] In this place he has foretold both the first and second advent of Christ: the first, to wit, of which he says, \"And He shall come suddenly into His temple;\" that is, into His flesh, of which He said in the Gospel, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\"[fn-34-P3491_1886287:75-nf] And of the second advent he says, \"Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand at His appearing?\" But what he says, \"The Lord whom ye seek, and the Angel of the testament whom ye desire,\" just means that even the Jews, according to the Scriptures which they read, shall seek and desire Christ. But many of them did not acknowledge that He whom they sought and desired had come, being blinded in their hearts, which were preoccupied with their own merits. Now what he here calls the testament, either above, where he says, \"My testament had been with Him,\" or here, where he has called Him the Angel of the testament, we ought, beyond a doubt, to take to be the new testament, in which the things promised are eternal, and not the old, in which they are only temporal. Yet many who are weak are troubled when they see the wicked abound in such temporal things, because they value them greatly, and serve the true God to be rewarded with them. On this account, to distinguish the eternal blessedness of the new testament, which shall be given only to the good, from the earthly felicity of the old, which for the most part is given to the bad as well, the same prophet says, \"Ye have made your words burdensome to me: yet ye have said, In what have we spoken ill of Thee? Ye have said, Foolish is every one who serves God; and what profit is it that we have kept His observances, and that we have walked as suppliants before the face of the Lord Almighty? And now we call the aliens blessed; yea, all that do wicked things are built up again; yea, they are opposed to God and are saved. They that feared the Lord uttered these reproaches every one to his neighbor: and the Lord hearkened and heard; and He wrote a book of remembrance before Him, for them that fear the Lord and that revere His name.\"[fn-34-P3492_1888166:76-nf] By that book is meant the New Testament. Finally, let us hear what follows: \"And they shall be an acquisition for me, saith the Lord Almighty, in the day which I make; and I will choose them as a man chooseth his son that serveth him. And ye shall return, and shall discern between the just and the unjust, and between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not. For, behold, the day cometh burning as an oven, and it shall burn them up; and all the aliens and all that do wickedly shall be stubble: and the day that shall come will set them on fire, saith the Lord Almighty, and shall leave neither root nor branch. And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, and health shall be in His wings; and ye shall go forth, and exult as calves let loose from bonds. And ye shall tread down the wicked, and they shall be ashes under your feet, in the day in which I shall do [this], saith the Lord Almighty.\"[fn-34-P3493_1889123:77-nf] This day is the day of judgment, of which, if God will, we shall speak more fully in its own place.","title":"Book XVIII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_18_lecture_xiii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"20.

For if, on the ground of His having said, \"Who is my mother?\" every one should conclude that He had no mother on earth, then each should as matter of course be also compelled to deny that the apostles had fathers on earth; since He gave them an injunction in these terms: \"Call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your Father, which is in heaven.\"[fn-32-P3210_1485586:47-nf] ","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":19,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_30_5_five_books_in_reply_to_marcion_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1206","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Denote our bodies: God's true temple[fn-47-P4777_759642:225-nf] He,","title":"5.

First he states that the assumed nature derives its descent from the loins of David; secondly that He took not a body only, but also an immortal soul, and thirdly that He delivered body and soul to death, and, after taking them again, raised them as He would. His own words are \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-63-P6316_1614143:415-nf] But we have learnt that the divine nature is immortal. What suffered was the passible, and the impassible remained impassible. For God the Word was made math not to render the impassible nature passible, but on the passible nature, by means of the Passion, to bestow the boon of impassibility. And the Lord Himself in the holy Gospels at one time says \"I have power to lay down my life and I have power to take it again, no man taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself;\" \"That I may take it again.\"[fn-63-P6317_1614667:416-nf] And again \"Therefore doth my Father love me because I lay down my life for the sheep,\"[fn-63-P6318_1614825:417-nf] and again \"Now is my soul troubled\"[fn-63-P6319_1614895:418-nf] \"my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death.\"[fn-63-P6320_1614966:419-nf] and of His body He says \"The bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world,\"[fn-63-P6321_1615099:420-nf] and when He delivered the divine mysteries and broke the symbol and distributed it, He added \"This is my body which is being broken for you for the remission of sins,\"[fn-63-P6322_1615287:421-nf] and again \"This is my blood which is shed for many for the remission of sins,\"[fn-63-P6323_1615654:422-nf] and again \"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood ye have no life in you\"[fn-63-P6324_1615772:423-nf] and \"Whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life\" \"in himself\" he adds.[fn-63-P6325_1615886:424-nf] Innumerable passages of the same character may be quoted, both in the old Testament find the new, pointing out the assumption both of the body and of the soul, and that they are descended from Abraham and David. Joseph of Arimathea when he came to Pilate begged the body of Jesus, and the fourfold authority[fn-63-P6326_1616214:425-nf] of the holy Gospels tells us how he received the body, wrapped it in the linen cloth, and committed it to the tomb. I do, indeed, sorrow and lament that I am compelled by the attacks of error to adduce against men supposed to be of one and the same faith with myself the arguments which I have already urged against the victims of the plague of Marcion,-of whom, by God's grace, I have converted more than ten thousand, and brought them to Holy Baptism. What child of the church ever had any doubts on these points? Who has not cited this teaching of the holy Fathers? The works of the great Basil are full of it; as well, as those of his fellow soldiers Gregory and Amphilochius, and of those who in the West have been illustrious teachers of grace, Damasus, bishop of great Rome, and Ambrose of Milan; and Cyprian of Carthage who for the sake of these doctrines won the martyr's crown. Five times was the famous Athanasius driven from his flock and compelled to dwell in exile; and in the cause of these doctrines strove too his master Alexander. Eustathius, Meletius, and Flavianus, luminaries of the East, and Ephraim, harp of the Spirit, who daily waters the people of Syria with the streams of grace; John and Atticus, lend heralds of the truth; and men of an earlier age than they, Ignatius, Polycarp, Irenaeus, Justin, and Hippolytus, of whom the more part not only shine at the head of the company of bishops, but also adorn the martyr's band.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":2,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"470","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"In his fourth chapter he denies the distinction of the terms of evangelists and apostles, and refuses to allow, as the teaching of the orthodox Father's has allowed, the terms of divine dignity to be understood of the divine nature, while the terms of humility, spoken in human sense, are applied to the nature assumed; whence the rightminded can easily detect the kinship with impiety. For Arius and Eunomius, asserting the only begotten Son of God to be a creature, and made out of the non-existent, and a servant, have ventured to apply to His godhead what is said in lowly and human sense; establishing by such means the difference of substance and the unlikeness. Besides this, to be brief, he argues that the very impassible and immutable Godhead of the Christ suffered, and was crucified, dead, and buried. This goes beyond even the madness of Arius and Eunomius, for this pitch of impiety has not been reached even by them that dare to call the maker and creator of the universe a creature. Furthermore he blasphemes against the Holy Ghost, denying that It proceeds from the Father, in accordance with the word of the Lord, but maintaining that It has Its origin of the Son. Here we have the fruit of the Apollinarian seed; here we come near the evil husbandry of Macedonius. Such are the offspring of the Egyptian, viler children of a vile father. This growth, which men, entrusted with the healing of souls, ought to make abortive while yet in the womb, or destroy as soon as it is born, as dangerous and deadly to mankind, is cherished by these excellent persons, and promoted with great energy, alike to their own ruin and to that of all who will listen to them.We, on the contrary, earnestly desire to keep our heritage untouched; and the faith which we have received, and in which we have been ourselves baptized, and baptize others, we strive to preserve uninjured and undefiled. We confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and body, was begotten of the Father before the ages, as touching the Godhead; and in the last days for us men and our salvation (was born) of the Virgin Mary; that the same Lord is of one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, and of one substance with us as touching the manhood. For there was an union of two natures. Wherefore we acknowledge one Christ, one Son, one Lord; but we do not destroy the union; we believe it to have been made without confusion, in obedience to the word of the Lord to the Jews, \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-65-P6501_1678851:549-nf] If on the contrary there had been mixture and confusion, and one nature was made out of both, He ought to have said \"Destroy me and in three days I shall be raised.\" But now, to show that there is a distinction between God according to His nature, and the temple, and that both are one Christ, His words are \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,\" clearly teaching that it was not God who was undergoing destruction, but the temple. The nature of this latter was susceptible of destructions while the power of the former raised what was being destroyed. Furthermore it is in obedience to the divine Scriptures that we acknowledge the Christ to be God and man. That our Lord Jesus Christ is God is asserted by the blessed evangelist John \"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was. God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made that was made.\"[fn-65-P6502_1679824:550-nf] And again, \"That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\"[fn-65-P6503_1679932:551-nf] And the Lord Himself distinctly teaches us, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\"[fn-65-P6504_1680039:552-nf] And \"I and my Father are one\"[fn-65-P6505_1680089:553-nf] and \"I am in the Father and the Father in me,\"[fn-65-P6506_1680155:554-nf] and the blessed Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews says \"Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power\"[fn-65-P6507_1680368:555-nf] and in the epistle to the Philippians \"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made Himself of no reputation and took upon Him the form of a servant.\"[fn-65-P6508_1680634:556-nf] And in the Epistle to the Romans, \"Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever.

And the divine Jeremiah too utters the prediction \"This is our God and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison with him. He hath found out all the way of knowledge and hath given it unto Jacob His servant and to Israel His beloved and afterward did He show Himself upon earth and conversed with men.\"[fn-65-P6514_1682104:562-nf] And countless other passages might be found as well in the holy gospels and in the writings of the apostles as in the predictions of the prophets, setting forth that our Lord Jesus Christ is very God.","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":2,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"480","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Wherefore all the human qualities of the Lord Christ, hunger, I mean, and thirst and weariness, sleep, fear, sweat, prayer, and ignorance, and the like, we affirm to belong to our nature which God the Word assumed and united to Himself in effecting our salvation. But the restitution of motion to the maimed, the resurrection of the dead, the supply of loaves, and all the other miracles we believe to be works of the divine power. In this sense I say that the same Lord Christ both suffers and destroys suffering; suffers, that is, as touching the visible, and destroys suffering as touching the ineffably indwelling Godhead. This is proved beyond question by the narrative of the holy evangelists, from whom we learn that when lying in a manger and wrapped in swaddling clothes, He was announced by a star, worshipped by magi and hymned by angels. Thus we reverent discern that the swaddling bands and the want of a bed and all the poverty belonged to the manhood; while the journey of the magi and the guiding of the star and the company of the angels proclaim the Godhead of the unseen. In like manner He makes His escape into Egypt and avoids the fury of Herod by flight,[fn-65-P6538_1688697:576-nf] for He was man; but as the Prophet says \"He shakes the idols of Egypt,\"[fn-65-P6539_1688799:577-nf] for He was by nature God. He is circumcised; He keeps the law; and offers offerings of purification, because He sprang from the root of Jesse. And, as man, He was under the law; and afterwards did away with the law and gave the new covenant, because He was a lawgiver and had promised by the prophets that He Himself would give it. He was baptized by John; and this shews His sharing what is ours. He is testified to by the Father from on high and is pointed out by the Spirit; this proclaims Him eternal. He hungered; but He fed many thousands with five loaves; the latter is divine, the former human. He thirsted and He asked for water; but He was the well of life; the former of His human weakness, the latter of His divine power. He fell asleep in the boat, but he put the tempest of the sea to sleep; the former of His human nature, the latter of His efficient and creative power which has gifted all things with their being. He was weary as he walked; but He healed the halt and raised dead men from their tombs; the former of human weakness, the latter of a power passing that of this world. He feared death and He destroyed death; the former shows that He was mortal, the latter that He was immortal or rather giver of life. \"He was crucified,\" as the blessed Paul says \"through weakness.\"[fn-65-P6540_1690119:578-nf] But as the same Paul says \"Yet He liveth by the power of God.\"[fn-65-P6541_1690207:579-nf] Let that word \"weakness\" teach us that He was not nailed to the tree as the Almighty, the Uncircumscribed, the Immutable and Invariable, but that the nature quickened by the power of God, was according to the Apostle's teaching dead and buried, both death and burial being proper to the form of the servant. \"He broke the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder\"[fn-65-P6542_1690605:580-nf] and destroyed the power of death and in three days raised His own temple. These are proofs of the form of God in accordance with the Lord's words \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-65-P6543_1690834:581-nf] Thus in the one Christ through the sufferings we contemplate the manhood and through the miracles we apprehend the Godhead. We do not divide the two natures into two Christs, and we know that of the Father God the Word was begotten and that of the seed of Abraham and David our nature was assumed. Wherefore also the blessed Paul says when discoursing of Abraham \"He saith not and to seeds as of many; but as of one, and to thy seed which is Christ,\"[fn-65-P6544_1691305:582-nf] and writing to Timothy he says \"Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel.\"[fn-65-P6545_1691456:583-nf] And to the Romans he writes \"Concerning His son Jesus Christ ...which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.\"[fn-65-P6546_1691602:584-nf] And again \"Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.\"[fn-65-P6547_1691705:585-nf] And the Evangelist writes \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham,\"[fn-65-P6548_1691836:586-nf] and the blessed Peter in the Acts says David \"being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, He would raise up Christ to sit on his throne, he seeing this before spake of his resurrection,\"[fn-65-P6549_1692098:587-nf] and God says to Abraham \"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,\"[fn-65-P6550_1692204:588-nf] and Isaiah \"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of His roots; and there shall rest upon Him[fn-65-P6551_1692364:589-nf] the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of piety and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-65-P6552_1692772:590-nf] And a little further on \"And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek; and His rest shall be glorious.\"[fn-65-P6553_1693018:591-nf] ","title":"Letters of the Blessed Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":2,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"488","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"It follows that He did not become God: He was God. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God; and the Word was God.\"[fn-65-P6579_1701837:609-nf] He was not man: He became man, and the so became by taking on Him our nature: So says the blessed Paul-\"Who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, hut made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant.\"[fn-65-P6580_1702110:610-nf] And again: \"For verily He took not on Him the nature of angel's; but He took on Him the seed of Abraham.\"[fn-65-P6581_1702249:611-nf] And again; Forasmuch then as the children are partaker's of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same.<mindy>\"[fn-65-P6582_1702402:612-nf] Thus He was both passible and impassible; mortal and immortal; passible, on the one hand, and mortal, as man; impassible, on the other, and immortal, as God. As God He raised His own flesh, which was dead;-as His own words declare: \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.\"[fn-65-P6583_1702716:613-nf] And as man, He was passible and mortal up to the time of the passion. For, after the resurrection, even as man He is impassible, immortal, and incorruptible; and He discharges divine lightnings; not that according to the flesh tie has been changed into the nature of Godhead, but still preserving the distinctive marks of humanity. Nor yet is His body uncircumscribed, for this is peculiar to the divine nature alone, but it abides in its former circumscription. This He teaches in the words He spake to the disciples even after His resurrection \"Behold my hands and feet that it is I myself; handle me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have.\"[fn-65-P6584_1703406:614-nf] While He was thus beheld He went up into heaven; thus has He promised to come again, thus shall He be seen both by them that have believed and them that have crucified, for it is written \"They shall look on Him whom they pierced.\"[fn-65-P6585_1703659:615-nf] We therefore worship the Son, but we contemplate in Him either nature in its perfection, both that which took, and that which was taken; the one of God and the other of David. For this reason also He is styled both Son of the living God and Son of David; either nature receiving its proper title. Accordingly the divine scripture calls him both God and man, and the blessed Paul exclaims \"There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave Himself a ransom for all.\"[fn-65-P6586_1704201:616-nf] But Him whom here he calls man in another place he describes as God for he says \"Looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.\"[fn-65-P6587_1704424:617-nf] And yet in another place he uses both names at once saying \"Of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever.

The evangelist John, again, tells us that, before Jesus went into Galilee, Peter and Andrew were with Him one day, and that on that occasion the former had this name, Peter, given him, while before that period he was called Simon. Likewise John tells us, that on the day following, when Jesus was now desirous of going forth unto Galilee, He found Philip, and said to him that he shouldfollow Him. Thus, too, the evangelist comes to give the narrative about Nathanael.[fn-15-P1573_642667:161-nf] Further, he informs us that on the third day, when He was yet in Galilee, Jesus wrought the miracle of the turning of the water into wine at Cana.[fn-15-P1574_642838:162-nf] All these incidents are left unrecorded by the other evangelists, who continue their narratives at once with the statement of the return of Jesus into Galilee. Hence we are to understand that there was an interval here of several days, during which those incidents took place in the history of the disciples which are inserted at this point by John.[fn-15-P1575_643210:163-nf] Neither is there anything contradictory here to that other passage where Matthew tells us how the Lord said to Peter, \"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church.\"[fn-15-P1576_643614:164-nf] But we are not to understand that that was the time when he first received this name; but we are rather to suppose that this took place on the occasion when it was said to him, as John mentions, \"Thou shall be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, A stone.\"[fn-15-P1577_643900:165-nf] Thus the Lord could address him at that later period by this very name, when He said, \"Thou art Peter.\" For He does not say then, \"Thou shalt be called Peter,\" but, \"Thou art Peter;\" because on a previous occasion he had already been spoken to in this manner, \"Thou shalt be called.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":19,"source_paragraph":"141","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"38.

This, however, is a mode of speech of the same kind with what is intended when we say that the Apostle Paul was born in Tarsus of Cilicia;[fn-15-P1589_650582:173-nf] for certainly he was not an apostle at that period.

For Matthew first of all tells us that He came and dwelt in Capharnaum,[fn-15-P1592_651498:175-nf] and then that He called them from their boats as they were engaged in fishing. On the other hand, John says that His disciples came with Him to Capharnaum. Now it may be the case that Matthew has but gone over here something he had omitted in its proper order. For he does not say, \"After this, walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw two brethren,\" but, without any indication of the strict consecution of time, simply, \"And walking by the sea of Galilee, He saw two brethren,\"[fn-15-P1593_651996:176-nf] and so forth: consequently it is quite possible that he has recorded at this later period not something which took place actually at that later time, but only something which he had omitted to introduce before; so that the men may be understood in this way to have come along with Him to Capharnaum, to which place John states that He did come, He and His mother and His disciples:or should we rather suppose that these were a different body of disciples, as He [may already have] had a follower in Philip, whom He called in this particular manner, by saying to him, \"Follow me\"?

Indeed, not only is the succession of the various callings left unrecorded; but even the fact of the calling is not mentioned in the case of all of them, the only vocations specified being those of Philip, and Peter and Andrew, and the sons of Zebedee, and Matthew the publican, who was also called Levi.[fn-15-P1594_653012:177-nf] The first and only person, however, who received a separate name from Him was Peter.[fn-15-P1595_653181:178-nf] For He did not give the sons of Zebedee their names individually, but He called them both together the sons of thunder.[fn-15-P1596_653320:179-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"146","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"42.

For, after relating how He turned the water into wine at Cana of Galilee, and how He came down to Capernaum with His mother and His disciples, and how they abode there not many days, he tells us that He went up then to Jerusalem on account of the passover; that after this He came into the land of Judaea along with His disciples, and tarried there with them, and baptized; and then in what follows at this point the evangelist says: \"And John also was baptizing in Aenon, near to Salim, because there was much water there; and they came, and were baptized: for John was not yet cast into prison.\"[fn-16-P1606_657245:184-nf] On the other hand, Matthew says: \"Now when He had heard that John was cast into prison, Jesus departed into Galilee.\"[fn-16-P1607_657395:185-nf] In like manner, Mark's words are: \"Now, after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee.\"[fn-16-P1608_657517:186-nf] Luke, again, says nothing indeed about the imprisonment of John; but notwithstanding this, after his account of the baptism and temptation of Christ, he also makes a statement to the same effect with that of these other two, namely, that Jesus went into Galilee. For he has connected the several parts of his narrative here in this way: \"And when all the temptation was ended, the devil departed from Him for a season; and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and there went out a fame of Him through all the region round about,\"[fn-16-P1609_658085:187-nf] From all this, however, we may gather, not that these three evangelists have made any statement opposed to the evangelist John, but only that they have left unrecorded the Lord's first advent in Galilee after His baptism; on which occasion also He turned the water into wine there. For at that period John had not yet been cast into prison. And we are also to understand that these three evangelists have introduced into the context of these narratives an account of another journey of His into Galilee, which took place after John's imprisonment, regarding which return into Galilee the evangelist John himself furnishes the following notice: \"When, therefore, Jesus knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus makes and baptizes more disciples than John (though Jesus Himself baptized not, but His disciples), he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.\"[fn-16-P1610_658972:188-nf] So, then, we perceive that by that time John hadbeen already cast into prison; and further, thatthe Jews had heard that He was making and baptizing more disciples than John had made and baptized.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":46,"source_paragraph":"222","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"92. Matthew then proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: \"For Herod laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother's wife;\" and so on, down to the words, \"And his disciples came and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.\"[fn-19-P1908_782434:384-nf] Mark gives this narrative in similar terms.[fn-19-P1909_782502:385-nf] Luke, on the other hand, does not relate it in the same succession, but introduces it in connection with his statement of the baptism wherewith the Lord was baptized. Hence we are to understand him to have acted by anticipation here, and to have taken the opportunity of recording at this point an event which took place actually a considerable period later. For he has first reported those words which John spake with regard to the Lord-namely, that \"His fan is in His hand, and that He will thoroughly purge His floor, and will gather the wheat into His garner; but the chaff He will burn up with fire unquenchable;\" and immediately thereafter he has appended his statement of an incident which the evangelist John demonstrates not to have taken place in direct historical sequence. For this latter writer mentions that, after Jesus had been baptized, He went into Galilee at the period when He turned the water into wine; and that, after a sojourn of a few days in Capharnaum, He left that district and returned to the land of Judaea, and there baptized a multitude about the Jordan, previous to the time when John was imprisoned.[fn-19-P1910_783659:386-nf] Now what reader, unless he were all the better versed[fn-19-P1911_783748:387-nf] in these writings, would not take it to be implied here that it was after the utterance of the words with regard to the fan and the purged floor that Herod became incensed against John, and cast him into prison? Yet, that the incident referred to here did not, as matter of fact, occur in the order in which it is here recorded, we have already shown elsewhere; and, indeed, Luke himself puts the proof into our hands.[fn-19-P1912_784346:388-nf] For if [he had meant that] John's incarceration took place immediately after the utterance of those words, then what are we to make of the fact that in Luke's own narrative the baptism of Jesus is introduced subsequently to his notice of the imprisonment of John? Consequently it is manifest that, recalling the circumstance in connection with the present occasion, he has brought it in here by anticipation, and has thus inserted it in his history at a point antecedent to a number of incidents, of which it was his purpose to leave us some record, and which, in point of time, were antecedent to this mishap that befell John. But it is as little the case that the other two evangelists, Matthew and Mark, have placed the fact of John's imprisonment in that position in their narratives which, as is apparent also froth their own writings, belonged to it in the actual order of events. For they, too, have told us how it was on John's being cast into prison that the Lord went into Galilee;[fn-19-P1913_785363:389-nf] and then, after [relating] a number of things which He did in Galilee, they come to Herod's admonition or doubt as to the rising again from the dead of that John whom he beheaded;[fn-19-P1914_785576:390-nf] and in connection with this latter occasion, they give us the story of all that occurred in the matter of John's incarceration and death.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_13_book_ii_","source_chapter":69,"source_paragraph":"282","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"129.

For if He, as one who held in His own knowledge all the intentions of men, both present and future was aware that they would publish it all the more the more He charged them not to publish it, what purpose could He have in giving them such a charge?

This we now say, that, according to this condition of being born and dying, which we know, and in which we have been created, the marriage of male and female is some good; the compact; whereof divide Scripture so commends, as that neither is it allowed one put away by her husband to marry, so long as her husband lives: nor is it allowed one put away by his wife to marry another, unless she who have separated from him be dead. Therefore, concerning the good of marriage, which the Lord also confirmed in the Gospel, not only in that He forbade to put away a wife,[fn-37-P3750_1768432:7-nf] save because of fornication, but also in that He came by invitation to a marriage,[fn-37-P3751_1768532:8-nf] there is good ground to inquire for what reason it be a good. And this seems notto me to be merely on account of the begetting of children, but also on account of the natural society itself in a difference of sex. Otherwise it would not any longer be called marriage in the case of old persons, especially if either they had lost sons, or had given birth to none. But now in good, although aged, marriage, albeit there hath withered away the glow of full age between male and female, yet there lives in full vigor the order of charity between husband and wife: because, the better they are, the earlier they have begun by mutual consent to contain from sexual intercourse with each other: not that it should be matter of necessity afterwards not to have power to do what they would, but that it should be matter of praise to have been unwilling at the first, to do what they had power to do.

Marriages have this good also, that carnal or youthful incontinence, although it be faulty, is brought unto an honest use in the begetting of children, in order that out of the evil of lust the marriage union may bring to pass some good. Next, in that the lust of the flesh is repressed, and rages in a way more modestly, being tempered by parental affection. For there is interposed a certain gravity of glowing pleasure, when in that wherein husband and wife cleave to one another, they have in mind that they be father and mother.","title":"On the Good of Marriage.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":2,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_33_book_ii","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"87","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"26.

For we frequently seek information about a variety of matters by use of the Olympiads, and the names of the consuls; and ignorance of the consulship in which our Lord was born, and that in which He suffered, has led some into the error of supposing that He was forty-six years of age when He suffered, that being the number of years He was told by the Jews the temple (which He took as a symbol of His body) was in building.[fn-49-P4971_2680755:58-nf] Now we know on the authority of the evangelist that He was about thirty years of age when He was baptized;[fn-49-P4972_2680882:59-nf] But the number of years He lived afterwards, although by putting His actions together we can make it out, yet that no shadow of doubt might arise from another source, can be ascertained more clearly and more certainly from a comparison of profane history with the gospel.

Thus an irreligious Pagan might bring the same reproaches against Christ in the Gospel, as Faustus brings against God in the Old Testament. He might say that Christ lacked foresight, not only because He was astonished at the faith of the centurion, but because He chose Judas as a disciple who proved disobedient to His commands; as Faustus objects to the precept given in Paradise, which, as it turned out, was not obeyed. He might also cavil at Christ's not knowing who touched Him, when the woman suffering from an issue of blood touched the hem of His garment; as Faustus blames God for not knowing where Adam had hid himself. If this ignorance is implied in God's saying, \"Where art thou, Adam?\"[fn-20-P2054_1206281:22-nf] the same may be said of Christ's asking, \"Who touched me?\"[fn-20-P2055_1206358:23-nf] The Pagans also might call Christ timid and envious, in not wishing five of the ten virgins to gain eternal life by entering into His kingdom, and in shutting them out, so that they knocked in vain in their entreaty to have the door opened, as if forgetful of His own promise, \"Knock, and it shall be opened unto you;\"[fn-20-P2056_1206701:24-nf] as Faustus charges God with fear and envy in not admitting man after his sin to eternal life. Again, he might call Christ greedy of the blood, not of beasts, but of men, because he said, \"He that loseth his life for my sake, shall keep it unto life eternal;\"[fn-20-P2057_1206979:25-nf] as Faustus reproaches God in reference to those animal sacrifices which prefigured the sacrifice of blood-shedding by which we are redeemed. He might also accuse Christ of jealousy, because in narrating His driving the buyers and sellers out of the temple, the evangelist quotes as applicable to Him the words, \"The jealousy of Thine house hath eaten me up;\"[fn-20-P2058_1207356:26-nf] as Faustus accuses God of jealousy in forbidding sacrifices to be offered to other gods. He might say that Christ was angry with both His friends and His enemies: with His friends, because He said, \"The servant that knows his lord's will, and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes;\" and with His enemies, because He said, \"If any one shall not receive you, shake off against him the dust of your shoes; verily I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in the day of judgment than for that city;\"[fn-20-P2059_1207896:27-nf] as Faustus accuses God of being angry at one time with His friends, and at another with His enemies; both of whom are spoken of thus by the apostle: \"They that have sinned without law shall perish without law, and they that have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.\"[fn-20-P2060_1208194:28-nf] Or he might say that Christ shed the blood of many without mercy, for a slight offense or for nothing. For to a Pagan there would appear to be little or no harm in not having a wedding garment at the marriage feast, for which our King in the Gospel commanded a man to be bound hand and foot, and cast into outer darkness;[fn-20-P2061_1208534:29-nf] or in not wishing to have Christ for a king, which is the sin of which Christ says, \"Those that would not have me to reign over them, bring hither and slay before me;\"[fn-20-P2062_1208727:30-nf] as Faustus blames God in the Old Testament for slaughtering thousands of human beings for slight offenses, as Faustus calls them, or for nothing. Again, if Faustus finds fault with God's threatening to come with the sword, and to spare neither the righteous nor the wicked, might not the Pagan. find as much fault with the words of the Apostle Paul, when he says of our God,\" He spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all;\"[fn-20-P2063_1209178:31-nf] or of Peter, when, in exhorting the saints to be patient in the midst of persecution and slaughter, he says, \"It is time that judgment begin from the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that believe not the gospel of the Lord? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?\"[fn-20-P2064_1209546:32-nf] What can be more righteous than the Only-Begotten, whom nevertheless the Father did not spare? And what can be plainer than that the righteous also are not spared, but chastised with manifold afflictions, as is clearly implied in the words, \"If the righteous scarcely are saved\"? As it is said in the Old Testament, \"Whom the Lord loveth He correcteth, and chastiseth every son whom He receiveth;\"[fn-20-P2065_1209968:33-nf] and, \"If we receive good at the hand of the Lord, shall we not also receive evil?\"[fn-20-P2066_1210071:34-nf] So we read also in the New Testament, \"Whom I love I rebuke and chasten;\"[fn-20-P2067_1210162:35-nf] and, \"If we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged of the Lord; but when we are judged, we are corrected of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.\"[fn-20-P2068_1210346:36-nf] If a Pagan were to make such objections to the New Testament, would not the Manichaeans try to answer them, though they themselves make similar objections to the Old Testament? But supposing them able to answer the Pagan, how absurd it would be to defend in the one Testament what they find fault with in the other!

Nay it is the soul which communicates its ruin to the body when it is breathed out of it, just as it is also destined to raise it up again from the earth when it shall re-enter it. That cannot fall which by its entrance raises; nor can that droop which by its departure causes ruin.

For when he requested of the sons of Heth a spot to bury Sarah in, he said to them, \"Give me the possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead,\"[fn-98-P9843_2718855:110-nf] -meaning, of course, her flesh; for he could not have desired a place to bury her soul in, even if the soul is to be deemed mortal, and even if it could bear to be described by the word \"dead.\" Since, then, this word indicates the body, it follows that when \"the resurrection of the dead\" is spoken of, it is the rising again of men's bodies that is meant.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_37_homily_xxxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"22","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"Noble tokens, surely, these, of the rulers of synagogues; in the moment of her death pipes and cymbals raising a dirge!

And first of all there comes at once to hand the preamble of John to his Gospel, which shows us what He previously was who had to become flesh. \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God: all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.\"[fn-106-P10683_3001318:243-nf] Now, since these words may not be taken otherwise than as they are written, there is without doubt shown to be One who was from the beginning, and also One with whom He always was: one the Word of God, the other God although the Word is also God, but God regarded as the Son of God, not as the Father); One through whom were all things, Another by whom were all things. But in what sense we call Him Another we have already often described. In that we called Him Another, we must needs imply that He is not identical-not identical indeed, yet not as if separate; Other by dispensation, not by division. He, therefore, who became flesh was not the very same as He from whom the Word came. \"His glory was beheld-the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father;\"[fn-106-P10684_3002098:244-nf] not, (observe, ) as of the Father. He \"declared\" (what was in) \"the bosom of the Father alone; \"[fn-106-P10685_3002214:245-nf] the Father did not divulge the secrets of His own bosom. For this is preceded by another statement: \"No man hath seen God at any time.\"[fn-106-P10686_3002449:246-nf] Then, again, when He is designated by John (the Baptist) as \"the Lamb of God,\"[fn-106-P10687_3002561:247-nf] He is not described as Himself the same with Him of whom He is the beloved Son. He is, no doubt, ever the Son of God, but yet not He Himself of whom He is the Son. This (divine relationship) Nathanµl at once recognised in Him,[fn-106-P10688_3002807:248-nf] even as Peter did on another occasion: \"Thou art the Son of God.\"[fn-106-P10689_3002892:249-nf] And He affirmed Himself that they were quite right in their convictions; for He answered Nathanµl: \"Because I said, I saw thee under the fig-tree, therefore dose thou believe?\"[fn-106-P10690_3003091:250-nf] And in the same manner He pronounced Peter to be \"blessed,\" inasmuch as \"flesh and blood had not revealed it to him\"-that he had perceived the Father-\"but the Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-106-P10691_3003297:251-nf] By asserting all this, He determined the distinction which is between the two Persons: that is, the Son then on earth, whom Peter had confessed to be the Son of God; and the Father in heaven, who had revealed to Peter the discovery which he had made, that Christ was the Son of God. When He entered the temple, He called it \"His Father's house,\"[fn-106-P10692_3003666:252-nf] speaking as the Son. In His address to Nicodemus He says: \"So God loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\"[fn-106-P10693_3003884:253-nf] And again: \"For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He that believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.\"[fn-106-P10694_3004192:254-nf] Moreover, when John (the Baptist) was asked what he happened to know of Jesus, he said: \"The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.\"[fn-106-P10695_3004518:255-nf] Whom, indeed, did He reveal to the woman of Samaria? Was it not \"the Messias which is called Christ? \"[fn-106-P10696_3004646:256-nf] And so lie showed, of course, that He was not the Father, but the Son; and elsewhere He is expressly called \"the Christ, the Son of God,\"[fn-106-P10697_3004804:257-nf] and not the Father. He says, therefore,\" My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work; \"[fn-106-P10698_3004938:258-nf] whilst to the Jews He remarks respecting the cure of the impotent man, \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.\"[fn-106-P10699_3005071:259-nf] \"My Father and I\"-these are the Son's words. And it was on this very account that \"the Jews sought the more intently to kill Him, not only because He broke the Sabbath, but also because He said that God was His Father, thus making Himself equal with God. Then indeed did He answer and say unto them, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do; for what things soever He doeth these also doeth the Son likewise. For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that He Himself doeth; and He will also show Him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son also quickeneth whom He will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son, that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent the Son. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my words, and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. Verily I say unto you, that the hour is coming, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and when they have heard it, they shall live. For as the Father hath eternal life in Himself, so also hath He given to the Son to have eternal life in Himself; and He hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man\"[fn-107-P10700_3006548:260-nf] -that is, according to the flesh, even as He is also the Son of God through His Spirit.[fn-107-P10701_3006658:261-nf] Afterwards He goes on to say: \"But I have greater witness than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to finish-those very works bear witness of me that the Father hath sent me. And the Father Himself, which hath sent me, hath also borne witness of me.\"[fn-107-P10702_3006963:262-nf] But He at once adds, \"Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape; \"[fn-107-P10703_3007075:263-nf] thus affirming that in former times it was not the Father, but the Son, who used to be seen and heard. Then He says at last: \"I am come in my Father's name, and ye have not received me.\"[fn-107-P10704_3007278:264-nf] It was therefore always the Son (of whom we read) under the designation of the Almighty and Most High God, and King, and Lord. To those also who inquired \"what they should do to work the works of God,\"[fn-107-P10705_3007496:265-nf] He answered, \"This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.\"[fn-107-P10706_3007598:266-nf] He also declares Himself to be \"the bread which the Father sent from heaven; \"[fn-107-P10707_3007693:267-nf] and adds, that \"all that the Father gave Him should come to Him, and that He Himself would not reject them,[fn-107-P10708_3007817:268-nf] because He had come down from heaven not to do His own will, but the will of the Father; and that the will of the Father was that every one who saw the Son, and believed on Him, should obtain the life (everlasting, ) and the resurrection at the last day. No man indeed was able to come to Him, except the Father attracted him; whereas every one who had heard and learnt of the Father came to Him.\"[fn-107-P10709_3008287:269-nf] He goes on then expressly to say, \"Not that any man hath seen the Father; \"[fn-107-P10710_3008386:270-nf] thus showing us that it was through the Word of the Father that men were instructed and taught. Then, when many departed from Him,[fn-107-P10711_3008534:271-nf] and He turned to the apostles with the inquiry whether \"they also would go away,\"[fn-107-P10712_3008632:272-nf] what was Simon Peter's answer? \"To whom shall we go?

Having now briefly arranged these points in order as we best could, it follows that, agreeably to our intention from the first, we refute those who think that the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is a different God from Him who gave the answers of the law to Moses, or commissioned the prophets, who is the God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For in this article of faith, first of all, we must be firmly grounded. We have to consider, then, the expression of frequent recurrence in the Gospels, and subjoined to all the acts of our Lord and Saviour, \"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by this or that prophet,\" it being manifest that the prophets are the prophets of that God who made the world. From this therefore we draw the conclusion, that He who sent the prophets, Himself predicted what was to be foretold of Christ. And there is no doubt that the Father Himself, and not another different from Him, uttered these predictions. The practice, moreover, of the Saviour or His apostles, frequently quoting illustrations from the Old Testament, shows that they attribute authority to the ancients. The injunction also of the Saviour, when exhorting His disciples to the exercise of kindness, \"Be ye perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect; for He commands His sun to rise upon the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust,\"[fn-65-P6524_1282839:34-nf] most evidently suggests even to a person of feeble understanding, that He is proposing to the imitation of His disciples no other God than the maker of heaven and the bestower of the rain. Again, what else does the expression, which ought to be used by those who pray, \"Our Father who art in heaven,\"[fn-65-P6525_1283162:35-nf] appear to indicate, save that God is to be sought in the better parts of the world, i.e., of His creation? Further, do not those admirable principles which He lays down respecting oaths, saying that we ought not to \"swear either by heaven, because it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, because it is His footstool,\"[fn-65-P6526_1283502:36-nf] harmonize most clearly with the words of the prophet, \"Heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool? \"[fn-65-P6527_1283633:37-nf] And also when casting out of the temple those who sold sheep, and oxen, and doves, and pouring out the tables of the money-changers, and saying, \"Take these things, hence, and do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise,\"[fn-65-P6528_1283883:38-nf] He undoubtedly called Him His Father, to whose name Solomon had raised a magnificent temple. The words, moreover, \"Have you not read what was spoken by God to Moses: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; He is not a God of the dead, but of the living,\"[fn-65-P6529_1284185:39-nf] most clearly teach us, that He called the God of the patriarchs (because they were holy, and were alive) the God of the living, the same, viz., who had said in the prophets, \"I am God, and besides Me there is no God.\"[fn-65-P6530_1284444:40-nf] For if the Saviour, knowing that He who is written in the law is the God of Abraham, and that it is the same who says, \"I am God, and besides Me there is no God, acknowledges that very one to be His Father who is ignorant of the existence of any other God above Himself, as the heretics suppose, He absurdly declares Him to be His Father who does not know of a greater God. But if it is not from ignorance, but from deceit, that He says there is no other God than Himself, then it is a much greater absurdity to confess that His Father is guilty of falsehood. From all which this conclusion is arrived at, that He knows of no other Father than God, the Founder and Creator of all things.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":2,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_43_the_first_book_","source_chapter":35,"source_paragraph":"113","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":" Moreover, it was this that he had in view when he said, \"The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.\"[fn-68-P6856_2620110:103-nf] And in that saying also consider for a little what was its purport. For when he had said, \"For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, that ye may not be wise in yourselves, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and so all Israel should be saved; as it is written, There shall come out of Sion one who shall deliver, and turn away impiety from Jacob: and this is the covenant to them from me, when I shall take away their sins;\"[fn-68-P6857_2620641:104-nf] he immediately added, what is to be very carefully understood, \"As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes: but as concerning the election, they are beloved for their fathers' sake.\"[fn-68-P6858_2620869:105-nf] What is the meaning of, \"as concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake,\" but that their enmity wherewith they put Christ to death was, without doubt, as we see, an advantage to the gospel? And he shows that this came about by God's ordering, who knew how to make a good use even of evil things; not that the vessels of wrath might be of advantage to Him, but that by His own good use of them they might be of advantage to the vessels of mercy. For what could be said more plainly than what is actually said, \"As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes\"? It is, therefore, in the power of the wicked to sin; but that in sinning they should do this or that by that wickedness is not in their power, but in God's, who divides the darkness and regulates it; so that hence even what they do contrary to God's will is not fulfilled except it be God's will. We read in the Acts of the Apostles that when the apostles had been sent away by the Jews, and had come to their own friends, and shown them what great things the priests and elders said to them, they all with one consent lifted up their voices to the Lord and said, \"Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein; who, by the mouth of our father David, thy holy servant, hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the peoples imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ. For in truth, there have assembled together in this city against Thy holy child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, Herod and Pilate, and the people of Israel, to do whatever Thy hand and counsel predestinated to be done.\"[fn-68-P6859_2622614:106-nf] See what is said: \"As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes.\" Because God's hand and counsel predestinated such things to be done by the hostile Jews as were necessary for the gospel, for our sakes. But what is it that follows? \"But as concerning the election, they are beloved for their fathers' sakes.\" For are those enemies who perished in their enmity and those of the same people who still perish in their opposition to Christ,-are those chosen and beloved? Away with the thought! Who is so utterly foolish as to say this? But both expressions, although contrary to one another-that is, \"enemies\" and \"beloved\"-are appropriate, though not to the same men, yet to the same Jewish people, and to the same carnal seed of lsrael, of whom some belonged to the falling away, and some to the blessing of Israel himself. For the apostle previously explained this meaning more dearly when he said, \"That which lsrael wrought for, he hath not obtained; but the election hath obtained in and the rest were blinded?[fn-68-P6860_2623671:107-nf] Yet in both cases it was the very same Israel. Where, therefore, we hear, \"lsrael hath not obtained,\" or, \"The rest were blinded,\" there are to be understood the enemies for our sakes; but where we hear, \"that the election hath obtained it,\" there are to be understood the beloved for their father's sakes, to which fathers those things were assuredly promised; because \"the promises were made to Abraham and his seed,\"[fn-68-P6861_2624110:108-nf] whence also in that olive-tree is grafted the wild olive-tree of the Gentiles. Now subsequently we certainly ought to fall in with the election, of which he says that it is according to grace, not according to debt, because \"there was made a remnant by the election of grace\"[fn-68-P6862_2624407:109-nf] This election obtained it, the rest bring blinded. As concerning this election, the Israelites were beloved for the sake of their fathers. For they were not called with that calling of which it is said, \"Many are called,\" but with that whereby the chosen are called. Whence also after he had said, \"But as concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes,\" he went on to add those words whence this discussion arose: \"For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance,\"-that is, they are firmly established without change. Those who belong to this calling are alI teachable by God; nor can any of them say, \"I believed in order to bring thus called,\" because the mercy of God anticipated him, because he was so called in order that he might believe. For all who are teachable of God come to the Son because they have heard and learned from the Father through the Son, who most clearly says, \"Every one who has heard of the Father, and has learned, cometh unto me.\"[fn-68-P6863_2625413:110-nf] But of such as these none perishes, because \"of all that the Father hath given Him, He will lose honed.\"[fn-68-P6864_2625538:111-nf] Whoever, therefore, is of these does not perish at all; nor was any who perishes ever of these.

Those who had been wronged he set free from oppression, making no distinction as to whether they were of his own or of the opposite party. He restored too the teaching which had been overthrown: the Trinity was once more boldly spoken of, and set upon the lampstand, flashing with the brilliant light of the One Godhead into the souls of all. He legislated again for the whole world, and brought all minds trader his influence, by letters to some, by invitations to others, instructing some, who visited him uninvited, and proposing as the single law to all-Good will.[fn-41-P4140_1244084:92-nf] For this alone was able to conduct them to the true issue.

And if by the apostle Christ is called \"the first-born of every creature,\"[fn-103-P10328_3238789:174-nf] how could He be the first-born of every creature, unless because according to His divinity the Word proceeded from the Father before every creature? And unless the heretics receive it thus, they will be constrained to show that Christ the man was the first-born of every creature; which they will not be able to do. Either, therefore, He is before every creature, that He may be the first-born of every creature, and He is not man only, because man is after every creature; or He is man only, and He is after every creature. And how is He the first-born of every creature, except because being that Word which is before every creature; and therefore, the first-born of every creature, He becomes flesh and dwells in us, that is, assumes that man's nature which is after every creature, and so dwells with him and in him, in us, that neither is humanity taken away from Christ, nor His divinity denied? For if He is only before every creature, humanity is taken away from Him; but if He is only man, the divinity which is before every creature is interfered with. Both of these, therefore, are leagued together in Christ, and both are conjoined, and both are linked with one another. And rightly, as there is in Him something which excels the creature, the agreement of the divinity and the humanity seems to be pledged in Him: for which reason He who is declared as made the \"Mediator between God and man\"[fn-103-P10329_3240515:175-nf] is revealed to have associated in Himself God and man. And if the same apostle says of Christ, that \"having put off the flesh, He spoiled powers, they being openly triumphed over in Himself,\"[fn-103-P10330_3240729:176-nf] he certainly did not without a meaning propound that the flesh was put off, unless because he wished it to be understood that it was again put on also at the resurrection. Who, therefore, is He that thus put off and put on the flesh? Let the heretics seek out. For we know that the Word of God was invested with the substance of flesh, and that He again was divested of the same bodily material, which again He took up in the resurrection and resumed as a garment. And yet Christ could neither have been divested of nor invested with manhood, had He been only man: for man is never either deprived of nor invested with himself. For that must be something else, whatever it may be, which by any other is either taken away or put on. Whence, reasonably, it was the Word of God who put off the flesh, and again in the resurrection put it on, since He put it off because at His birth He had been invested with it. Therefore in Christ it is God who is invested, and moreover must be divested, because He who is invested must also likewise be He who is divested; whereas, as man, He is invested with and divested of, as it were, a certain tunic of the compacted body.[fn-103-P10331_3241913:177-nf] And therefore by consequence He was, as we have said, the Word of God, who is revealed to be at one time invested, at another time divested of the flesh. For this, moreover, He before predicted in blessings: \"He shall wash His garment in wine, and His clothing in the blood of the grape.\"[fn-103-P10332_3242355:178-nf] If the garment in Christ be the flesh, and the clothing itself be the body, let it be asked who is He whose body is clothing, and garment flesh? For to us it is evident that the flesh is the garment, and the body the clothing of the Word; and He washed His bodily substance, and purified the material of the flesh in blood, that is, in wine, by His passion, in the human character that He had undertaken. Whence, if indeed He is washed, He is man, because the garment which is washed is the flesh; but He who washes is the Word of God, who, in order that He might wash the garment, was made the taker-up of the garment. Rightly, from that substance which is taken that it might be washed, He is revealed as a man, even as from the authority of the Word who washed it He is manifested to be God.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":2,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_44_oration_xxix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"29","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XX.

Of all the temples spoken of in this sense, the best and most excellent was the pure and holy body of our Saviour Jesus Christ. When He knew that wicked men might aim at the destruction of the temple of God in Him, but that their purposes of destruction would not prevail against the divine power which had built that temple, He says to them, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it again.... This He said of the temple of His body.\"[fn-113-P11311_3078221:38-nf] And in other parts of holy Scripture where it speaks of the mystery of the resurrection to those whose ears are divinely opened, it says that the temple which has been destroyed shall be built up again of living and most precious stones, thereby giving us to understand that each of those who are led by the word of God to strive together in the duties of piety, will be a precious stone in the one great temple of God.

For you have the fruits of an answer pointed out by our Lord's words in the case of the agreement of two persons; as it is said: \"If two of you shall agree upon earth touching anything for which they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\"[fn-49-P4971_1790561:49-nf] You have another in the fulness of faith, which is compared to a grain of mustard-seed. \"For,\" He says, \"if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain: Be thou removed, and it shall be removed; and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4972_1790850:50-nf] You have it in continuance in prayer, which the Lord's words call, by reason of unwearied perseverance in petitioning, importunity: \"For, verily, I say unto you that if not because of his friendship, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as much as he needs.\"[fn-49-P4973_1791154:51-nf] You have it in the fruits of almsgiving: \"Shut up alms in the heart of the poor and it shall pray for thee in the time of tribulation.\"[fn-49-P4974_1791316:52-nf] You have it in the purifying of life and in works of mercy, as it is said: \"Loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress;\" and after a few words in which the barrenness of an unfruitful fast is rebuked, \"then,\" he says, \"thou shall call and the Lord shall hear thee; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here am I.\"[fn-49-P4975_1791669:53-nf] Sometimes also excess of trouble causes it to be heard, as it is said: \"When I was in trouble I called unto the Lord, and He heard me;\"[fn-49-P4976_1791838:54-nf] and again: \"Afflict not the stranger for if he crieth unto Me, I will hear him, for I am merciful.\"[fn-49-P4977_1791961:55-nf] You see then in how many ways the gift of an answer may be obtained, so that no one need be crushed by the despair of his conscience for securing those things which are salutary and eternal. For if in contemplating our wretchedness I admit that we are utterly destitute of all those virtues which we mentioned above, and that we have neither that laudable agreement of two persons, nor that faith which is compared to a grain of mustard seed, nor those works of piety which the prophet describes, surely we cannot be without that importunity which He supplies to all who desire it, owing to which alone the Lord promises that He will give whatever He has been prayed to give. And therefore we ought without unbelieving hesitation to persevere, and not to have the least doubt that by continuing in them we shall obtain all those things which we have asked according to the mind of God. For the Lord, in His desire to grant what is heavenly and eternal, urges us to constrain Him as it were by our importunity, as He not only does not despise or reject the importunate, but actually welcomes and praises them, and most graciously promises to grant whatever they have perseveringly hoped for; saying, \"Ask and ye shall receive: seek and ye shall find: knock and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\"[fn-49-P4978_1793384:56-nf] and again: \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive, and nothing shall be impossible to you.\"[fn-49-P4979_1793529:57-nf] And therefore even if all the grounds for being heard which we have mentioned are altogether wanting, at any rate the earnestness of importunity may animate us, as this is placed in the power of any one who wills without the difficulties of any merits or labours. But let not any suppliant doubt that he certainly will not be heard, so long as he doubts whether he is heard. But that this also shall be sought from the Lord unweariedly, we are taught by the example of the blessed Daniel, as, though he was heard from the first day on which he began to pray, he only obtained the result of his petition after one and twenty days.[fn-49-P4980_1794179:58-nf] Wherefore we also ought not to grow slack in the earnestness of the prayers we have begun, if we fancy that the answer comes but slowly, for fear lest perhaps the gift of the answer be in God's providence delayed, or the angel, who was to bring the Divine blessing to us, may when he comes forth from the Presence of the Almighty be hindered by the resistance of the devil, as it is certain that he cannot transmit and bring to us the desired boon, if he finds that we slack off from the earnestness of the petition made. And this would certainly have happened to the above mentioned prophet unless he had with incomparable steadfastness prolonged and persevered in his prayers until the twenty-first day. Let us then not be at all cast down by despair from the confidence of this faith of ours, even when we fancy that we are far from having obtained what we prayed for, and let us not have any doubts about the Lord's promise where He says: \"All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.\"[fn-49-P4981_1795222:59-nf] For it is well for us to consider this saying of the blessed Evangelist John, by which the ambiguity of this question is clearly solved: \"This is,\" he says, \"the confidence which we have in Him, that whatsoever we ask according to His will, He heareth us.\"[fn-49-P4982_1795789:60-nf] He bids us then have a full and undoubting confidence of the answer only in those things which are not for our own advantage or for temporal comforts, but are in conformity to the Lord's will. And we are also taught to put this into our prayers by the Lord's Prayer, where we say \"Thy will be done,\"-Thine not ours. For if we also remember these words of the Apostle that \"we know not what to pray for as we ought\"[fn-49-P4983_1796228:61-nf] we shall see that we sometimes ask for things opposed to our salvation and that we are most providentially refused our requests by Him who sees what is good for us with greater right and truth than we can. And it is clear that this also happened to the teacher of the Gentiles when he prayed that the messenger of Satan who had been for his good allowed by the Lord's will to buffet him, might be removed, saying: \"For which I besought the Lord thrice that he might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-49-P4984_1796840:62-nf] And this feeling even our Lord expressed when He prayed in the character[fn-49-P4985_1796933:63-nf] of man which He had taken, that He might give us a form of prayer as other things also by His example; saying thus: \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,\"[fn-49-P4986_1797176:64-nf] though certainly His will was not discordant with His Father's will, \"For He had come to save what was lost and to give His life a ransom for many;\"[fn-49-P4987_1797346:65-nf] as He Himself says: \"No man taketh my life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again.\"[fn-49-P4988_1797507:66-nf] In which character there is in the thirty-ninth Psalm the following sung by the blessed David, of the Unity of will which He ever maintained with the Father: \"To do Thy will: O My God, I am willing.\"[fn-49-P4989_1797727:67-nf] For even if we read of the Father: \"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,\"[fn-49-P4990_1797852:68-nf] we find none the less of the Son: \"Who gave Himself for our sins.\"[fn-49-P4991_1797935:69-nf] And as it is said of the One: \"Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for all of us,\"[fn-49-P4992_1798044:70-nf] so it is written of the other: \"He was offered because He Himself willed it.\"[fn-49-P4993_1798146:71-nf] And it is shown that the will of the Father and of the Son is in all things one, so that even in the actual mystery of the Lord's resurrection we are taught that there was no discord of operation. For just as the blessed Apostle declares that the Father brought about the resurrection of His body, saying: \"And God the Father, who raised Him from the dead,\"[fn-49-P4994_1798569:72-nf] so also the Son testifies that He Himself will raise again the Temple of His body, saying: \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.\"[fn-49-P4995_1798808:73-nf] And therefore we being instructed by all these examples of our Lord which have been enumerated ought to end our supplications also with the same prayer, and always to subjoin this clause to all our petitions: \"Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\"[fn-49-P4996_1799084:74-nf] But it is clear enough that one who does not[fn-49-P4997_1799204:75-nf] pray with attention of mind cannot observe that threefold reverence[fn-49-P4998_1800699:76-nf] which is usually practised in the assemblies of the brethren at the close of service.","title":"IX.

And while such is the sense of expressions like these, those which speak humanly concerning the Saviour admit of a religious meaning also. For with this end have we examined them beforehand, that, if we should hear Him asking where Lazarus is laid[fn-68-P6829_2708621:284-nf] , or when He asks on coming into the parts of Caesarea, `Whom do men say that I am?' or, `How many loaves have ye?' and, `What will ye that I shall do unto you[fn-68-P6830_2708816:285-nf] ?' we may know, from what has been already said, the right[fn-68-P6831_2708924:286-nf] sense of the passages, and may not stumble as Christ's enemies the Arians. First then we must put this question to the irreligious, why they consider Him ignorant? for one who asks, does not for certain ask from ignorance; but it is possible for one who knows, still to ask concerning what He knows. Thus John was aware that Christ, when asking, `How many loaves have ye?' was not ignorant, for he says, `And this He said to prove him, for He Himself knew what He would do[fn-68-P6832_2709418:287-nf] .'

And thus with ease is their clever point exploded; but if they still persist[fn-68-P6833_2709850:288-nf] on account of His asking, then they must be told that in the Godhead indeed ignorance is not, but to the flesh ignorance is proper, as has been said.

For with this end have we examined them beforehand, that, if we should hear Him asking where Lazarus is laid[fn-68-P6829_2708621:284-nf] , or when He asks on coming into the parts of Caesarea, `Whom do men say that I am?' or, `How many loaves have ye?' and, `What will ye that I shall do unto you[fn-68-P6830_2708816:285-nf] ?' we may know, from what has been already said, the right[fn-68-P6831_2708924:286-nf] sense of the passages, and may not stumble as Christ's enemies the Arians. First then we must put this question to the irreligious, why they consider Him ignorant? for one who asks, does not for certain ask from ignorance; but it is possible for one who knows, still to ask concerning what He knows. Thus John was aware that Christ, when asking, `How many loaves have ye?' was not ignorant, for he says, `And this He said to prove him, for He Himself knew what He would do[fn-68-P6832_2709418:287-nf] .' But if He knew what He was doing, therefore not in ignorance, but with knowledge did He ask. From this instance we may understand similar ones; that, when the Lord asks, He does not ask in ignorance, where Lazarus lies, nor again, whom men do say that He is; but knowing the thing which He was asking, aware what He was about to do. And thus with ease is their clever point exploded; but if they still persist[fn-68-P6833_2709850:288-nf] on account of His asking, then they must be told that in the Godhead indeed ignorance is not, but to the flesh ignorance is proper, as has been said.

For when the ruthless men wished to prove the image to be the truth, and to destroy that true habitation which we surely believe His union with us to be, He threatened them not; but knowing that their crime was against themselves, He says to them, `Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up[fn-72-P7281_2890561:150-nf] ,' He, our Saviour, surely shewing thereby that the things about which men busy themselves, carry their dissolution with them.

And what did He at this marriage? Of water He made wine. What greater sign of power? He who had power to do such things, vouchsafed to be in need. He who made of water wine could also have of stones made bread. The power was the same; but then the devil tempted Him, therefore Christ did it not. For ye know that when the Lord Christ was tempted, the devil suggested this to Him. For He was an hungred, since this too He vouchsafed to be, since this too made part of His Humiliation. The Bread was hungry, as the Way fainted, as saving Health was wounded, as the Life died. When then He was an hungred as ye know, the tempter said to Him, \"If Thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.\"[fn-59-P5909_2502880:2-nf] And He made answer to the tempter, teaching thee to answer the tempter.
