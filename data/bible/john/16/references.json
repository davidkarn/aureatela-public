Of spectacles, moreover, and pleasures of that kind, we have already filled a volume of their own.[fn-7-P739_307118:92-nf] In this place must be handled the subject of holidays and other extraordinary solemnities, which we accord sometimes to our wantonness, sometimes to our timidity, in opposition to the common faith and Discipline. The first point, indeed, on which I shall join issue is this: whether a servant of God ought to share with the very nations themselves in matters of his kind either in dress, or in food, or in any other kind of their gladness. \"To rejoice with the rejoicing, and grieve with the grieving,\"[fn-7-P740_307689:93-nf] is said.about brethren by the apostle when exhorting to unanimity. But, for these purposes, \"There is nought of communion between light and darkness,\"[fn-7-P741_307859:94-nf] between life and death or else we rescind what is written, \"The world shall rejoice, but ye shall grieve.\"[fn-7-P742_308118:95-nf] If we rejoice with the world, there is reason to fear that with the world we shall grieve too. But when the world rejoices, let us grieve; and when the world afterward grieves, we shall rejoice. Thus, too, Eleazar[fn-7-P743_308422:96-nf] in Hades,[fn-7-P744_308469:97-nf] (attaining refreshment in Abraham's bosom) and the rich man, (on the other hand, set in the torment of fire) compensate, by an answerable retribution, their alternate vicissitudes of evil and good. There are certain gift-days, which with some adjust the claim of honour, with others the debt of wages. \"Now, then,\" you say, \"I shall receive back what is mine, or pay back what is another's.\" If men have consecrated for themselves this custom from superstition, why do you, estranged as you are from all their vanity, participate in solemnities consecrated to idols; as if for you also there were some prescript about a day, short of the observance of a particular day, to prevent your paying or receiving what you owe a man, or what is owed you by a man? Give me the form after which you wish to be dealt with. For why should you skulk withal, when you contaminate your own conscience by your neighbour's ignorance? If you are not unknown to be a Christian, you are tempted, and you act as if you were not a Christian against your neighbour's conscience; if, however, you shall be disguised withal,[fn-7-P745_309810:98-nf] you are the slave of the temptation. At all events, whether in the latter or the former way, you are guilty of being \"ashamed of God.\"[fn-7-P746_310171:99-nf] But \"whosoever shall be ashamed of Me in the presence of men, of him will I too be ashamed,\" says He, \"in the presence of my Father who is in the heavens.\"[fn-7-P747_310367:100-nf] ","title":"On Idolatry.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":20,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_09_the_shows_or_de_spectaculis_","source_chapter":30,"source_paragraph":"89","folder":"ANF-03","text":"With such dainties as these let the devil's guests be feasted.

For He signifies this in that which He says: \"I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man taketh from you.\"[fn-3-P311_109177:101-nf] Mary, sitting at the feet of the Lord, and earnestly listening to His word, foreshowed a similitude of this joy; resting as she did from all business, and intent upon the truth, according to that manner of which this life is capable, by which, however, to prefigure that which shall be for eternity. For while Martha, her sister, was cumbered about necessary business, which, although good and useful, yet, when rest shall have succeeded, is to pass away, she herself was resting in the word of the Lord. And so the Lord replied to Martha, when she complained that her sister did not help her: \"Mary hath chosen the best part, which shall not be taken away from her.\"[fn-3-P312_109866:102-nf] He did not say that Martha was acting a bad part; but that \"best part that shall not be taken away.\" For that part which is occupied in the ministering to a need shall be \"taken away\" when the need itself has passed away. Since the reward of a good work that will pass away is rest that will not pass away. In that contemplation, therefore, God will be all in all; because nothing else but Himself will be required, but it will be sufficient to be enlightened by and to enjoy Him alone. And so he in whom \"the Spirit maketh intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered,\"[fn-3-P313_110466:103-nf] says, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I will seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to contemplate the beauty of the Lord.\"[fn-3-P314_110664:104-nf] For we shall then contemplate God, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, when the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, so as no longer to make intercession for us, as our Mediator and Priest, Son of God and Son of man;[fn-3-P315_110986:105-nf] but that He Himself too, in so far as He is a Priest that has taken the form of a servant for us, shall be put under Him who has put all things under Him, and under whom He has put all things: so that, in so far as He is God. He with Him will have put us under Himself; in so far as He is a Priest, He with us will be put under Him.[fn-3-P316_112148:106-nf] And therefore as the [incarnate] Son is both God and man, it is rather to be said that the manhood in the Son is another substance [from the Son], than that the Son in the Father [is another substance from the Father]; just as the carnal nature of my soul is more another substance in relation to my soul itself, although in one and the same man, than the soul of another man is in relation to my soul.[fn-3-P317_112577:107-nf] ","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":25,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_07_book_i_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"21.

And this He signifies, when He says: \"These things have I spoken unto you in similitudes;[fn-3-P319_113619:108-nf] but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in similitudes,[fn-3-P320_113714:109-nf] but I shall declare[fn-3-P321_113757:110-nf] to you plainly of the Father:\" that is, they will not then be \"similitudes,\" when the sight shall be \"face to face.\" For this it is which He says, \"But I will declare to you plainly of the Father;\" as if He said I will plainly show you the Father. For He says, I will \"declare\" to you, because He is His word. For He goes on to say, \"At that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father Himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.

And what is meant by \"I am come into the world,\" unless this, that I have manifested to the eyes even of sinners who love this world, the form of a servant which I took, making myself of no reputation? And what is meant by \"Again, I leave the world,\" unless this, that I take away from the sight of the lovers of this world that which they have seen? And what is meant by \"I go to the Father,\" unless this, that I teach those who are my faithful ones to understand me in that being in which I am equal to the Father? Those who believe this will be thought worthy of being brought by faith to sight, that is, to that very sight, in bringing them to which He is said to \"deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father.\" For His faithful ones, whom He has redeemed with His blood, are called His kingdom, for whom He now intercedes; but then, making them to abide in Himself there, where He is equal to the Father, He will no longer pray the Father for them. \"For,\" He says, \"the Father Himself loveth you.\" For indeed He \"prays,\" in so far as He is less than the Father; but as He is equal with the Father, He with the Father grants. Wherefore He certainly does not exclude Himself from that which He says, \"The Father Himself loveth you;\" but He means it to be understood after that manner which I have above spoken of, and sufficiently intimated,-namely, that for the most part each Person of the Trinity is so named, that the other Persons also may be understood. Accordingly, \"For the Father Himself loveth you,\" is so said that by consequence both the Son and the Holy Spirit also may be understood: not that He does not now love us, who spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all;[fn-3-P323_116369:112-nf] but God loves us, such as we shall be, not such as we are, For such as they are whom He loves, such are they whom He keeps eternally; which shall then be, when He who now maketh intercession for us shall have \"delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father,\" so as no longer to ask the Father, because the Father Himself loveth us. But for what deserving, except of faith, by which we believe before we see that which is promised?

Even to those are preferred the Etruscan. This appellation is given to the crowns which, distinguished by their gems and oak leaves of gold, they put on, with mantles having an embroidery of palm branches, to conduct the chariots containing the images of the gods to the circus. There are also provincial crowns of gold, needing now the larger heads of images instead of those of men. But your orders, and your magistracies, and your very place of meeting, the church, are Christ's. You belong to Him, for you have been enrolled in the books of life.[fn-11-P1108_458719:49-nf] There the blood of the Lord serves for your purple robe, and your broad stripe is His own cross; there the axe is already laid to the trunk of the tree;[fn-11-P1109_458890:50-nf] there is the branch out of the root of Jesse.[fn-11-P1110_458956:51-nf] Never mind the state horses with their crown. Your Lord, when, according to the Scripture, He would enter Jerusalem in triumph, had not even an ass of His own. These (put their trust) in chariots, and these in horses; but we will seek our help in the name of the Lord our God.[fn-11-P1111_459250:52-nf] From so much as a dwelling in that Babylon of John's Revelation[fn-11-P1112_459330:53-nf] we are called away; much more then from its pomp. The rabble, too, are crowned, at one time because of some great rejoicing for the success of the emperors; at another, on account of some custom belonging to municipal festivals. For luxury strives to make her own every occasion of public gladness. But as for you, you are a foreigner in this world, a citizen of Jerusalem, the city above. Our citizenship, the apostle says, is in heaven.[fn-11-P1113_459820:54-nf] You have your own registers, your own calendar; you have nothing to do with the joys of the world; nay, you are called to the very opposite, for \"the world shall rejoice, but ye shall mourn.\"[fn-11-P1114_460032:55-nf] And I think the Lord affirms, that those who mourn are happy, not those who are crowned. Marriage, too, decks the bridegroom with its crown; and therefore we will not have heathen brides, lest they seduce us even to the idolatry with which among them marriage is initiated. You have the law from the patriarchs indeed; you have the apostle enjoining people to marry in the Lord.[fn-11-P1115_460430:56-nf] You have a crowning also on the making of a freeman; but you have been already ransomed by Christ, and that at a great price. How shall the world manumit the servant of another? Though it seems to be liberty, yet it will come to be found bondage. In the world everything is nominal, and nothing real. For even then, as ransomed by Christ, you were under no bondage to man; and now, though man has given you liberty, you are the servant of Christ. If you think freedom of the world to be real, so that you even seal it with a crown, you have returned to the slavery of man, imagining it to be freedom; you have lost the freedom of Christ, fancying it is slavery. Will there be any dispute as to the cause of crown-wearing, which contests in the games in their turn supply, and which, both as sacred to the gods and in honour of the dead, their own reason at once condemns? It only remains, that the Olympian Jupiter, and the Nemean Hercules, and the wretched little Archemorus, and the hapless Antinous, should be crowned in a Christian, that he himself may become a spectacle disgusting to behold. We have recounted, as I think, all the various causes of the wearing of the crown, and there is not one which has any place with us: all are foreign to us, unholy, unlawful, having been abjured already once for all in the solemn declaration of the sacrament. For they were of the pomp of the devil and his angels, offices of the world,[fn-11-P1116_461886:57-nf] honours, festivals, popularity huntings, false vows, exhibitions of human servility, empty praises, base glories, and in them all idolatry, even in respect of the origin of the crowns alone, with which they are all wreathed. Claudius will tell us in his preface, indeed, that in the poems of Homer the heaven also is crowned with constellations, and that no doubt by God, no doubt for man; therefore man himself, too, should be crowned by God. But the world crowns brothels, and baths, and bakehouses, and prisons, and schools, and the very amphitheatres, and the chambers where the clothes are stripped from dead gladiators, and the very biers of the dead. How sacred and holy, how venerable and pure is this article of dress, determine not from the heaven of poetry alone, but from the traffickings of the whole world. But indeed a Christian will not even dishonour his own gate with laurel crowns, if so be he knows how many gods the devil has attached to doors; Janus so-called from gate, Limentinus from threshold, Forcus and Carna from leaves and hinges; among the Greeks, too, the Thyrµan Apollo, and the evil spirits, the Antelii.","title":"The Chaplet, or De Corona.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"5.

But whereas both the Son is of the Father, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, why both are not called sons, and both not said to be begotten, but the former is called the one only-begotten Son, and the latter, viz. the Holy Spirit, neither son nor begotten, because if begotten, then certainly a son, we will discuss in another place, if God shall grant, and so far as He shall grant.[fn-4-P461_166326:15-nf] ","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":7,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"7.

What, then, is that which the same evangelist says concerning Him, \"He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not;\" and then he adds, \"He came unto His own?\"[fn-4-P471_168862:19-nf] Certainly He was sent thither, whither He came; but if He was sent into the world, because He came forth from the Father, then He both came into the world and was in the world. He was sent therefore thither, where He already was. For consider that, too, which is written in the prophet, that God said, \"Do not I fill heaven . and earth?\"[fn-4-P472_169221:20-nf] If this is said of the Son (for some will have it understood that the Son Himself spoke either by the prophets or in the prophets), whither was He sent except to the place where He already was? For He who says, \"I fill heaven and earth,\" was everywhere. But if it is said of the Father, where could He be without His own word and without His own wisdom, which \"reacheth from one end to another mightily, and sweetly ordereth all things?\"[fn-4-P473_169680:21-nf] But He cannot be anywhere without His own Spirit. Therefore, if God is everywhere, His Spirit also is everywhere. Therefore, the Holy Spirit, too, was sent thither, where He already was.

But when Moses was sent to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt, it is written that the Lord appeared to him thus: \"Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back side of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\"[fn-5-P565_210278:80-nf] He is here also first called the Angel of the Lord, and then God. Was an angel, then, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? Therefore He may be rightly understood to be the Saviour Himself, of whom the apostle says, \"Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.\"[fn-5-P566_210652:81-nf] He, therefore, \"who is over all, God blessed for ever,\" is not unreasonably here understood also to be Himself the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. But why is He previously called the Angel of the Lord, when He appeared in a flame of fire out of the bush? Was it because it was one of many angels, who by an economy [or arrangement] bare the person of his Lord? or was something of the creature assumed by Him in order to bring about a visible appearance for the business in hand, and that words might thence be audibly uttered, whereby the presence of the Lord might be shown, in such way as was fitting, to the corporeal senses of man, by means of the creature made subject? For if he was one of the angels, who could easily affirm whether it was the person of the Son which was imposed upon him to announce, or that of the Holy Spirit, or that of God the Father, or altogether of the Trinity itself, who is the one and only God, in order that he might say, \"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?\" For we cannot say that the Son of God is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and that the Father is not; nor will any one dare to deny that either the Holy Spirit, or the Trinity itself, whom we believe and understand to be the one God, is the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he who is not God, is not the God of those fathers. Furthermore, if not only the Father is God, as all, even heretics, admit; but also the Son, which, whether they will or not, they are compelled to acknowledge, since the apostle says, \"Who is over all, God blessed for ever;\" and the Holy Spirit, since the same apostle says, \"Therefore glorify God in your body;\" when he had said above, \"Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you, which ye have of God?\"[fn-5-P567_212549:82-nf] and these three are one God, as catholic soundness believes: it is not sufficiently apparent which person of the Trinity that angel bare, if he was one of the rest of the angels, and whether any person, and not rather that of the Trinity itself. But if the creature was assumed for the purpose of the business in hand, whereby both to appear to human eyes, and to sound in human ears, and to be called the Angel of the Lord, and the Lord, and God; then cannot God here be understood to be the Father, but either the Son or the Holy Spirit. Although I cannot call to mind that the Holy Spirit is anywhere else called an angel, which yet may be understood from His work; for it is said of Him, \"And He will show you[fn-5-P568_213287:83-nf] things to come;\"[fn-5-P569_213323:84-nf] and \"angel\" in Greek is certainly equivalent to \"messenger\"[fn-5-P570_213402:85-nf] in Latin: but we read most evidently of the Lord Jesus Christ in the prophet, that He is called \"the Angel of Great Counsel,\"[fn-5-P571_213544:86-nf] while both the Holy Spirit and the Son of God is God and Lord of the angels.","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_08_book_ii_","source_chapter":22,"source_paragraph":"114","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"67.

Moreover, from the things created at the beginning may be learnt the fellowship of the Spirit with the Father and the Son. The pure, intelligent, and supermundane powers are and are styled holy, because they have their holiness of the grace given by the Holy Spirit. Accordingly the mode of the creation of the heavenly powers is passed over in Silence, for the historian of the cosmogony has revealed to us only the creation of things perceptible by sense. But do thou, who hast power from the things that are seen to form an analogy of the unseen, glorify the Maker by whom all things were made, visible and invisible, principalities and powers, authorities, thrones, and dominions, and all other reasonable natures whom we cannot name.[fn-15-P1559_383788:327-nf] And in the creation bethink thee first, I pray thee, of the original cause of all things that are made, the Father; of the creative cause, the Son; of the perfecting cause, the Spirit; so that the ministering spirits subsist by the will of the Father, are brought into being by the operation of the Son, and perfected by the presence of the Spirit. Moreover, the perfection of angels is sanctification and continuance in it. And let no one imagine me either to affirm that there are three original hypostases[fn-15-P1560_384325:328-nf] or to allege the operation of the Son to be imperfect. For the first principle of existing things is One, creating through the Son and perfecting through the Spirit.[fn-15-P1561_384514:329-nf] The operation of the Father who worketh all in all is not imperfect, neither is the creating work of the Son incomplete if not perfected by the Spirit. The Father, who creates by His sole will, could not stand in any need of the Son, but nevertheless He wills through the Son; nor could the Son, who works according to the likeness of the Father, need co-operation, but the Son too wills to make perfect through the Spirit. \"For by the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath [the Spirit] of His mouth.\"[fn-15-P1562_385080:330-nf] The Word then is not a mere significant impression on the air, borne by the organs of speech; nor is the Spirit of His mouth a vapour, emitted by the organs of respiration; but the Word is He who \"was with God in the beginning\" and \"was God,\"[fn-15-P1563_385462:331-nf] and the Spirit of the mouth of God is \"the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father.\"[fn-15-P1564_385668:332-nf] You are therefore to perceive three, the Lord who gives the order, the Word who creates,and the Spirit who confirms.[fn-15-P1565_385807:333-nf] And what other thing could confirmation be than the perfecting according to holiness? This perfectingexpresses the confirmation's firmness,unchangeableness,and fixity in good. But there is no sanctification without the Spirit. The powers of the heavens are not holy by nature; were it so there would in this respect be no difference between them and the Holy Spirit. It is in proportion to their relative excellence that they have their meed of holiness from the Spirit. The branding-iron is conceived of together with the fire; and yet the material and the fire are distinct. Thus too in the case of the heavenly powers; their substance is, peradventure, an aerial spirit, or an immaterial fire, as it is written, \"Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;\"[fn-15-P1566_386607:334-nf] wherefore they exist in space and become visible, and appear in their proper bodily form to them that are worthy. But their sanctification, being external to their substance, superinduces their perfection through the communion of the Spirit. They keep their rank by their abiding in the good and true, and while they retain their freedom of will, never fall away from their patient attendance on Him who is truly good. It results that, if by your argument you do away with the Spirit, the hosts of the angels are disbanded, the dominions of archangels are destroyed, all is thrown into confusion, and their life loses law, order, and distinctness. For how are angels to cry \"Glory to God in the highest\"[fn-15-P1567_387331:335-nf] without being empowered by the Spirit? For \"No man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost, and no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed;\"[fn-15-P1568_387931:336-nf] as might be said by wicked and hostile spirits, whose fall establishes our statement of the freedom of the will of the invisible powers; being, as they are, in a condition of equipoise between virtue and vice, and on this account needing the succour of the Spirit. I indeed maintain that even Gabriel[fn-15-P1569_388251:337-nf] in no other way foretells events to come than by the foreknowledge of the Spirit, by reason of the fact that one of the boons distributed by the Spirit is prophecy. And whence did he who was ordained to announce the mysteries of the vision to the Man of Desires[fn-15-P1570_388533:338-nf] derive the wisdom whereby he was enabled to teach hidden things, if not from the Holy Spirit? The revelation of mysteries is indeed the peculiar function of the Spirit, as it is written, \"God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit.\"[fn-15-P1571_388790:339-nf] And how could \"thrones, dominions, principalities and powers\"[fn-15-P1572_388871:340-nf] live their blessed life, did they not \"behold the face of the Father which is in heaven\"?[fn-15-P1573_389017:341-nf] But to behold it is impossible without the Spirit! Just as at night, if you withdraw the light from the house, the eyes fall blind and their faculties become inactive, and the worth of objects cannot be discerned, and gold is trodden on in ignorance as though it were iron, so in the order of the intellectual world it is impossible for the high life of Law to abide without the Spirit. For it so to abide were as likely as that an army should maintain its discipline in the absence of its commander, or a chorus its harmony without the guidance of the coryphaeus. How could the Seraphim cry\"Holy, Holy, Holy,\"[fn-15-P1574_389650:342-nf] were they not taught by the Spirit how often true religion requires them to lift their voice in this ascription of glory? Do \"all His angels\" and \"all His hosts\"[fn-15-P1575_389831:343-nf] praise God? It is through the co-operation of the Spirit. Do \"thousand thousand\" of angels stand before Him, and\"ten thousand times ten thouSand\" ministering spirits?[fn-15-P1576_390022:344-nf] They are blamelessly doing their proper work by the power of the Spirit. All the glorious and unspeakable harmony[fn-15-P1577_390154:345-nf] of the highest heavens both in the service of God, and in the mutual concord of the celestial powers, can therefore only be preserved by the direction of the Spirit. Thus with those beings who are not gradually perfected by increase and advance,[fn-15-P1578_390423:346-nf] butare perfect from the moment of the creation, there is in creation the presence of the Holy Spirit, who confers on them the grace that flows from Him for the completion and perfection of their essence.[fn-15-P1579_390648:347-nf] ","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":16,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"137","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"46.

On the assumption that there has been a mixture, he means that there is a distinction of terms as used both in the holy Gospels and in the apostolic writings. And he uses this language while glorifying himself that he is at war at once with Arius and Eunomius and the rest of the heresiarchs. Let then this exact professor of theology tells us how he would confute the blasphemy of the heretics, while applying to God the Word what is uttered humbly and appropriately by the form of the servant. They indeed while thus doing lay down that the Son of God is inferior, a creature, made, and a servant. To whom then are we, holding as we do the opposite opinion to theirs, and confessing the Son to be of one substance and co-eternal with God the Father, Creator of the Universe, Maker, Beautifier, Ruler, and Governor, All-wise, Almighty, or rather Himself, Power, Life and Wisdom, to refer the words \"My God, my God why hast thou forsaken me;\"[fn-8-P877_149828:186-nf] or \"Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me;\"[fn-8-P878_149909:187-nf] or \"Father save me from this hour;\"[fn-8-P879_149968:188-nf] or \"That hour no man knoweth, not even the Son of Man;\"[fn-8-P880_150045:189-nf] and all the other passages spoken and written in lowliness by Him and by the holy apostles about Him? To whom shall we apply the weariness and the sleep? To whom the ignorance and the fear? Who was it who stood in need of angelic succour? If these belong to God the Word, how was wisdom ignorant? How could it be called wisdom when affected by the sense of ignorance? How could He speak the truth in saying that He had all that the Father hath,[fn-8-P881_150595:190-nf] when not having the knowledge of the Father? For He says, \"The Father alone knoweth that day.\"[fn-8-P882_150711:191-nf] How could He be the unchanged image of Him that begat Him if He has not all that the Begetter hath? If then He speaks the truth when saying that He is ignorant, any one might suppose this of Him. But if He knoweth the day, but says that He is ignorant with the wish to hide it, you see in what a blasphemy the conclusion issues. For the truth lies and could not properly be called truth if it has any quality opposed to truth. But if the truth does not lie, neither is God the Word ignorant of the day which He Himself made, and which He Himself fixed, wherein He purposes to judge the world, but has the knowledge of the Father as being unchanged image. Not then to God the Word does the ignorance belong, but to the form of the servant who at that time knew as much as the indwelling Godhead revealed. The same position may be maintained about other similar cases. How for instance could it be reasonable for God the Word to say to the Father, \"Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me, nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt\"?[fn-8-P883_151779:192-nf] The absurdities which necessarily thence follow are not a few. First it follows that the Father and the Son are not of the same mind, and that the Father wishes one thing and the Son another, for He said, \"Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt.\" Secondly we shall have to contemplate great ignorance in the Son, for He will be found ignorant whether the cup can or cannot pass from Him; but to say this of God the Word is utter impiety and blasphemy. For exactly did He know the end of the mystery of the oeconomy Who for this very reason came among us, Who of His own accord took our nature, Who emptied Himself. For this cause too He foretold to the Holy Apostles, \"Behold we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be betrayed ...into the hands of the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and the third day He shall rise again.\"[fn-8-P884_152658:193-nf] How then can He Who foretold these things, and, when Peter deprecated their coming to pass, rebuked him, Himself deprecate their coming to pass, when He clearly knows all that is to be? Is it not absurd that Abraham many generations ago should have seen His day and have been glad,[fn-8-P885_152975:194-nf] and that Isaiah in like manner, and Jeremiah, and Daniel, and Zechariah, and all the fellowship of the prophets, should have foretold His saving passion, and He Himself be ignorant, and beg release from and deprecate it, though it was destined to come to pass for the salvation of the world? Therefore these words are not the words of God the Word, but of the form of the servant, afraid of death because death was not yet destroyed.[fn-8-P886_153431:195-nf] Surely God the Word permitted the utterance of these expressions allowing room for fear, that the nature of Him that had to be born may be plain, and to prevent our supposing the Son of Abraham and David to be an unreality or appearance. The crew of the impious heretics has given birth to this blasphemy through entertaining these sentiments. We shall therefore apply what is divinely spoken and acted to God the Word; on the other hand what is said and done in humility we shall connect with the form of a servant, lest we be tainted with the blasphemy of Arius and Eunomius.","title":"Counter-Statements of Theodoret.","author":"Theodoret"},{"chapter":16,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_08_counter_statements_of_theodoret_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Against X.-The unchangeable nature was not changed into nature of flesh, but assumed human nature and set it over the common high priests, as the blessed Paul teaches in the words, \"For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is encompassed with infirmity.

Concerning whom we thus believe, even as the Apostolic Church believes. In one Father unbegotten, who has from no one the cause of His being, who is unchangeable and immutable, who is always the same, and admits of no increase or diminution; who gave to us the Law, the prophets, and the Gospels; who is Lord of the patriarchs and apostles, and all the saints. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God; not begotten of things which are not, but of Him who is the Father; not in a corporeal manner, by excision or division as Sabellius and Valentinus thought, but in a certain inexplicable and unspeakable manner, according to the words of the prophet cited above: \"Who shall declare His generation? \"[fn-47-P4704_1409728:34-nf] Since that His subsistence no nature which is begotten can investigate, even as the Father can be investigated by none; because that the nature of rational beings cannot receive the knowledge of His divine generation by the Father. But men who are moved by the Spirit of truth, have no need to learn these things from me, for in our ears are sounding the words before uttered by Christ on this very thing,\" No man knoweth the Father, save the Son; and no man knoweth who the Son is, save the Father.\"[fn-47-P4705_1410248:35-nf] That He is equally with the Father unchangeable and immutable, wanting in nothing, and the perfect Son, and like to the Father, we have learnt; in this alone is He inferior to the Father, that He is not unbegotten. For He is the very exact image of the Father, and in nothing differing from Him. For it is clear that He is the image fully containing all things by which the greatest similitude is declared, as the Lord Himself hath taught us, when He says, \"My Father is greater than I.\"[fn-47-P4706_1410755:36-nf] And according to this we believe that the Son is of the Father, always existing. \"For He is the brightness of His glory, the express image of His Father's person.\"[fn-47-P4707_1410938:37-nf] But let no one take that word always so as to raise suspicion that He is unbegotten, as they imagine who have their senses blinded. For neither are the words, \"He was,\" or \"always,\" or \"before all worlds,\" equivalent to unbegotten. But neither can the human mind employ any other word to signify unbegotten. And thus I think that you understand it, and I trust to your right purpose in all things, since these words do not at all signify unbegotten. For these words seem to denote simply a lengthening out of time, but the Godhead, and as it were the antiquity of the only-begotten, they cannot worthily signify; but they have been employed by holy men, whilst each, according to his capacity, seeks to express this mystery, asking indulgence from the hearers, and pleading a reasonable excuse, in saying, Thus far have we attained. But if there be any who are expecting from mortal lips some word which exceeds human capacity, saying that those things have been done away which are known in part, it is manifest that the words,\" He was,\" and \"always,\" and \"before all ages,\" come far short of what they hoped. And whatever word shall be employed is not equivalent to unbegotten. Therefore to the unbegotten Father, indeed, we ought to preserve His proper dignity, in confessing that no one is the cause of His being; but to the Son must be allotted His fitting honour, in assigning to Him, as we have said, a generation from the Father without beginning, and allotting adoration to Him, so as only piously and properly to use the words,\" He was,\" and \"always,\" and \"before all worlds,\" with respect to Him; by no means rejecting His Godhead, but ascribing to Him a similitude which exactly answers in every respect to the Image and Exemplar of the Father. But we must say that to the Father alone belongs the property of being unbegotten, for the Saviour Himself said, My Father is greater than I.\"[fn-47-P4708_1412855:38-nf] And besides the pious opinion concerning the Father and the Son, we confess to one Holy Spirit, as the divine Scriptures teach us; who hath inaugurated both the holy men of the Old Testament, and the divine teachers of that which is called the New. And besides, also, one only Catholic and Apostolic Church, which can never be destroyed, though all the world should seek to make war with it; but it is victorious over every most impious revolt of the heretics who rise up against it. For her Goodman hath confirmed our minds by saying, \"Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\"[fn-47-P4709_1413457:39-nf] After this we know of the resurrection of the dead, the first-fruits of which was our Lord Jesus Christ, who in very deed, and not in appearance merely, carried a body, of Mary Mother of God, who in the end of the world came to the human race to put away sin, was crucified and died, and yet did He not thus perceive any detriment to His divinity, being raised from the dead, taken up into heaven, seated at the right hand of majesty.","title":"Epistles on the Arian Heresy","author":"Alexander"},{"chapter":16,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_09_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"33.

And whereas our Lord said in the Gospel:[fn-64-P6465_2000865:294-nf] \"The law and the prophets were until John,\" they because they were virgins are related to have prophesied even after John. For they could not be bound by the law of the Old Testament, who had shone with the brightness of virginity. Let us pass on to James, who was called the brother of the Lord, a man of such sanctity and righteousness, and distinguished by so rigid and perpetual a virginity, that even[fn-64-P6466_2001292:295-nf] Josephus, the Jewish historian, relates that the overthrow of Jerusalem was due to his death. He, the first bishop of the Church at Jerusalem, which was composed of Jewish believers, to whom Paul went, accompanied by Titus and Barnabas, says in his Epistle:[fn-64-P6467_2001614:296-nf] \"Be not deceived, my beloved brethren. Every good gift and every perfect boon is from above, coming down from the Father of lights,[fn-64-P6468_2001772:297-nf] with whom there is no difference, neither shadow that is cast by turning.

And as He who was Himself the[fn-64-P6469_2002714:298-nf] first begotten from the dead has raised all that have died in Him: so He who was a virgin, consecrated the first-fruits of His virgins in His own virgin self. Let us also consider what Peter thinks of the calling of the Gentiles:[fn-64-P6470_2002962:299-nf] \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy begat us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who by the power of God are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.\" Where we read of an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, prepared in heaven and reserved for the last time, and of the hope of eternal life when they will neither marry, nor be given in marriage, there, in other words, the privileges of virginity are described. For he shows as much in what follows:[fn-64-P6471_2003701:300-nf] \"Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your former lusts in the time of your ignorance; but like as he which called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of living; because it is written, ye shall be holy; for I am holy.[fn-64-P6472_2004148:301-nf] For we were not redeemed with contemptible things, with silver or gold; but with the precious blood of a lamb without spot, Jesus Christ,[fn-64-P6473_2004321:302-nf] that we might purify our souls in obedience to the truth, having been begotten again not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God,[fn-64-P6474_2004513:303-nf] who liveth and abideth.

For the time past is sufficient for us when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, and other vices. Great and precious are the promises attaching to virginity which He has given us,[fn-64-P6477_2005458:306-nf] that through it we may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world through lust.[fn-64-P6478_2005610:307-nf] The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgement, but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion, daring, self-willed. For they, as beasts of burden, without reason, think only of their belly and their lusts, railers who shall in their corruption be destroyed, and shall receive the reward of iniquity: men that count unrighteousness delight, spots and blemishes, thinking of nothing but their pleasures; having eyes full of adultery and insatiable lust, deceiving souls not yet strengthened by the love of Christ. For they utter swelling words and easily snare the unlearned with the seduction of the flesh; promising them liberty while they themselves are the slaves of vice, luxury, and corruption. For of what a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage. But if, after they had escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again overcome by that which they before overcame, the last state is become worse with them than the first.

So that God did not wish to hallow this day by His works, but by His rest, which has no evening, for it is not a creature; so that, being known in one way in the Word of God, and in another in itself, it should make a twofold knowledge, daylight and dusk (day and evening). Much more might be said about tile perfection of the number seven, but this book is already too long, and I fear lest I should seem to catch at an opportunity of airing my little smattering of science more childishly than profitably. I must speak, therefore, in moderation and with dignity, lest, in too keenly following \"number,\" I be accused of forgetting \"weight\" and \"measure.\" Suffice it here to say, that three is the first whole number that is odd, four the first that is even, and of these two, seven is composed. On this account it is often put for all numbers together, as, \"A just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again,\"[fn-19-P1940_1113059:61-nf] -that is, let him fall never so often, he will not perish (and this was meant to be understood not of sins, but of afflictions conducing to lowliness). Again, \"Seven times a day will I praise Thee,\"[fn-19-P1941_1113278:62-nf] which elsewhere is expressed thus, \"I will bless the Lord at all times.\"[fn-19-P1942_1113373:63-nf] And many such instances are found in the divine authorities, in which the number seven is, as I said, commonly used to express the whole, or the completeness of anything. And so the Holy Spirit, of whom the Lord says, \"He will teach you all truth,\"[fn-19-P1943_1113643:64-nf] is signified by this number,[fn-19-P1944_1113692:65-nf] In it is the rest of God, the rest His people find in Him. For rest is in the whole, i.e.., in perfect completeness, while in the part there is labor. And thus we labor as long as we know in part; \"but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\"[fn-19-P1945_1113998:66-nf] It is even with toil we search into the Scriptures themselves. But the holy angels, towards whose society and assembly we sigh while in this our toilsome pilgrimage, as they already abide in their eternal home, so do they enjoy perfect facility of knowledge and felicity of rest. It is without difficulty that they help us; for their spiritual movements, pure and free, cost them no effort.","title":"Book XI","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_20_commandment_tenth","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"ANF-02","text":"\"Hear, then,\" says he, \"foolish man, how grief crushes out the Holy Spirit, and on the other hand saves.

It is not possible, in fact, to traverse in thought one amongst those attributes and then reach another, be it a reality or a conception, which is to transcend the first in antiquity. Every name of God, every sublime conception of Him, every utterance or idea that harmonizes with our general ideas with regard to Him, is linked in closest union with its fellow; all such conceptions are massed together in our under standing into one collective and compact whole namely, His Fatherhood, and Ungeneracy, and Power, and Imperishability, and Goodness, and Authority, and everything else. You cannot take one of these and separate it in thought from the rest by any interval of time, as if it preceded or followed something else; no sublime or adorable attribute in Him can be discovered, which is not simultaneously expressed in His everlastingness. Just, then, as we cannot say that God was ever not good, or powerful, or imperishable, or immortal, in the same way it is a blasphemy not to attribute to Him Fatherhood always, and to say that that came later. He Who is truly Father is always Father; if eternity was not included in this confession, and if a foolishly preconceived idea curtailed and checked retrospectively our conception of the Father, true Fatherhood could no longer be properly predicated of Him, because that preconceived idea about the Son would cancel the continuity and eternity of His Father hood.

It is not possible, in fact, to traverse in thought one amongst those attributes and then reach another, be it a reality or a conception, which is to transcend the first in antiquity. Every name of God, every sublime conception of Him, every utterance or idea that harmonizes with our general ideas with regard to Him, is linked in closest union with its fellow; all such conceptions are massed together in our under standing into one collective and compact whole namely, His Fatherhood, and Ungeneracy, and Power, and Imperishability, and Goodness, and Authority, and everything else. You cannot take one of these and separate it in thought from the rest by any interval of time, as if it preceded or followed something else; no sublime or adorable attribute in Him can be discovered, which is not simultaneously expressed in His everlastingness. Just, then, as we cannot say that God was ever not good, or powerful, or imperishable, or immortal, in the same way it is a blasphemy not to attribute to Him Fatherhood always, and to say that that came later. He Who is truly Father is always Father; if eternity was not included in this confession, and if a foolishly preconceived idea curtailed and checked retrospectively our conception of the Father, true Fatherhood could no longer be properly predicated of Him, because that preconceived idea about the Son would cancel the continuity and eternity of His Father hood.

For the words preceding also are tainted with the same profanity-\"receiving glory from the Father, not sharing glory with the Father, for the glory of the Almighty God is incommunicable.\" For my own part, even had his words referred to Moses who was glorified in the ministration of the Law,-not even then should I have tolerated such a statement, even if it be conceded that Moses, having no glory from within, appeared completely glorious to the Israelites by the favour bestowed on him from God. For the very glory that was bestowed on the lawgiver was the glory of none other but of God Himself, which glory the Lord in the Gospel bids all to seek, when He blames those who value human glory highly and seek not the glory that cometh from God only[fn-11-P1136_615427:142-nf] . For by the fact that He commanded them to seek the glory that cometh from the only God, He declared the possibility of their obtaining what they sought. How then is the glory of the Almighty incommunicable, if it is even our duty to ask for the glory that cometh from the only God, and if, according to our Lord's word, \"every one that asketh receiveth[fn-11-P1137_615808:143-nf] ?\" But one who says concerning the Brightness of the Father's glory, that He has the glory by having received it, says in effect that the Brightness of the glory is in Itself devoid of glory, and needs, in order to become Himself at last the Lord of some glory, to receive glory from another. How then are we to dispose of the utterances of the Truth,-one which tells us that He shall be seen in the glory of the Father[fn-11-P1138_616252:144-nf] , and another which says, \"All things that the Father hath are Mine[fn-11-P1139_616345:145-nf] \"? To whom ought the hearer to give ear? To him who says, \"He that is, as the Apostle says, the `heir of all things[fn-11-P1140_616485:146-nf] ' that are in the Father, is without part or lot in His Father's glory\"; or to Him Who declares that all things that the Father hath, He Himself hath also? Now among the \"all things,\" glory surely is included. Yet Eunomius says that the glory of the Almighty is incommunicable. This view Joel does not attest, nor yet the mighty Peter, who adopted, in his speech to the Jews, the language of the prophet. For both the prophet and the apostle say, in the person of God,-\"I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh[fn-11-P1141_617017:147-nf] .\" He then Who did not grudge the partaking in His own Spirit to all flesh,-how can it be that He does not impart His own glory to the only-begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, Who has all things that the Father has? Perhaps one should say that Eunomius is here speaking the truth, though not intending it. For the term \"impart\" is strictly used in the case of one who has not his glory from within, whose possession of it is an accession from without, and not part of his own nature: but where one and the same nature is observed in both Persons, He Who is as regards nature all that the Father is believed to be stands in no need of one to impart to Him each several attribute. This it will be well to explain more clearly and precisely. He Who has the Father dwelling in Him in His entirety-what need has He of the Father's glory, when none of the attributes contemplated in the Father is withdrawn from Him?","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":16,"verse":15,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"59","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"What, moreover, is the high estate of the Almighty in which Eunomius affirms that the Son has no share? Let those, then, who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight[fn-11-P1145_618377:148-nf] , utter their groundling opinions-they who, as the prophet says, \"speak out of the ground[fn-11-P1146_618485:149-nf] .\" But let us who reverence the Word and are disciples of the Truth, or rather who profess to be so, not leave even this assertion unsifted. We know that of all the names by which Deity is indicated some are expressive of the Divine majesty, employed and understood absolutely, and some are assigned with reference to the operations over us and all creation. For when the Apostle says \"Now to the immortal, invisible, only wise Gods[fn-11-P1147_618938:150-nf] ,\" and the like, by these titles he suggests conceptions which represent to us the transcendent power, but when God is spoken of in the Scriptures as gracious, merciful, full of pity, true, good, Lord, Physician, Shepherd, Way, Bread, Fountain, King, Creator, Artificer, Protector, Who is over all and through all, Who is all in all, these and similar titles contain the declaration of the operations of the Divine loving-kindness in the creation. Those then who enquire precisely into the meaning of the term \"Almighty\" will find that it declares nothing else concerning the Divine power than that operation which controls created things and is indicated by the word \"Almighty,\" stands in a certain relation to something. For as He would not be called a Physician, save on account of the sick, nor merciful and gracious, and the like, save by reason of one who stood in need of grace and mercy, so neither would He be styled Almighty, did not all creation stand in need of one to regulate it and keep it in being. As, then, He presents Himself as a Physician to those who are in need of healing, so He is Almighty over one who has need of being ruled: and just as \"they that are whole have no need of a physician[fn-11-P1148_620178:151-nf] ,\" so it follows that we may well say that He Whose nature contains in it the principle of unerring and unwavering rectitude does not, like others, need a ruler over Him. Accordingly, when we hear the name \"Almighty,\" our conception is this, that God sustains in being all intelligible things as well as all things of a material nature. For this cause He sitteth upon the circle of the earth, for this cause He holdeth the ends of the earth in His hand, for this cause He \"meteth out leaven with the span, and measureth the waters in the hollow of His hand[fn-11-P1149_620786:152-nf] \"; for this cause He comprehendeth in Himself all the intelligible creation, that all things may remain in existence controlled by His encompassing power. Let us enquire, then, Who it is that \"worketh all in all.\" Who is He Who made all things, and without Whom no existing thing does exist? Who is He in Whom all things were created, and in Whom all things that are have their continuance? In Whom do we live and move and have our being? Who is He Who hath in Himself all that the Father hath? Does what has been said leave us any longer in ignorance of Him Who is \"God over all[fn-11-P1150_621448:153-nf] ,\" Who is so entitled by S. Paul,-our Lord Jesus Christ, Who, as He Himself says, holding in His hand \"all things that the Father hath[fn-11-P1151_621602:154-nf] ,\" assuredly grasps all things in the all-containing hollow of His hand and is sovereign over what He has grasped, and no man taketh from the hand of Him Who in His hand holdeth all things? If, then, He hath all things, and is sovereign over that which He hath, why is He Who is thus sovereign over all things something else and not Almighty? If heresy replies that the Father is sovereign over both the Son and the Holy Spirit, let them first show that the Son and the Holy Spirit are of mutable nature, and then over this mutability let them set its ruler, that by the help implanted from above, that which is so overruled may continue incapable of turning to evil. If, on the other hand, the Divine nature is incapable of evil, unchangeable, unalterable, eternally permanent, to what end does it stand in need of a ruler, controlling as it does all creation, and itself by reason of its immutability needing no ruler to control it? For this cause it is that at the name of Christ \"every knee boweth, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth[fn-11-P1152_622698:155-nf] .\" For assuredly every knee would not thus bow, did it not recognize in Christ Him Who rules it for its own salvation. But to say that the Son came into being by the goodness of the Father is nothing else than to put Him on a level with the meanest objects of creation. For what is there that did not arrive at its birth by the goodness of Him Who made it? To what is the formation of mankind ascribed? to the badness of its Maker, or to His goodness? To what do we ascribe the generation of animals, the production of plants and herbs? There is nothing that did not take its rise from the goodness of Him Who made it. A property, then, which reason discerns to be common to all things, Eunomius is so kind as to allow to the Eternal Son! But that He did not share His essence or His estate with the Father-these assertions and the rest of his verbiage I have refuted in anticipation, when dealing with his statements concerning the Father, and shown that he has hazarded them at random and without any intelligible meaning. For not even in the case of us who are born one of another is there any division of essence. The definition expressive of essence remains in its entirety in each, in him that begets and in him who is begotten, without admitting diminution in him who begets, or augmentation in him who is begotten. But to speak of division of estate or sovereignty in the case of Him Who hath all things whatsoever that the Father hath, carries with it no meaning, unless it be a demonstration of the propounder's impiety. It would therefore be superfluous to entangle oneself in such discussions, and so to prolong our treatise to an unreasonable length.

And the meaning is: Who is he that cometh up from the earth, cometh up from blood? According to the[fn-71-P7131_2353827:97-nf] prophecy of Jacob, He has bound His foal to the vine, and has trodden the wine-press alone, and His garments are red with new wine from Bosor, that is from flesh, or from the tribulation of the world: for He Himself[fn-71-P7132_2354063:98-nf] has conquered the world.

That which was seen is either real, or false. If it is real, it follows that He really ate, and really had members. But if it is false, how could He be willing to give false impressions in order to prove the truth of His resurrection? For no one proves what is true by means of what is false. You will say, are we then going to eat after our resurrection? I know not. Scripture does not tell us; and yet, if the question be asked, I do not think we shall eat. For I have read that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, while it promises[fn-71-P7143_2356821:109-nf] such things as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man. Moses fasted forty days and forty nights. Human nature does not allow of this, but what is impossible with men is not impossible with God. Just as, in foretelling the future, it matters not whether a person announces what will take place after ten years or after a hundred, since the knowledge of futurity is all one; so he who can fast for forty days and yet live,-not, indeed, that he can of himself fast, but that he lives by the power of God,-will also be able to live for ever without food and drink. Why did our Lord eat an honeycomb? To prove the resurrection: not to give your palate the pleasure of tasting of honey. He asked for a fish broiled on the coals that He might[fn-71-P7144_2357612:110-nf] confirm the doubting Apostles, who did not dare approach Him because they thought they saw not a body, but a spirit.[fn-71-P7145_2357749:111-nf] The daughter of the ruler of the synagogue was raised to life and took food.[fn-71-P7146_2357841:112-nf] Lazarus, who had been four days dead, rose again, and comes before us at a dinner; not because he was accustomed to eat in the lower world, but because a case which presented such difficulties challenged the believer's criticism. As He showed them real hands and a real side, so He really ate with His disciples; really walked with Cleophas; conversed with men with a real tongue; really reclined at supper; with real hands took bread, blessed and brake it, and was offering it to them. And as for His suddenly vanishing out of their sight, that is the power of God, not of a shadowy phantom. Besides, even before His resurrection, when they had led Him out from Nazareth that they might cast Him down headlong from the brow of the hill, He passed through the midst of them, that is, escaped out of their hands. Can we follow Marcion, and say that because, when He was held fast, He escaped in a manner contrary to nature, therefore His birth must have been only apparent? Has not the Lord a privilege which is conceded to magicians? It is related of Apollonius of Tyana that, when standing in court before Domitian, he all at once disappeared. Do not put the power of the Lord on a level with the tricks of magicians, so that He may appear to have been what He was not, and may be thought to have eaten without teeth, walked without feet, broken bread without hands, spoken without a tongue, and showed a side which had no ribs.","title":"To Pammachius Against John of Jerusalem","author":false},{"chapter":16,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_14_book_iii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"21","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"I resume my discourse, however, taking up that point of his argument which we originally set aside. \"We do not refuse,\" he says, \"to call the Son. seeing He is generate, even by the name of `product of generation[fn-13-P1377_745647:53-nf] ,' since the generated essence itself, and the appellation of `Son,' make such a relation of words appropriate\" Meanwhile let the reader who is critically following the argument remember this, that in speaking of the \"generated essence\" in the case of the Only-begotten, he by consequence allows us to speak of the \"ungenerate essence\" in the case of the Father, so that neither absence of generation, nor generation, can any longer be supposed to constitute the essence, but the essence must be taken separately, and its being, or not being begotten, must be conceived separately by means of the peculiar attributes contemplated in it. Let us, however, consider more carefully his argument on this point. He says that an essence has been begotten, and that the name of this generated essence is \"Son.\" Well, at this point our argument will convict that of our opponents on two grounds, first, of an attempt at knavery, secondly, of slackness in their attempt against ourselves. For he is playing the knave when he speaks of \"generation of essence,\" in order to establish his opposition between the essences, when once they are divided in respect of a difference of nature between \"generate\" and \"ungenerate\": while the slackness of their attempt is shown by the very positions their knavery tries to establish. For he who says the essence is generate, clearly defines generation as being something else distinct from the essence, so that the significance of generation cannot be assigned to the word \"essence.\" For he has not in this passage represented the matter as he often does, so as to say that generation is itself the essence, but acknowledges that the essence is generated, so that there is produced in his readers a distinct notion in the case of each word: for one conception arises in him who hears that it was generated, and another is called up by the name of \"essence.\" Our argument may be made clearer by example. The Lord says in the Gospel[fn-13-P1378_747957:54-nf] that a woman, when her travail is drawing near, is in sorrow, but afterwards rejoices in gladness because a man is born into the world. As then in this passage we derive from the Gospel two distinct conceptions,-one the birth which we conceive to be by way of generation, the other that which results from the birth (for the birth is not the man, but the man is by the birth),-so here too, when Eunomius confesses that the essence was generated, we learn by the latter word that the essence comes from something, and by the Former we conceive that subject itself which has its real being from something. If then the signification of essence is one thing, and the word expressing generation suggests to us another conception, their clever contrivances are quite gone to ruin, like earthen vessels hurled one against the other, and mutually smashed to pieces. For it will no longer be possible for them, if they apply the opposition of \"generate\" and \"ungenerate\" to the essence of the Father and the Son, to apply at the same time to the things themselves the mutual conflict between these names[fn-13-P1379_749078:55-nf] . For as it is confessed by Eunomius that the essence is generate (seeing that the example from the Gospel explains the meaning of such a phrase, where, when we hear that a man is generated, we do not conceive the man to be the same thing as his generation, but receive a separate conception in each of the two words), heresy will surely no longer be permitted to express by such words her doctrine of the difference of the essences. In order, however, that our account of these matters may be cleared up as far as possible, let us once more discuss the point in the following way. He Who framed the universe made the nature of man with all things in the beginning, and after Adam was made, He then appointed for men the law of generation one from another, saying, \"Be fruitful and multiply[fn-13-P1380_750192:56-nf] .\" Now while Abel came into existence by way of generation, what reasonable man would deny that, in the actual sense of human generation, Adam existed ungenerately? Yet the first man had in himself the complete definition of man's essential nature, and he who was generated of him was enrolled under the same essential name. But if the essence that was generated was made anything other than that which was not generated, the same essential name would not apply to both: for of those things whose essence is different, the essential name also is not the same. Since, then, the essential nature of Adam and of Abel is marked by the same characteristics, we must certainly agree that one essence is in both, and that the one and the other are exhibited in the same nature. For Adam and Abel are both one so far as the definition of their nature is concerned, but are distinguished one from the other without confusion by the individual attributes observed in each of them. We cannot therefore properly say that Adam generated another essence besides himself, but rather that of himself he generated another self, with whom was produced the whole definition of the essence of him who generated him. What, then, we learn in the case of human nature by means of the inferential guidance afforded to us by the definition, this I think we ought to take for our guidance also to the pure apprehension of the Divine doctrines. For when we have shaken off from the Divine and exalted doctrines all carnal and material notions, we shall be most surely led by the remaining conception, when it is purged of such ideas, to the lofty and unapproachable heights. It is confessed even by our adversaries that God, Who is over all, both is and is called the Father of the Only-begotten, and they moreover give to the Only-begotten God, Who is of the Father, the name of \"begotten,\" by reason of His being generated. Since then among men the word \"father\" has certain significances attaching to it, from which the pure nature is alien, it behoves a man to lay aside all material conceptions which enter in by association with the carnal significance of the word \"father,\" and to form in the case of the God and Father a conception befitting the Divine nature, expressive only of the reality of the relationship. Since, therefore, in the notion of a human father there is included not only all that the flesh suggests to our thoughts, but a certain notion of interval is also undoubtedly conceived with the idea of human fatherhood, it would be well, in the case of the Divine generation, to reject, together with bodily pollution, the notion of interval also, that so what properly belongs to matter may be completely purged away, and the transcendent generation may be clear, not only from the idea of passion, but from that of interval. Now he who says that God is a Father will unite with the thought that God is, the further thought that He is something: for that which has its being from some beginning, certainly also derives from something the beginning of its being, whatever it is: but He in Whose case being had no beginning, has not His beginning from anything, even although we contemplate in Him some other attribute than simple existence. Well, God is a Father. It follows that He is what He is from eternity: for He did not become, but is a Father: for in God that which was, both is and will be. On the other hand, if He once was not anything, then He neither is nor will be that thing: for He is not believed to be the Father of a Being such that it may be piously asserted that God once existed by Himself without that Being. For the Father is the Father of Life, and Truth, and Wisdom, and Light, and Sanctification, and Power, and all else of a like kind that the Only-begotten is or is called. Thus when the adversaries allege that the Light \"once was not,\" I know not to which the greater injury is done, whether to the Light, in that the Light is not, or to Him that has the Light, in that He has not the Light. So also with Life and Truth and Power, and all the other characters in which the Only-begotten fills the Father's bosom, being all things in His own fulness. For the absurdity will be equal either way, and the impiety against the Father will equal the blasphemy against the Son: for in saying that the Lord \"once was not,\" you will not merely assert the non-existence of Power, but you will be saying that the Power of God, Who is the Father of the Power, \"was not.\" Thus the assertion made by your doctrine that the Son \"once was not,\" establishes nothing else than a destitution of all good in the case of the Father. See to what an end these wise men's acuteness leads, how by them the word of the Lord is made good, which says, \"He that despiseth Me despiseth Him that sent Me[fn-13-P1381_755008:57-nf] :\" for by the very arguments by which they despise the existence at any time of the Only-begotten, they also dishonour the Father, stripping off by their doctrine from the Father's glory every good name and conception.","title":"Book III","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":16,"verse":26,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_13_book_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"31. To this the Lord's words bear witness;-I will not say unto you that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father Himself loveth you, because ye have loved Me, and believe that I went forth from God, and am come from the Father into this world[fn-14-P1454_918523:35-nf] . A complete faith concerning the Son, which accepts and loves the truth that He went forth from God, has access to the Father without need of His intervention. The confession that the Son was born and sent from God wins for it direct audience and love from Him. Thus the narrative of His birth and coming must be taken in the strictest and most literal sense. I went forth from God, He says, conveying that His nature is exactly that which was given Him by His birth; for what being but God could go forth from God, that is, could enter upon existence by birth from Him? Then He continues, And am come from the Father into this world. To assure us that this going forth from God means birth from the Father, He tells us that He came from the Father into this world. The latter statement refers to His incarnation, the former to His nature. And again, His putting on record first the fact of His going forth from God, and then His coming from the Father, forbids us to identify the going with the coming. Coming from the Father, and going forth from God, are not synonymous; they might be paraphrased as `Birth' and `Presence,' and are as different in meaning as these. It is one thing to have gone forth from God, and entered by birth upon a substantial existence; another to have come from the Father into this world to accomplish the mysteries of our salvation.","title":"Book VI.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":16,"verse":29,"source_code":"npnf2_09_npnf2_09_13_book_vi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"34","folder":"NPNF2-09","text":"33. After many dark sayings, spoken in parables by Him Whom they already knew as the Christ foretold by Moses and the Prophets, Whom Nathanael had confessed as the Son of God and King of Israel, Who had Himself reproached Philip, in his question about the Father, for not perceiving, by the works which He did, that the Father was in Him and He in the Father; after He had already often taught them that He was sent from the Father; still, it was not till they had heard Him assert that He had gone forth from God that they confessed, in the words which immediately follow in the Gospel;-His disciples say unto Him, Now speakest Thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.

And ye had seen withered hands recover their suppleness, the tongues of dumb men loosened into speech, the feet of the lame made swift to run, the eyes of the blind endowed with vision, and life restored to the dead. Lazarus, who stank already, had risen to his feet at a word. He was summoned from the tomb and instantly came forth, without a pause between the word and its fulfilment. He was standing before you, a living man, while yet the air was carrying the odour of death to your nostrils. I speak not of other exertions of His mighty, His Divine powers. And is it, in spite of all this, only after ye heard Him say, I went forth from God, that ye understood Who He is that had been sent from heaven? Is this the first time that the truth had been told you without a proverb? The first time that the powers of His nature made it manifest to you that He went forth from God? And this in spite of His silent scrutiny of the purposes of your will, of His needing not to ask you concerning anything as though He were ignorant, of His universal knowledge?

For the present I forbear to expose their licence of speculation, some of them holding that the Paraclete Spirit comes from the Father or from the Son. For our Lord has not left this in uncertainty, for after these same words He spoke thus,-I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He shall guide you into all truth: for He shall not speak from Himself: but what things soever He shall hear, these shall He speak; and He shall declare unto you the things that are to come.

Accordingly He receives from the Son, Who is both sent by Him, and proceeds from the Father. Now I ask whether to receive from the Son is the same thing as to proceed from the Father. But if one believes that there is a difference between receiving from the Son and proceeding from the Father, surely to receive from the Son and to receive from the Father will be regarded as one and the same thing. For our Lord Himself says, Because He shall receive of Mine and shall declare it unto you. All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine: therefore said I, He shall receive of Mine and shall declare it unto you. That which He will receive,-whether it will be power, or excellence, or teaching,-the Son has said must be received from Him, and again He indicates that this same thing must be received from the Father. For when tie says that all things whatsoever the Father hath are His, and that for this cause He declared that it must be received from His own, He teaches also that what is received from the Father is yet received from Himself, because all things that the Father hath are His. Such a unity admits no difference, nor does it make any difference from whom that is received, which given by the Father is described as given by the Son. Is a mere unity of will brought forward here also? All things which the Father hath are the Son's, and all things which the Son hath are the Father's. For He Himself saith, And all Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine[fn-16-P1648_1083739:29-nf] . It is not yet the place to shew wily He spoke thus, For He shall receive of Mine: for this points to some subsequent time, when it is revealed that He shall receive. Now at any rate He says that He will receive of Himself, because all things that the Father had were His. Dissever if thou canst the unity of the nature, and introduce some necessary unlikeness through which the Son may not exist in unity of nature. For the Spirit of truth proceedeth from the Father and is sent from the Father by the Son. All things that the Father hath are the Son's; and for this cause whatever He Who is to be sent shall receive, He shall receive from the Son, because all things that the Father hath are the Son's. The nature in all respects maintains its law, and because Both are One that same Godhead is signified as existing in Both through generation and nativity; since the Son affirms that that which the Spirit of truth shall receive from the Father is to be given by Himself.

Now that you may understand the saying of the Lord, when He said, All things whatsoever the Father hath are Mine[fn-17-P1724_1133676:72-nf] , learn the teaching and faith of the Apostle who said, Take heed lest any lead you astray through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elements of the world and not after Christ; for in Him dwelleth the fulness of Godhead bodily[fn-17-P1725_1133958:73-nf] . That man is of the world and savours of the teaching of men and is the victim of philosophy, who does not know Christ to be the true God, who does not recognise in Him the fulness of Godhead. The mind of man knows only that which it understands, and the world's powers of belief are limited, since it judges according to the laws of the material elements that that alone is possible which it can see or do. For the elements of the world have come into being out of nothing, but Christ's continuity of existence did not begin in the non-existent, nor did He ever begin to exist, but He took from the beginning a beginning which is eternal. The elements of the world are either without life, or have issued out of this stage into life, but Christ is life, born to be living God from the living God. The elements of the world have been established by God, but they are not God: Christ as God of God is Himself wholly all that God is. The elements of the world, since they are within it, cannot possibly rise out of their condition and cease to be within it, but Christ, while having God within Himself through the Mystery, is Himself in God. The elements of the universe, generating from themselves creatures with a life like their own, do indeed through the exercise of their bodily functions bestow upon them from their own bodies the beginnings of life, but they are not themselves present as living beings in their offspring, whereas in Christ all the fulness of the Godhead is present in bodily shape.","title":"Book VIII.","author":"Hilary of Poitiers"},{"chapter":16,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_15_book_iii_","source_chapter":2,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"6.

But the Lord knowing by His Divine Nature what should come to pass, answered that Peter would deny Him thrice: that we might know from Peter how the others were offended, since even he lapsed into so great peril to his faith by the triple denial. After that, He took Peter, James and John, chosen, the first two to be His martyrs, John to be strengthened for the proclamation of the Gospel, and declared that He was sorrowful unto death. Then He went before, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet, not as I will, but as Thou wilt[fn-20-P2047_1328417:57-nf] . He prays that the cup may pass from Him, when it was certainly already before Him: for even then was being fulfilled that pouting forth of His blood of the New Testament for the sins of many. He does not pray that it may not be with Him; but that it may pass away from Him. Then He prays that His wilt may not be done, and wills that what He wishes to be effected, may not be granted Him. For He says, Yet not as I will, but as Thou wilt: signifying by His spontaneous prayer for the cup's removal His fellowship with human anxiety, yet associating Himself with the decree of the Will which He shares inseparably with the Father. To shew, moreover, that He does not pray for Himself, and that He seeks only a conditional fulfilment of what He desires and prays for, He prefaces the whole of this request with the words, My Father, if it is possible.

For this reason we declare the maintenance of their doctrine as to the non-existence at some time of Him Who truly is, to be a denial and rejection of His true Godhead; and this on the ground that, on the one hand, He Who showed Himself to Moses by the light speaks of Himself as being, when He says, \"I am He that is[fn-18-P1819_1059094:4-nf] ,\" while on the other, Isaiah (being made, so to say, the instrument of Him Who spoke in him) says in the person of Him that is, \"I am the first, and hereafter am I[fn-18-P1820_1059276:5-nf] ,\" so that hereby, whichever way we consider it, we conceive eternity in God. And so, too, the word that was spoken to Manoah shows the fact that the Divinity is not comprehensible by the significance of His name, because, when Manoah asks to know His name, that, when the promise has come actually to pass, he may by name glorify his benefactor, He says to him, \"Why askest thou this? It also is wonderful[fn-18-P1821_1059752:6-nf] \"; so that by this we learn that there is one name significant of the Divine Nature-the wonder, namely, that arises unspeakably in our hearts concerning It. So, too, great David, in his discourses with himself, proclaims the same truth, in the sense that all the creation was brought into being by God, while He alone exists always in the same manner, and abides for ever, where he says, \"But Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail[fn-18-P1822_1060224:7-nf] .\" When we hear these sayings, and others like them, from men inspired by God, let us leave all that is not from eternity to the worship of idolaters, as a new thing alien from the true Godhead. For that which now is, and formerly was not, is clearly new and not eternal, and to have regard to any new object of worship is called by Moses the service of demons, when he says, \"They sacrificed to devils and not to God, to gods whom their fathers knew not; new gods were they that came newly up[fn-18-P1823_1060734:8-nf] .\" If then everything that is new in worship is a service of demons, and is alien from the true Godhead, and if what is now, but was not always, is new and not eternal, we who have regard to that which is, necessarily reckon those who contemplate non-existence as attaching to Him Who is, and who say that \"He once was not,\" among the worshippers of idols. For we may also see that the great John, when declaring in his own preaching the Only-begotten God, guards his own statement in every way, so that the conception of non-existence shall find no access to Him Who is. For he says[fn-18-P1824_1061377:9-nf] that He \"was in the beginning,\" and \"was with God,\" and \"was God,\" and was light, and life, and truth, and all good things at all times, and never at any time failed to be anything that is excellent, Who is the fulness of all good, and is in the bosom of the Father. If then Moses lays down as a law for us some such mark of true Godhead as this, that we know nothing else of God but this one thing, that He is (for to this point the words, \"I am He that is[fn-18-P1825_1061854:10-nf] \"); while Isaiah in his preaching declares aloud the absolute infinity of Him Who is, defining the existence of God as having no regard to beginning or to end (for He Who says \"I am the first, and hereafter am I,\" places no limit to His eternity in either direction, so that neither, if we look to the beginning, do we find any point marked since which He is, and beyond which He was not, nor, if 'we turn our thought to the future, can we cut short by any boundary the eternal progress of Him Who is),-and if the prophet David forbids us to worship any new and strange God[fn-18-P1826_1062447:11-nf] (both of which are involved in the heretical doctrine; \"newness\" is clearly indicated in that which is not eternal, and \"strangeness\" is alienation from the Nature of the very God),-if, I say, these things are so, we declare all the sophistical fabrication about the non-existence at some time of Him Who truly is, to be nothing else than a departure from Christianity, and a turning to idolatry. For when the Evangelist, in his discourse concerning the Nature of God, separates at all points non-existence from Him Who is, and, by his constant repetition of the word \"was,\" carefully destroys the suspicion of non-existence, and calls Him the Only-begotten God, the Word of God, the Son of God, equal with God, and all such names, we have this judgment fixed and settled in us, that if the Only-begotten Son is God, we must believe that He Who is believed to be God is eternal. And indeed He is verily God, and assuredly is eternal, and is never at any time found to be non-existent. For God, as we have often said, if He now is, also assuredly always was, and if He once was not, neither does He now exist at all. But since even the enemies of the truth confess that the Son is and continually abides the Only-begotten God, we say this, that, being in the Father, He is not in Him in one respect only, but He is in Him altogether, in respect of all that the Father is conceived to be. As, then, being in the incorruptibility of the Father, He is incorruptible, good in His goodness, powerful in His might, and, as being in each of these attributes of special excellence which are conceived of the Father, He is that particular thing, so, also, being in His eternity, He is assuredly eternal. Now the eternity of the Father is marked by His never having taken His being from nonexistence, and never terminating His being in non-existence. He, therefore, Who hath all things that are the Father's[fn-18-P1827_1064368:12-nf] , and is contemplated in all the glory of the Father, even as, being in the endlessness of the Father, He has no end, so, being in the unoriginateness of the Father, has, as the Apostle says, \"no beginning of days[fn-18-P1828_1064604:13-nf] ,\" but at once is \"of the Father,\" and is regarded in the eternity of the Father:and in this respect, more especially, is seen the complete absence of divergence in the Likeness, as compared with Him Whose Likeness He is. And herein is His saying found true which tells us, \"He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father[fn-18-P1829_1064939:14-nf] .\" Moreover, it is in this way that those words of the Apostle, that the Son is \"the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His Person[fn-18-P1830_1065106:15-nf] ,\" are best understood to have an excellent and close application. For the Apostle conveys to those hearers who are unable, by the contemplation of purely intellectual objects, to elevate their thought to the height of the knowledge of God, a sort of notion of the truth, by means of things apparent to sense. For as the body of the sun is expressly imaged by the whole disc that surrounds it, and he who looks on the sun argues, by means of what he sees, the existence of the whole solid substratum, so, he says, the majesty of the Father is expressly imaged in the greatness of the power of the Son, that the one may be believed to be as great as the other is known to be: and again, as the radiance of light sheds its brilliancy from the whole of the sun's disc (for in the disc one part is not radiant, and the rest dim), so all that glory which the Father is, sheds its brilliancy from its whole extent by means of the brightness that comes from it, that is, by the true Light; and as the ray is of the sun (for there would be no ray if the sun were not), yet the sun is never conceived as existing by itself without the ray of brightness that is shed from it, so the Apostle delivering to us the continuity and eternity of that existence which the Only-begotten has of the Father, calls the Son \"the brightness of His glory.\"","title":"Book VIII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":16,"verse":24,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_112_sermon_xcv_cxlv_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"1.

For they still had concupiscence; whereas the Law saith, \"Thou shalt not lust.\"[fn-68-P6842_2874224:29-nf] Without offence to those holy rams, the leaders of the flock, without offence to them I would say it, for I say the truth: the Gospel relates, that they contended which of them should be the greatest, and whilst the Lord was yet on earth, they were agitated by a dissension about pre-eminence.[fn-68-P6843_2874546:30-nf] Whence was this, but from the old leaven? whence, but from the law in the members, resisting the law of the mind? They sought for eminence; yea, they desired it; they thought which should be the greatest; therefore is their pride put to shame by a little child.[fn-68-P6844_2874827:31-nf] Jesus calleth unto him the age of humility to tame the swelling desire. With good reason then when they returned too, and said, \"Lord, behold even the devils are subject unto us through Thy Name.\" (It was for a nothing that they rejoiced; of what importance was it compared to that which God promised?) The Lord, the Good Master, quieting fear, and building up a firm support, said to them, \"In this rejoice not that the devils are subject unto you.\" Why so? Because \"many will come in My Name, saying, Behold, in Thy Name we have cast out devils; and I will say to them, I know you not. In this rejoice not, but rejoice because your Dances are written in heaven.\"[fn-68-P6845_2875512:32-nf] Ye cannot yet be there, yet notwithstanding ye are already written there. Therefore\" rejoice.\" So that place again, \"Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My Name.\"[fn-68-P6846_2875695:33-nf] For what ye have asked, in comparison with that which I am willing to give, is nothing. For what have ye asked in My Name? That the devils should be subject unto you? \"In this rejoice not,\" that is, what ye have asked is nothing; for if it were anything, He would bid them rejoice. So then it was not absolutely nothing, but that it was little in comparison of that greatness of God's rewards. For the Apostle Paul was not really not anything; and yet in comparison of God, \"Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth.\"[fn-68-P6847_2876267:34-nf] And so I say to you, and I say to myself, both to myself and you I say, when we ask in Christ's Name for these temporal things. For ye have asked undoubtedly. For who doth not ask? One asketh for health, if he is sick; another asketh for deliverance, if he is in prison; another asketh for the port, if he is tossed about at sea; another asketh for victory, if he is in conflict with an enemy; and in the Name of Christ he asketh all, and what he asketh is nothing. What then must be asked for? \"Ask in My Name.\"[fn-68-P6848_2876799:35-nf] And He said not what, but by the very words we understand what we ought to ask. \"Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. Ask, and ye shall receive, in My Name.\" But what? Not nothing; but what? \"That your joy may be full;\" that is, ask what may suffice you.

Faustus said: Why do I not believe the prophets? Rather why do you believe them? On account, you will reply, of their prophecies about Christ. For my part, I have read the prophets with the most eager attention, and have found no such prophecies. And surely it shows a weak faith not to believe in Christ without proofs and testimonies. Indeed, you yourselves are accustomed to teach that Christian faith is so simple and absolute as not to admit of laborious investigations. Why, then, should you destroy the simplicity of faith by buttressing it with evidences, and Jewish evidences too? Or if you are changing your opinion about evidences, what more trustworthy witness could you have than God Himself testifying to His own Son when He sent Him on earth,-not by a prophet or an interpreter,-by a voice immediately from heaven: \"This is my beloved Son, believe Him?\"[fn-13-P1378_733640:1-nf] And again He testifies of Himself: \"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world;[fn-13-P1379_733752:2-nf] and in many similar passages. When the Jews quarrelled with this testimony, saying \"Thou bearest witness of thyself, thy witness is not true,\" He replied: \"Although I bear witness of myself, my witness is true. It is written in your law, The witness of two men is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness of me.\"[fn-13-P1380_734128:3-nf] He does not mention the prophets. Again He appeals to the testimony of His own works, saying, \"If ye believe not me, believe the works;\"[fn-13-P1381_734286:4-nf] not, \"If ye believe not me, believe the prophets.\" Accordingly we require no testimonies concerning our Saviour. All we look for in the prophets is prudence and virtue, and a good example, which, you are well aware, are not to be found in the Jewish prophets. This, no doubt, explains your referring me at once to their predictions as a reason for believing them, without a word about their actions. This may be good policy, but it is not in harmony. with the declaration of Scripture, that it is impossible to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles. This may serve meanwhile as a brief and sufficient reply to the question, why we do not believe the prophets. The fact that they did not prophesy of Christ is abundantly proved in the writings of our fathers. I shall only add this, that if the Hebrew prophets knew and preached Christ, and yet lived such vicious lives, what Paul says of the wise men among the Gentiles might be applied to them: \"Though they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, nor were thankful; but they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.\"[fn-13-P1382_735414:5-nf] You see the knowledge of great things is worth little, unless the life corresponds.","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":33,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_25_book_xii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"35","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"32.

With respect to the Holy Spirit, however, there has not been as yet, on the part of learned and distinguished investigators of the Scriptures, a discussion of the subject full enough or careful enough to make it possible for us to obtain an intelligent conception of what also constitutes His special individuality (proprium): in virtue of which special individuality it comes to be the case that we cannot call Him either the Son or the Father, but only the Holy Spirit; excepting that they predicate Him to be the Gift of God, so that we may believe God not to give a gift inferior to Himself. At the same time they hold by this position, namely, to predicate the Holy Spirit neither as begotten, like the Son, of the Father; for Christ is the only one [so begotten]: nor as [begotten] of the Son, like a Grandson of the Supreme Father: while they do not affirm Him to owe that which He is to no one, but [admit Him to owe it] to the Father, of whom are all things; lest we should establish two Beginnings without beginning (ne duo constituamus principia isne principio), which would be an assertion at once most false and most absurd, and one proper not to the catholic faith, but to the error of certain heretics.[fn-32-P3275_1506357:92-nf] Some, however, have gone so far as to believe that the communion of the Father and the Son, and (so to speak) their Godhead (deitatem), which the Greeks designate qeotha, is the Holy Spirit; so that, inasmuch as the Father is God and the Son God, the Godhead itself, in which they are united with each other,-to wit, the former by begetting the Son, and the latter by cleaving to the Father,[fn-32-P3276_1506799:93-nf] -should [thereby] be constituted equal with Him by whom He is begotten. This Godhead, then, which they wish to be understood likewise as the love and charity subsisting between these two [Persons], the one toward the other, they affirm to have received the name of the Holy Spirit. And this opinion of theirs they support by many proofs drawn from the Scriptures; among which we might instance either the passage which says, \"For the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who has been given unto us,\"[fn-32-P3277_1507383:94-nf] or many other proofs texts of a similar tenor: while they ground their position also upon the express fact that it is through the Holy Spirit that we are reconciled unto God; whence also, when He is called the Gift of God, they will have it that sufficient indication is offered of the love of God and the Holy Spirit being identical. For we are not reconciled unto Him except through that love in virtue of which we are also called sons:[fn-32-P3278_1507839:95-nf] as we are no more \"under fear, like servants,\"[fn-32-P3279_1507954:96-nf] because \"love, when it is made perfect, casteth out fear;\"[fn-32-P3280_1508033:97-nf] and [as] \"we have received the spirit of liberty, wherein we cry, Abba, Father.\"[fn-32-P3281_1508134:98-nf] And inasmuch as, being reconciled and called back into friendship through love, we shall be able to become acquainted with all the secret things of God, for this reason it is said of the Holy Spirit that \"He shall lead you into all truth.\"[fn-32-P3282_1508394:99-nf] For the same reason also, that confidence in preaching the truth, with which the apostles were filled at His advent,[fn-32-P3283_1508531:100-nf] is rightly ascribed to love; because diffidence also is assigned to fear, which the perfecting of love excludes. Thus, likewise, the same is called the Gift of God,[fn-32-P3284_1508715:101-nf] because no one enjoys that which he knows, unless he also love it. To enjoy the Wisdom of God, however, implies nothing else than to cleave to the same in love (ei dilectione cohaerere). Neither does any one abide in that which he apprehends, but by love; and accordingly the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of sanctity (Spiritus Sanctus), inasmuch as all things that are sanctioned (sanciuntur)[fn-32-P3285_1509135:102-nf] are sanctioned with a view to their permanence, and there is no doubt that the term sanctity (sanctitatem) is derived from sanction (a sanciendo). Above all, however, that testimony is employed by the upholders of this opinion, where it is thus written, \"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;\"[fn-32-P3286_1509634:103-nf] \"for God is a Spirit.\"[fn-32-P3287_1509677:104-nf] For here He speaks of our regeneration,[fn-32-P3288_1509737:105-nf] which is not, according to Adam, of the flesh, but, according to Christ, of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, if in this passage mention is made of the Holy Spirit, when it is said, \"For God is a Spirit,\" they maintain that we must take note that it is not said, \"for the Spirit is God,\"[fn-32-P3289_1510223:106-nf] but, \"for God is a Spirit;\" so that the very Godhead of the Father and the Son is in this passage called God, and that is the Holy Spirit. To this is added another testimony which the Apostle John offers, when he says, \"For God is love.\"[fn-32-P3290_1510571:107-nf] For here, in like manner, what he says is not, \"Love is God,\"[fn-32-P3291_1510655:108-nf] but, \"God is love;\" so that the very Godhead is taken to be love. And with respect to the circumstance that, in that enumeration of mutually connected objects which is given when it is said, \"All things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's,\"[fn-32-P3292_1511009:109-nf] as also, \"The head of the woman is the man, the Head of the man is Christ, and the Head of Christ is God,\"[fn-32-P3293_1511143:110-nf] there is no mention of the Holy Spirit; this they affirm to be but an application of the principle that, in general, the connection itself is not wont to be enumerated among the things which are connected with each other. Whence, also, those who read with closer attention appear to recognize the express Trinity likewise in that passage in which it is said, \"For of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things.\"[fn-32-P3294_1511582:111-nf] \"Of Him,\" as if it meant, of that One who owes it to no one that He is: \"through Him,\" as if the idea were, through a Mediator; \"in Him,\" as if it were, in that One who holds together, that is, unites by connecting.","title":"Introductory Notice.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf2_03_npnf2_03_23_letters_of_the_blessed_theodoret_bishop_of_cyrus","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"291","folder":"NPNF2-03","text":"Many are the devices secretly plotted against me, and through me patched up against the faith of apostles.

I was anxious to adduce their opinions, and to point out how they bear witness in favour of my own, but I want more words than a letter allows room for, wherefore I have written summarily what I have been taught about the incarnation of the only begotten; I send my statement to your godly excellency.[fn-59-P5974_1482225:244-nf] I bare written not with the object of teaching others, but of making my defence against the accusations brought against me, and of explaining my sentiments to those who are ignorant of them. After your holiness has read what I have written, if you find it in conformity with the apostolic doctrines, I hope you trill confirm my opinion by what you reply-if, on the contrary, anything that I have said jars with the divine teaching, I request to be told of it by your holiness. For, though I have spent much time in teaching, I still need one to teach me. \"We know,\" says the divine Apostle \"in part,\"[fn-59-P5975_1482879:245-nf] and again he says, \"If any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.\"[fn-59-P5976_1483010:246-nf] So I hope that I may hear the truth from your holiness, and that you may also give heed to the calm of the Church, and fight for the divine doctrines.

For he wishes to show that the essence of the Son is subject to passion, and to decay, and in no wise differs from material nature, which is in a state of flux, that by this means he may demonstrate His difference from the Father. For he says, \"If he can show that the God Who is over all, Who is the Light unapproachable, was incarnate or could be incarnate, came under authority, obeyed commands, came under the laws of men, bore the Cross, let him say that the Light is equal to the Light.\" If these words had been brought forward by us as following by necessary consequence from premises laid down by Eunomius, who would not have charged us with unfairness, in employing an over-subtle dialectic to reduce our adversaries' statement to such an absurdity? But as things stand, the fact that they themselves make no attempt to suppress the absurdity that naturally follows from their assumption, helps to support our contention that it was not without due reflection that, with the help of truth, we censured life argument of heresy. For behold, how undisguised and outspoken is their striving against the Only-begotten God! Nay, by His enemies His work of mercy is reckoned a means of disparaging and maligning the Nature of the Son of God, as though not of deliberate purpose, but by a compulsion of His Nature he had slipped down to life in the flesh, and to the suffering of the Cross! And as it is the nature of a stone to fall downward, and of fire to rise upward, and as these material objects do not exchange their natures one with another, so that the stone should have an upward tendency, and fire be depressed by its weight and sink downwards, even so they make out that passion was part of the very Nature of the Son, and that for this cause He came to that which was akin and familiar to Him, but that the Nature of the Father, being free from such passions, remained unapproachable by the contact of evil. For he says, that the God Who is over all, Who is Light unapproachable, neither was incarnate nor could be incarnate. The first of the two statements was quite enough, that the Father did not become incarnate. But now by his addition a double absurdity arises; for he either charges the Son with evil, or the Father with powerlessness. For if to partake of our flesh is evil, then he predicates evil of the Only-begotten God; but if the lovingkindness to man was good, then he makes out the Father to be powerless for good, by saying that it would not have been in His power to have effectually bestowed such grace by taking flesh. And yet who in the world does not know that life-giving power proceeds to actual operation both in the Father and in the Son? \"For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them,\" He says, \"even so the Son quickeneth whom He will[fn-21-P2125_1289217:32-nf] ,\"-meaning obviously by \"dead\" us who had fallen from the true life. If then it is even so as the Father quickeneth, and not otherwise, that the Son brings to operation the same grace, how comes it that the adversary of God moves his profane tongue against both, insulting the Father by attributing to Him powerlessness for good, and the Son by attributing to Him association with evil. But \"Light,\" he says, \"is not equal to Light,\" because the one he calls \"true,\" and the other \"unapproachable.\" Is then the true considered to be a diminution of the unapproachable? Why so? and yet their argument is that the Godhead of the Father must be conceived to be greater and more exalted than that of the Son, because the one is called in the Gospel \"true God[fn-21-P2126_1289992:33-nf] ,\" the other \"God[fn-21-P2127_1290032:34-nf] \" without the addition of \"true.\" How then does the same term, as applied to the Godhead, indicate an enhancement of the conception, and, as applied to Light, a diminution? For if they say that the Father is greater than the Son because He is true God, by the same showing the Son would be acknowledged to be greater than the Father, because the former is called \"true Light[fn-21-P2128_1290426:35-nf] ,\" and the latter not so. \"But this Light,\" says Eunomius, \"carried into effect the plan of mercy, while the other remained inoperative with respect to that gracious action.\" A new and strange mode of determining priority in dignity! They judge that which is ineffective for a benevolent purpose to be superior to that which is operative. But such a notion as this neither exists nor ever will be found amongst Christians,-a notion by which it is made out that every good that is in existent things has not its origin from the Father. But of goods that pertain to us men, the crowning blessing is held by all right-minded men to be the return to life; and it is secured by the dispensation carried out by the Lord in His human nature; not that the Father remained aloof, as heresy will have it, ineffective and inoperative during the time of this dispensation. For it is not this that He indicates Who said, \"He that sent Me is with Me[fn-21-P2129_1291381:36-nf] ,\" and \"The Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works[fn-21-P2130_1291482:37-nf] .\" With what right then does heresy attribute to the Son alone the gracious intervention on our behalf, and thereby exclude the Father from having any part or lot in our gratitude for its successful issue? For naturally the requital of thanks is due to our benefactors alone, and He Who is incapable of benefiting us is outside the pale of our gratitude. See you how the course of their profane attack upon the Only-begotten Son has missed its mark, and is working round in natural consequence so as to be directed against the majesty of the Father? And this seems to me to be a necessary result of their method of proceeding. For if he that honoureth the Son honoureth the Father[fn-21-P2131_1292185:38-nf] , according to the Divine declaration, it is plain on the other side that an assault upon the Son strikes at the Father. But I say that to those who with simplicity of heart receive the preaching of the Cross and the resurrection, the same grace should be a cause of equal thankfulness to the Son and to the Father, and now that the Son has accomplished the Father's will (and this, in the language of the Apostle, is \"that all men should be saved[fn-21-P2132_1292657:39-nf] \"), they ought for this boon to honour the Father and the Son alike, inasmuch as our salvation would not have been wrought, had not the good will of the Father proceeded to actual operation for us through His own power. And we have learnt from the Scripture that the Son is the learnt of the Father[fn-21-P2133_1292975:40-nf] .","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":16,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_119_treatise_ix_on_the_advantage_of_patience_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"15","folder":"ANF-05","text":"12.

Consequently, it will tarry thus until He comes. At present it will tarry in the faith of believers, but hereafter it will be possible to contemplate it face to face,[fn-28-P2859_1264453:81-nf] when He, our Life, shall appear, and when we shall appear with Him in glory.[fn-28-P2860_1264548:82-nf] But if any one supposes that with man, living, as he still does, in this mortal life, it may be possible for a person to dispel and clear off every obscurity induced by corporeal and carnal fancies, and to attain to the serenest light of changeless truth, and to cleave constantly and unswervingly to that with a mind thoroughly estranged from the course of this present life, that man understands neither what he asks, nor who he is that put such a supposition. Let such an individual rather accept the authority, at once lofty and free from all deceitfulness, which tells us that, as long as we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord, and that we walk by faith find not by sight? And thus, with all perseverance keeping and guarding his faith and hope and charity, let him look forward to the sight which is promised, in accordance with that earnest which we have received of the Holy Ghost, who shall teach us all truth,[fn-28-P2861_1265499:83-nf] when God, who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall also quicken our mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in us.[fn-28-P2862_1265642:84-nf] But before this body, which is dead by reason of sin, is quickened, it is without doubt corruptible, and presseth down the soul.[fn-28-P2863_1265795:85-nf] And if, in the body, man is ever helped to reach beyond the cloud with which the whole earth is covered,[fn-28-P2864_1265927:86-nf] -that is to say, beyond this carnal darkness with which the whole life of earth is covered,-it is simply as if he were touched with a rapid coruscation, only to sink swiftly into his natural infirmity, the desire surviving by which he may again be excited (to what is evil), and the purity being insufficient to establish him (in what is good). The more, however, any one can do this, the greater is he; while the less he can do so, the less is he. And if the mind of a man has as yet had no such experience-in which mind nevertheless Christ dwells by faith-he ought to strive earnestly to diminish the lusts of this world, and to make an end of them by the exercise of moral virtue, walking, as it were, in the company of these three evangelists with Christ the Mediator. And, with the joy of large hope, let him in faith hold Him who is alway the Son of God, but who, for our sakes, became the Son of man, in order that His eternal power and Godhead might be united with[fn-28-P2865_1266922:87-nf] our weakness and mortality, and, on the basis of what is ours, make a way for us in Himself and to Himself. That a man may be kept from sinning, he should be ruled by Christ the King. If he happens to sin, he may obtain remission from Christ, who is also priest. And thus, nurtured in the exercise of a good conversation and life, and borne out of the atmosphere of earth on the wings of a twofold love, as on a pair of strong pinions, so may he be enlightened by the same Christ, who is also the Word, the Word who was in the beginning, the Word who was with God, and the Word who was God; and although that will still be through a glass darkly, it will be a sublime kind of illumination far superior to every corporeal similitude. Wherefore, although it is the gifts of the active virtue that shine pre-eminent in the first three evangelists, while it is the gift of the contemplative virtue that discerns such subjects, nevertheless, this Gospel of John, in so far as it also is in part, will so tarry until that which is perfect comes.[fn-28-P2866_1267998:88-nf] And to one, indeed, is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit.[fn-28-P2867_1268143:89-nf] One man regardeth the day to the Lord;[fn-28-P2868_1268202:90-nf] another receives a clearer draught from the breast of the Lord; another is caught up even to the third heaven, and hears unspeakable words.[fn-28-P2869_1268360:91-nf] But all, as long as they are in the body, are absent from the Lord.[fn-28-P2870_1268450:92-nf] And for all believers living in the good hope, whose names are written in the book of life, there is still in reserve that which is referred to in the words, \"And I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him.\"[fn-28-P2871_1268684:93-nf] Nevertheless, the greater the advance which a man may make in the apprehension and knowledge of this theme during the time of this absence from the Lord, all the more carefully should he guard against those devilish vices, pride and envy. Let him remember that this very Gospel of John, which urges us so pre-eminently to the contemplation of truth, gives a no less remarkable prominence to the inculcation of the sweet grace of charity. Let him also consider that most true and wholesome precept which is couched in the words, \"The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all.\"[fn-28-P2872_1269287:94-nf] For the evangelist who presents Christ to us in a far loftier strain of teaching than all the others, is also the one in whose narrative the Lord washes the disciples' feet.[fn-28-P2873_1269483:95-nf] ","title":"Book IV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_121_treatise_xi_exhortation_to_martyrdom_addressed_to_fortunatus_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"45","folder":"ANF-05","text":"The Lord in the Gospel forewarns and foretells, saying: \"If the world hates you, know that it first hated me.

But woe to them that are pregnant, and to those that are giving suck in those days!

Thus, at the very beginning of the world, the righteous Abel was the first to be shin by his brother; and Jacob was driven into exile, and Joseph was sold, and king Saul persecuted the merciful David; and king Ahab endeavoured to oppress Elias, who firmly and bravely asserted the majesty of God. Zacharias the priest was slain between the temple and the altar, that himself might there become a sacrifice where he was accustomed to offer sacrifices to God. So many martyrdoms of the righteous have, in fact, often been celebrated; so many examples of faith and virtue have been set forth to future generations. The three youths, Ananias, Azarias, and Misäel, equal in age, agreeing in love, stedfast in faith, constant in virtue, stronger than the flames and penalties that urged them, proclaim that they only obey God, that they know Him alone, that they worship Him alone, saying: \"O king Nebuchodonosor, there is no need for us to answer thee in this matter. For the God whom we serve is able to deliver us out of the furnace of burning fire; and He will deliver us from thy hands, O king.

Hear how. He hath told us Himself, and foretold it before He was made a spectacle, and in the words of prophecy announced beforehand what was to come to pass, as if it were already done, saying in the Psalms, \"They pierced My hands and My feet, they told all My bones.\"[fn-29-P2900_1278129:5-nf] Lo! how He was made a spectacle, for His bones to be told! and this spectacle He expresseth more plainly, \"they observed and looked upon Me.\" He was made a spectacle and an object of derision, made a spectacle by them who were to show Him no favour indeed in that spectacle, but who were to be furious against Him, just as at first He made His martyrs spectacles; as saith the Apostle, \"We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\"[fn-29-P2901_1278605:6-nf] Now two sorts of men are spectators of such spectacles; the one, carnal, the other, spiritual men.

A grand spectacle to the eyes of the heart doth a whole mind in a mangled body exhibit! When these things are read of in the church, you behold them with pleasure with these eyes of the heart, for if you were to behold nothing, you would hear nothing; so you see you have not neglected the spectacles to-day, but have made a choice of spectacles. May God then be with you, and give you grace with gentle persuasiveness to report your spectacles to your friends, whom you have been pained to see this day running to the amphitheatre, and unwilling to come to the church; that so they too may begin to contemn those things, by the love of which themselves have become contemptible, and may, with you, love God, of whom none who love Him can ever be ashamed, for that they love Him who cannot be overcome: let them, as you do, love Christ, who by that very thing wherein He seemed to be overcome, overcame the whole world. For He hath overcome the whole world as we see, my brethren; He hath subjected all powers, He hath subjugated kings, not with the pride of soldiery, but by the ignominy of the Cross: not bythe fury of the sword, but by hanging on the Wood, by suffering in the body, by working in the Spirit.[fn-29-P2902_1280238:7-nf] His body was lifted up on the Cross, and so He subdued souls to the Cross; and now what jewel in their diadem is more precious than the Cross of Christ on the foreheads of kings?

For so would they be enslaved to the vain joy, to the exultation of a depraved desire, who are conquered by the very circumstance of running to these shows.

But in all our doings, even good men are very greatly embarrassed in the mater of compensative sins; so that these are not esteemed to be sins, if they have such causes for the which they be done, and in the which it may seem to be rather sin, if they be left undone. And chiefly as concerning lies hath it come to this pass in the opinion of men that those lies are not accounted sins, nay rather are believed to be rightly done, when one tells a lie for the benefit of him for whom it is expedient to be deceived, or lest a person should hurt others, who seems likely to hurt unless he be got rid of by lies. In defense of these kinds of lies, very many examples from holy Scripture are accounted to lend their support. It is not, however, the same thing to hide the truth as it is to utter a lie. For although every one who lies wishes to hide what is true, yet not every one who wishes to hide what is true, tells a lie. For in general we hide truths not by telling a lie, but by holding our peace. For the Lord lied not when He said, \"I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\"[fn-44-P4438_2166712:32-nf] He held His peace from true things, not spoke false things; for the hearing of which truths He judged them to be less fit.

Whence, they who assert that it is sometimes meet to lie, do not conveniently mention that Abraham did this concerning Sarah, whom he said to be his sister.

Which also afterwards he confirmed, after she had been given back by him who had taken her, answering him and saying, \"And indeed she is my sister, by father, not by mother;\" thatis, by the father's kindred, not the mother's.

This also did his son Isaac: for him too we know to have gotten a wife near of kin.[fn-44-P4440_2167921:34-nf] It is not then a lie, when by silence a true thing is kept back, but when by speech a false thing is put forward.","title":"Against Lying.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_38_book_ii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"ANF-10","text":"We have thus enquired as to the life of God, and the life which is Christ, and the living who are in a place by themselves, and have seen how the living are not justified before God, and we have noticed the cognate statement, \"Who alone hath immortality .\" We may now take up the assumption which may appear to be involved in this, namely, that whatever being is gifted with reason does not possess blessedness as a part of its essence, or as an inseparable part of its nature. For if blessedness and the highest life were an inseparable characteristic of reasonable being, how could it be truly said of God that He only has immortality? We should therefore remark, that the Saviour is some things, not to Himself but to others, and some things both to Himself and others, and we must enquire if there are some things which He is to Himself and to no other. Clearly it is to others that He is a Shepherd, not a shepherd like those among men who make gain out of their occupation; unless the benefit conferred on the sheep might be regarded, on account of His love to men, as a benefit to Himself also. Similarly it is to others that He is the Way and the Door, and, as all will admit, the Rod. To Himself and to others He is Wisdom and perhaps also Reason (Loges). It may be asked whether, as He has in Himself a system of speculations, inasmuch as He is wisdom, there are some of those speculations which cannot be received by any nature that is begotten, but His own, and which He knows for Himself only. Nor should the reverence we owe to the Holy Spirit keep us from seeking to answer this question. For the Holy Spirit Himself receives instruction, as is clear from what is said about the Paraclete and the Holy Spirit,[fn-65-P6510_1105644:52-nf] \"He shall take of mine and shall declare it to you.\" Does He, then, from these instructions, take in everything that the Son, gazing at the Father from the first, Himself knows? That would require further consideration. And if the Saviour is some things to others, and some things it may be to Himself, and to no other, or to one only, or to few, then we ask, in so far as He is the life which came in the Loges, whether he is life to Himself and to others, or to others, and if to others, to what others. And are life and the light of men the same thing, for the text says, \"That which was made was life in Him and the life was the light of men.\" But the light of men is the light only of some, not of all, rational creatures; the word \"men\" which is added shows this. But He is the light of men, and so He is the life of those whose light he is also. And inasmuch as He is life He may be called the Saviour, not for Himself but to be life to others, whose light also He is.

Let us look also at what follows. What says the most divine evangelist? When the Lord had entered into the temple, the blind and the lame came to Him; and He healed them.

Wherefore He says, Have ye never heard Me saying by the prophet, Then shall ye know that I am He that doth speak?[fn-62-P6211_1910004:56-nf] nor again, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou perfected praise because of Thine enemies, that Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger?

If ye had known me, ye would have known the Father also: but henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.\"[fn-107-P10775_3023721:326-nf] And now we come to Philip, who, roused with the expectation of seeing the Father, and not understanding in what sense he was to take \"seeing the Father,\" says: \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\"[fn-107-P10776_3023946:327-nf] Then the Lord answered him: \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? \"[fn-107-P10777_3024067:328-nf] Now whom does He say that they ought to have known?-for this is the sole point of discussion. Was it as the Father that they ought to have known Him, or as the Son? If it was as the Father, Praxeas must tell us how Christ, who had been so long time with them, could have possibly ever been (I will not say understood, but even) supposed to have been the Father. He is clearly defined to us in all Scriptures-in the Old Testament as the Christ of God, in the New Testament as the Son of God. In this character was He anciently predicted, in this was He also declared even by Christ Himself; nay, by the very Father also, who openly confesses Him from heaven as His Son, and as His Son glorifies Him. \"This is my beloved Son; \"\"I have glorified Him, and I will glorify Him.\" In this character, too, was He believed on by His disciples, and rejected by the Jews. It was, moreover, in this character that He wished to be accepted by them whenever He named the Father, and gave preference to the Father, and honoured the Father. This, then, being the case, it was not the Father whom, after His lengthened intercourse with them, they were ignorant of, but it was the Son; and accordingly the Lord, while upbraiding Philip for not knowing Himself who was the object of their ignorance, wished Himself to be acknowledged indeed as that Being whom He had reproached them for being ignorant of after so long a time-in a word, as the Son. And now it may be seen in what sense it was said, \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father,\"[fn-107-P10778_3025606:329-nf] -even in the same in which it was said in a previous passage, \"I and my Father are one.\"[fn-107-P10779_3025715:330-nf] Wherefore? Because \"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world\"[fn-107-P10780_3025812:331-nf] and, \"I am the way: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me; \"[fn-107-P10781_3025897:332-nf] and, \"No man can come to me, except the Father draw him; \"[fn-107-P10782_3025976:333-nf] and, \"All things are delivered unto me by the Father; \"[fn-107-P10783_3026052:334-nf] and, \"As the Father quickeneth (the dead), so also doth the Son; \"[fn-107-P10784_3026140:335-nf] and again, \"If ye had known me, ye would have known the Father also.\"[fn-107-P10785_3026229:336-nf] For in all these passages He had shown Himself to be the Father's Commissioner,[fn-107-P10786_3026329:337-nf] through whose agency even the Father could be seen in His works, and heard in His words, and recognised in the Son's administration of the Father's words and deeds. The Father indeed was invisible, as Philip had learnt in the law, and ought at the moment to have remembered: \"No man shall see God, and live.\"[fn-107-P10787_3026655:338-nf] So he is reproved for desiring to see the Father, as if He were a visible Being, and is taught that He only becomes visible in the Son from His mighty works, and not in the manifestation of His person. If, indeed, He meant the Father to be understood as the same with the Son, by saying, \"He who seeth me seeth the Father,\" how is it that He adds immediately afterwards, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? \"[fn-107-P10788_3027118:339-nf] He ought rather to have said: \"Believest thou not that I am the Father? \"With what view else did He so emphatically dwell on this point, if it Were not to clear up that which He wished men to understand-namely, that He was the Son? And then, again, by saying, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me,\"[fn-107-P10789_3027467:340-nf] He laid the greater stress on His question on this very account, that He should not, because He had said, \"He that hath seen me, hath seen the Father,\" be supposed to be the Father; because He had never wished Himself to be so regarded, having always professed Himself to be the Son, and to have come from the Father. And then He also set the conjunction of the two Persons in the clearest light, in order that no wish might be entertained of seeing the Father as if He were separately visible, and that the Son might be regarded as the representative of the Father. And yet He omitted not to explain how the Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. \"The words,\" says He, \"which I speak unto you, are not mine,\"[fn-107-P10790_3028208:341-nf] because indeed they were the Father's words; \"but the Father that dwelleth in me, He doeth the works.\"[fn-107-P10791_3028332:342-nf] It is therefore by His mighty works, and by the words of His doctrine, that the Father who dwells in the Son makes Himself visible-even by those words and works whereby He abides in Him, and also by Him in whom He abides; the special properties of Both the Persons being apparent from this very circumstance, that He says, \"I am in the Father, and the Father is in me.\"[fn-107-P10792_3028719:343-nf] Accordingly He adds: \"Believe-\" What? That I am the Father? I do not find that it is so written, but rather, \"that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for my works' sake; \"[fn-107-P10793_3028934:344-nf] meaning those works by which the Father manifested Himself to be in the Son, not indeed to the sight of man, but to his intelligence.","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":27,"source_paragraph":"86","folder":"ANF-03","text":"What follows Philip's question, and the Lord's whole treatment of it, to the end of John's Gospel, continues to furnish us with statements of the same kind, distinguishing the Father and the Son, with the properties of each.

Run through the whole Gospel, and you will find that He whom you believe to be the Father (described as acting for the Father, although you, for your part, forsooth, suppose that \"the Father, being the husbandman,\"[fn-108-P10803_3030538:351-nf] must surely have been on earth) is once more recognised by the Son as in heaven, when, \"lifting up His eyes thereto,\"[fn-108-P10804_3030675:352-nf] He commended His disciples to the safe-keeping of the Father.[fn-108-P10805_3030758:353-nf] We have, moreover, in that other Gospel a clear revelation, i.e. of the Son's distinction from the Father, \"My God, why hast Thou forsaken me? \"[fn-108-P10806_3030925:354-nf] and again, (in the third Gospel, ) \"Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.\"[fn-108-P10807_3031030:355-nf] But even if (we had not these passages, we meet with satisfactory evidence) after His resurrection and glorious victory over death. Now that all the restraint of His humiliation is taken away, He might, if possible, have shown Himself as the Father to so faithful a woman (as Mary Magdalene) when she approached to touch Him, out of love, not from curiosity, nor with Thomas' incredulity. But not so; Jesus saith unto her, \"Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren\" (and even in this He proves Himself to be the Son; for if He had been the Father, He would have called them His children, (instead of His brethren), \"and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.\"[fn-108-P10808_3031793:356-nf] Now, does this mean, I ascend as the Father to the Father, and as God to God? Or as the Son to the Father, and as the Word to God? Wherefore also does this Gospel, at its very termination, intimate that these things were ever written, if it be not, to use its own words, \"that ye might believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God? \"[fn-108-P10809_3032146:357-nf] Whenever, therefore, you take any of the statements of this Gospel, and apply them to demonstrate the identity of the Father and the Son, supposing that they serve your views therein, you are contending against the definite purpose of the Gospel. For these things certainly are not written that you may believe that Jesus Christ is the Father, but the Son.[fn-108-P10810_3032523:358-nf] ","title":"Against Praxeas","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":13,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_43_against_praxeas","source_chapter":32,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"ANF-03","text":"However, if you persist in pushing your views further, I shall find means of answering you with greater stringency, and of meeting you with the exclamation of the Lord Himself, so as to challenge you with the question, What is your inquiry and reasoning about that?

But this was the voice of flesh and soul, that is to say, of man-not of the Word and Spirit, that is to say, not of God; and it was uttered so as to prove the impassibility of God, who \"forsook\" His Son, so far as He handed over His human substance to the suffering of death. This verity the apostle also perceived, when he writes to this effect: \"If the Father spa. red not His own Son.\"[fn-108-P10888_3059054:421-nf] This did Isaiah before him likewise perceive, when he declared: \"And the Lord hath delivered Him up for our offences.\"[fn-108-P10889_3059195:422-nf] In this manner He \"forsook\" Him, in not sparing Him; \"forsook\" Him, in delivering Him up.

But, she proceeded, the truth does not lie in these arguments, even though we may find it impossible to give a rhetorical answer to them, couched in equally strong language. The true explanation of all these questions is still stored up in the hidden treasure-rooms of Wisdom, and will not come to the light until that moment when we shall be taught the mystery of the Resurrection by the reality of it; and then there will be no more need of phrases to explain the things which we now hope for. Just as many questions might be started for debate amongst people sitting up at night as to the kind of thing that sunshine is, and then the simple appearing of it in all its beauty would render any verbal description superfluous, so every calculation that tries to arrive conjecturally at the future state will be reduced to nothingness by the object of our hopes, when it comes upon us. But since it is our duty not toleave the arguments brought against us in any way unexamined, we will expound the truth as to these points as follows. First let us get a clear notion as to the scope of this doctrine; in other words, what is the end that Holy Scripture has in view in promulgating it and creating the belief in it. Well, to sketch the outline of so vast a truth and to embrace it in a definition, we will say that the Resurrection is \"the reconstitution of our nature in its original form[fn-37-P3775_2465779:173-nf] .\" But in that form of life, of which God Himself was the Creator, it is reasonable to believe that there was neither age nor infancy nor any of the sufferings arising from our present various infirmities, nor any kind of bodily affliction whatever. It is reasonable, I say, to believe that God was the Creator of none of these things, but that man was a thing divine before his humanity got within reach of the assault of evil; that then, however, with the inroad of evil, all these afflictions also broke in upon him. Accordingly a life that is free from evil is under no necessity whatever of being passed amidst the things that result from evil. It follows that when a man travels through ice he must get his body chilled; or when he walks in a very hot sun that he must get his skin darkened; but if he has kept clear of the one or the other, he escapes these results entirely, both the darkening and the chilling; no one, in fact, when a particular cause was removed, would be justified in looking for the effect of that particular cause. Just so our nature, becoming passional, had to encounter all the necessary results of a life of passion: but when it shall have started back to that state of passionless blessedness, it will no longer encounter the inevitable results of evil tendencies. Seeing, then, that all the infusions of the life of the brute into our nature were not in us before our humanity descended through the touch of evil into passions, most certainly, when we abandon those passions, we shall abandon all their visible results. No one, therefore, will be justified in seeking in that other life for the consequences in us of any passion. Just as if a man, who, clad in a ragged tunic, has divested himself of the garb, feels no more its disgrace upon him, so we too, when we have cast off that dead unsightly tunic made from the skins of brutes and put upon us (for I take the \"coats of skins\" to mean that conformation belonging to a brute nature with which we were clothed when we became familiar with passionate indulgence), shall, along with the casting off of that tunic, fling from us all the belongings that were round us of that skin of a brute; and such accretions are sexual intercourse, conception, parturition, impurities, suckling, feeding, evacuation, gradual growth to full size, prime of life, old age, disease, and death. If that skin is no longer round us, how can its resulting consequences be left behind within us? It is folly, then, when we are to expect a different state of things in the life to come, to object to the doctrine of the Resurrection on the ground of something that has nothing to do with it. I mean, what has thinness or corpulence, a state of consumption or of plethora, or any other condition supervening in a nature that is ever in a flux, to do with the other life, stranger as it is to any fleeting and transitory passing such as that? One thing, and one thing only, is required for the operation of the Resurrection; viz. that a man should have lived, by being born; or, to use rather the Gospel words, that \"a man should be born[fn-37-P3776_2469197:174-nf] into the world\"; the length or briefness of the life, the manner, this or that, of the death, is an irrelevant subject of inquiry in connection with that operation. Whatever instance we take, howsoever we suppose this to have been, it is all the same; from these differences in life there arises no difficulty, any more than any facility, with regard to the Resurrection. He who has once begun to live must necessarily go on having once lived[fn-37-P3777_2469674:175-nf] , after his intervening dissolution in death has been repaired in the Resurrection.

My Hebrew master also used to say that those two seraphim in Isaiah, which are described as having each six wings, and calling to one another, and saying, \"Holy, holy, holy, is the Loan God of hosts,\"[fn-63-P6346_1161197:68-nf] were to be understood of the only-begotten Son of God and of the Holy Spirit.

For all knowledge of the Father is obtained by revelation of the Son through the Holy Spirit, so that both of these beings which, according to the prophet, are called either \"living things\" or \"lives,\" exist as the ground of the knowledge of God the Father. For as it is said of the Son, that \"no one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him,\"[fn-63-P6348_1161907:70-nf] the same also is said by the apostle of the Holy Spirit, when He declares, \"God hath revealed them to us by His Holy Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of God; \"[fn-63-P6349_1162117:71-nf] and again in the Gospel, when the Saviour, speaking of the divine and profounder parts of His teaching, which His disciples were not yet able to receive, thus addresses them: \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now; but when the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, is come, He will teach you all things, and will bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\"[fn-63-P6350_1162543:72-nf] We must understand, therefore, that as the Son, who alone knows the Father, reveals Him to whom He will, so the Holy Spirit, who alone searches the deep things of God, reveals God to whom He will: \"For the Spirit bloweth where He listeth.\"[fn-63-P6351_1162823:73-nf] We are not, however, to suppose that the Spirit derives His knowledge through revelation from the Son. For if the Holy Spirit knows the Father through the Son's revelation, He passes from a state of ignorance into one of knowledge; but it is alike impious and foolish to confess the Holy Spirit, and yet to ascribe to Him ignorance. For even although something else existed before the Holy Spirit, it was not by progressive advancement that He came to be the Holy Spirit; as if any one should venture to say, that at the time when He was not yet the Holy Spirit He was ignorant of the Father, but that after He had received knowledge He was made the Holy Spirit. For if this were the case, the Holy Spirit would never be reckoned in the Unity of the Trinity, i.e., along with the unchangeable Father and His Son, unless He had always been the Holy Spirit. When we use, indeed, such terms as \"always\" or \"was,\" or any other designation of time, they are not to be taken absolutely, but with due allowance; for while the significations of these words relate to time, and those subjects of which we speak are spoken of by a stretch of language as existing in time, they nevertheless surpass in their real nature all conception of the finite understanding.","title":"Book I.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":16,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_43_the_first_book_","source_chapter":36,"source_paragraph":"115","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Let us, then, understand the calling whereby they become elected,-not those who are elected because they have believed, but who are elected that they may believe.

But He takes away this supposition altogether when He says \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.\" And yet they themselves, beyond a doubt, chose Him when they believed on Him. Whence it is not for any other reason that He says, \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,\" than because they did not choose Him that He should choose them, but He chose them that they might choose Him; because His mercy preceded them according to grace, not according to debt. Therefore He chose them out of the word while He was wearing flesh, but as those who were already chosen in Himself before the foundation of the world. This is the changeless truth concerning predestination and grace. For what is it that the apostle says, \"As He hath chosen us in Himself before the foundation of the world\"?[fn-68-P6870_2627232:114-nf] And assuredly, if this were said because God foreknew that they would believe, not because He Himself would make them believers, the Son is speaking against such a foreknowledge as that when He says, \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you;\" when God should rather have foreknown this very thing, that they themselves would have chosen Him, so that they might deserve to be chosen by Him. Therefore they were elected before the foundation of the world with that predestination in which God foreknew what He Himself would do; but they were elected out of the world with that calling whereby God fulfilled that which He predestinated. For whom He predestinated, them He also called, with that calling, to wit, which is according to the purpose. Not others, therefore, but those whom He predestinated, them He also called; nor other, but those whom He so called, them He also justified; nor others, but those whom He predestinated, called, and justified, them He also glorified; assuredly to that end which has no end. Therefore God elected believers; but He chose them that they might be so, not because they were already so. The Apostle James says: \"Has not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love Him?\"[fn-68-P6871_2628536:115-nf] By choosing them, makes them heirs of the kingdom; because He is rightly said to choose that in them, in order to make which in them He chose them. I ask, who can hear the Lord saying, \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,\" and can dare to say that men believe in order to be elected, when they are rather elected to believe; lest against the judgment of truth they be found to have first chosen Christ to whom Christ says, \"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen 'you\"?[fn-68-P6872_2629037:116-nf] ","title":"The First Book.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":33,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-04","text":"5. We are not, however, to suppose that each individual has to contend against all these (adversaries). For it is impossible for any man, although he were a saint, to carry on a contest against all of them at the same time. If that indeed were by any means to be the case, as it is certainly impossible it should be so, human nature could not possibly bear it without undergoing entire destruction.[fn-71-P7154_1578414:302-nf] But as, for example, if fifty soldiers were to say that they were about to engage with fifty others, they would not be understood to mean that one of them had to contend against the whole fifty, but each one would rightly say that \"our battle was against fifty,\" all against all; so also this is to be understood as the apostle's meaning, that all the athletes and soldiers of Christ have to wrestle and struggle against all the adversaries enumerated,-the struggle having, indeed, to be maintained against all, but by single individuals either with individual powers, or at least in such manner as shall be determined by God, who is the just president of the struggle. For I am of opinion that there is a certain limit to the powers of human nature, although there may be a Paul, of whom it is said, \"He is a chosen vessel unto Me; \"[fn-71-P7155_1579286:303-nf] or a Peter, against whom the gates of hell do not prevail; or a Moses, the friend of God: yet not one of them could sustain, without destruction to himself,[fn-71-P7156_1579463:304-nf] the whole simultaneous assault of these opposing powers, unless indeed the might of Him alone were to work in him, who said, \"Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\"[fn-71-P7157_1579668:305-nf] And therefore Paul exclaims with confidence, \"I can do all things through Christ, who strengtheneth me; \"[fn-71-P7158_1579795:306-nf] and again, \"I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\"[fn-71-P7159_1579922:307-nf] On account, then, of this power, which certainly is not of human origin operating and speaking in him, Paul could say, \"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor power, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"[fn-71-P7160_1580342:308-nf] For I do not think that human nature can alone of itself maintain a contest with angels, and with the powers of the height and of the abyss,[fn-71-P7161_1580666:309-nf] and with any other creature; but when it feels the presence of the Lord dwelling within it, confidence in the divine help will lead it to say, \"The Lord is my light, and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the enemies draw near to me, to eat my flesh, my enemies who trouble me, they stumbled and fell. Though an host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in Him shall I be confident.\"[fn-71-P7162_1581188:310-nf] From which I infer that a man perhaps would never be able of himself to vanquish an opposing power, unless he had the benefit of divine assistance. Hence, also, the angel is said to have wrestled with Jacob. Here, however, I understand the writer to mean, that it was not the same thing for the angel to have wrestled with Jacob, and to have wrestled against him; but the angel that wrestles with him is he who was present with him in order to secure his safety, who, after knowing also his moral progress, gave him in addition the name of Israel, i.e., he is with him in the struggle, and assists him in the contest; seeing there was undoubtedly another angel against whom he contended, and against whom he had to carry on a contest. Finally, Paul has not said that we wrestle with princes, or with powers, but against principalities and powers. And hence, although Jacob wrestled, it was unquestionably against some one of those powers which, Paul declares, resist and contend with the human race, and especially with the saints. And therefore at last the Scripture says of him that \"he wrestled with the angel, and had power with God,\" so that the struggle is supported by help of the angel, but the prize of success conducts the conqueror to God.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":16,"verse":12,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_44_a_treatise_on_the_gift_of_perseverance_being_the_second_book","source_chapter":42,"source_paragraph":"156","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Therefore let the truth be spoken, especially when any question impels us to declare it; and\nlet them receive it who are able, lest, perchance, while we are silent on account of those who cannot\nreceive it, they be not only defrauded of the truth but be taken captive by falsehood, who are able\nto receive the truth whereby falsehood may be avoided. For it is easy, nay, and it is useful, that\nsome truth should be kept back because of those who are incapable of apprehending it. For whence is\nthat word of our Lord: \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now \"?[fn-71-P7158_2734233:100-nf] And that of the apostle: \"I could not speak unto\nyou as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal: as if unto babes in Christ I have given you to drink milk,\nand not meat, for hitherto ye were not able, neither yet indeed now are ye able\"?[fn-71-P7159_2734487:101-nf] Although, in a certain manner of speaking, it\nmight happen that what is said should be both milk to infants and meat for grown-up persons.

But the\nreason of keeping back the truth is one, the necessity of speaking the truth is another. It would be\na tedious business to inquire into or to put down all the reasons for keeping back the truth; of\nwhich, nevertheless, there is this one,-lest we should make those who do not understand worse, while\nwishing to make those who do understand more learned; although these latter do not become more\nlearned when we withhold any such thing on the one hand, but also do not become worse. When, however,\na truth is of such a nature that he who cannot receive it is made worse by our speaking it, and he\nwho can receive it is made worse by our silence concerning it, what do we think is tobe done?

Whether the prophets predicted the coming of Jesus we shall see presently. Meanwhile, I need say no more than that if Jesus, after being predicted in the Old Testament, now subjects it to this sweeping criticism, and teaches us to receive a few things and to throw over many things, in the same way the Paraclete who is promised in the New Testament teaches us what part of it to receive, and what to reject; as Jesus Himself says in the Gospel, when promising the Paraclete, \"He shall guide you into all truth, and shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance.\"[fn-24-P2482_1501437:11-nf] So then, with the help of the Paraclete, we may take the same liberties with the New Testament as Jesus enables you to take with the Old, unless you suppose that the Testament of the Son is of greater value than that of the Father, if it is really the Father's; so that while many parts of the one are to be condemned, the other must be exempted from all disapproval; and that, too, when we know, as I said before, that it was not written by Christ or by His apostles.","title":"Book XXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":13,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_45_book_xxxii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"16. Why, then, do you not accept everything in the New Testament? Is it because the books have not the authority of Christ's apostles, or because the apostles taught what was wrong? You reply that the books have not the authority of the apostles. That the apostles were wrong in their teaching is what Pagans say. But what can you say to prove that the publication of these books cannot be traced to the apostles? You reply that in many things they contradict themselves and one another. Nothing could be more untrue; the fact is, you do not understand. In every case where Faustus has brought forward what you think a discrepancy, we have shown that there was none; and we will do the same in every other case. It is intolerable that the reader or learner should dare to lay the blame on Scriptures of such high authority, instead of confessing his own stupidity. Did the Paraclete teach you that these writings are not of the apostles' authorship, but written by others under their names? But where is the proof that it was the Paraclete from whom you learned this? If you say that the Paraclete was promised and sent by Christ, we reply that your Paraclete was neither promised nor sent by Christ; and we also show you when He sent the Paraclete whom He promised. What proof have you that Christ sent your Paraclete? Where do you get the evidence in support of your informant, or rather misinformant? You reply that you find the proof in the Gospel. In what Gospel? You do not accept all the Gospel, and you say that it has been tampered with. Will you first accuse your witness of corruption, and then call for his evidence? To believe him when you wish it, and then disbelieve him when you wish it, is to believe nobody but yourself. If we were prepared to believe you, there would be no need of a witness at all. Moreover, in the promise of the Holy Spirit as the Paraclete, it is said, \"He shall lead you into all truth;\"[fn-25-P2513_1519851:32-nf] but how can you be led into all truth by one who teaches you that Christ was a deceiver? And again, if you were to prove that all that is said in the Gospel of the promise of the Paraclete could apply to no one but Manichaeus, as the predictions of the prophets are applicable to Christ; and if you quoted passages from those manuscripts which you say are genuine, we might say that on this very point, as proving Manichaeus to be the only person intended, the passages have been altered in the interest of your sect. Your only answer to this would be, that you could not possibly alter documents already in the possession of all Christians; for at the very outset of such an attempt, it would be met by an appeal to older copies. But if this proves that the books could not be corrupted by you, it also proves that they could not be corrupted by any one. The first person who ventured to do such a thing would be convicted by a comparison of older manuscripts; especially as the Scripture is to be found not in one language only, but in many. As it is, false readings are sometimes corrected by comparing older copies or the original language. Hence you must either acknowledge these documents as genuine, and then your heresy cannot stand a moment; or if they are spurious, you cannot use their authority in support of your doctrine of the Paraclete, and so you refute yourselves.","title":"Book XXXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_49_on_baptism_","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"44","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The baptism announced by John formed the subject, even at that time, of a question, proposed by the Lord Himself indeed to the Pharisees, whether that baptism were heavenly, or truly earthly:[fn-115-P11595_3269976:96-nf] about which they were unable to give a consistent[fn-115-P11596_3270071:97-nf] answer, inasmuch as they understood not, because they believed not. But we, with but as poor a measure of understanding as of faith, are able to determine that that baptism was divine indeed, (yet in respect of the command, not in respect of efficacy[fn-115-P11597_3270340:98-nf] too, in that we read that John was sent by the lord to perform this duty, )[fn-115-P11598_3270432:99-nf] but human in its nature: for it conveyed nothing celestial, but it fore-ministered to things celestial; being, to wit, appointed over repentance, which is in man's power.[fn-115-P11599_3270625:100-nf] In fact, the doctors of the law and the Pharisees, who were unwilling to \"believe,\" did not \"repent\" either.[fn-116-P11600_3270872:101-nf] But if repentance is a thing human, its baptism must necessarily be of the same nature: else, if it had been celestial, it would have given both the Holy Spirit and remission of sins.

Whence, if on the one hand He is man only, as the heretics will have it, how shall not anybody who believes in Him die eternally, since he who trusts in man is held to be accursed? Or on the other, if he is not accursed, but rather, as it is read, destined for the attainment of everlasting life, Christ is not man only, but God also, in whom he who believes both lays aside all risk of curse, and attains to the fruit of righteousness. If Christ was only man, how does He say that the Paraclete \"shall take of His, those things which He shall declare? \"[fn-102-P10255_3202129:117-nf] For neither does the Paraclete receive anything from man, but the Paraclete offers knowledge to man; nor does the Paraclete learn things future from man, but instructs man concerning futurity. Therefore either the Paraclete has not received from Christ, as man, what He should declare, since man could give nothing to the Paraclete, seeing that from Him man himself ought to receive, and Christ in the present instance is both mistaken and deceives, in saying that the Paraclete shall receive from Him, being a man, the things which He may declare; or He does not deceive us,-as in fact He does not,-and the Paraclete has received from Christ what He may declare. But if He has received from Christ what He may declare to us, Christ is greater than the Paraclete, because the Paraclete would not receive from Christ unless He were less than Christ. But the Paraclete being less than Christ, moreover, by this very fact proves Christ to be God, from whom He has received what He declares: so that the testimony of Christ's divinity is immense, in the Paraclete being found to be in this economy less than Christ, and taking from Him what He gives to others; seeing that if Christ were only man, Christ would receive from the Paraclete what He should say, not the Paraclete receive from Christ what He should declare. If Christ was only man, wherefore did He lay down for us such a rule of believing as that in which He said, \"And this is life eternal, that they should know Thee, the only and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent? \"[fn-102-P10256_3203695:118-nf] Had He not wished that He also should be understood to be God, why did He add, \"And Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent,\" except because He wished to be received as God also? Because if He had not wished to be understood to be God, He would have added, \"And the man Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent; \"but, in fact, He neither added this, nor did Christ deliver Himself to us as than only, but associated Himself with God, as He wished to be understood by this conjunction to be God also, as He is. We must therefore believe, according to the rule prescribed,[fn-102-P10257_3204275:119-nf] on the Lord, the one true God, and consequently on Him whom He has sent, Jesus Christ, who by no means, as we have said, would have linked Himself to the Father had He not wished to be understood to be God also: for He would have separated Himself from Him had He not wished to be understood to be God. He would have placed Himself among men only, had He known Himself to be only man; nor would He have linked Himself with God had He not known Himself to be God also. But in this case He is silent about His being man, because no one doubts His being man, and with reason links Himself to God, that He might establish the formula of His divinity[fn-102-P10258_3205117:120-nf] for those who should believe. If Christ was only man, how does He say, \"And now glorify me with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was? \"[fn-102-P10259_3205465:121-nf] If, before the world was, He had glory with God, and maintained His glory with the Father, He existed before the world, for He would not have had the glory unless He Himself had existed before, so as to be able to keep the glory. For no one could possess anything, unless he himself should first be in existence to keep anything. But now Christ has the glory before the foundation of the world; therefore He Himself was before the foundation of the world. For unless He were before the foundation of the world, He could not have glory before the foundation of the world, since He Himself was not in existence. But indeed man could not have glory before the foundation of the world, seeing that he was after the world; but Christ had-therefore He was before the world. Therefore He was not man only, seeing that He was before the world. He is therefore God, because He was before the world, and held His glory before the world. Neither let this be explained by predestination, since this is not so expressed, or let them add this who think so, but woe is denounced to them who add to, even as to those who take away from, that which is written. Therefore that may not be said, which may not be added. And thus, predestination being set aside, seeing it is not so laid down, Christ was in substance before the foundation of the world. For He is \"the Word by which all things were made, and without which nothing was made.\" Because even if He is said to be glorious in predestination, and that this predestination was before the foundation of the world, let order be maintained, and before Him a considerable number of men was destined to glory. For in respect of that destination, Christ will be perceived to be less than others if He is designated subsequent to them. For if this glory was in predestination, Christ received that predestination to glory last of all; for prior to Him Adam will be seen to have been predestinated, and Abel, and Enoch, and Noah, and Abraham, and many others. For since with God the order of all, both persons and things, is arranged, many will be said to have been predestinated before this predestination of Christ to glory. And on these terms Christ is discovered to be inferior to other men, although He is really found to be better and greater, and more ancient than the angels themselves. Either, then, let all these things be set on one side, that Christ's divinity may be destroyed; or if these things cannot be set aside, let His proper divinity be attributed to Christ by the heretics.","title":"A Treatise of Novatian Concerning the Trinity.","author":"Novatian"},{"chapter":16,"verse":7,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_138_a_treatise_of_novatian_concerning_the_trinity_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"96","folder":"ANF-05","text":"Moreover, the order of reason, and the authority of the faith in the disposition of the words and in the Scriptures of the Lord, admonish us after these things to believe also on the Holy Spirit, once promised to the Church, and in the appointed occasions of times given.

For the former deserved to be accused, because they had contemned the law; and they of the Gentiles who believe deserve to be aided by the defence of the Spirit, because they earnestly desire to attain to the Gospel law. Assuredly in the Spirit there are different kinds of offices, because in the times there is a different order of occasions; and yet, on this account, He who discharges these offices is not different, nor is He another in so acting, but He is one and the same, distributing His offices according to the times, and the occasions and impulses of things. Moreover, the Apostle Paul says, \"Having the same Spirit; as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-104-P10424_3282722:246-nf] He is therefore one and the same Spirit who was in the prophets and apostles, except that in the former He was occasional, in the latter always. But in the former not as being always in them, in the latter as abiding always in them; and in the former distributed with reserve, in the latter all poured out; in the former given sparingly, in the latter liberally bestowed; not yet manifested before the Lord's resurrection, but conferred after the resurrection. For, said He, \"I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Advocate, that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10425_3283345:247-nf] And, \"When He, the Advocate, shall come, whom I shall send unto you from my Father, the Spirit of truth who proceedeth from my Father.\"[fn-104-P10426_3283506:248-nf] And, \"If I go not away, that Advocate shall not come to you; but if I go away, I will send Him to you.\"[fn-104-P10427_3283631:249-nf] And, \"When the Spirit of truth shall come, He will direct you into all the truth.\"[fn-104-P10428_3283735:250-nf] And because the Lord was about to depart to the heavens, He gave the Paraclete out of necessity to the disciples; so as not to leave them in any degree orphans,[fn-104-P10429_3283918:251-nf] which was little desirable, and forsake them without an advocate and some kind of protector. For this is He who strengthened their hearts and minds, who marked out the Gospel sacraments, who was in them the enlightener of divine things; and they being strengthened, feared, for the sake of the Lord's name, neither dungeons nor chains, nay, even trod under foot the very powers of the world and its tortures, since they were henceforth armed and strengthened by the same Spirit, having in themselves the gifts which this same Spirit distributes, and appropriates to the Church, the spouse of Christ, as her ornaments. This is He who places prophets in the Church, instructs teachers, directs tongues, gives powers and healings, does wonderful works, often discrimination of spirits, affords powers of government, suggests counsels, and orders and arranges whatever other gifts there are of charismata; and thus make the Lord's Church everywhere, and in all, perfected and completed. This is He who, after the manner of a dove, when our Lord was baptized, came and abode upon Him, dwelling in Christ full and entire, and not maimed in any measure or portion; but with His whole overflow copiously distributed and sent forth, so that from Him others might receive some enjoyment of His graces: the source of the entire Holy Spirit remaining in Christ, so that from Him might be drawn streams of gifts and works, while the Holy Spirit dwelt affluently in Christ. For truly Isaiah, prophesying this, said: \"And the Spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and piety; and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-104-P10430_3285641:252-nf] This self-same thing also he said in the person of the Lord Himself, in another place, ' \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because He has anointed me, He has sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor.\"[fn-104-P10431_3285866:253-nf] Similarly David: \"Wherefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\"[fn-104-P10432_3285998:254-nf] Of Him the Apostle Paul says: \"For he who hath not the Spirit of Christ is none of His.\"[fn-104-P10433_3286107:255-nf] \"And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"[fn-104-P10434_3286186:256-nf] He it is who effects with water the second birth as a certain seed of divine generation, and a consecration of a heavenly nativity, the pledge of a promised inheritance, and as it were a kind of handwriting of eternal salvation; who can make us God's temple, and fit us for His house; who solicits the divine hearing for us with groanings that cannot be uttered; filling the offices of advocacy, and manifesting the duties of our defence,-an inhabitant given for our bodies and an effector of their holiness. Who, working in us for eternity, can also produce our bodies at the resurrection of immortality, accustoming them to be associated in Himself with heavenly power, and to be allied with the divine eternity of the Holy Spirit.

For He was promised by Joel the prophet, but given by Christ. \"In the last days,\" says the prophet, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants and my handmaids.\"[fn-104-P10421_3281470:243-nf] And the Lord said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose sins ye remit, they shall be remitted; and whose ye retain, they shall be retained.\"[fn-104-P10422_3281643:244-nf] But this Holy Spirit the Lord Christ calls at one time \"the Paraclete,\" at another pronounces to be the \"Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10423_3281790:245-nf] And He is not new in the Gospel, nor yet even newly given; for it was He Himself who accused the people in the prophets, and in the apostles gave them the appeal to the Gentiles. For the former deserved to be accused, because they had contemned the law; and they of the Gentiles who believe deserve to be aided by the defence of the Spirit, because they earnestly desire to attain to the Gospel law. Assuredly in the Spirit there are different kinds of offices, because in the times there is a different order of occasions; and yet, on this account, He who discharges these offices is not different, nor is He another in so acting, but He is one and the same, distributing His offices according to the times, and the occasions and impulses of things. Moreover, the Apostle Paul says, \"Having the same Spirit; as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.\"[fn-104-P10424_3282722:246-nf] He is therefore one and the same Spirit who was in the prophets and apostles, except that in the former He was occasional, in the latter always. But in the former not as being always in them, in the latter as abiding always in them; and in the former distributed with reserve, in the latter all poured out; in the former given sparingly, in the latter liberally bestowed; not yet manifested before the Lord's resurrection, but conferred after the resurrection. For, said He, \"I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Advocate, that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth.\"[fn-104-P10425_3283345:247-nf] And, \"When He, the Advocate, shall come, whom I shall send unto you from my Father, the Spirit of truth who proceedeth from my Father.\"[fn-104-P10426_3283506:248-nf] And, \"If I go not away, that Advocate shall not come to you; but if I go away, I will send Him to you.\"[fn-104-P10427_3283631:249-nf] And, \"When the Spirit of truth shall come, He will direct you into all the truth.\"[fn-104-P10428_3283735:250-nf] And because the Lord was about to depart to the heavens, He gave the Paraclete out of necessity to the disciples; so as not to leave them in any degree orphans,[fn-104-P10429_3283918:251-nf] which was little desirable, and forsake them without an advocate and some kind of protector. For this is He who strengthened their hearts and minds, who marked out the Gospel sacraments, who was in them the enlightener of divine things; and they being strengthened, feared, for the sake of the Lord's name, neither dungeons nor chains, nay, even trod under foot the very powers of the world and its tortures, since they were henceforth armed and strengthened by the same Spirit, having in themselves the gifts which this same Spirit distributes, and appropriates to the Church, the spouse of Christ, as her ornaments. This is He who places prophets in the Church, instructs teachers, directs tongues, gives powers and healings, does wonderful works, often discrimination of spirits, affords powers of government, suggests counsels, and orders and arranges whatever other gifts there are of charismata; and thus make the Lord's Church everywhere, and in all, perfected and completed. This is He who, after the manner of a dove, when our Lord was baptized, came and abode upon Him, dwelling in Christ full and entire, and not maimed in any measure or portion; but with His whole overflow copiously distributed and sent forth, so that from Him others might receive some enjoyment of His graces: the source of the entire Holy Spirit remaining in Christ, so that from Him might be drawn streams of gifts and works, while the Holy Spirit dwelt affluently in Christ. For truly Isaiah, prophesying this, said: \"And the Spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon Him, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and piety; and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him.\"[fn-104-P10430_3285641:252-nf] This self-same thing also he said in the person of the Lord Himself, in another place, ' \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because He has anointed me, He has sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor.\"[fn-104-P10431_3285866:253-nf] Similarly David: \"Wherefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.\"[fn-104-P10432_3285998:254-nf] Of Him the Apostle Paul says: \"For he who hath not the Spirit of Christ is none of His.\"[fn-104-P10433_3286107:255-nf] \"And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.\"[fn-104-P10434_3286186:256-nf] He it is who effects with water the second birth as a certain seed of divine generation, and a consecration of a heavenly nativity, the pledge of a promised inheritance, and as it were a kind of handwriting of eternal salvation; who can make us God's temple, and fit us for His house; who solicits the divine hearing for us with groanings that cannot be uttered; filling the offices of advocacy, and manifesting the duties of our defence,-an inhabitant given for our bodies and an effector of their holiness. Who, working in us for eternity, can also produce our bodies at the resurrection of immortality, accustoming them to be associated in Himself with heavenly power, and to be allied with the divine eternity of the Holy Spirit. For our bodies are both trained in Him and by Him to advance to immortality, by learning to govern themselves with moderation according to His decrees.

To this I may compare the case of Theology[fn-46-P4674_1497384:40-nf] except that it proceeds the reverse way. For in the case by which I have illustrated it the change is made by successive subtractions; whereas here perfection is reached by additions. For the matter stands thus. The Old Testament proclaimed the Father openly, and the Son more obscurely. The New manifested the Son, and suggested the Deity of the Spirit. Now the Spirit Himself dwells among us, and supplies us with a clearer demonstration of Himself. For it was not safe, when the Godhead of the Father was not yet acknowledged, plainly to proclaim the Son; nor when that of the Son was not yet received to burden us further (if I may use so bold an expression) with the Holy Ghost; lest perhaps people might, like men loaded with food beyond their strength, and presenting eyes as yet too weak to bear it to the sun's light, risk the loss even of that which was within the reach of their powers; but that by gradual additions, and, as David says, Goings up, and advances and progress from glory to glory,[fn-46-P4675_1498821:41-nf] the Light of the Trinity might shine upon the more illuminated. For this reason it was, I think, that He gradually came to dwell in the Disciples, measuring Himself out to them according to their capacity to receive Him, at the beginning of the Gospel, after the Passion, after the Ascension, making perfect their powers, being breathed upon them, and appearing in fiery tongues. And indeed it is by little and little that He is declared by Jesus, as you will learn for yourself if you will read more carefully. I will ask the Father, He says, and He will send you another Comforter, even the spirit of Truth.[fn-46-P4676_1499471:42-nf] This He said that He might not seem to be a rival God, or to make His discourses to them by another authority.

For it is there related that Jesus said: \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all the truth: for He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak.\"[fn-80-P8008_1951130:7-nf] And when we inquire what were the \"many things\" referred to in the passage which Jesus had to say to His disciples, but which they were not then able to bear, I have to observe that, probably because the apostles were Jews, and had been trained up according to the letter of the Mosaic law, He was unable to tell them what was the true law, and how the Jewish worship consisted in the pattern and shadow of certain heavenly things, and how future blessings were foreshadowed by the injunctions regarding meats and drinks, and festivals, and new moons, and sabbaths. These were many of the subjects which He had to explain to them; but as He saw that it was a work of exceeding difficulty to root out of the mind opinions that have been almost born with a man, and amid which he has been brought up till he reached the period of maturity, and which have produced in those who have adopted them the belief that they are divine, and that it is an act of impiety to overthrow them; and to demonstrate by the superiority of Christian doctrine, that is, by the truth, in a manner to convince the hearers, that such opinions were but \"loss and dung,\" He postponed such a task to a future season-to that, namely, which followed His passion and resurrection. For the bringing of aid unseasonably to those who were not yet capable of receiving it, might have overturned the idea which they had already formed of Jesus, as the Christ, and the Son of the living God. And see if there is not some well-grounded reason for such a statement as this, \"I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot hear them now; \"seeing there are many points in the law which require to be explained and cleared up in a spiritual sense, and these the disciples were in a manner unable to bear, having been born and brought up amongst Jews. I am of opinion, moreover, that since these rites were typical, and the truth was that which was to be taught them by the Holy Spirit, these words were added, \"When He is come who is the Spirit of truth, He will lead you into all the truth; \"as if He had said, into all the truth about those things which, being to you but types, ye believed to constitute a true worship which ye rendered unto God. And so, according to the promise of Jesus, the Spirit of truth came to Peter, saying to him, with regard to the four-footed beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air: \"Arise, Peter; kill, and eat.\" And the Spirit came to him while he was still in a state of superstitious ignorance; for he said, in answer to the divine command, \"Not so Lord; for I have never yet eaten anything common or unclean.\" He instructed him, however, in the true and spiritual meaning of meats, by saying, \"What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.\" And so, after that vision, the Spirit of truth, which conducted Peter into all the truth, told him the many things which he was unable to bear when Jesus was still with him in the flesh. But I shall have another opportunity of explaining those matters, which are connected with the literal acceptation of the Mosaic law.","title":"Book II.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":16,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_38_sermon_xxi_lxxi_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"26","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"24.

For it is the custom of these writers (of Scripture) to distribute into many classes those writings which express one sense when taken literally,[fn-96-P9650_2512946:353-nf] but which convey a different signification as their hidden meaning; and one of these kinds of writing is \"Proverbs.\" And for this reason, in our Gospels too, is our Saviour described as saying: \"These things have I spoken to you in proverbs, but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs.\"[fn-96-P9651_2513275:354-nf] It is not, then, the visible ants which are \"wiser even than the wise,\" but they who are indicated as such under the \"proverbial\" style of expression.

For everything depends on the inward frame of mind, and when the devil has been expelled. from this, and sins no longer reign in it, it follows that the kingdom of God as founded in us, as the Evangelist says \"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, nor shall men say Lo here, or lo there: for verily I say unto you that the kingdom of God is within you.\"[fn-35-P3539_1321607:14-nf] But nothing else can be \"within you,\" but knowledge or ignorance of truth, and delight either in vice or in virtue, through which we prepare a kingdom for the devil or for Christ in our heart: and of this kingdom the Apostle describes the character, when he says \"For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-35-P3540_1322000:15-nf] And so if the kingdom of God is within us, and the actual kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy, then the man who abides in these is most certainly in the kingdom of God, and on the contrary those who live in unrighteousness, and discord, and the sorrow that worketh death, have their place in the kingdom of the devil, and in hell and death. For by these tokens the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the devil are distinguished: and in truth if lifting up our mental gaze on high we would consider that state in which the heavenly powers live on high, who are truly in the kingdom of God, what should we imagine it to be except perpetual and lasting joy? For what is so specially peculiar and appropriate to true blessedness as constant calm and eternal joy? And that you may be quite sure that this, which we say, is really so, not on my own authority but on that of the Lord, hear how very clearly He describes the character and condition of that world: \"Behold,\" says He, \"I create new beavers and a new earth: and the former things shall not be remembered nor come into mind. But ye shall be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create.\"[fn-35-P3541_1323178:16-nf] And again \"joy and gladness shall be found therein: thanksgiving and the voice of praise, and there shall be month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath.\"[fn-35-P3542_1323356:17-nf] And again: \"they shall obtain joy and gladness; and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\"[fn-35-P3543_1323471:18-nf] And if you want to know more definitely about that life and the city of the saints, hear what the voice of the Lord proclaims to the heavenly Jerusalem herself: \"I will make,\" says He, \"thine officers peace and thine overseers righteousness. Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, desolation nor destruction within thy borders. And salvation shall take possession of thy walls, and praise of thy gates. The sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither shall the brightness of the moon give light to thee: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended:\"[fn-35-P3544_1324238:19-nf] and therefore the holy Apostle does not say generally or without qualification that every joy is the kingdom of God, but markedly and emphatically that joy alone which is \"in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-35-P3545_1324450:20-nf] For he was perfectly aware of another detestable joy, of which we hear \"the world shall rejoice,\"[fn-35-P3546_1324571:21-nf] and \"woe unto you that laugh, for ye shall mourn.\"[fn-35-P3547_1324644:22-nf] In fact the kingdom of heaven must be taken in a threefold sense, either that the heavens shall reign, i.e., the saints over other things subdued, according to this text, \"Be thou over five cities, and thou over ten;\"[fn-35-P3548_1324883:23-nf] and this which is said to the disciples: \"Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel:\"[fn-35-P3549_1325022:24-nf] or that the heavens themselves shall begin to be reigned over by Christ, when \"all things are subdued unto Him,\" and God begins to be \"all in all:\"[fn-35-P3550_1325193:25-nf] or else that the saints shall reign in heaven with the Lord.","title":"I.

Petilianus said: \"But what have you to do with the kings of this world, in whom Christianity has never found anything save envy towards her? And to teach you shortly the truth of what I say, A king persecuted the brethren of the Maccabees.[fn-53-P5356_2578949:256-nf] A king also condemned the three children to the sanctifying flames, being ignorant what lie did, seeing that he himself was fighting against God.[fn-53-P5357_2579114:257-nf] A king sought the life of the infant Saviour.[fn-53-P5358_2579177:258-nf] A king exposed Daniel, as he thought, to be eaten by wild beasts.[fn-53-P5359_2579264:259-nf] And the Lord Christ Himself was slain by a king's most wicked judge.[fn-53-P5360_2579349:260-nf] Hence it is that the apostle cries out, `We speak wisdom among them that are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, which was hidden, which God ordained before the world unto our glory; which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.'[fn-53-P5361_2579782:261-nf] But grant that this was said of the heathen kings of old. Yet you, rulers of this present age, because you desire to be Christians, do not allow men to be Christians, seeing that, when they are believing in all honesty of heart, you draw them by the defilement and mist of your falsehood wholly over to your wickedness, that with their arms, which were provided against the enemies of the state, they should assail the Christians, and should think that, at your instigation, they are doing the work of Christ if they kill us whom you hate, according to the saying of the Lord Christ: `The time cometh,' He says, `that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.'[fn-53-P5362_2580484:262-nf] It makes no matter therefore to you, false teachers, whether the kings of this world desire to be heathens, which God forbid, or Christians, so long as you cease not in your efforts to arm them against the family of Christ. But do you not know, or rather, have you not read, that the guilt of one who instigates a murder is greater than the guilt of him who carries it out? Jezebel had excited the king her husband to the murder of a poor and righteous man, yet husband and wife alike perished by an equal punishment.[fn-53-P5363_2581023:263-nf] Nor indeed is your mode of urging on kings different from that by which the subtle persuasion of women has often urged kings on to guilt. For the wife of Herod earned and obtained the boon by means of her daughter, that the head of John should be brought to table in a charger.[fn-53-P5364_2581321:264-nf] Similarly the Jews forced on Pontius Pilate that he should crucify the Lord Jesus, whose blood Pilate prayed might remain in vengeance upon them and on their children.[fn-53-P5365_2581513:265-nf] So therefore you also overwhelm yourselves with our blood by your sin. For it does not follow that because it is the hand of the judge that strikes the blow, your calumnies therefore are not rather guilty of the deed. For the prophet David says, speaking in the person of Christ, `Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His Anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure. Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts, of the earth for Thy possession. Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.' And he warned the kings themselves in the following precepts, that they should not, like ignorant men devoid of understanding, seek to persecute the Christians, lest they should themselves be destroyed,-which precepts I would that we could teach them, seeing that they are ignorant of them; or, at least, that you would show them to them, as doubtless you would do if you desired that they should live; or, at any rate; if neither of the other courses be allowed, that your malice would have permitted them to read them for themselves. The first Psalm of David would certainly have persuaded them that they should live and reign as Christians; but meanwhile you deceive them, so long as they entrust themselves to you. For you represent to them things that are evil, and you hide from them what is good. Let them then at length read this, which they should have read already long ago. For what does he say, `Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Lay hold of instruction lest the Lord be angry, and ye perish from the right way. Since how quickly has His wrath kindled over you? Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.'[fn-53-P5366_2583840:266-nf] You urge on emperors, I say, with your persuasions, even as Pilate, whom, as we showed above, the Jews urged on, though he himself cried aloud, as he washed his hands before them all, `I am innocent of the blood of this just person,'[fn-53-P5367_2584102:267-nf] -as though a person could be clear from the guilt of a sin who had himself committed it. But, to say nothing of ancient examples, observe, from instances taken from your own party, how very many of your emperors and judges have perished in persecuting us. To pass over Nero, who was the first to persecute the Christians, Domitian perished almost in the same way as Nero, as also did Trajan, Geta,[fn-53-P5368_2584524:268-nf] Decius, Valerian, Diocletian; Maximian also perished, at whose command that men should burn incense to their gods, burning the sacred volumes, Marcellinus indeed first, but after him also Mensurius of Carthage, and Caecilianus, escaped death from the sacrilegious flames, surviving like some ashes or cinders from the burning. For the consciousness of the guilt of burning incense involved you all, as many as agreed with Mensurius. Macarius perished, Ursacius[fn-53-P5369_2585376:269-nf] perished, and all your counts perished in like manner by the vengeance of God. For Ursacius was slain in a battle with the barbarians, after which birds of prey with their savage talons, and the greedy teeth of dogs with their biting, tore him limb from limb. Was not he too a murderer at your suggestion, who, like king Ahab, whom we showed to have been persuaded by a woman, slew a poor and righteous man?[fn-53-P5370_2586591:270-nf] So you too do not cease to murder us, who are just and poor (poor, that is, in worldly wealth; for in the grace of God no one of us is poor). For even if you do not murder a man with your hands, you do not cease to do so with your butcherous tongues. For it is written, `Death and life are in the power of the tongue.'[fn-53-P5371_2586931:271-nf] All, therefore, who have been murdered, you the instigator of the deed, have slain. Nor indeed does the hand of the butcher glow save at the instigation of your tongue; and that terrible heat of the breast is inflamed by your words to take the blood of others,-blood that shall take a just vengeance upon him who shed it.\"","title":"Book II.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":16,"verse":2,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_61_book_ii_","source_chapter":91,"source_paragraph":"401","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"206.

You do not see that if this had been said of these emperors who rejoice in the name of Christian, their chief command would certainly have been this, that you should have been put to death; and this command they never gave at all. But the men of your party, by opposing the laws in hostile fashion, bring deserved punishment on themselves; and their own voluntary deaths, so long as they think that they bring odium on us, they consider in no wise ruinous to themselves. But if they think that that saying of Christ refers to kings who honor the name of Christ, let them ask I what the Catholic Church suffered in the East, when, Valens the Arian was emperor. There indeed I might find what I should understand to be sufficient fulfillment of the saying of the Lord, \"The time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service,\" that heretics should not claim, as conducing to their especial glory, the injunctions issued against their errors by Catholic emperors. But we remember that that time was fulfilled after the ascension of our Lord, of which holy Scripture is known by all to be a witness. The Jews thought that they were doing a service to God when they put the apostles to death. Among those who thought that they were showing service to God was even our Saul, though not ours as yet; so that among his causes for confidence which were past and to be forgotten, he enumerates the following: \"An Hebrew,\" he says, \"of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting the Church.\"[fn-53-P5389_2600825:285-nf] Here was one who thought that he did God service when he did what presently he suffered himself. For forty Jews bound themselves by an oath that they would slay him, when he caused that this should be made known to the tribune, so that under the protection of a guard of armed men he escaped their snares.[fn-53-P5390_2601155:286-nf] But there was no one yet to say to him, What have you to do (not with kings, but) with tribunes and the arms of kings? There was no one to say to him, Dare you seek protection at the hand of soldiers, when your Lord was dragged by them to undergo His sufferings?

Today is the glad spring-time to us, and Christ the Sun of righteousness has beamed with clear light around us, and has illumined the minds of the faithful. To-day is Adam made anew,[fn-11-P1143_281985:2-nf] and moves in the choir of angels, having winged his way to heaven. To-day is the whole circle of the earth filled with joy, since the sojourn of the Holy Spirit has been realized to men. To-day the grace of God and the hope of the unseen shine through all wonders transcending imagination, and make the mystery that was kept hid from eternity plainly discernible to us. To-day are woven the chaplets of never-fading virtue. To-day, God, willing to crown the sacred heads of those whose pleasure is to hearken to Him, and who delight in His festivals, invites the lovers of unswerving faith as His called and His heirs; and the heavenly kingdom is urgent to summon those who mind celestial things to join the divine service of the incorporeal choirs. To-day is fulfilled the word of David, \"Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad. The fields shall be joyful, and all the trees of the wood before the Lord, because He cometh.\"[fn-11-P1144_282976:3-nf] David thus made mention of the trees;[fn-11-P1145_283034:4-nf] and the Lord's forerunner also spoke of them as trees[fn-11-P1146_283098:5-nf] \"that should bring forth fruits meet for repentance,\"[fn-11-P1147_283164:6-nf] or rather for the coming of the Lord. But our Lord Jesus Christ promises perpetual gladness to all those who believe on Him. For He says, \"I will see you, and ye shall rejoice; and your joy no man taketh from you.\"[fn-11-P1148_283396:7-nf] To-day is the illustrious and ineffable mystery of Christians, who have willingly[fn-11-P1149_283495:8-nf] set their hope like a seal upon Christ, plainly declared to us. To-day did Gabriel, who stands by God, come to the pure virgin, bearing to her the glad annunciation, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured![fn-11-P1150_283728:9-nf] And she cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be. And the angel immediately proceeded to say, The Lord is with thee: fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favour with God. Behold,[fn-11-P1151_283938:10-nf] thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call[fn-11-P1152_284035:11-nf] His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David, and He shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever: and of His kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? \"[fn-11-P1153_284393:12-nf] Shall I still remain a virgin? is the honour of virginity not then lost by me? And while she was yet in perplexity as to these things, the angel placed shortly before her the summary of his whole message, and said to the pure virgin, \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\" For what it is, that also shall it be called by all means. Meekly, then, did grace make election of the pure Mary alone out of all generations. For she proved herself prudent truly in all things; neither has any woman been born like her in all generations. She was not like the primeval virgin Eve, who, keeping holiday[fn-11-P1154_285151:13-nf] alone in paradise, with thoughtless mind, unguardedly hearkened to the word of the serpent, the author of all evil, and thus became depraved in the thoughts of her mind;[fn-11-P1155_285337:14-nf] and through her that deceiver, discharging his poison and refusing death with it, brought it into the whole world; and in virtue of this has arisen all the trouble of the saints. But in the holy Virgin alone is the fall of that (first mother) repaired. Yet was not this holy one competent to receive the gift until she had first learned who it was that sent it, and what the gift was, and who it was that conveyed it. While the holy one pondered these things in perplexity with herself, she says to the angel, \"Whence hast thou brought to us the blessing in such wise? Out of what treasure-stores is the pearl of the word despatched to us? Whence has the gift acquired its purpose[fn-11-P1156_286088:15-nf] toward us? From heaven art thou come, yet thou walkest upon earth! Thou dost exhibit the form of man, and (yet) thou art glorious with dazzling light.\"[fn-11-P1157_286290:16-nf] These things the holy one considered with herself, and the archangel solved the difficulty expressed in such reasonings by saying to her: \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. And fear not, Mary; for I am not come to overpower thee with fear, but to repel the subject of fear. Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God. Question not grace by the standard of nature. For grace does not endure to pass under the laws of nature. Thou knowest, O Mary, things kept hid from the patriarchs and prophets. Thou hast learned, O virgin, things which were kept concealed till now from the angels. Thou hast heard, O purest one, things of which even the choir of inspired men[fn-11-P1158_287148:17-nf] was never deemed worthy. Moses, and David, and Isaiah, and Daniel, and all the prophets, prophesied of Him; but the manner they knew not. Yet thou alone, O purest virgin, art now made the recipient of things of which all these were kept in ignorance, and thou dost learn[fn-11-P1159_287434:18-nf] the origin of them. For where the Holy Spirit is, there are all things readily ordered. Where divine grace is present, all things are found possible with God. The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall; overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\" And if He is the Son of God, then is He also God, of one form with the Father, and co-eternal; in Him the Father possesses all manifestation;[fn-11-P1160_287980:19-nf] He is His image in the person, and through His reflection the (Father's) glory shines forth. And as from the ever-flowing fountain the streams proceed, so also from this ever-flowing and ever-living fountain does the light of the world proceed, the perennial and the true, namely Christ our God. For it is of this that the prophets have preached: \"The streams of the river make glad the city of God.\"[fn-11-P1161_288398:20-nf] And not one city only, but all cities; for even as it makes glad one city, so does it also the whole world. Appropriately, therefore, did the angel[fn-11-P1162_288564:21-nf] say to Mary the holy virgin first of all, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee; \"inasmuch as with her was laid up the full treasure of grace. For of all generations she alone has risen as a virgin pure in body and in spirit; and she alone bears Him who bears all things on His word. Nor is it only the beauty of this holy one in body that calls forth our admiration, but also the innate virtue of her soul. Wherefore also the angels addressed her first with the salutation, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured,[fn-11-P1163_289119:22-nf] the Lord is with thee, and no spouse of earth; \"He Himself is with thee who is the Lord of sanctification, the Father of purity, the Author of incorruption, and the Bestower of liberty, the Curator of salvation, and the Steward and Provider of the true peace, who out of the virgin earth made man, and out of man's side formed Eve in addition. Even this Lord is with thee, and on the other hand also is of thee. Come, therefore, beloved brethren, and let us take up the angelic strain, and to the utmost of our ability return the due meed of praise, saying, \"Hail,[fn-11-P1164_289712:23-nf] thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee!\" For it is thine truly to rejoice, seeing that the grace of God, as he knows, has chosen to dwell with thee-the Lord of glory dwelling with the handmaiden; \"He that is fairer than the children of men \"[fn-11-P1165_289986:24-nf] with the fair virgin; He who sanctifies all things with the undefiled. God is with thee, and with thee also is the perfect man in whom dwells the whole fulness of the Godhead. Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the fountain of the light that lightens all who believe upon Him! Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the rising of the rational Sun,[fn-11-P1166_290351:25-nf] and the undefiled flower of Life! Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the mead[fn-11-P1167_290546:26-nf] of sweet savour! Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the ever-blooming vine, that makes glad the souls of those who honour thee? Hail, thou that art highly favoured!-the soil that, all untilled, bears bounteous fruit: for thou hast brought forth in accordance with the law of nature indeed, as it goes with us, and by the set time of practice,[fn-11-P1168_290906:27-nf] and yet in a way beyond nature, or rather above nature, by reason that God the Word from above took His abode in thee, and formed the new Adam in thy holy womb, and inasmuch as the Holy Ghost gave the power of conception to the holy virgin; and the reality of His body was assumed from her body. And just as the pearl[fn-11-P1169_291270:28-nf] comes of the two natures, namely lightning and water, the occult signs of the sea; so also our Lord Jesus Christ proceeds, without fusion and without mutation, from the pure, and chaste, and undefiled, and holy Virgin Mary; perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity, in all things equal to the Father, and in all things consubstantial with us, apart from sin.","title":"The First Homily on the Annunciation to the Holy Virgin Mary.","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":16,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_24_the_second_homily","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"ANF-06","text":"It is our duty to present to God, like sacrifices, all the festivals and hymnal celebrations; and first of all, the annunciation to the holy mother of God, to wit, the salutation made to her by the angel, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured!\" For first of all wisdom[fn-11-P1191_296906:2-nf] and saving doctrine in the New Testament was this salutation, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured!\" conveyed to us from the Father of lights. And this address, \"highly favoured,\"[fn-11-P1192_297112:3-nf] embraced the whole nature of men. \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured\"[fn-11-P1193_297210:4-nf] in the holy conception and in the glorious pregnancy, \"I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\"[fn-11-P1194_297361:5-nf] And again the Lord, who came for the purpose of accomplishing a saving passion, said, \"I will see you, and ye shall rejoice; and your joy no man taketh from you.\"[fn-11-P1195_297540:6-nf] And after His resurrection again, by the hand of the holy women, He gave us first of all the salutation \"Hail! \"[fn-11-P1196_297670:7-nf] And again, the apostle made the announcement in similar terms, saying, \"Rejoice evermore: pray without ceasing: in everything give thanks.\"[fn-11-P1197_297830:8-nf] See, then, dearly beloved, how the Lord has conferred upon us everywhere, and indivisibly, the joy that is beyond conception, and perennial. For since the holy Virgin, in the life of the flesh, was in possession of the incorruptible citizenship, and walked as such in all manner of virtues, and lived a life more excellent than man's common standard; therefore the Word that cometh from God the Father thought it meet to assume the flesh, and endue the perfect man from her, in order that in the same flesh in which sin entered into the world, and death by sin, sin might be condemned in the flesh, and that the tempter of sin might be overcome in the burying[fn-11-P1198_298512:9-nf] of the holy body, and that therewith also the beginning of the resurrection might be exhibited, and life eternal instituted in the world, and fellowship established for men with God the Father. And what shall we state, or what shall we pass by here? or who shall explain what is incomprehensible in the mystery? But for the present let us fall back upon our subject. Gabriel was sent to the holy virgin; the incorporeal was despatched to her who in the body pursued the incorruptible conversation, and lived in purity and in virtues. And when he came to her, he first addressed her with the salutation, \"Hail, thou that art highly favoured! the Lord is with thee.\" Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for thou doest what is worthy of joy indeed, since thou hast put on the vesture of purity, and art girt with the cincture of prudence. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for to thy lot it has fallen to be the vehicle of celestial joy. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for through thee joy is decreed for the whole creation, and the human race receives again by thee its pristine dignity. Hail, thou that art highly favoured! for in thy arms the Creator of all things shall be carried. And she was perplexed by this word; for she was inexperienced in all the addresses of men, and welcomed quiet, as the mother of prudence and purity; (yet) being a pure, and immaculate, and stainless image[fn-11-P1199_299997:10-nf] herself, she shrank not in terror from the angelic apparition, like most of the prophets, as indeed true virginity has a kind of affinity and equality with the angels. For the holy Virgin guarded carefully the torch of virginity, and gave diligent heed that it should not be extinguished or defiled. And as one who is clad in a brilliant robe deems it a matter of great moment that no impurity or filth be suffered to touch it anywhere, so did the holy Mary consider with herself, and said: Does this act of attention imply any deep design or seductive purpose? Shall this word \"Hail\" prove the cause of trouble to me, as of old the fair promise of being made like God, which was given her by the serpent-devil, proved to our first mother Eve? Has the devil, who is the author of all evil, become transformed again into an angel of light; and bearing a grudge against my espoused husband for his admirable temperance, and having assailed him with some fair-seeming address, and finding himself powerless to overcome a mind so firm, and to deceive the man, has he turned his attack upon me, as one endowed with a more susceptible mind; and is this word \"Hail\" (Grace be with thee) spoken as the sign of gracelessness hereafter? Is this benediction and salutation uttered in irony? Is there not some poison concealed in the honey? Is it not the address of one who brings good tidings, while the end of the same is to make me the designer's prey? And how is it that he can thus salute one whom he knows not? These things she pondered in perplexity with herself, and expressed in words. Then again the archangel addressed her with the announcement of a joy which all may believe in, and which shall not be taken away, and said to her, \"Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God.\" Shortly hast thou the proof of what has been said. For I not only give yon to understand that there is nothing to fear, but I show you the very key to the absence of all cause for fear. For through me all the heavenly powers hail thee, the holy virgin: yea rather, He Himself, who is Lord of all the heavenly powers and of all creation, has selected thee as the holy one and the wholly fair; and through thy holy, and chaste, and pure, and undefiled womb the enlightening Pearl comes forth for the salvation of all the world: since of all the race of man thou art by birth the holy one, and the more honourable, and the purer, and the more pious than any other: and thou hast a mind whiter than the snow, and a body made purer than any gold, however fine, and a womb such as the object which Ezekiel saw, and which he has described in these terms: \"And the likeness of the living creatures upon the head was as the firmament, and as the appearance of the terrible crystal, and the likeness of the throne above them was as the appearance of a sapphire-stone: and above the throne it was as the likeness of a man, and as the appearance of amber; and within it there was, as it were, the likeness of fire round about.\"[fn-12-P1200_303014:11-nf] ","title":"The Second Homily","author":"Gregory Thaumaturgus"},{"chapter":16,"verse":28,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_18_part_ii_dogmatical_and_historical_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"121","folder":"ANF-05","text":"16.

We also ought forthwith to hasten on that by means of the indissoluble grace of love we may mount to that third stage of sonship, which believes that all that the father has is its own, and so we may be counted worthy to receive the image and likeness of our heavenly Father, and be able to say after the likeness of the true son: \"All that the Father hath is mine.\"[fn-51-P5151_1861929:15-nf] Which also the blessed Apostle declares of us, saying: \"All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours.\"[fn-51-P5152_1862151:16-nf] And to this likeness the commands of our Saviour also summon us: \"Be ye,\" says He, \"perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect\"[fn-51-P5153_1862307:17-nf] For in these persons sometimes the love of goodness is found to be interrupted, when the vigour of the soul is relaxed by some coldness or joy or delight, and so loses either the fear of hell for the time, or the desire of future blessings. And there is indeed in these a stage leading to some advance, which affects us so that when from fear of punishment or from hope of reward we begin to avoid sin we are enabled to pass on to the stage of love, for \"fear,\" says one, \"is not in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment, but he who fears is not perfect in love.

Wherefore we must do our best to mount with perfect ardour of mind from this fear to hope, from hope to the love of God, and the love of the virtues themselves, that as we steadily pass on to the love of goodness itself, we may, as far as it is possible for human nature, keep firm hold of what is good.","title":"XI.

Behold, says some one, the Son has been sent; and the Father is greater, because He sent. Withdraw from the flesh; the old man suggests oldness in time. Let the ancient, the perpetual, the eternal, to thee the new, call off thy understanding from time to this. Is the Son less because He is said to have been sent? I hear of a sending, not a separation. But yet, saith he, among men we see that he who sends is greater than he who is sent. Be it so; but human affairs deceive a man; divine things purge him. Do not regard things human, in which the sender appears greater, the sent less; notwithstanding, things human themselves bear testimony against thee. Just as, for example, if a man wishes to ask a woman to wife, and, not being able to do this in person, sends a friend to ask for him. And there are many cases in which the greater is chosen to be sent by the less. Why, then, wouldst thou now raise a captious objection, because the one has sent, the other is sent? The sun sends out a ray, but does not separate it; the moon sends out her sheen, but does not separate it; a lamp sheds light, but does not separate it: I see there a sending forth, not a separation. For if thou seekest examples from human things, O heretical vanity, although, as I have said, even human things in some instances refute thee, and convict of error; yet consider how different it is in the case of things human, from which you wish to deduce examples for things divine. A man that sends remains himself behind, while only the man that is sent goes forward. Does the man who sends go with him whom he sends? Yet the Father, who sent the Son, has not departed from the Son. Hear the Lord Himself saying, \"Behold, the hour is coming, when every one shall depart to his own, and ye will leave me alone; but I am not alone, because the Father is with me.\"[fn-11-P1115_682355:25-nf] How has He, with whom He came, sent Him?

Let us not love the world. It overwhelms its lovers, it conducts them to no good. We must rather labour in it that it seduce us not, than fear lest it should fall.

For wherefore saith the Lord, \"Rejoice, for that I have overcome the world\"?[fn-51-P5123_2179984:10-nf] We might answer Him if we pleased, \"`Rejoice,' yes do Thou rejoice. If Thou `hast overcome,' do thou rejoice. Why should we?\" Why doth He say to us, \"Rejoice;\" but because it is for us that He hath overcome, for us hath fought?For wherein fought He? In that He took man's nature upon Him.

For in the most general application it holds good, that it does not appear to be possible for any man to remain altogether without experience of ill: for, as one says, \"The whole world lieth in wickedness; \"[fn-20-P2051_591781:3-nf] and again, \"The most of the days of man are labour and trouble,\"[fn-20-P2052_591863:4-nf] as men themselves also admit. Short is our life, and full of sorrow. Howbeit it was not meet that He should bid them pray directly that that curse might not be fulfilled, which is expressed thus: \"Cursed is the ground in thy works: in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; \"[fn-20-P2053_592169:5-nf] or thus, \"Earth thou art, and unto earth shall thou return.\"[fn-20-P2054_592247:6-nf] For which reason the Holy Scriptures, that indicate in many various ways the dire distressfulness of life, designate it as a valley of weeping. And most of all indeed is this world a scene of pain to the saints, to whom He addresses this word, and He cannot lie in uttering it: \"In the world ye shall have tribulation.\"[fn-20-P2055_592584:7-nf] And to the same effect also He says by the prophet, \"Many are the afflictions of the righteous.\"[fn-20-P2056_592698:8-nf] But I suppose that He refers to this entering not into temptation, when He speaks in the prophet's words of being delivered out of the afflictions. For He adds, \"The Lord will deliver him out of them all.\" And this is just in accordance with the Saviour's word, whereby He promises that they will overcome their afflictions, and that they will participate in that victory which He has won for them. For after saying, \"In the world ye shall have tribulation,\" He added, \"But be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.\" And again, He taught them to pray that they might not fall into temptation, when He said, \"And lead us not into temptation; \"which means, \"Suffer us not to fall into temptation.\" And to show that this did not imply they should not be tempted, but really that they should be delivered from the evil, He added, \"But deliver us from evil.\" But perhaps you will say, What difference is there between being tempted, and falling or entering into temptation? Well, if one is overcome of evil-and he will be overcome unless he struggles against it himself, and unless God protects him with His shield-that man has entered into temptation, and is in it, and is brought under it like one that is led captive. But if one withstands and endures, that man is indeed tempted; but he has not entered into temptation, or fallen under it. Thus Jesus was led up of the Spirit, not indeed to enter into temptation, but \"to be tempted of the devil.\"[fn-20-P2057_594166:9-nf] And Abraham, again, did not enter into temptation, neither did God lead him into temptation, but He tempted (tried) him; yet He did not drive him into temptation. The Lord Himself, moreover, tempted (tried) the disciples. And thus the wicked one, when he tempts us, draws us into the temptations, as dealing himself with the temptations of evil; but God, when He tempts (tries), adduces the temptations as one untempted of evil. For God, it is said, \"cannot be tempted of evil.\"[fn-20-P2058_594662:10-nf] The devil, therefore, drives us on by violence, drawing us to destruction; but God leads us by the hand, training us for our salvation.

(10.) `getter' then, as has been said, could not have been brought to pass by any other than the Son, who sits on the right hand of the Father. And what does this denote but the Son's genuineness, and that the Godhead of the Father is the same as the Son's[fn-57-P5738_2275622:374-nf] ? For in that the Son reigns in His Father's kingdom, is seated upon the same throne as the Father, and is contemplated in the Father's Godhead, therefore is the Word God, and whose beholds the Son, beholds the Father; and thus there is one God. Sitting then on the right, yet He does not place His Father on the left[fn-57-P5739_2275967:375-nf] ; but whatever is right[fn-57-P5740_2276125:376-nf] and precious in the Father, that also the Son has, and says, `All things that the Father hath are Mine[fn-57-P5741_2276242:377-nf] .'

For many taking occasion by this saying, insist with crass intelligence that these things will be given carnally in the millennium, though they must certainly admit that age, which they say will be after the resurrection cannot possibly be understood as present. It is then more credible and much clearer that one, who at the persuasion of Christ has made light of any worldly affections or goods, receives from the brethren and partners of his life, who are joined to him by a spiritual tie, even in this life a love which is an hundred times better: since it is certain that among parents and children and brothers, wives and relations, where either the tie is merely formed by intercourse, or the bond of union by the claims of relationship, the love is tolerably short lived and easily broken. Finally even good and duteous children when they have grown up, are sometimes shut out by their parents from their homes and property, and sometimes for a really good reason the tie of matrimony is severed, and a quarrelsome division destroys the property of brothers. Monks alone maintain a lasting union in intimacy, and possess all things in common,as they hold that everything that belongs to their brethren is their own, and that everything which is their own is their brethren's. If then the grace of our love is compared to those affections where the bond of union is a carnal love, certainly it is an hundred times sweeter and finer. There will indeed also be gained from conjugal continence a pleasure that is an hundred times greater than that which arises from the union of the sexes. And instead of that joy, which a man experiences from the possession of a single field of house,he will enjoy a delight in riches a hundred times greater, if he passes over to the adoption of sons of God, and possesses as his own all things which belong to the eternal Father, and asserts in heart and soul after the fash- ion of that true Son: \"All things that the Father hath are mine;\"[fn-68-P6834_2447022:59-nf] and if no longer tried by that criminal anxiety in distractions and cares, but free from care and glad at heart he succeeds everywhere to his own, hearing daily the announcement made to him by the Apostle: \"For all things are yours, whether the world, or things present, or things to come;\" and by Solomon: \"The faithful man has a whole world of riches.\"[fn-68-P6835_2447401:60-nf] You have then that recompense of an hundredfold brought out by the greatness of the value, and the difference of the character that cannot be estimated. For if for a fixed weight of brass or iron or some still commoner metal, one had given in exchange the same weight only in gold, he would appear to have given much more than an hundredfold. And so when for the scorn of delights and earthly affections there is made a recompense of spiritual joy and the gladness of a most precious love, even if the actual amount be the same, yet it is an hundred times better and grander. And to make this plainer by frequent repetition: I used formerly to have a wife in the lustful passion of desire: I now have one in honourable sanctification and the true love of Christ. The woman is but one, but the value of the love has increased an hundredfold. But if instead of distrusting anger and wrath you have regard to constant gentleness and patience, instead of the stress of anxiety and trouble, peace and freedom from care, insteadof the fruitless and criminal vexation of this world the salutary fruits of sorrow, instead of the vanity of temporal joy the richness of spiritual delights, you will see in the change of these feelings a recompense of an hundredfold. And if we compare with the short-lived and fleeting pleasure of each sin the benefits of the opposite virtues the increased delights will prove that these are an hundred times better. For in counting on your fingers you transfer the number of an hundred from the left hand to the right and though you seem to keep the same arrangement of the fingers yet there is a great increase in the amount of the quantity.[fn-68-P6836_2449091:61-nf] For the result will be that we who seemed to bear the form of the goats on the left hand, will be removed and gain the reward of the sheep on the right hand. Now let us pass on to consider the nature of those things which Christ gives back to us in this world for our scorn of worldly advantages, more particularly according to the Gospel of Mark who says: \"There is no man who hath left house or brethren or sisters or mother or children or lands for My sake and the gospel's sake, who shall not receive an hundred times as much now in this time: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come life eternal.\"[fn-68-P6837_2449809:62-nf] For he who for the sake of Christ's name disregards the love of a single father or mother or child, and gives himself over to the purest love of all who serve Christ, will receive an hundred times the amount of brethren and kinsfolk; since instead of but one he will begin to have so many fathers and brethren bound to him by a still more fervent and admirable affection. He also will be enriched with an increased possession of lands, who has given up a single house for the love of Christ, and possesses countless homes in monasteries as his own, to whatever part of the world he may retire, as to his own house. For how can he fail to receive an hundredfold, and, if it is not wrong to add somewhat to our Lord's words, more than an hundredfold, who gives up the faithless and compulsory service of ten or twenty slaves and relies on the spontaneous attendance of so many noble and free born men? And that this is so you could prove by your own experience, as since you have each left but one father and mother and home, you have gained without any effort or care, in any part of the world to which you have come, countless fathers and mothers and brethren, as well as houses and lands and most faithful servants, who receive you as their masters, and welcome, and respect, and take care of you with the utmost attention. But, I say that deservedly and confidently will the saints enjoy this service, if they have first submitted themselves and everything they have by a voluntary offering for the service of the brethren. For, as the Lord says, they will freely receive back that which they themselves have bestowed on others. But if a man has not first offered this with true humility to his companions, how can he calmly endure to have it offered to him by others, when he knows that he is burdened rather than helped by their services, because he prefers to receive attention from the brethren rather than to give it to them?","title":"XXIV.

Much more then did Peter say this without meaning that the Essence of the Word was a work; for he knew Him to be God's Son, confessing, `Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God[fn-59-P5919_2363450:97-nf] ;' but he meant His Kingdom and Lordship which was formed and came to be according to grace, and was relatively to us. For while saying this, he was not silent about the Son of God's everlasting Godhead which is the Father's; but He had said already, that He had poured the Spirit on us; now to give the Spirit with authority, is not in the power of creature or work, but the Spirit is God's Gift[fn-59-P5920_2363867:98-nf] .

We have gone through thus much before the passage in the Proverbs, resisting the insensate fables which their hearts have invented, that they may know that the Son of God ought not to be called a creature, and may learn lightly to read what admits in truth of a right[fn-61-P6150_2452614:287-nf] explanation. For it is written, `The Lord created me a beginning of His ways, for His works[fn-61-P6151_2452925:288-nf] ;' since, however, these are proverbs, and it is expressed in the way of proverbs, we must not expound them nakedly in their first sense, but we must inquire into the person, and thus religiously put the sense on it. For what is said in proverbs, is not said plainly, but is put forth latently[fn-61-P6152_2453502:289-nf] , as the Lord Himself has taught us in the Gospel according to John, saying, `These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs, but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but openly[fn-61-P6153_2453776:290-nf] .' Therefore it is necessary to unfold the sense[fn-61-P6154_2453846:291-nf] of what is said, and to seek it as something hidden, and not nakedly to expound as if the meaning were spoken `plainly,' lest by a false interpretation we wander from the truth. If then what is written be about Angel, or any other of things originate, as concerning one of us who are works, let it be said, `created me;' but if it be the Wisdom of God, in whom all things originate have been framed, that speaks concerning Itself, what ought we to understand but that `He created' means nothing contrary to `He begat?' Nor, as forgetting that It is Creator and Framer, or ignorant of the difference between the Creator and the creatures, does It number Itself among the creatures; but It signifies a certain sense, as in proverbs, not `plainly,' but latent; which It inspired the saints to use in prophecy, while soon after It doth Itself give the meaning of `He created' in other but parallel expressions, saying, `Wisdom made herself a house[fn-61-P6155_2455048:292-nf] .'

For that Son whom He declares not to know the day, Him He declares to know the Father; for `No one,' He says, `knoweth the Father save the Son[fn-68-P6882_2731470:327-nf] .'

Therefore He, being the Framer of the universe, knows of what nature, and of what magnitude, and with what limits, the Father has willed it to be made; and in the how much and how far is included its period. And again, if all that is the Father's, is the Son's (and this He Himself has[fn-68-P6884_2732224:329-nf] said), and it is the Father's attribute to know the day, it is plain that the Son too knows it, having this proper to Him from the Father.

And it is not wonderful if He, through whom all things were made, and in whom the universe consists, Himself knows what has been brought to be, and when the end will be of each and of all together; rather is it wonderful that this audacity, suitable as it is to the madness of the Ariomaniacs, should have forced us to have recourse to so long a defence. For ranking the Son of God, the Eternal Word, among things originate, they are not far from venturing to maintain that the Father Himself is second to the creation; for if He who knows the Father knows not the day nor the hour, I fear lest the knowledge of the creation, or rather of the lower portion of it, be greater, as they in their madness would say, than knowledge concerning the Father.","title":"Discourse III","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":16,"verse":28,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_62_discourse_iv","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"30","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"22.

Now, He has the prerogative of creating and making, of Eternity, of omnipotence, of immutability. But things originate cannot have the power of making, for they are creatures; nor eternity, for their existence has a beginning; nor of omnipotence and immutability, for they are under sway, and of changeable nature, as the Scriptures say. Well then, if these prerogatives belong to the Son, they clearly do so, not on account of His virtue, as said above, but essentially, even as the synod said, `He is of no other essence' but of the Father's, to whom these prerogatives are proper. But what can that be which is proper to the Father's essence, and an offspring from it, or what name can we give it, save `coessential?' For that which a man sees in the Father, that sees he also in the Son; and that not by participation, but essentially. And this is [the meaning of] `I and the Father are one,' and `he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.' Here especially once more it is easy to shew their folly. If it is from virtue, the antecedent of willing and not willing, and of moral progress, that you hold the Son to be like the Father; while these things fall under the category of quality; clearly you call God compound of quality and essence. But who will tolerate you when you say this? For God, who compounded all things to give them being, is not compound, nor of similar nature to the things made by Him through the Word. Far be the thought. For He is simple essence, in which quality is not, nor, as James says, `any variableness or shadow of turning[fn-78-P7895_3157784:47-nf] .' Accordingly, if it is shewn that it is not from virtue (for in God there is no quality, neither is there in the Son), then He must be proper to God's essence. And this you will certainly admit if mental apprehension is not utterly destroyed in you. But what is that which is proper to and identical with the essence of God, and an Offspring from it by nature, if not by this very fact coessential with Him that begat it?

Would\nthat it were now given me to throw myself round (perixuqhnai) the body of\nPaul, and be riveted to the tomb, and to see the dust of that body that \"filled up that which was\nlacking\" after \"Christ\" Col. i. 24), that bore \"the marks\" (stigmata,)\n(Gal. vi. 17) that sowed the Gospel everywhere yea, the dust of that body through which he ran to and\nfro everywhere! the dust of that body through which Christ spoke, and the Light shone forth more\nbrilliant than any lightning, and the voice started out, more awful than any thunder to the devils!\nthrough which he uttered that blessed voice, saying, \"I could wish that myself were accursed, for my\nbrethren\" (Rom. ix. 3), through which he spake \"before kings, and was not ashamed!\" (Ps. cxix. 46)\nthrough which we come to know Paul through which also Paul's Master! Not so awful to us is the\nthunder, as was that voice to the demons! For if they shuddered at his clothes (Acts xix. 12), much\nmore did they at his voice. This led them away captive, this cleansed out the world, this put a stop\nto diseases, cast out vice, lifted the truth on high, had Christ riding[fn-34-P3466_3148144:10-nf] upon it, and everywhere went about with Him; and\nwhat the Cherubim were, this was Paul's voice, for as He was seated upon those Powers, so was He upon\nPaul's tongue. For it had become worthy of receiving Christ, by speaking those things only which were\nacceptable to Christ, and flying as the Seraphim to height unspeakable! for what more lofty than that\nvoice which says, \"For I am persuaded that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things\npresent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate\nus from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus?\" (Rom. viii. 38, 39.) What pinions doth not this\ndiscourse seem to thee to have? what eyes? (Ez. x. 12.) It was owing to this that he said, \"for we\nare not ignorant of his devices.\" (2 Cor. ii. 11.) Owing to this did the devils flee not only at\nhearing him speak, but even at seeing his garments. This is the mouth, the dust whereof I would fain\nsee, through which Christ spake the great and secret things, and greater than in His own person, (for\nas He wrought, so He also spake greater things by the disciples,[fn-34-P3467_3149417:11-nf] ) through which the Spirit gave those wondrous\noracles to the world! For what good thing did not that mouth effect? Devils it drave out, sins it\nloosed, tyrants it muzzled, philosophers' mouths it stopped, the world it brought over to God,\nsavages it persuaded to learn wisdom, all the whole order of the earth it altered. Things in Heaven\ntoo it disposed what way it listed (1 Cor. v. 3, 4), binding whom it would, and loosing in the other\nworld, \"according unto the power given unto it.\" (2 Cor. xiii. 10.) Nor is it that mouth only, but\nthe heart too would fain see the dust of, which a man would not do wrong to call the heart of the\nworld, and a fountain of countless blessings, and a beginning, and element of our life. For the\nspirit of life was furnished out of it all, and was distributed through the members of Christ, not as\nbeing sent forth by arteries, but by a free choice of good deeds. This heart was so large, as to take\nin entire cities, and peoples, and nations. \"For my heart\" he says, \"is enlarged.\" (ib. vi. 11.) Yet\neven a heart thus large, did this very charity that enlarged it many a time straiten and oppress. For\nhe says, \"Out of much affliction (qliyewj) and anguish (sunoxhj) of heart I wrote unto you.\" (ib. ii. 4.) I were desirous to see that\nheart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second\ntime with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,[fn-34-P3468_3150916:12-nf] (\"for the pure in heart,\" He says, \"shall see\nGod,\") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, (\"for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,\") (Ps.\nli. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than\nthe sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,\n(\"for rivers,\" it says, \"of living water shall flow out of his belly,\") (John vii. 38) wherein was a\nfountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not\nrivers only, but even fountains of[fn-34-P3469_3151577:13-nf] tears,\nissued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for \"I live,\" he says, \"yet not I,\nbut Christ liveth in me,\" (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy\nSpirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by\nany means \"I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2\nCor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;\") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared\nfor itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, \"lest by any means after having preached to\nothers I myself should be a castaway,\" (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, \"I am persuaded that neither angels nor\npowers shall be able to separate us;\") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love\nChrist as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'\ntears, (for he says, \"what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?\") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most\nenduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour! (1\nThess. ii. 17; iii. 10.) Fain would I see the dust of hands that were in a chain, through the\nimposition of which the Spirit was furnished, through which the divine writings were written, (for\n\"behold how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand:\" (Gal. vi. 11) and again, \"The\nsalutation of me Paul with mine own hand,\") (1 Cor. xvi. 21) of those hands at the sight of which the\nserpent \"fell off into the fire.\" (Acts xxviii. 5.) Fain would I see the dust of those eyes which\nwere blinded gloriously, which recovered their sight again for the salvation of the world; which even\nin the body were counted worthy to see Christ, which saw earthly things, yet saw them not, which saw\nthe things which are not seen, which saw not sleep, which were watchful at midnight, which were not\neffected as eyes are. I would also see the dust of those feet, which ran through the world and were\nnot weary; which were bound in the stocks when the prison shook, which went through parts habitable\nor uninhabited, which walked on so many journeys. And why need I speak of single parts? Fain would I\nsee the tomb, where the armor of righteousness is laid up, the armor of light, the limbs which now\nlive, but which in life were made dead; and in all whereof Christ lived, which were crucified to the\nworld, which were Christ's members, which were clad in Christ, were a temple of the Spirit, an holy\nbuilding, \"bound in the Spirit,\" (Acts xx. 22) riveted to the fear of God, which had the marks of\nChrist. This body is a wall to that City, which is safer than all towers, and than thousands of\nbattlements. And with it is that of Peter. For he honored him while alive. For he \"went up to see\nPeter.\" (Gal. i. 18) and therefore even when departed grace deigned to give him the same abode with\nhim. Fain would I see the spiritual Lion. For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) (Cant. ii. 15) forth\nfire (pur afieij) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of\ndemons and philosophers, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the\ndevil. (Luke xiii. 32.) For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he\nfeared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a\ndistance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched\nhim out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught\n\"not to blaspheme.\" (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,\nrousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, \"We wrestle not against flesh\nand blood, but against principalities and powers.\" (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in\nheavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things\nin the Heavens. And to others, he says, \"Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the\nthings of this life?\" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul\nwas a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But\nbecause he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the\nAngels. And so if we too would rouse ourselves up some little, and kindle in ourselves that fire, we\nshall be able to emulate that holy man. For were this impossible, he would never have cried aloud,\nand said, \"Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ.\" (1 Cor. xi. 1.) Let us not then admire him\nonly, or be struck with him only, but imitate him, that we too may, when we depart hence, be counted\nworthy to see him, and to share the glory unutterable, which God grant that we may all attain to by\nthe grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom, and with Whom, be glory to the\nFather, with the Holy Ghost, now and evermore.

For if when here he loved men so, that when he had the choice of departing\nand being with Christ, he chose to be here, much more will he there display a warmer affection. I\nlove Rome even for this, although indeed one has other grounds for praising it, both for its\ngreatness, and its antiquity, and its beauty, and its populousness, and for its power, and its\nwealth, and for its successes in war.

And as a body great and strong, it hath as two glistening eyes\nthe bodies of these Saints. Not so bright is the heaven, when the sun sends forth his rays, as is the\ncity of Rome, sending out these two lights into all parts of the world. From thence will Paul be\ncaught up, from thence Peter. Just bethink you, and shudder (fricate) at\nthe thought of what a sight Rome will see, when Paul ariseth suddenly from that deposit, together\nwith Peter, and is lifted up to meet the Lord.

Which things must all now be considered by us, that no one may desire anything from the world that is now dying, but may follow Christ, who both lives for ever, and quickens His servants, who are established in the faith of His name. For there comes the time, beloved brethren, which our Lord long ago foretold and taught us was approaching, saying, \"The time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these things they will do unto you, because they have not known the Father nor me. But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.\"[fn-58-P5808_1809993:7-nf] Nor let any one wonder that we are harassed with constant persecutions, and continually tried with increasing afflictions, when the Lord before predicted that these things would happen in the last times, and has instructed us for the warfare by the teaching and exhortation of His words. Peter also, His apostle, has taught that persecutions occur for the sake of our being proved, and that we also should, by the example of righteous men who have gone before us, be joined to the love of God by death and sufferings. For he wrote in his epistle, and said, \"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is thing happened unto you; but as often as ye partake in Christ's sufferings, rejoice in all things, that when His glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached in the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the name of the majesty and power of the Lord resteth on you, which indeed on their part is blasphemed, but on our part is glorified.\"[fn-58-P5809_1811010:8-nf] Now the apostles taught us those things which they themselves also learnt from the Lord's precepts and the heavenly commands, the Lord Himself thus strengthening us, and saying, \"There is no man that hath left house, or land, or parents, or brethren, or sisters, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive sevenfold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.\"[fn-58-P5810_1811450:9-nf] And again He says, \"Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and shall separate you from their company, and shall cast you out, and shall reproach your name as evil for the Son of man's sake.

We may give yet another illustration, if it seems good to you. A certain man, the head of a household, and possessed of great riches, was minded to journey abroad for a time, and promised to his sons that he would send them some one who would take his place, and divide among them equally the substance falling to them. And, in truth, not long after that, he did despatch to them a certain trustworthy and righteous and true man. And on his arrival, this man took charge of the whole substance, and first of all exerted himself to arrange it and administer it, giving himself great labour in journeying, and even[fn-34-P3488_951658:224-nf] working diligently with his own hands, and toiling like a servant for the good of the estate. Afterwards feeling that his end was at hand,[fn-34-P3489_951885:225-nf] the man wrote out a will, demitting the inheritance to the relations and all the next of kin; and he gave them his seals, and called them together one by one by name, and charged them to preserve the inheritance, and to take care of the substance, and to administer it rightly, even as they had received it, and to take their use of its goods and fruits, as they were themselves left its owners and heirs. If, moreover, any person were to ask to be allowed to benefit by the fruits of this field, they were to show themselves indulgent to such. But if, on the other hand, any one were to declare himself partner in the heirship with them, and were to make his demands on that ground,[fn-34-P3490_952777:226-nf] they were to keep aloof from him, and pronounce him an alien; and further, they were to hold that the individual who desired to be received among them ought all the more on that account to do work.[fn-34-P3491_953209:227-nf] Well, then, granting that all these things have been well and rightly disposed of and settled, and that they have continued in that condition for a very long time, how shall we deal with one who presents himself well-nigh three hundred years after, and sets up his claim to the heirship? Shall we not cast him off from us? Shall we not justly pronounce such a one an alien-one who cannot prove himself to have belonged to those related to our Master, who never was with our departed Lord in the hour of His sickness, who never walked in the funeral procession of the Crucified, who never stood by the sepulchre, who has no knowledge whatsoever of the manner or the character of His departure, and who, in fine, is now desirous of getting access to the storehouse of corn without presenting any token from him who placed it under lock and seal? Shall we not cast him off from us like a robber and a thief, and thrust him out of our number by all possible means? Yet this man is now in our presence, and falls to produce any of the credentials which we have summarized in what we have already said, and declares that he is the Paraclete whose mission was presignified by Jesus. And by this assertion, in his ignorance perchance, he will make out Jesus Himself to be a liar;[fn-34-P3492_954520:228-nf] for thus He who once said that He would send the Paraclete no long time after, will be proved only to have sent this person, if we accept the testimony which he bears to himself, after an interval of three hundred years and more.[fn-34-P3493_954875:229-nf] In the day of judgment, then, what will those say to Jesus who have departed this life from that time on to the present period? Will they not meet Him with words like these: \"Do not punish its rigorously if we have failed to do Thy works. For why, when Thou didst promise to send the Paraclete under Tiberius Caesar, to convince us of sin and of righteousness,[fn-34-P3494_955590:230-nf] didst Thou send Him only under Probus the Roman emperor, and didst leave us orphaned, not with-standing that Thou didst say, 'I will not leave you comfortless (orphaned), '[fn-34-P3495_955783:231-nf] and after Thou hadst also assured us that Thou wouldest send the Paraclete presently after Thy departure? What could we orphans do, having no guardian? We have committed no fault; it is Thou that hast deceived us.\" But away with such a supposition in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour of every soul.[fn-34-P3496_956117:232-nf] For He did not confine Himself to mere promises;[fn-34-P3497_956335:233-nf] but when He had once said, \"I go to my Father, and I send the Paraclete to you,\"[fn-34-P3498_956808:234-nf] straightway He sent (that gift of the Paraclete), dividing and imparting the same to His disciples,-bestowing it, however, in greater fulness upon Paul.[fn-34-P3499_956991:235-nf] ","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":16,"verse":14,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_90_the_acts_of_the_disputation_with_the_heresiarch_manes_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"43","folder":"ANF-06","text":"34. I think that you cannot fail to understand this too, that the word \"father\" is but a single term indeed, and yet one admitting of being understood in various ways. For one is called father, as being the parent of those children whom he has begotten in a natural way; another is called father, as being the guardian of children whom he has but brought up; and some, again, are called fathers in respect of the privileged standing accruing through time or age. Hence our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is said to have a variety of fathers: for David was called His father, and Joseph was reckoned to be His father, while neither of these two was His father in respect of the actuality of nature. For David is called His father as touching the prerogative of time and age,[fn-35-P3594_998366:322-nf] and Joseph is designated His father as concerning the law of upbringing; but God Himself is His only Father by nature, who was pleased to make all things manifest in short space[fn-35-P3595_998583:323-nf] to us by His word. And our Lord Jesus Christ, making no tarrying,[fn-35-P3596_998667:324-nf] in the space of one year[fn-35-P3597_998724:325-nf] restored multitudes of the sick to health, and gave back the dead to the light of life; and He did indeed embrace all things in the power of His own word.[fn-35-P3598_999144:326-nf] And wherein, forsooth, did He make any tarrying, so that we should have to believe Him to have waited so long, even to these days, before He actually sent the Paraclete?[fn-35-P3599_999353:327-nf] Nay, rather, as has been already said above, He gave proof of His presence with us forthwith, and did most abundantly impart Himself to Paul, whose testimony we also believe when he says, \"Unto me only is this grace given.\"[fn-36-P3600_999677:328-nf] For this is he who formerly was a persecutor of the Church of God, but who afterwards appeared openly before all men as a faithful minister of the Paraclete; by whose instrumentality His singular clemency was made known to all men, in such wise that even to us who some time were without hope the largess of His gifts has come. For which of us could have hoped that Paul, the persecutor and enemy of the Church, would prove its defender and guardian? Yea, and not that alone, but that he would become also its ruler, the founder and architect of the churches? Wherefore after him, and after those who were with Himself-that is, the disciples-we are not to look for the advent of any other (such), according to the Scriptures; for our Lord Jesus Christ says of this Paraclete, \"He shall receive of mine.\"[fn-36-P3601_1000524:329-nf] Him therefore He selected as an acceptable vessel; and He sent this Paul to us in the Spirit. Into him the Spirit was poured;[fn-36-P3602_1000671:330-nf] and as that Spirit could not abide upon all men, but only on Him who was born of Mary the mother of God, so that Spirit, the Paraclete, could not come into any other, but could only come upon the apostles and the sainted Paul. \"For he is a chosen vessel,\" He says, \"unto me, to bear my name before kings and the Gentiles.\"[fn-36-P3603_1001283:331-nf] The apostle himself, too, states the same thing in his first epistle, where he says: \"According to the grace that is given to me of God, that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering[fn-36-P3604_1001546:332-nf] the Gospel of God.\"[fn-36-P3605_1001624:333-nf] \"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.\"[fn-36-P3606_1001745:334-nf] And again: \"For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me by word and deed.\"[fn-36-P3607_1001883:335-nf] \"I am the last of all the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle. But by the grace of God I am what I am.\"[fn-36-P3608_1002022:336-nf] And it, is his wish to have to deal with[fn-36-P3609_1002240:337-nf] those who sought the proof of that Christ who spake in him, for this reason, that the Paraclete was in him: and as having obtained His gift of grace, and as being enriched with magnificent, honour,[fn-36-P3610_1002458:338-nf] he says: \"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for strength is made perfect in weakness.\"[fn-36-P3611_1002714:339-nf] Again, that it was the Paraclete Himself who was in Paul, is indicated by our Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel, when He says: \"If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray my Father, and He shall give you another Comforter.\"[fn-36-P3612_1002971:340-nf] In these words He points to the Paraclete Himself, for He speaks of \"another\" Comforter. And hence we have given credit to Paul, and have hearkened to him when he says, \"Or[fn-36-P3613_1003169:341-nf] seek ye a proof of Christ i speaking in me? \"[fn-36-P3614_1003227:342-nf] and when he expresses himself in similar terms, of which we have already spoken above. Thus, too, he seals his testament for us as for his faithful heirs, and like a father he addresses us in these words in his Epistle to the Corintians: \"I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures; and that He was seen of Cephas, then of the eleven apostles:[fn-36-P3615_1003765:343-nf] after that He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that He was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all He was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. For I am the last of the apostles.\"[fn-36-P3616_1004100:344-nf] \"Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.\"[fn-36-P3617_1004213:345-nf] And again, in delivering over to his heirs that inheritance which he gained first himself, he says: \"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ,[fn-36-P3618_1004538:346-nf] whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another Spirit, which we have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.

For His Nature, which is invisible and shared in common with the Father and the Son, showed the character of His gift and work by the outward sign that pleased Him, but kept His essential property within His own Godhead: because human sight can no more perceive the Holy Ghost than it can the Father or the Son. For in the Divine Trinity nothing is unlike or unequal, and all that can be thought concerning Its substance admits of no diversity either in power or glory or eternity. And while in the property of each Person the Father is one, the Son is another, and the Holy Ghost is another, yet the Godhead is not distinct and different; for whilst the Son is the Only begotten of the Father, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Father and the Son, not in the way that every creature is the creature of the Father and the Son, but as living and having power with Both, and eternally subsisting of That Which is the Father and the Son[fn-39-P3973_1014605:5-nf] . And hence when the Lord before the day of His Passion promised the coming of the Holy Spirit to His disciples, He said, \"I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of Truth shall have come, He shall guide you into all the Truth. For He shall not speak from Himself, but whatsoever He shall have heard, He shall speak and shall announce things to come unto you.

In them let no times, no grades, no differences be imagined[fn-39-P3975_1015730:7-nf] , and, if no one can explain that which is true concerning God, let no one dare to assert what is not true. For it is more excusable not to make a full statement concerning His ineffable Nature than to frame an actually wrong definition. And so whatever loyal hearts can conceive of the Father's eternal and unchangeable Glory, let them at the same time understand it of the Son and of the Holy Ghost without any separation or difference.

What the Father has the Son also has, and what the Father and the Son have, the Holy Ghost also has, because the whole Trinity together is One God.

In the passage in Matthew, then, the Lord made no mention of His own Person, as a matter beyond controversy, and said that the angels knew not and that His Father alone knew, tacitly asserting the knowledge of His Father to be His own knowledge too, because of what He had said elsewhere. \"as the Father knoweth me even so know I the Father,\"[fn-55-P5511_1734103:16-nf] and if the Father has complete knowledge of the Son, nothing excepted, so that He knows all knowledge to dwell in Him, He will clearly be known as fully by the Son with all His inherent wisdom and all His knowledge of things to come.

No man knoweth, neither the angels of God; nor yet the Son would have known unless the Father had known: that is, the cause of the Son's knowing comes from the Father. To a fair hearer there is no violence in this interpretation, because the wore \"only\" is not added as it is in Matthew.
