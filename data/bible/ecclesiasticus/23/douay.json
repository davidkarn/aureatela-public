{"verses":["O Lord, father, and sovereign ruler of my life, leave me not to\ntheir counsel:  nor suffer me to fall by them.","Who will set scourges over my thoughts, and the discipline of\nwisdom over my heart, that they spare me not in their ignorances, and\nthat their sins may not appear:","Lest my ignorances increase, and my offences be multiplied, and\nmy sins abound, and I fall before my adversaries, and my enemy rejoice\nover me?","O Lord, father, and God of my life, leave me not to their\ndevices.","Give me not haughtiness of my eyes, and turn away from me all\ncoveting.","Take from me the greediness of the belly, and let not the lusts\nof the flesh take hold of me, and give me not over to a shameless and\nfoolish mind.","Hear, O ye children, the discipline of the mouth, and he that\nwill keep it shall not perish by his lips, nor be brought to fall into\nmost wicked works.","A sinner is caught in his own vanity, and the proud and the evil\nspeakers shall fall thereby.","Let not thy mouth be accustomed to swearing:  for in it there are\nmany falls.","And let not the naming of God be usual in thy mouth, and meddle\nnot with the names of saints, for thou shalt not escape free from them.","For as a slave daily put to the question, is never without a\nblue mark:  so every one that sweareth, and nameth, shall not be wholly\npure from sin.","A man that sweareth much, shall be filled with iniquity, and a\nscourge shall not depart from his house.","And if he make it void, his sin shall be upon him, and if he\ndissemble it, he offendeth double:","And if he swear in vain, he shall not be justified:  for his\nhouse shall be filled with his punishment.","There is also another speech opposite to death, let it not be\nfound in the inheritance of Jacob.","For from the merciful all these things shall be taken away, and\nthey shall not wallow in sins.","Let not thy mouth be accustomed to indiscreet speech:  for\ntherein is the word of sin.","Remember thy father and thy mother, for thou sittest in the\nmidst of great men:","Lest God forget thee in their sight, and thou, by thy daily\ncustom be infatuated and suffer reproach:  and wish that thou hadst not\nbeen born, and curse the day of thy nativity.","The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words, will never be\ncorrected all the days of his life.","Two sorts of men multiply sins, and the third bringeth wrath and\ndestruction.","A hot soul is a burning fire, it will never be quenched, till it\ndevour some thing.","And a man that is wicked in the mouth of his flesh, will not\nleave off till he hath kindled a fire.","To a man that is a fornicator all bread is sweet, he will not be\nweary of sinning unto the end.","Every man that passeth beyond his own bed, despising his own\nsoul, and saying:  Who seeth me?","Darkness compasseth me about, and the walls cover me, and no man\nseeth me:  whom do I fear?  the most High will not remember my sins.","And he understandeth not that his eye seeth all things, for such\na man's fear driveth him from the fear of God, and the eyes of men\nfearing him:","And he knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are far brighter\nthan the sun, beholding round about all the ways of men, and the bottom\nof the deep, and looking into the hearts of men, into the most hidden\nparts.","For all things were known to the Lord God, before they were\ncreated:  so also after they were perfected he beholdeth all things.","This man shall be punished in the streets of the city, and he\nshall be chased as a colt:  and where he suspected not, he shall be\ntaken.","And he shall be in disgrace with all men, because he understood\nnot the fear of the Lord.","So every woman also that leaveth her husband, and bringeth in an\nheir by another:","For first she hath been unfaithful to the law of the most High:\nand secondly, she hath offended against her husband:  thirdly, she hath\nfornicated in adultery, and hath gotten her children of another man.","This woman shall be brought into the assembly, and inquisition\nshall be made of her children.","Her children shall not take root, and her branches shall bring\nforth no fruit.","She shall leave her memory to be cursed, and her infamy shall\nnot be blotted out.","And they that remain shall know, that there is nothing better\nthan the fear of God:  and that there is nothing sweeter than to have\nregard to the commandments of the Lord.","It is great glory to follow the Lord:  for length of days shall\nbe received from him."]}
