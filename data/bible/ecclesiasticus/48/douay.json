{"verses":["And Elias the prophet stood up, as a fire, and his word burnt\nlike a torch.","He brought a famine upon them, and they that provoked him in\ntheir envy, were reduced to a small number, for they could not endure\nthe commandments of the Lord.","By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, and he brought\ndown fire from heaven thrice.","Thus was Elias magnified in his wondrous works.  And who can glory\nlike to thee?","Who raisedst up a dead man from below, from the lot of death, by\nthe word of the Lord God.","Who broughtest down kings to destruction, and brokest easily\ntheir power in pieces, and the glorious from their bed.","Who heardest judgment in Sina, and in Horeb the judgments of\nvengeance.","Who anointedst kings to penance, and madest prophets successors\nafter thee.","Who wast taken up in a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot of fiery\nhorses.","Who art registered in the judgments of times to appease the\nwrath of the Lord, to reconcile the heart of the father to the son, and\nto restore the tribes of Jacob.","Blessed are they that saw thee, and were honoured with thy\nfriendship.","For we live only in our life, but after death our name shall not\nbe such.","Elias was indeed covered with the whirlwind, and his spirit was\nfilled up in Eliseus:  in his days he feared not the prince, and no man\nwas more powerful than he.","No word could overcome him, and after death his body prophesied.","In his life he did great wonders, and in death he wrought\nmiracles.","For all this the people repented not, neither did they depart\nfrom their sins till they were cast out of their land, and were\nscattered through all the earth.","And there was left but a small people, and a prince in the house\nof David.","Some of these did that which pleased God:  but others committed\nmany sins.","Ezechias fortified his city, and brought in water into the midst\nthereof, and he digged a rock with iron, and made a well for water.","In his days Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and lifted\nup his hand against them, and he stretched out his hand against Sion,\nand became proud through his power.","Then their hearts and hands trembled, and they were in pain as\nwomen in travail.","And they called upon the Lord who is merciful, and spreading\ntheir hands, they lifted them up to heaven:  and the holy Lord God\nquickly heard their voice.","He was not mindful of their sins, neither did he deliver them up\nto their enemies, but he purified them by the hand of Isaias, the holy\nprophet.","He overthrew the army of the Assyrians, and the angel of the\nLord destroyed them.","For Ezechias did that which pleased God, and walked valiantly in\nthe way of David his father, which Isaias, the great prophet, and\nfaithful in the sight of God, had commanded him.","In his days the sun wen backward, and he lengthened the king's\nlife.","With a great spirit he saw the things that are to come to pass\nat last, and comforted the mourners in Sion.","He showed what should come to pass for ever, and secret things\nbefore they came."]}
