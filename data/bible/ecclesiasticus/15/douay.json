{"verses":["He that feareth God, will do good:  and he that possesseth\njustice, shall lay hold on her,","And she will meet him as an honourable mother, and will receive\nhim as a wife married of a virgin.","With the bread of life and understanding, she shall feed him, and\ngive him the water of wholesome wisdom to drink:  and she shall be made\nstrong in him, and he shall not be moved.","And she shall hold him fast, and he shall not be confounded:  and\nshe shall exalt him among his neighbours.","And in the midst of the church she shall open his mouth, and\nshall fill him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding, and shall\nclothe him with a robe of glory.","She shall heap upon him a treasure of joy and gladness, and shall\ncause him to inherit an everlasting name.","But foolish men shall not obtain her, and wise men shall meet\nher, foolish men shall not see her:  for she is far from pride and\ndeceit.","Lying men shall be mindful of her:  but men that speak truth shall\nbe found with her, and shall advance, even till they come to the sight\nof God.","Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner:","For wisdom came forth from God:  for praise shall be with the\nwisdom of God, and shall abound in a faithful mouth, and the sovereign\nLord will give praise unto it.","Say not:  It is through God, that she is not with me:  for do not\nthou the things that he hateth.","Say not:  He hath caused me to err:  for he hath no need of wicked\nmen.","The Lord hateth all abomination of error, and they that fear him\nshall not love it.","God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his\nown counsel.","He added his commandments and precepts.","If thou wilt keep the commandments and perform acceptable\nfidelity for ever, they shall preserve thee.","He hath set water and fire before thee:  stretch forth thy hand\nto which thou wilt.","Before man is life and death, good and evil, that which he shall\nchoose shall be given him:","For the wisdom of God is great, and he is strong in power,\nseeing all men without ceasing.","The eyes of the Lord are towards them that fear him, and he\nknoweth al the work of man.","He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, and he hath given no\nman license to sin;","For he desireth not a multitude of faithless and unprofitable\nchildren."]}
