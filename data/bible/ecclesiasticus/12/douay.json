{"verses":["If thou do good, know to whom thou dost it, and there shall be\nmuch thanks for thy good deeds.","Do good to the just, and thou shalt find great recompense:  and if\nnot of him, assuredly of the Lord.","For there is no good for him that is always occupied in evil, and\nthat giveth no alms:  for the Highest hateth sinners, and hath mercy on\nthe penitent.","Give to the merciful and uphold not the sinner:  God will repay\nvengeance to the ungodly and to sinners, and keep them against the day\nof vengeance.","Give to the good, and receive not a sinner.","Do good to the humble, and give not to the ungodly:  hold back thy\nbread, and give it not to him, lest thereby he overmaster thee.","For thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou\nshalt have done to him:  for the Highest also hateth sinners, and will\nrepay vengeance to the ungodly.","A friend shall not be known in prosperity, and an enemy shall not\nbe hidden in adversity.","In the prosperity of a man, his enemies are grieved:  and a friend\nis known in his adversity.","Never trust thy enemy for as a brass pot his wickedness rusteth:","Though he humble himself and go crouching, yet take good heed\nand beware of him.","Set him not by thee, neither let him sit on thy right hand, lest\nhe turn into thy place, and seek to take thy seat and at the last thou\nacknowledge my words, and be pricked with my sayings.","Who will pity an enchanter struck by a serpent, or any that come\nnear wild beasts?  so is it with him that keepeth company with a wicked\nman, and is involved in his sins.","For an hour he will abide with thee:  but if thou begin to\ndecline, he will not endure it.","An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he\nlieth in wait, to throw thee into a pit.","An enemy weepeth with his eyes:  but if he find an opportunity he\nwill not be satisfied with blood:","And if evils come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first.","An enemy hath tears in his eyes, and while he pretendeth to help\nthee, will undermine thy feet.","He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper much,\nand change his countenance."]}
