{"verses":["Set not thy heart upon unjust possessions, and say not:  I have\nenough to live on:  for it shall be of no service in the time of\nvengeance and darkness.","Follow not in thy strength the desires of thy heart:","And say not:  How mighty am I?  and who shall bring me under for my\ndeeds?  for God will surely take revenge.","Say not:  I have sinned, and what harm hath befallen me?  for the\nmost High is a patient rewarder.","Be not without fear about sin forgiven, and add not sin upon sin:","And say not:  The mercy of the Lord is great, he will have mercy on\nthe multitude of my sins.","For mercy and wrath quickly come from him, and his wrath looketh\nupon sinners.","Delay not to be converted to the Lord, and defer it not from day\nto day.","For his wrath shall come on a sudden, and in the time of vengeance\nhe will destroy thee.","Be not anxious for goods unjustly gotten:  for they shall not\nprofit thee in the day of calamity and revenge.","Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way:  for so is\nevery sinner proved by a double tongue.","Be steadfast in the way of the Lord, and in the truth of thy\njudgment, and in knowledge, and let the word of peace and justice keep\nwith thee.","Be meek to hear the word, that thou mayst understand:  and return\na true answer with wisdom.","If thou have understanding, answer thy neighbour:  but if not, let\nthy hand be upon thy mouth, lest thou be surprised in an unskilful\nword, and be confounded.","Honour and glory is in the word of the wise, but the tongue of\nthe fool is his ruin.","Be not called a whisperer, and be not taken in thy tongue, and\nconfounded.","For confusion and repentance is upon a thief, and an evil mark of\ndisgrace upon the double tongued, but to the whisperer hatred, and\nenmity, and reproach.","Justify alike the small and the great."]}
