{"verses":["Happy is the husband of a good wife:  for the number of his years\nis double.","A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and shall fulfil the\nyears of his life in peace.","A good wife is a good portion, she shall be given in the portion\nof them that fear God, to a man for his good deeds.","Rich or poor, if his heart is good, his countenance shall be\ncheerful at all times.","Of three things my heart hath been afraid, and at the fourth my\nface hath trembled:","The accusation of a city, and the gathering together of the\npeople:","And a false calumny, all are more grievous than death.","A jealous woman is the grief and mourning of the heart.","With a jealous woman is a scourge of the tongue which\ncommunicateth with all.","As a yoke of oxen that is moved to and fro, so also is a wicked\nwoman:  he that hath hold of her, is as he that taketh hold of a\nscorpion.","A drunken woman is a great wrath:  and her reproach and shame\nshall not be hid.","The fornication of a woman shall be known by the haughtiness of\nher eyes and by her eyelids.","On a daughter that turneth not away herself, set a strict watch:\nlest finding an opportunity she abuse herself.","Take heed of the impudence of her eyes, and wonder not if she\nslight thee.","She will open her mouth as a thirsty traveller to the fountain,\nand will drink of every water near her, and will sit down by every\nhedge, and open her quiver against every arrow, until she fail.","The grace of a diligent woman shall delight her husband, and\nshall fat his bones.","Her discipline is the gift of God.","Such is a wise and silent woman, and there is nothing so much\nworth as a well instructed soul.","A holy and shamefaced woman is grace upon grace.","And no price is worthy of a continent soul.","As the sun when it riseth to the world in the high places of\nGod, so is the beauty of a good wife for the ornament of her house.","As the lamp shining upon the holy candlestick, so is the beauty\nof the face in a ripe age,","As golden pillars upon bases of silver, so are the firm feet\nupon the soles of a steady woman.","As everlasting foundations upon a solid rock, so the\ncommandments of God in the heart of a holy woman.","At two things my heart is grieved, and the third bringeth anger\nupon me.","A man of war fainting through poverty, and a man of sense\ndespised:","And he that passeth over from justice to sin, God hath prepared\nsuch an one for the sword.","Two sorts of callings have appeared to me hard and dangerous:  a\nmerchant is hardly free from negligence:  and a huckster shall not be\njustified from the sins of the lips."]}
