{"verses":["The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and\ndeceitful:  and dreams lift up fools.","The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him that\ncatcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.","The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another:\nas when a man's likeness is before the face of a man.","What can be made clean by the unclean?  and what truth can come\nfrom that which is false?","Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of\nevildoers, are vanity:","And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail:  except it\nbe a vision sent forth from the most High, set not thy heart upon them.","For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put\ntheir trust in them.","The word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie, and wisdom\nshall be made plain in the mouth of the faithful.","What doth he know, that hath not been tried?  A man that hath much\nexperience, shall think of many things:  and he that hath learned many\nthings, shall shew forth understanding.","He that hath no experience, knoweth little:  and he that hath\nbeen experienced in many things, multiplieth prudence.","He that hath not been tried, what manner of things doth he know?\nhe that hath been surprised, shall abound with subtlety.","I have seen many things by travelling, and many customs of\nthings.","Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these things, and I\nhave been delivered by the grace of God.","The spirit of those that fear God, is sought after, and by his\nregard shall be blessed.","For their hope is on him that saveth them, and the eyes of God\nare upon them that love him.","He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing, and shall not\nbe afraid:  for he is his hope.","The soul of him that feareth the Lord is blessed.","To whom doth he look, and who is his strength?","The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, he is their\npowerful protector, and strong stay, a defence from the heat, and a\ncover from the sun at noon,","A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling:  he\nraiseth up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth health, and\nlife, and blessing.","The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully\ngotten, is stained, and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable.","The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth\nand justice.","The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked:  neither\nhath he respect to the oblations of the unjust, nor will he be pacified\nfor sins by the multitude of their sacrifices.","He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor, is as one\nthat sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father.","The bread of the needy, is the life of the poor:  he that\ndefraudeth them thereof, is a man of blood.","He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat, is like him that\nkilleth his neighbour.","He that sheddeth blood, and he that defraudeth the laborer of\nhis hire, are brothers.","When one buildeth up, and another pulleth down:  what profit have\nthey but the labour?","When one prayeth, and another curseth:  whose voice will God\nhear?","He that washeth himself after touching the dead, if he toucheth\nhim again, what doth his washing avail?","So a man that fasteth for his sins, and doth the same again,\nwhat doth his humbling himself profit him?  who will hear his prayer?"]}
