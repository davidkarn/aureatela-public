{"verses":["He that sheweth mercy, lendeth to his neighbour:  and he that is\nstronger in hand, keepeth the commandments.","Lend to thy neighbour in the time of his need, and pay thou thy\nneighbour again in due time.","Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him:  and thou shalt\nalways find that which is necessary for thee.","Many have looked upon a thing lent as a thing found, and have\ngiven trouble to them that helped them.","Till they receive, they kiss the hands of the lender, and in\npromises they humble their voice:","But when they should repay, they will ask time, and will return\ntedious and murmuring words, and will complain of the time:","And if he be able to pay, he will stand off, he will scarce pay\none half, and will count it as if he had found it:","But if not, he will defraud him of his money, and he shall get\nhim for an enemy without cause.","And he will pay him with reproaches and curses, and instead of\nhonour and good turn will repay him injuries.","Many have refused to lend, not out of wickedness, but they were\nafraid to be defrauded without cause.","But yet towards the poor be thou more hearty, and delay not to\nshew him mercy.","Help the poor because of the commandment:  and send him not away\nempty handed because of his poverty.","Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend:  and hide it not\nunder a stone to be lost.","Place thy treasure in the commandments of the most High, and it\nshall bring thee more profit than gold.","Shut up alms in the heart of the poor, and it shall obtain help\nfor thee against all evil.","Better than the shield of the mighty, and better than the spear:","It shall fight for thee against thy enemy.","A good man is surety for his neighbour:  and he that hath lost\nshame, will leave him to himself.","Forget not the kindness of thy surety:  for he hath given his\nlife for thee.","The sinner and the unclean fleeth from his surety.","A sinner attributeth to himself the goods of his surety:  and he\nthat is of an unthankful mind will leave him that delivered him.","A man is surety for his neighbour:  and when he hath lost all\nshame, he shall forsake him.","Evil suretyship hath undone many of good estate, and hath tossed\nthem as a wave of the sea.","It hath made powerful men to go from place to place round about,\nand they have wandered in strange countries.","A sinner that transgresseth the commandment of the Lord, shall\nfall into an evil suretyship:  and he that undertaketh many things,\nshall fall into judgment.","Recover thy neighbour according to thy power, and take heed to\nthyself that thou fall not.","The chief thing for man's life is water and bread, and clothing,\nand a house to cover shame.","Better is the poor man's fare under a roof of boards, than\nsumptuous cheer abroad in another man's house.","Be contented with little instead of much, and thou shalt not\nhear the reproach of going abroad.","It is a miserable life to go as a guest from house to house:  for\nwhere a man is a stranger, he shall not deal confidently, nor open his\nmouth.","He shall entertain and feed, and give drink to the unthankful,\nand moreover he shall hear bitter words.","Go, stranger, and furnish the table, and give others to eat what\nthou hast in thy hand.","Give place to the honourable presence of my friends:  for I want\nmy house, my brother being to be lodged with me.","These things are grievous to a man of understanding:  the\nupbraiding of houseroom, and the reproaching of the lender."]}
