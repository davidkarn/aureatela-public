{"verses":["The wise man will seek out the wisdom of all the ancients, and\nwill be occupied in the prophets.","He will keep the sayings of renowned men, and will enter withal\ninto the subtilties of parables.","He will search out the hidden meanings of proverbs, and will be\nconversant in the secrets of parables.","He shall serve among great men, and appear before the governor.","He shall pass into strange countries:  for he shall try good and\nevil among men.","He will give his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him,\nand he will pray in the sight of the most High.","He will open his mouth in prayer, and will make supplication for\nhis sins.","For if it shall please the great Lord, he will fill him with the\nspirit of understanding:","And he will pour forth the words of his wisdom as showers, and in\nhis prayer he will confess to the Lord.","And he shall direct his counsel, and his knowledge, and in his\nsecrets shall he meditate.","He shall shew forth the discipline he hath learned, and shall\nglory in the law of the covenant of the Lord.","Many shall praise his wisdom, and it shall never be forgotten.","The memory of him shall not depart away, and his name shall be\nin request from generation to generation.","Nations shall declare his wisdom, and the church shall shew\nforth his praise.","If he continue, he shall leave a name above a thousand:  and if\nhe rest, it shall be to his advantage.","I will yet meditate that I may declare:  for I am filled as with\na holy transport.","By a voice he saith:  Hear me, ye divine offspring, and bud forth\nas the rose planted by the brooks of waters.","Give ye a sweet odour as frankincense.","Send forth flowers, as the lily, and yield a smell, and bring\nforth leaves in grace, and praise with canticles, and bless the Lord in\nhis works.","Magnify his name, and give glory to him with the voice of your\nlips, and with the canticles of your mouths, and with harps, and in\npraising him, you shall say in this manner:","All the works of the Lord are exceeding good.","At his word the waters stood as a heap:  and at the words of his\nmouth the receptacles of waters:","For at his commandment favour is shewn, and there is no\ndiminishing of his salvation.","The works of all flesh are before him, and there is nothing hid\nfrom his eyes.","He seeth from eternity to eternity, and there is nothing\nwonderful before him.","There is no saying:  What is this, or what is that?  for all\nthings shall be sought in their time.","His blessing hath overflowed like a river.","And as a flood hath watered the earth; so shall his wrath\ninherit the nations, that have not sought after him.","Even as he turned the waters into a dry land, and the earth was\nmade dry:  and his ways were made plain for their journey:  so to sinners\nthey are stumblingblocks in his wrath.","Good things were created for the good from the beginning, so for\nthe wicked, good and evil things.","The principal things necessary for the life of men, are water,\nfire, and iron, salt, milk, and bread of flour, and honey, and the\ncluster of the grape, and oil, and clothing.","All these things shall be for good to the holy, so to the\nsinners and the ungodly they shall be turned into evil.","There are spirits that are created for vengeance, and in their\nfury they lay on grievous torments.","In the time of destruction they shall pour out their force:  and\nthey shall appease the wrath of him that made them.","Fire, hail, famine, and death, all these were created for\nvengeance.","The teeth of beasts, and scorpions, and serpents, and the sword\ntaking vengeance upon the ungodly unto destruction.","In his commandments they shall feast, and they shall be ready\nupon earth when need is, and when their time is come they shall not\ntransgress his word.","Therefore from the beginning I was resolved, and I have\nmeditated, and thought on these things and left them in writing,","All the works of the Lord are good, and he will furnish every\nwork in due time.","It is not to be said:  This is worse than that:  for all shall be\nwell approved in their time.","Now therefore with the whole heart and mouth praise ye him, and\nbless the name of the Lord."]}
