{"verses":["Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and\nin fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation.","Humble thy heart, and endure:  incline thy ear, and receive the\nwords of understanding:  and make not haste in the time of clouds.","Wait on God with patience:  join thyself to God, and endure, that\nthy life may be increased in the latter end.","Take all that shall be brought upon thee:  and in thy sorrow\nendure, and in thy humiliation keep patience.","For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in\nthe furnace of humiliation.","Believe God, and he will recover thee:  and direct thy way, and\ntrust in him.  Keep his fear, and grow old therein.","Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy:  and go not aside from\nhim lest ye fall.","Ye that fear the Lord, believe him:  and your reward shall not be\nmade void.","Ye that fear the Lord hope in him, and mercy shall come to you for\nyour delight.","Ye that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be\nenlightened.","My children behold the generations of men:  and know ye that no\none hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been confounded.","For who hath continued in his commandment, and hath been\nforsaken?  or who hath called upon him, and he despised him?","For God is compassionate and merciful, and will forgive sins in\nthe day of tribulation:  and he is a protector to all that seek him in\ntruth.","Woe to them that are of a double heart and to wicked lips, and to\nthe hands that do evil, and to the sinner that goeth on the earth two\nways.","Woe to them that are fainthearted, who believe not God:  and\ntherefore they shall not be protected by him.","Woe to them that have lost patience, and that have forsaken the\nright ways, and have gone aside into crooked ways.","And what will they do, when the Lord shall begin to examine?","They that fear the Lord, will not be incredulous to his word:  and\nthey that love him, will keep his way.","They that fear the Lord, will seek after the things that are well\npleasing to him:  and they that love him, shall be filled with his law.","They that fear the Lord, will prepare their hearts, and in his\nsight will sanctify their souls,","They that fear the Lord, keep his commandments, and will have\npatience even until his visitation,","Saying:  If we do not penance, we shall fall into the hands of the\nLord, and not into the hands of men.","For according to his greatness, so also is his mercy with him."]}
