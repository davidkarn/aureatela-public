In fact, subsequent patriarchs were uncircumcised, like Melchizedek, who, uncircumcised, offered to Abraham himself, already circumcised, on his return from battle, bread and wine.[fn-20-P2073_705681:39-nf] \"But again,\" (you say) \"the son of Moses would upon one occasion have been choked by an angel, if Zipporah,[fn-20-P2074_706106:40-nf] had not circumcised the foreskin of the infant with a pebble; whence, \"there is the greatest peril if any fail to circumcise the foreskin of his flesh.\" Nay, but if circumcision altogether brought salvation, even Moses himself, in the case of his own son, would not have omitted to circumcise him on the eighth day; whereas it is agreed that Zipporah did it on the journey, at the compulsion of the angel.

For circumcision had to be given; but as \"a sign,\" whence Israel in the last time would have to be distinguished, when, in accordance with their deserts, they should be prohibited from entering the holy city, as we see through the words of the prophets, saying, \"Your land is desert; your cities utterly burnt with fire; your country, in your sight, strangers shall eat up; and, deserted and subverted by strange peoples, the daughter of Zion shall be derelict, like a shed in a vineyard, and like a watchhouse in a cucumber-field, and as it were a city which is being stormed.\"[fn-20-P2075_707833:41-nf] Why so?
