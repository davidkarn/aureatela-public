{"verses":["For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints, it is\nsuperfluous for me to write unto you.","For I know your forward mind:  for which I boast of you to the\nMacedonians, that Achaia also is ready from the year past.  And your\nemulation hath provoked very many.","Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of\nconcerning you be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said)\nyou may be ready:","Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me and find you\nunprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.","Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they\nwould go to you before and prepare this blessing before promised, to be\nready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.","Now this I say:  He who soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly:\nand he who soweth in blessings shall also reap blessings.","Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness or\nof necessity:  for God loveth a cheerful giver.","And God is able to make all grace abound in you:  that ye always,\nhaving all sufficiently in all things, may abound to every good work,","As it is written:  He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the\npoor:  his justice remaineth for ever.","And he that ministereth seed to the sower will both give you\nbread to eat and will multiply your seed and increase the growth of the\nfruits of your justice:","That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all\nsimplicity which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.","Because the administration of this office doth not only supply\nthe want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the\nLord.","By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience\nof your confession unto the gospel of Christ and for the simplicity of\nyour communicating unto them and unto all.","And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of\nthe excellent grace of God in you.","Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift."]}
