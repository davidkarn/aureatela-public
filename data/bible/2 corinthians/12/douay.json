{"verses":["If I must glory (it is not expedient indeed) but I will come to\nvisions and revelations of the Lord.","I know a man in Christ:  above fourteen years ago (whether in the\nbody, I know not, or out of the body, I know not:  God knoweth), such a\none caught up to the third heaven.","And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I\nknow not:  God knoweth):","That he was caught up into paradise and heard secret words which\nit is not granted to man to utter.","For such an one I will glory:  but for myself I will glory nothing\nbut in my infirmities.","For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish:\nfor I will say the truth.  But I forbear, lest any man should think of\nme above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me.","And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there\nwas given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.","For which thing, thrice I besought the Lord that it might depart\nfrom me.","And he said to me:  My grace is sufficient for thee:  for power is\nmade perfect in infirmity.  Gladly therefore will I glory in my\ninfirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.","For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in\nreproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ.\nFor when I am weak, then am I powerful.","I am become foolish.  You have compelled me:  for I ought to have\nbeen commended by you.  For I have no way come short of them that are\nabove measure apostles, although I be nothing.","Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all\npatience, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds.","For what is there that you have had less than the other churches\nbut that I myself was not burthensome to you?  Pardon me this injury.","Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you and I will\nnot be burthensome unto you.  For I seek not the things that are yours,\nbut you.  For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but\nthe parents for the children.","But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls:\nalthough loving you more, I be loved less.","But be it so:  I did not burthen you:  but being crafty, I caught\nyou by guile.","Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you?","I desired Titus:  and I sent with him a brother.  Did Titus\noverreach you?  Did we not walk with the same spirit?  Did we not in the\nsame steps?","Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you?  We speak\nbefore God in Christ:  but all things, my dearly beloved, for your\nedification.","For I fear lest perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you such\nas I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not.\nLest perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions,\ndetractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you.","Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you:  and I mourn\nmany of them that sinned before and have not done penance for the\nuncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness that they have\ncommitted."]}
