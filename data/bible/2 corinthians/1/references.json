But in the case of human infirmities, it is not easy in the first place for a man to discern them, for no man \"knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him.\"[fn-3-P327_117169:10-nf] How then can any one apply the remedy for the disease of which he does not know the character, often indeed being unable to understand it even should he happen to sicken with it himself? And even when it becomes manifest, it causes him yet more trouble: for it is not possible to doctor all men with the same authority with which the shepherd treats his sheep. For in this case also it is necessary to bind and to restrain from food, and to use cautery or the knife: but the reception of the treatment depends on the will of the patient, not of him who applies the remedy. For this also was perceived by that wonderful man (St. Paul) when he said to the Corinthians-\"Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy.\"[fn-3-P328_117933:11-nf] For Christians above all men are not permitted forcibly to correct the failings of those who sin. Secular judges indeed, when they have captured malefactors under the law, show their authority to be great, and prevent them even against their will from following their own devices: but in our case the wrong-doer must be made better, not by force, but by persuasion. For neither has authority of this kind for the restraint of sinners been given us by law, nor, if it had been given, should we have any field for the exercise of our power, inasmuch as God rewards those who abstain from evil by their own choice, not of necessity. Consequently much skill is required that our patients may be induced to submit willingly to the treatment prescribed by the physicians, and not only this, but that they may be grateful also for the cure. For if any one when he is bound becomes restive (which it is in his power to be), he makes the mischief worse; and if he should pay no heed to the words which cut like steel, he inflicts another wound by means of this contempt, and the intention to heal only becomes the occasion of a worse disorder.

Hence these men of base character, who abounded when Sallust wrote and Virgil sang these things, did not seek after honors and glory by these arts, but by treachery and deceit. Wherefore the same says, \"But at first it was rather ambition than avarice that stirred the minds of men, which vice, however, is nearer to virtue. For glory, honor, and power are desired alike by the good man and by the ignoble; but the former,\" he says, \"strives onward to them by the true way, whilst the other, knowing nothing of the good arts, seeks them by fraud and deceit.\"[fn-9-P957_490534:16-nf] And what is meant by seeking the attainment of glory, honor, and power by good arts, is to seek them by virtue, and not by deceitful intrigue; for the good and the ignoble man alike desire these things, but the good man strives to overtake them by the true way. The way is virtue, along which he presses as to the goal of possession-namely, to glory, honor, and power. Now that this was a sentiment engrained in the Roman mind, is indicated even by the temples of their gods; for they built in very close proximity the temples of Virtue and Honor, worshipping as gods the gifts of God. Hence we can understand what they who were good thought to be the end of virtue, and to what they ultimately referred it, namely, to honor; for, as to the bad, they had no virtue though they desired honor, and strove to possess it by fraud and deceit. Praise of a higher kind is bestowed upon Cato, for he says of him \"The less he sought glory, the more it followed him.\"[fn-9-P958_491521:17-nf] We say praise of a higher kind; for the glory with the desire of which the Romans burned is the judgment of men thinking well of men. And therefore virtue is better, which is content with no human judgment save that of one's own conscience. Whence the apostle says, \"For this is our glory, the testimony of our conscience.\"[fn-9-P959_491874:18-nf] And in another place he says, \"But let every one prove his own work, and then he shall have glory in himself, and not in another.\"[fn-9-P960_492024:19-nf] That glory, honor, and power, therefore, which they desired for themselves, and to which the good sought to attain by good arts, should not be sought after by virtue, but virtue by them. For there is no true virtue except that which is directed towards that end in which is the highest and ultimate good of man. Wherefore even the honors which Cato sought he ought not to have sought, but the state ought to have conferred them on him unsolicited, on account of his virtues.","title":"Book V.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_06_lecture_i","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"2.

What, however, they call sub-numeration,[fn-16-P1609_398078:370-nf] and in what sense they use this word, cannot even be imagined without difficulty. It is well known that it was imported into our language from the\"wisdom of the world;\"[fn-16-P1610_398274:371-nf] but a point for our present consideration will be whether it has any immediate relation to the subject under discussion. Those who are adepts in vain investigations tell us that, while some nouns are common and of widely extended denotation, others are more specific, and that the force of some is more limited than that of others. Essence, for instance, is a common noun, predicable of all things both animate and inanimate; while animal is more specific, being predicated of fewer subjects than the former, though of more than those which are considered under it, as it embraces both rational and irrational nature. Again, human is more specific than animal, and man than human, and than man the individual Peter, Paul or John.[fn-16-P1611_399026:372-nf] Do they then mean by sub-numerationthe division of the common into its subordinate parts? But I should hesitate to believe they have reached such a pitch of infatuation as to assert that the God of the universe, like some common quality conceivable only by reason and without actual existence in any hypostasis, is divided into subordinate divisions, and that then this subdivision is called sub-numeration. This would hardly be said even by men melancholy mad, for, besides its impiety, they are establishing the very opposite argument to their own contention. For the subdivisions are of the same essence as that from which they have been divided. The very obviousness of the absurdity makes it difficult for us to find arguments to confute their unreasonableness; so that really their folly looks like an advantage to them; just as soft and yielding bodies offer no resistance, and therefore cannot be struck a stout blow. It is impossible to bring a vigorous confutation to bear on a palpable absurdity. The only course open to us is topass by their abominable impiety in silence. Yet our love for the brethren and the importunity of our opponents makes silence impossible.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_06_the_book_of_saint_basil_on_the_spirit_","source_chapter":31,"source_paragraph":"194","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"77. Turn now I beg you from this figurative description to the unhappy reality. Did it not at one time[fn-19-P1949_532879:634-nf] appear that the Arian schism, after its separation into a sect opposed to the Church of God, stood itself alone in hostile array? But when the attitude of our foes against us was changed from one of long standing and bitter strife to one of open warfare, then, as is well known, the war was split up in more ways than I can tell into many subdivisions, so that all men were stirred to a state of inveterate hatred alike by common party spirit and individual suspicion.[fn-19-P1950_533368:635-nf] But what storm at sea was ever so fierce and wild as this tempest of the Churches? In it every landmark of the Fathers has been moved; every foundation. every bulwark of opinion has been shaken: everything buoyed up on the unsound is dashed about and shaken down. We attack one another. We are overthrown by one another. If our enemy is not the first to strike us, we are wounded by the comrade at our side. If a foeman is stricken and falls, his fellow soldier tramples him down. There is at least this bond of union between us that we hate our common foes, but no sooner have the enemy gone by than we find enemies in one another. And who could make a complete list of all the wrecks? Some have gone to the bottom on the attack of the enemy, some through the unsuspected treachery, of their allies, some from the blundering of their own officers. We see, as it were, whole churches, crews and all, dashed and shattered upon the sunken reefs of disingenuous heresy, while others of the enemies of the Spirit[fn-19-P1951_534398:636-nf] of Salvation have seized the helm and made shipwreck of the faith.[fn-19-P1952_534520:637-nf] And then the disturbances wrought by the princes of the world[fn-19-P1953_536883:638-nf] have caused the downfall of the people with a violence unmatched by that of hurricane or whirlwind. The luminaries of the world, which God set to give light to the souls of the people, have been driven from their homes, and a darkness verily gloomy and disheartening has settled on the Churches.[fn-19-P1954_537659:639-nf] The terror of universal ruin is already imminent, and yet their mutual rivalry is so unbounded as to blunt all sense of danger. Individual hatred is of more importance than the general and common warfare, for men by whom the immediate gratification of ambition is esteemed more highly than the rewards that await us in a time to come, prefer the glory of getting the better of their opponents to securing the common welfare of mankind. So all men alike, each as best he can, lift the hand of murder against one another. Harsh rises the cry of the combatants encountering one another in dispute; already all the Church is almost full of the inarticulate screams, the unintelligible noises, rising from the ceaseless agitations that divert the right rule of the doctrine of true religion, now in the direction of excess, now in that of defect. On the one hand are they who confound the Persons and are carried away into Judaism;[fn-19-P1955_538607:640-nf] on the other hand are they that, through the opposition of the natures, pass into heathenism.[fn-19-P1956_538722:641-nf] Between these opposite parties inspired Scripture is powerless to mediate; the traditions of the apostles cannot suggest terms of arbitration. Plain speaking is fatal to friendship, and disagreement in opinion all the ground that is wanted for a quarrel. No oaths of confederacy are so efficacious in keeping men true to sedition as their likeness in error. Every one is a theologue though he have his soul branded with more spots than can be counted. The result is that innovators find a plentiful supply of men ripe for faction, while self-appointed scions of the house of place-hunters[fn-19-P1957_539516:642-nf] reject the government[fn-19-P1958_540212:643-nf] of the Holy Spirit and divide the chief dignities of the Churches. The institutions of the Gospel have now everywhere been thrown into confusion by want of discipline; there is an indescribable pushing for the chief places while every self-advertiser tries to force himself into high office. The result of this lust for ordering is that our people are in a state of wild confusion for lack of being ordered;[fn-19-P1959_540889:644-nf] the exhortations of those in authority are rendered wholly purposeless and void, because there is not a man but, out of his ignorant impudence, thinks that it is just as much his duty to give orders to other people, as it is to obey any one else.","title":"The Book of Saint Basil on the Spirit.","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":1,"verse":22,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_101_tractate_xcvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"4.

For that cannot be loved which is altogether unknown. But when what is known, in however small a measure, is also loved, by the self-same love one is led on to a better and fuller knowledge. If, then, you grow in the love which the Holy Spirit spreads abroad in your hearts, \"He will teach you all truth;\" or, as other codices have it, \"He will guide you in all truth:\"[fn-31-P3197_1788615:5-nf] as it is said, \"Lead me in Thy way, O Lord, and I will walk in Thy truth.\"[fn-31-P3198_1788767:6-nf] So shall the result be, that not from outward teachers will you learn those things which the Lord at that time declined to utter, but be all taught of God;[fn-31-P3199_1788942:7-nf] so that the very things which you have learned and believed by means of lessons and sermons supplied from without regarding the nature of God, as incorporeal, and unconfined by limits, and yet not rolled out as a mass of matter through infinite space, but everywhere whole and perfect and infinite, without the gleaming of colors, without the tracing of bodily outlines, without any markings of letters or succession of syllables,-your minds themselves may have the power to perceive.

Whereof you remember, beloved, that I have already spoken, when we were occupied with the words of the holy Gospel, where the Lord says, \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\" Not that in these words of the Lord we should be suspecting an over-fastidious concealment of no one knows what secrets, which might be uttered by the Teacher, but could not be borne by the learner, but those very things which in connection with religious doctrine we read and write, hear and speak of, as within the knowledge of such and such persons, were Christ willing to utter to us in the self-same way as He speaks of them to the holy angels, in His own Person as the only-begotten Word of the Father, and co-eternal with Him, where are the human beings that could bear them, even were they already spiritual, as the apostles still were not when the Lord so spoke to them, and as they afterwards became when the Holy Spirit descended? For, of course, whatever may be known of the creature, is less than the Creator Himself, who is the supreme and true and unchangeable God. And yet who keeps silence about Him? Where is His name not found in the mouths of readers, disputants, inquirers, respondents, adorers, singers, all sorts of haranguers, and lastly even of blasphemers themselves? And although no one keeps silence about Him, who is there that apprehends Him as He is to be understood, although He is never out of the mouths and the hearing of men? Who is there, whose keenness of mind can even get near Him? Who is there that would have known Him as the Trinity, had not He Himself desired so to become known? And what man is there that now holds his tongue about that Trinity; and yet what man is there that has any such idea of it as the angels? The very things, therefore, that are incessantly being uttered off-hand and openly about the eternity, the truth, the holiness of God, are understood well by some, and badly by others: nay rather, are understood by some, and not understood at all by others. For he that understands in a bad way, does not understand at all. And in the case even of those by whom they are understood in a right sense, by some they are perceived with less, by others with greater mental vividness, and by none on earth are apprehended as they are by the angels. In the very mind, therefore, that is to say, in the inner man, there is a kind of growth, not only in order to the transition from milk to solid food, but also to the taking of food itself in still larger and larger measure. But such growth is not in the way of a space-covering mass of matter, but in that of an illuminated understanding; because that food is itself the light of the understanding. In order, then, to your growth and apprehension of God, and in order that your apprehension may keep full pace with your ever-advancing growth, you ought to be addressing your prayer, and turning your hope, not to the teacher whose voice only reaches your ears, that is, who plants and waters only by outside labor, but to Him who giveth the increase.[fn-32-P3217_1796798:3-nf] ","title":"Tractate XCVII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_11_lecture_vi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"7","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"1.

Now let us see what he says about the Holy Spirit. \"After Him, we believe,\" he says, \"on the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth.\" I think it will be plain to all who come across this passage what object he has in view in thus perverting the declaration of the faith delivered to us by the Lord, in his statements concerning the Son and the Father. Though this absurdity has already been exposed, I will nevertheless endeavour, in few words, to make plain the aim of his knavery. As in the former case, he avoided using the name \"Father,\" that so he might not include the Son in the eternity of the Father, so he avoided employing the title Son, that he might not by it suggest His natural affinity to the Father; so here, too, he refrains from saying \"Holy Spirit,\" that he may not by this name acknowledge the majesty of His glory, and His complete union with the Father and the Son. For since the appellation of \"Spirit,\" and that of \"Holy,\" are by the Scriptures equally applied to the Father and the Son (for \"God is a Spirits[fn-12-P1225_665183:210-nf] ,\" and \"the anointed Lord is the Spirit before our face[fn-12-P1226_665262:211-nf] ,\" and \"the Lord our God is Holy[fn-12-P1227_665326:212-nf] ,\" and there is \"one Holy, one Lord Jesus Christ[fn-12-P1228_665395:213-nf] \") lest there should, by the use of these terms, be bred in the minds of his readers some orthodox conception of the Holy Spirit, such as would naturally arise in them from His sharing His glorious appellation with the Father and the Son, for this reason, deluding the ears of the foolish, he changes the words of the Faith as set forth by God in the delivery of this mystery, making a way, so to speak, by this sequence, for the entrance of his impiety against the Holy Spirit. For if he had said, \"We believe in the Holy Spirit,\" and \"God is a Spirit,\" any one instructed in things divine would have interposed the remark, that if we are to believe in the Holy Spirit, while God is called a Spirit, He is assuredly not distinct in nature from that which receives the same titles in a proper sense. For of all those things which are indicated not unreally, nor metaphorically, but properly and absolutely, by the same names, we are necessarily compelled to acknowledge that the nature also, which is signified by this identity of names, is one and the same. For this reason it is that, suppressing the name appointed by the Lord in the formula of the faith, he says, \"We believe in the Comforter.\" But I have been taught that this very name is also applied by the inspired Scripture to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost alike. For the Son gives the name of \"Comforter\" equally to Himself and to the Holy Spirit[fn-12-P1229_666903:214-nf] ; and the Father, where He is said to work comfort, surely claims as His own the name of \"Comforter.\" For assuredly he Who does the work of a Comforter does not disdain the name belonging to the work: for David says to the Father, \"Thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me[fn-12-P1230_667203:215-nf] ,\" and the great Apostle applies to the Father the same language, when he says, \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1231_667403:216-nf] \"; and John, in one of his Catholic Epistles, expressly gives to the Son the name of Comforter[fn-12-P1232_667520:217-nf] . Nay, more, the Lord Himself, in saying that another Comforter would be sent us, when speaking of the Spirit, clearly asserted this title of Himself in the first place. But as there are two senses of the parakalein[fn-12-P1233_667807:218-nf] ,-one to beseech, by words and gestures of respect, to induce him to whom we apply for anything, to feel with us in respect of those things for which we apply,-the other to comfort, to take remedial thought for affections of body and soul,-the Holy Scripture affirms the conception of the Paraclete, in either sense alike, to belong to the Divine nature. For at one time Paul sets before us by the word parakalein the healing power of God, as when he says, \"God, Who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus[fn-12-P1234_668424:219-nf] \"; and at another time he uses this word in its other meaning, when he says, writing to the Corinthians, \"Now we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God[fn-12-P1235_668680:220-nf] .\" Now since these things are so, in whatever way you understand the title \"Paraclete,\" when used of the Spirit, you will not in either of its significations detach Him from His community in it with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, he has not been able, even though he wished it, to belittle the glory of the Spirit by ascribing to Him the very attribute which Holy Scripture refers also to the Father and to the Son. But in styling Him \"the Spirit of Truth,\" Eunomius' own wish, I suppose, was to suggest by this phrase subjection, since Christ is the Truth, and he called Him the Spirit of Truth, as if one should say that He is a possession and chattel of the Truth, without being aware that God is called a God of righteousness[fn-12-P1236_669437:221-nf] ; and we certainly do not understand thereby that God is a possession of righteousness. Wherefore also, when we hear of the \"Spirit of Truth,\" we acquire by that phrase such a conception as befits the Deity, being guided to the loftier interpretation by the words which follow it. For when the Lord said \"The Spirit of Truth,\" He immediately added \"Which proceedeth from the Father[fn-12-P1237_669966:222-nf] ,\" a fact which the voice of the Lord never asserted of any conceivable thing in creation, not of aught visible or invisible, not of thrones, principalities, powers, or dominions, nor of any other name that is named either in this world or in that which is to come. It is plain then that that, from share in which all creation is excluded, is something special and peculiar to uncreated being. But this man bids us believe in \"the Guide of godliness.\" Let a man then believe in Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and all those by whom we have been led into the way of thefaith. For if we are to believe in \"that which guides us to godliness,\" along with the Father and the Son, all the prophets and lawgivers and patriarchs, heralds, evangelists, apostles, pastors,and teachers, have equal honour with the Holy Spirit, as they bare been \"guides to godliness\" to those who came after them. \"Who came into being,\" he goes on, \"by the only God through the Only-begotten.\" In these words he gathers up in one head all his blasphemy. Once more he calls the Father \"only God,\" who employs the Only-begotten as an instrument for the production of the Spirit. What shadow of such a notion did he find in Scripture, that he ventures upon this assertion? by deduction from what premises did he bring his profanity to such a conclusion as this?Which of the Evangelists says it? what apostle? what prophet? Nay, on the contrary every scripture divinely inspired, written by the afflatus of the Spirit, attests the Divinity of the Spirit. For example (for it is better to prove my position from the actual testimonies), those who receive power to become children of God bear witness to the Divinity of the Spirit. Who knows not that utterance of the Lord which tells us that they who are born of the Spirit are the children of God? For thus He expressly ascribes the birth of the children of God to the Spirit, saying, that as that which is born of the flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. But as many as are born of the Spirit are called the children of God[fn-12-P1238_672086:223-nf] . So also when the Lord by breathing upon His disciples had imparted to them the Holy Spirit, John says, \"Of His fulness have all we received[fn-12-P1239_672321:224-nf] .\" And that \"in Him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead[fn-12-P1240_672419:225-nf] ,\" the mighty Paul attests: yea, moreover, through the prophet Isaiah it is attested, as to the manifestation of the Divine appearance vouchsafed to him, when he saw Him that sat \"on the throne high and lifted up[fn-12-P1241_672651:226-nf] ;\" the older tradition, it is true, says that it was the Father Who appeared to him, but the evangelist John refers the prophecy to our Lord, saying, touching those of the Jews who did not believe the words uttered by the prophet concerning the Lord, \"These things said Esaias, when he saw His glory and spoke of Him[fn-12-P1242_672986:227-nf] .\" But the mighty Paul attributes the same passage to the Holy Spirit in his speech made to the Jews at Rome, when he says, \"Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet concerning you, saying, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand[fn-12-P1243_673333:228-nf] ,\" showing, in my opinion, by Holy Scripture itself, that every specially divine vision, every theophany, every word uttered in the Person of God, is to be understood to refer to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hence when David says, \"they provoked God in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert[fn-12-P1244_673719:229-nf] ,\" the apostle refers to the Holy Spirit the despite done by the Israelites to God, in these terms: \"Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me[fn-12-P1245_674004:230-nf] ,\" and goes on to refer all that the prophecy refers to God, to the Person of the Holy Ghost. Those who keep repeating against us the phrase \"three Gods,\" because we hold these views, have perhaps not yet learnt how to count. For if the Father and the Son are not divided into duality, (for they are, according to the Lord's words, One, and not Two[fn-12-P1246_674374:231-nf] ) and if the Holy Ghost is also one, how can one added to one be divided into the number of three Gods? Is it not rather plain that no one can charge us with believing in the number of three Gods, without himself first maintaining in his own doctrine a pair of Gods? For it is by being added to two that the one completes the triad of Gods. But what room is there for the charge of tritheism against those by whom one God is worshipped, the God expressed by the Name ofthe Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost?","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"80","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Let us now see further what he adds to this \"sanctifying the saints.\" If any one says this also of the Father and of the Son, he will speak truly. For those in whom the Holy One dwells, He makes holy, even as the Good One makes men good. And the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are holy and good, as has been shown. \"Acting as a guide to those who approach the mystery.\" This may well be said of Apollos who watered what Paul planted. For the Apostle plants by his guidance[fn-12-P1272_692308:250-nf] , and Apollos, when he baptizes, waters by Sacramental regeneration, bringing to the mystery those who were instructed by Paul. Thus he places on a level with Apollos that Spirit Who perfects men through baptism. \"Distributing every gift.\" With this we too agree; for everything that is good is a portion of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. \"Co-operating with the faithful for the understanding and contemplation of things appointed.\" As he does not add by whom they are appointed, he leaves his meaning doubtful, whether it is correct or the reverse. But we will by a slight addition advance his statement so as to make it consistent with godliness. For since, whether it be the word of wisdom, or the word of knowledge, or faith, or help, or government, or aught else that is enumerated in the lists of saving gifts, \"all these worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will[fn-12-P1273_693352:251-nf] ,\" we therefore do not reject the statement of Eunomius when he says that the Spirit \"co-operates with the faithful for understanding and contemplation of things appointed\" by Him, because by Him all good teachings are appointed for us. \"Sounding an accompaniment to those who pray.\" It would be foolish seriously to examine the meaning of this expression, of which the ludicrous and meaningless character is at once manifest to all. For who is so demented and beside himself as to wait for us to tell him that the Holy Spirit is not a bell nor an empty cask sounding an accompaniment and made to ring by the voice of him who prays as it were by a blow? \"Leading us to that which is expedient for us.\" This the Father and the Son likewise do: for \"He leadeth Joseph like a sheep[fn-12-P1274_694154:252-nf] ,\" and, \"led His people like sheep[fn-12-P1275_694209:253-nf] ,\" and, \"the good Spirit leadeth us in a land of righteousness[fn-12-P1276_694295:254-nf] .\" \"Strengthening us to godliness.\" To strengthen man to godliness David says is the work of God; \"For Thou art my strength and my refuge[fn-12-P1277_694460:255-nf] ,\" says the Psalmist, and \"the Lord is the strength of His people[fn-12-P1278_694550:256-nf] ,\" and, \"He shall give strength and power unto His people[fn-12-P1279_694630:257-nf] .\" If then the expressions of Eunomius are meant in accordance with the mind of the Psalmist, they are a testimony to the Divinity of the Holy Ghost: but if they are opposed to the word of prophecy, then by this very fact a charge of blasphemy lies against Eunomius, because he sets up his own opinions in opposition to the holy prophets. Next he says, \"Lightening souls with the light of knowledge.\" This grace also the doctrine of godliness ascribes alike to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. For He is called a light by David[fn-12-P1280_695195:258-nf] , and from thence the light of knowledge shines in them who are enlightened. In like manner also the cleansing of our thoughts of which the statement speaks is proper to the power of the Lord. For it was \"the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of His person,\" Who \"purged our sins[fn-12-P1281_695518:259-nf] .\" Again, to banish devils, which Eunomius says is a property of the Spirit, this also the only-begotten God, Who said to the devil, \"I charge thee[fn-12-P1282_695684:260-nf] ,\" ascribes to the power of the Spirit, when He says, \"If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils[fn-12-P1283_695808:261-nf] ,\" so that the expulsion of devils is not destructive of the glory of the Spirit, but rather a demonstration of His divine and transcendent power. \"Healing the sick,\" he says, \"curing the infirm, comforting the afflicted, raising up those who stumble, recovering the distressed.\" These are the words of those who think reverently of the Holy Ghost, for no one would ascribe the operation of any one of these effects to any one except to God. If then heresy affirms that those things which it belongs to none save God alone to effect, are wrought by the power of the Spirit, we have in support of the truths for which we are contending the witness even of our adversaries. How does the Psalmist seek his healing from God, saying, \"Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, for my hones are vexed[fn-12-P1284_696647:262-nf] !\" It is to God that Isaiah says, \"The dew that is from Thee is healing unto them[fn-12-P1285_696747:263-nf] .\" Again, prophetic language attests that the conversion of those in error is the work of God. For \"they went astray in the wilderness in a thirsty land,\" says the Psalmist, and he adds, \"So He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to the city where they dwelt[fn-12-P1286_697050:264-nf] :\" and, \"when the Lord turned again the captivity of Sion[fn-12-P1287_697131:265-nf] .\" In like manner also the comfort of the afflicted is ascribed to God, Paul thus speaking, \"Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1288_697344:266-nf] .\" Again, the Psalmist says, speaking in the person of God \"Thou calledst upon Me in trouble and I delivered thee[fn-12-P1289_697491:267-nf] .\" And the setting upright of those who stumble is innumerable times ascribed by Scripture to the power of the Lord: \"Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall, but the Lord was my help[fn-12-P1290_697703:268-nf] ,\" and \"Though he fall, he shall not be cast away, for the Lord upholdeth him with His hand[fn-12-P1291_697818:269-nf] ,\" and \"The Lord helpeth them that are fallen[fn-12-P1292_697887:270-nf] .\" And to the loving-kindness of God confessedly belongs the recovery of the distressed, if Eunomius means the same thing of which we learn in prophecy, as the Scripture says, \"Thou laidest trouble upon our loins; Thou sufferedst men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, and Thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place[fn-12-P1293_698246:271-nf] .\"","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_03_npnf1_03_21_book_xv_","source_chapter":17,"source_paragraph":"72","folder":"NPNF1-03","text":"Is our word, then, born of our knowledge only?

And when we do, certainly we both willingly and knowingly have a word that is false, wherein there is a word that is true, viz. that we lie, for this we know. And when we confess that we have lied, we speak that which is true; for we say what we know, for we know that we lied. But that Word which is God, and can do more than we, cannot do this. For it \"can do nothing except what it sees the Father do;\" and it \"speaks not of itself,\" but it has from the Father all that it speaks, since the Father speaks it in a special way; and the great might of that Word is that it cannot lie, because there cannot be there \"yea and nay,\"[fn-20-P2013_1020942:58-nf] but \"yea yea, nay nay.\" Well, but that is not even to be called a word, which is not true. I willingly assent, if so it be. What, then, if our word is true and therefore is rightly called a word? Is it the case that, as we can speak of sight of sight, and knowledge of knowledge, so we can speak of essence of essence, as that Word of God is especially spoken of, and is especially to be spoken of? Why so? Because to us, to be is not the same as to know; since we know many things which in some sense live by memory, and so in some sense die by being forgotten: and so, when those things are no longer in our knowledge, yet we still are: and while our knowledge has slipped away and perished out of our mind, we are still alive.","title":"Book XV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":21,"source_code":"anf_10_anf10_26_the_first_epistle_of_clement_to_the_corinthians","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"73","folder":"ANF-10","text":"Every kind of honour and happiness[fn-53-P5306_759706:14-nf] was bestowed upon you, and then was fulfilled that which is written, \"My beloved did eat and drink, and was enlarged and became fat, and kicked.\"[fn-53-P5307_759883:15-nf] Hence flowed emulation and envy, strife and sedition, persecution and disorder, war and captivity.

Hear, I beseech you: although somewhat of the like kind does not take place now, yet in the case of our dead likewise, a great mystery is celebrating. Say,[fn-9-P937_844153:23-nf] if as we sit together, the Emperor were to send and invite some one of us to the palace, would it be right, I ask, to weep and mourn? Angels are present, commissioned from heaven and come from thence, sent from the King Himself to call their fellow servant, and say, dost thou weep? Knowest thou not what a mystery it is that is taking place, how awful, how dread, and worthy indeed of hymns and lauds? Wouldest thou learn, that thou mayest know, that this is no time for tears? For it is a very great mystery of the Wisdom of God. As if leaving her dwelling, the soul goes forth, speeding on her way to her own Lord, and dost thou mourn? Why then, thou shouldst do this on the birth of a child: for this in fact is also a birth, and a better than that. For here she goes forth to a very different light, is loosed as from a prison-house, comes off as from a contest. \"Yes,\" say you, \"it is all very well to say this,[fn-9-P938_845357:24-nf] in the case of those of whose salvation we are assured.\" Then, what ails thee, O man, that even in the case of such, thou dost not take it in this way? Say, what canst thou have to condemn in the little child? Why dost thou mourn for it? What in the newly baptized? for he too is brought into the same condition: why dost thou mourn for him? For as the sun arises clear and bright, so the soul, leaving the body with a pure conscience, shines joyously. Not such the spectacle of Emperor as he comes in state to take possession of the city (epibainontapoLewj), not such the hush of awe, as when the soul having quitted the body is departing in company with Angels. Think what the soul must then be! in what amazement, what wonder, what delight! Why mournest thou? Answer me.-But it is only in the case of sinners thou doest this? Would that it were so, and I would not forbid your mournings, would that this were the object! This lamentation were Apostolic, this were after the pattern of the Lord; for even Jesus wept over Jerusalem. I would that your mournings were discriminated by this rule. But when thou speakest the words of one[fn-9-P939_846830:25-nf] that would call back (the dead), and speakest of thy long intimacy and his beneficence, it is but for this thou mournest (not because he was a sinner), thou dost but pretend to say it. Mourn, bewail the sinner, and I too will give a loose to tears; I, more than thou, the greater the punishment to which he is liable as such: I too will lament, with such an object. But not thou alone must lament him that is such; the whole city must do the same, and all that meet you on the way, as men bewail them that are led to be put to death. For this is a death indeed, an evil death, the death of sinners. But (with you) all is clean reversed. Such lamentation marks a lofty mind, and conveys much instruction; the other marks a littleness of soul. If we all lamented with this sort of lamentation, we should amend the persons themselves while yet living. For as, if it rested with thee to apply medicines which would prevent that bodily death, thou wouldest use them, just so now, if this death were the death thou lamentest, thou wouldest prevent its taking place, both in thyself and in him. Whereas now our behavior is a perfect riddle; that having it in our power to hinder its coming, we let it take place, and mourn over it when it has come. Worthy indeed of lamentations are they (when we consider), what time as they shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ, what words they shall then hear, what they shall suffer! To no purpose have these men lived: nay, not to no purpose, but to evil purpose! Of them too it may be fitly said, \"It were good for them had they never been born.\" (Mark xiv. 21.) For what profit is it, I ask, to have spent so much time to the hurt of his own person? Had it been spent only to no purpose, were not that, I ask you, punishment enough! If one who has been an hired servant twenty years were to find that he has had all his labor in vain, would he not weep and lament, and think himself the most miserable of men? Why, here is a man who has lost all the labor of a whole life: not one day has he lived for himself, but to luxury, to debauchery, to covetousness, to sin, to the devil. Then, say, shall we not bewail this man? shall we not try to snatch him from his perils? For it is, yes, it is possible, if we will, to mitigate his punishment, if we make continual prayers for him, if for him we give alms. However unworthy he may be, God will yield to our importunity. For if[fn-9-P940_850206:26-nf] Paul showed mercy on one (who had no claims on his mercy), and for the sake of others spared one (whom he would not have spared), much more is it right for us to do this. By means of his substance, by means of thine own, by what means thou wilt, aid him: pour in oil, nay rather, water. Has he no alms-deeds of his own to exhibit? Let him have at least those of his kindred. Has he none done by himself? At least let him have those which are done for him, that his wife may with confidence beg him off in that day, having paid down the ransom for him. The more sins he has to answer for, the greater need has he of alms, not only for this reason, but because the alms has not the same virtue now, but far less: for it is not all one to have done it himself, and to have another do it for him; therefore, the virtue being less, let us by quantity make it the greatest. Let us not busy ourselves about monuments, not about memorials. This is the greatest memorial: set widows to stand around him. Tell them his name: bid them all make for him their prayers, their supplications: this will overcome God: though it have not been done by the man himself, yet because of him another is the author of the almsgiving. Even this pertains to the mercy of God: \"widows standing around and weeping\" know how to rescue, not indeed from the present death, but from that which is to come. Many have profited even by the alms done by others on their behalf: for even if they have not got perfect (deliverance), at least they have found some comfort thence. If it be not so, how are children saved? And yet there, the children themselves contribute nothing, but their parents do all: and often have women had their children given them, though the children themselves contributed nothing.

Say,[fn-9-P937_844153:23-nf] if as we sit together, the Emperor were to send and invite some one of us to the palace, would it be right, I ask, to weep and mourn? Angels are present, commissioned from heaven and come from thence, sent from the King Himself to call their fellow servant, and say, dost thou weep? Knowest thou not what a mystery it is that is taking place, how awful, how dread, and worthy indeed of hymns and lauds? Wouldest thou learn, that thou mayest know, that this is no time for tears? For it is a very great mystery of the Wisdom of God. As if leaving her dwelling, the soul goes forth, speeding on her way to her own Lord, and dost thou mourn? Why then, thou shouldst do this on the birth of a child: for this in fact is also a birth, and a better than that. For here she goes forth to a very different light, is loosed as from a prison-house, comes off as from a contest. \"Yes,\" say you, \"it is all very well to say this,[fn-9-P938_845357:24-nf] in the case of those of whose salvation we are assured.\" Then, what ails thee, O man, that even in the case of such, thou dost not take it in this way? Say, what canst thou have to condemn in the little child? Why dost thou mourn for it? What in the newly baptized? for he too is brought into the same condition: why dost thou mourn for him? For as the sun arises clear and bright, so the soul, leaving the body with a pure conscience, shines joyously. Not such the spectacle of Emperor as he comes in state to take possession of the city (epibainontapoLewj), not such the hush of awe, as when the soul having quitted the body is departing in company with Angels. Think what the soul must then be! in what amazement, what wonder, what delight! Why mournest thou? Answer me.-But it is only in the case of sinners thou doest this? Would that it were so, and I would not forbid your mournings, would that this were the object! This lamentation were Apostolic, this were after the pattern of the Lord; for even Jesus wept over Jerusalem. I would that your mournings were discriminated by this rule. But when thou speakest the words of one[fn-9-P939_846830:25-nf] that would call back (the dead), and speakest of thy long intimacy and his beneficence, it is but for this thou mournest (not because he was a sinner), thou dost but pretend to say it. Mourn, bewail the sinner, and I too will give a loose to tears; I, more than thou, the greater the punishment to which he is liable as such: I too will lament, with such an object. But not thou alone must lament him that is such; the whole city must do the same, and all that meet you on the way, as men bewail them that are led to be put to death. For this is a death indeed, an evil death, the death of sinners. But (with you) all is clean reversed. Such lamentation marks a lofty mind, and conveys much instruction; the other marks a littleness of soul. If we all lamented with this sort of lamentation, we should amend the persons themselves while yet living. For as, if it rested with thee to apply medicines which would prevent that bodily death, thou wouldest use them, just so now, if this death were the death thou lamentest, thou wouldest prevent its taking place, both in thyself and in him. Whereas now our behavior is a perfect riddle; that having it in our power to hinder its coming, we let it take place, and mourn over it when it has come. Worthy indeed of lamentations are they (when we consider), what time as they shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ, what words they shall then hear, what they shall suffer! To no purpose have these men lived: nay, not to no purpose, but to evil purpose! Of them too it may be fitly said, \"It were good for them had they never been born.\" (Mark xiv. 21.) For what profit is it, I ask, to have spent so much time to the hurt of his own person? Had it been spent only to no purpose, were not that, I ask you, punishment enough! If one who has been an hired servant twenty years were to find that he has had all his labor in vain, would he not weep and lament, and think himself the most miserable of men? Why, here is a man who has lost all the labor of a whole life: not one day has he lived for himself, but to luxury, to debauchery, to covetousness, to sin, to the devil. Then, say, shall we not bewail this man? shall we not try to snatch him from his perils? For it is, yes, it is possible, if we will, to mitigate his punishment, if we make continual prayers for him, if for him we give alms. However unworthy he may be, God will yield to our importunity. For if[fn-9-P940_850206:26-nf] Paul showed mercy on one (who had no claims on his mercy), and for the sake of others spared one (whom he would not have spared), much more is it right for us to do this. By means of his substance, by means of thine own, by what means thou wilt, aid him: pour in oil, nay rather, water. Has he no alms-deeds of his own to exhibit? Let him have at least those of his kindred. Has he none done by himself? At least let him have those which are done for him, that his wife may with confidence beg him off in that day, having paid down the ransom for him. The more sins he has to answer for, the greater need has he of alms, not only for this reason, but because the alms has not the same virtue now, but far less: for it is not all one to have done it himself, and to have another do it for him; therefore, the virtue being less, let us by quantity make it the greatest. Let us not busy ourselves about monuments, not about memorials. This is the greatest memorial: set widows to stand around him. Tell them his name: bid them all make for him their prayers, their supplications: this will overcome God: though it have not been done by the man himself, yet because of him another is the author of the almsgiving. Even this pertains to the mercy of God: \"widows standing around and weeping\" know how to rescue, not indeed from the present death, but from that which is to come. Many have profited even by the alms done by others on their behalf: for even if they have not got perfect (deliverance), at least they have found some comfort thence. If it be not so, how are children saved? And yet there, the children themselves contribute nothing, but their parents do all: and often have women had their children given them, though the children themselves contributed nothing. Many are the ways God gives us to be saved, only let us not be negligent.","title":"Homily XXI.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":11,"source_code":"npnf1_11_npnf1_11_28_homily_xxi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-11","text":"[fn-9-P936_843457:22-nf] For where tears are-or rather, where miracles are, there tears ought not to be; not where such a mystery is celebrating.

To none other than Him is it suitable, who is also \"the Father of mercies,\"[fn-76-P7669_2195768:492-nf] and (in the prophets) has been described as \"full of compassion, and gracious, and plenteous in mercy.\"[fn-76-P7670_2195892:493-nf] In Jonah you find the signal act of His mercy, which He showed to the praying Ninevites.[fn-76-P7671_2196035:494-nf] How inflexible was He at the tears of Hezekiah![fn-76-P7672_2196104:495-nf] How ready to forgive Ahab, the husband of Jezebel, the blood of Naboth, when he deprecated His anger.[fn-76-P7673_2196231:496-nf] How prompt in pardoning David on his confession of his sin[fn-76-P7674_2196318:497-nf] -preferring, indeed, the sinner's repentance to his death, of course because of His gracious attribute of mercy.[fn-76-P7675_2196454:498-nf] Now, if Marcion's god has exhibited or proclaimed any such thing as this, I will allow him to be \"the Father of mercies.\" Since, however, he ascribes to him this title only from the time he has been revealed, as if he were the father of mercies from the time only when he began to liberate the human race, then we on our side, too,[fn-76-P7676_2196811:499-nf] adopt the same precise date of his alleged revelation; but it is that we may deny him! It is then not competent to him to ascribe any quality to his god, whom indeed he only promulged by the fact of such an ascription; for only if it were previously evident that his god had an existence, could he be permitted to ascribe an attribute to him. The ascribed attribute is only an accident; but accidents[fn-76-P7677_2197234:500-nf] are preceded by the statement of the thing itself of which they are predicated, especially when another claims the attribute which is ascribed to him who has not been previously shown to exist. Our denial of his existence will be all the more peremptory, because of the fact that the attribute which is alleged in proof of it belongs to that God who has been already revealed. Therefore \"the New Testament\" will appertain to none other than Him who promised it-if not \"its letter, yet its spirit; \"[fn-76-P7678_2197775:501-nf] and herein will lie its newness. Indeed, He who had engraved its letter in stones is the same as He who had said of its spirit, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.\"[fn-76-P7679_2197972:502-nf] Even if \"the letter killeth, yet the Spirit giveth life; \"[fn-76-P7680_2198051:503-nf] and both belong to Him who says: \"I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.\"[fn-76-P7681_2198156:504-nf] We have already made good the Creator's claim to this twofold character of judgment and goodness[fn-76-P7682_2198277:505-nf] -\"killing in the letter\" through the law, and \"quickening in the Spirit\" through the Gospel. Now these attributes, however different they be, cannot possibly make two gods; for they have already (in the prevenient dispensation of the Old Testament) been found to meet in One.[fn-76-P7683_2198601:506-nf] He alludes to Moses' veil, covered with which \"his face could not be stedfastly seen by the children of Israel.\"[fn-76-P7684_2198755:507-nf] Since he did this to maintain the superiority of the glory of the New Testament, which is permanent in its glory, over that of the Old, \"which was to be done away,\"[fn-76-P7685_2198946:508-nf] this fact gives support to my belief which exalts the Gospel above the law and you must look well to it that it does not even more than this. For only there is superiority possible where was previously the thing over which superiority can be affirmed. But then he says, \"But their minds were blinded\"[fn-76-P7686_2199272:509-nf] -of the world; certainly not the Creator's mind, but the minds of the people which are in the world.[fn-76-P7687_2199416:510-nf] Of Israel he says, Even unto this day the same veil is upon their heart; \"[fn-76-P7688_2199659:511-nf] showing that the veil which was on the face of Moses was a figure of the veil which is on the heart of the nation still; because even now Moses is not seen by them in heart, just as he was not then seen by them in eye. But what concern has Paul with the veil which still obscures Moses from their view, if the Christ of the Creator, whom Moses predicted, is not yet come? How are the hearts of the Jews represented as still covered and veiled, if the predictions of Moses relating to Christ, in whom it was their duty to believe through him, are as yet unfulfilled? What had the apostle of a strange Christ to complain of, if the Jews failed in understanding the mysterious announcements of their own God, unless the veil which was upon their hearts had reference to that blindness which concealed from their eyes the Christ of Moses? Then, again, the words which follow, But when it shall turn to the Lord, the evil shall be taken away,\"[fn-76-P7689_2200621:512-nf] properly refer to the Jew, over whose gaze Moses' veil is spread, to the effect that, when he is turned to the faith of Christ, he will understand how Moses spoke of Christ. But how shall the veil of the Creator be taken away by the Christ of another god, whose mysteries the Creator could not possibly have veiled-unknown mysteries, as they were of an unknown god? So he says that \"we now with open face\" (meaning the candour of the heart, which in the Jews had been covered with a veil), \"beholding Christ, are changed into the same image, from that glory\" (wherewith Moses was transfigured as by the glory of the Lord) \"to another glory.\"[fn-76-P7690_2201286:513-nf] By thus setting forth the glory which illumined the person of Moses from his interview with God, and the veil which concealed the same from the infirmity of the people, and by superinducing thereupon the revelation and the glory of the Spirit in the person of Christ-\"even as,\" to use his words, \"by the Spirit of the Lord\"[fn-76-P7691_2201633:514-nf] -he testifies that the whole Mosaic system[fn-76-P7692_2201897:515-nf] was a figure of Christ, of whom the Jews indeed were ignorant, but who is known to us Christians. We are quite aware that some passages are open to ambiguity, from the way in which they are read, or else from their punctuation, when there is room for these two causes of ambiguity. The latter method has been adopted by Marcion, by reading the passage which follows, \"in whom the God of this world,\"[fn-76-P7693_2202325:516-nf] as if it described the Creator as the God of this world, in order that he may, by these words, imply that there is another God for the other world. We, however, say that the passage ought to be punctuated with a comma after God, to this effect: \"In whom God hath blinded the eyes of the unbelievers of this world.\"[fn-76-P7694_2202661:517-nf] \"In whom\" means the Jewish unbelievers, from some of whom the gospel is still hidden under Moses' veil. Now it is these whom God had threatened for \"loving Him indeed with the lip, whilst their heart was far from Him,\"[fn-76-P7695_2203650:518-nf] in these angry words: \"Ye shall hear with your ears, and not understand; and see with your eyes, but not perceive; \"[fn-76-P7696_2203789:519-nf] and, \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand; \"[fn-76-P7697_2203881:520-nf] and again, \"I will take away the wisdom of their wise men, and bring to nought[fn-76-P7698_2203987:521-nf] the understanding of their prudent ones.\" But these words, of course, He did not pronounce against them for concealing the gospel of the unknown God. At any rate, if there is a God of this world,[fn-76-P7699_2204217:522-nf] He blinds the heart of the unbelievers of this world, because they have not of their own accord recognised His Christ, who ought to be understood from His Scriptures.[fn-77-P7700_2204457:523-nf] Content with my advantage, I can willingly refrain from noticing to any greater length[fn-77-P7701_2204617:524-nf] this point of ambiguous punctuation, so as not to give my adversary any advantage,[fn-77-P7702_2204753:525-nf] indeed, I might have wholly omitted the discussion. A simpler answer I shall find ready to hand in interpreting \"the god of this world\" of the devil, who once said, as the prophet describes him: \"I will be like the Most High; I will exalt my throne in the clouds.\"[fn-77-P7703_2205190:526-nf] The whole superstition, indeed, of this world has got into his hands,[fn-77-P7704_2205281:527-nf] so that he blinds effectually the hearts of unbelievers, and of none more than the apostate Marcion's. Now he did not observe how much this clause of the sentence made against him: \"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to (give) the light of the knowledge (of His glory) in the face of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7705_2205660:528-nf] Now who was it that said; \"Let there be light? \"[fn-77-P7706_2205730:529-nf] And who was it that said to Christ concerning giving light to the world: \"I have set Thee as a light to the Gentiles\"[fn-77-P7707_2205866:530-nf] -to them, that is, \"who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death? \"[fn-77-P7708_2205989:531-nf] (None else, surely, than He), to whom the Spirit in the Psalm answers, in His foresight of the future, saying, \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, hath been displayed upon us.\"[fn-77-P7709_2206205:532-nf] Now the countenance (or person[fn-77-P7710_2206262:533-nf] ) of the Lord here is Christ. Wherefore the apostle said above: Christ, who is the image of God.\"[fn-77-P7711_2206409:534-nf] Since Christ, then, is the person of the Creator, who said, \"Let there be light,\" it follows that Christ and the apostles, and the gospel, and the veil, and Moses-nay, the whole of the dispensations-belong to the God who is the Creator of this world, according to the testimony of the clause (above adverted to), and certainly not to him who never said, \"Let there be light.\" I here pass over discussion about another epistle, which we hold to have been written to the Ephesians, but the heretics to the Laodiceans. In it he tells[fn-77-P7712_2206961:535-nf] them to remember, that at the time when they were Gentiles they were without Christ, aliens from (the commonwealth of) Israel, without intercourse, without the covenants and any hope of promise, nay, without God, even in his own world,[fn-77-P7713_2207209:536-nf] as the Creator thereof. Since therefore he said, that the Gentiles were without God, whilst their god was the devil, not the Creator, it is clear that he must be understood to be the lord of this world, whom the Gentiles received as their god-not the Creator, of whom they were in ignorance. But how does it happen, that \"the treasure which we have in these earthen vessels of ours\"[fn-77-P7714_2207612:537-nf] should not be regarded as belonging to the God who owns the vessels? Now since God's glory is, that so great a treasure is contained in earthen vessels, and since these earthen vessels are of the Creator's make, it follows that the glory is the Creator's; nay, since these vessels of His smack so much of the excellency of the power of God, that power itself must be His also! Indeed, all these things have been consigned to the said \"earthen vessels\" for the very purpose that His excellence might be manifested forth. Henceforth, then, the rival god will have no claim to the glory, and consequently none to the power. Rather, dishonour and weakness will accrue to him, because the earthen vessels with which he had nothing to do have received all the excellency! Well, then, if it be in these very earthen vessels that he tells us we have to endure so great sufferings,[fn-77-P7715_2208506:538-nf] in which we bear about with us the very dying of God,[fn-77-P7716_2208584:539-nf] (Marcion's) god is really ungrateful and unjust, if he does not mean to restore this same I substance of ours at the resurrection, wherein so much has been endured in loyalty to him, in which Christ's very death is borne about, wherein too the excellency of his power is treasured.[fn-77-P7717_2209030:540-nf] For he gives prominence to the statement, \"That the life also of Christ may be manifested in our body,\"[fn-77-P7718_2209156:541-nf] as a contrast to the preceding, that His death is borne about in our body. Now of what life of Christ does he here speak? Of that which we are now living? Then how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the things which are seen and are temporal, but to those which are not seen and are eternal[fn-77-P7719_2209494:542-nf] -in other words, not to the present, but to the future? But if it be of the future life of Christ that he speaks, intimating that it is to be made manifest in our body,[fn-77-P7720_2209688:543-nf] then he has clearly predicted the resurrection of the flesh.[fn-77-P7721_2209771:544-nf] He says, too, that \"our outward man perishes,\"[fn-77-P7722_2209840:545-nf] not meaning by an eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in reference to which he previously said, \"For which cause we will not faint.\"[fn-77-P7723_2210021:546-nf] Now, when he adds of \"the inward man\" also, that it \"is renewed day by day,\" he demonstrates both issues here-the wasting away of the body by the wear and tear[fn-77-P7724_2210203:547-nf] of its trials, and the renewal of the soul[fn-77-P7725_2210264:548-nf] by its contemplation of the promises.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":3,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"ANF-03","text":"If, owing to the fault of human error, the word God has become a common name (since in the world there are said and believed to be \"gods many\"[fn-76-P7665_2195216:488-nf] ), yet \"the blessed God,\" (who is \"the Father) of our Lord Jesus Christ,\"[fn-76-P7666_2195313:489-nf] will be understood to be no other God than the Creator, who both blessed all things (that He had made), as you find in Genesis,[fn-76-P7667_2195461:490-nf] and is Himself \"blessed by all things,\" as Daniel tells us.[fn-76-P7668_2195540:491-nf] Now, if the title of Father may be claimed for (Marcion's) sterile god, how much more for the Creator? To none other than Him is it suitable, who is also \"the Father of mercies,\"[fn-76-P7669_2195768:492-nf] and (in the prophets) has been described as \"full of compassion, and gracious, and plenteous in mercy.\"[fn-76-P7670_2195892:493-nf] In Jonah you find the signal act of His mercy, which He showed to the praying Ninevites.[fn-76-P7671_2196035:494-nf] How inflexible was He at the tears of Hezekiah![fn-76-P7672_2196104:495-nf] How ready to forgive Ahab, the husband of Jezebel, the blood of Naboth, when he deprecated His anger.[fn-76-P7673_2196231:496-nf] How prompt in pardoning David on his confession of his sin[fn-76-P7674_2196318:497-nf] -preferring, indeed, the sinner's repentance to his death, of course because of His gracious attribute of mercy.[fn-76-P7675_2196454:498-nf] Now, if Marcion's god has exhibited or proclaimed any such thing as this, I will allow him to be \"the Father of mercies.\" Since, however, he ascribes to him this title only from the time he has been revealed, as if he were the father of mercies from the time only when he began to liberate the human race, then we on our side, too,[fn-76-P7676_2196811:499-nf] adopt the same precise date of his alleged revelation; but it is that we may deny him! It is then not competent to him to ascribe any quality to his god, whom indeed he only promulged by the fact of such an ascription; for only if it were previously evident that his god had an existence, could he be permitted to ascribe an attribute to him. The ascribed attribute is only an accident; but accidents[fn-76-P7677_2197234:500-nf] are preceded by the statement of the thing itself of which they are predicated, especially when another claims the attribute which is ascribed to him who has not been previously shown to exist. Our denial of his existence will be all the more peremptory, because of the fact that the attribute which is alleged in proof of it belongs to that God who has been already revealed. Therefore \"the New Testament\" will appertain to none other than Him who promised it-if not \"its letter, yet its spirit; \"[fn-76-P7678_2197775:501-nf] and herein will lie its newness. Indeed, He who had engraved its letter in stones is the same as He who had said of its spirit, \"I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.\"[fn-76-P7679_2197972:502-nf] Even if \"the letter killeth, yet the Spirit giveth life; \"[fn-76-P7680_2198051:503-nf] and both belong to Him who says: \"I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.\"[fn-76-P7681_2198156:504-nf] We have already made good the Creator's claim to this twofold character of judgment and goodness[fn-76-P7682_2198277:505-nf] -\"killing in the letter\" through the law, and \"quickening in the Spirit\" through the Gospel. Now these attributes, however different they be, cannot possibly make two gods; for they have already (in the prevenient dispensation of the Old Testament) been found to meet in One.[fn-76-P7683_2198601:506-nf] He alludes to Moses' veil, covered with which \"his face could not be stedfastly seen by the children of Israel.\"[fn-76-P7684_2198755:507-nf] Since he did this to maintain the superiority of the glory of the New Testament, which is permanent in its glory, over that of the Old, \"which was to be done away,\"[fn-76-P7685_2198946:508-nf] this fact gives support to my belief which exalts the Gospel above the law and you must look well to it that it does not even more than this. For only there is superiority possible where was previously the thing over which superiority can be affirmed. But then he says, \"But their minds were blinded\"[fn-76-P7686_2199272:509-nf] -of the world; certainly not the Creator's mind, but the minds of the people which are in the world.[fn-76-P7687_2199416:510-nf] Of Israel he says, Even unto this day the same veil is upon their heart; \"[fn-76-P7688_2199659:511-nf] showing that the veil which was on the face of Moses was a figure of the veil which is on the heart of the nation still; because even now Moses is not seen by them in heart, just as he was not then seen by them in eye. But what concern has Paul with the veil which still obscures Moses from their view, if the Christ of the Creator, whom Moses predicted, is not yet come? How are the hearts of the Jews represented as still covered and veiled, if the predictions of Moses relating to Christ, in whom it was their duty to believe through him, are as yet unfulfilled? What had the apostle of a strange Christ to complain of, if the Jews failed in understanding the mysterious announcements of their own God, unless the veil which was upon their hearts had reference to that blindness which concealed from their eyes the Christ of Moses? Then, again, the words which follow, But when it shall turn to the Lord, the evil shall be taken away,\"[fn-76-P7689_2200621:512-nf] properly refer to the Jew, over whose gaze Moses' veil is spread, to the effect that, when he is turned to the faith of Christ, he will understand how Moses spoke of Christ. But how shall the veil of the Creator be taken away by the Christ of another god, whose mysteries the Creator could not possibly have veiled-unknown mysteries, as they were of an unknown god? So he says that \"we now with open face\" (meaning the candour of the heart, which in the Jews had been covered with a veil), \"beholding Christ, are changed into the same image, from that glory\" (wherewith Moses was transfigured as by the glory of the Lord) \"to another glory.\"[fn-76-P7690_2201286:513-nf] By thus setting forth the glory which illumined the person of Moses from his interview with God, and the veil which concealed the same from the infirmity of the people, and by superinducing thereupon the revelation and the glory of the Spirit in the person of Christ-\"even as,\" to use his words, \"by the Spirit of the Lord\"[fn-76-P7691_2201633:514-nf] -he testifies that the whole Mosaic system[fn-76-P7692_2201897:515-nf] was a figure of Christ, of whom the Jews indeed were ignorant, but who is known to us Christians. We are quite aware that some passages are open to ambiguity, from the way in which they are read, or else from their punctuation, when there is room for these two causes of ambiguity. The latter method has been adopted by Marcion, by reading the passage which follows, \"in whom the God of this world,\"[fn-76-P7693_2202325:516-nf] as if it described the Creator as the God of this world, in order that he may, by these words, imply that there is another God for the other world. We, however, say that the passage ought to be punctuated with a comma after God, to this effect: \"In whom God hath blinded the eyes of the unbelievers of this world.\"[fn-76-P7694_2202661:517-nf] \"In whom\" means the Jewish unbelievers, from some of whom the gospel is still hidden under Moses' veil. Now it is these whom God had threatened for \"loving Him indeed with the lip, whilst their heart was far from Him,\"[fn-76-P7695_2203650:518-nf] in these angry words: \"Ye shall hear with your ears, and not understand; and see with your eyes, but not perceive; \"[fn-76-P7696_2203789:519-nf] and, \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand; \"[fn-76-P7697_2203881:520-nf] and again, \"I will take away the wisdom of their wise men, and bring to nought[fn-76-P7698_2203987:521-nf] the understanding of their prudent ones.\" But these words, of course, He did not pronounce against them for concealing the gospel of the unknown God. At any rate, if there is a God of this world,[fn-76-P7699_2204217:522-nf] He blinds the heart of the unbelievers of this world, because they have not of their own accord recognised His Christ, who ought to be understood from His Scriptures.[fn-77-P7700_2204457:523-nf] Content with my advantage, I can willingly refrain from noticing to any greater length[fn-77-P7701_2204617:524-nf] this point of ambiguous punctuation, so as not to give my adversary any advantage,[fn-77-P7702_2204753:525-nf] indeed, I might have wholly omitted the discussion. A simpler answer I shall find ready to hand in interpreting \"the god of this world\" of the devil, who once said, as the prophet describes him: \"I will be like the Most High; I will exalt my throne in the clouds.\"[fn-77-P7703_2205190:526-nf] The whole superstition, indeed, of this world has got into his hands,[fn-77-P7704_2205281:527-nf] so that he blinds effectually the hearts of unbelievers, and of none more than the apostate Marcion's. Now he did not observe how much this clause of the sentence made against him: \"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to (give) the light of the knowledge (of His glory) in the face of (Jesus) Christ.\"[fn-77-P7705_2205660:528-nf] Now who was it that said; \"Let there be light? \"[fn-77-P7706_2205730:529-nf] And who was it that said to Christ concerning giving light to the world: \"I have set Thee as a light to the Gentiles\"[fn-77-P7707_2205866:530-nf] -to them, that is, \"who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death? \"[fn-77-P7708_2205989:531-nf] (None else, surely, than He), to whom the Spirit in the Psalm answers, in His foresight of the future, saying, \"The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, hath been displayed upon us.\"[fn-77-P7709_2206205:532-nf] Now the countenance (or person[fn-77-P7710_2206262:533-nf] ) of the Lord here is Christ. Wherefore the apostle said above: Christ, who is the image of God.\"[fn-77-P7711_2206409:534-nf] Since Christ, then, is the person of the Creator, who said, \"Let there be light,\" it follows that Christ and the apostles, and the gospel, and the veil, and Moses-nay, the whole of the dispensations-belong to the God who is the Creator of this world, according to the testimony of the clause (above adverted to), and certainly not to him who never said, \"Let there be light.\" I here pass over discussion about another epistle, which we hold to have been written to the Ephesians, but the heretics to the Laodiceans. In it he tells[fn-77-P7712_2206961:535-nf] them to remember, that at the time when they were Gentiles they were without Christ, aliens from (the commonwealth of) Israel, without intercourse, without the covenants and any hope of promise, nay, without God, even in his own world,[fn-77-P7713_2207209:536-nf] as the Creator thereof. Since therefore he said, that the Gentiles were without God, whilst their god was the devil, not the Creator, it is clear that he must be understood to be the lord of this world, whom the Gentiles received as their god-not the Creator, of whom they were in ignorance. But how does it happen, that \"the treasure which we have in these earthen vessels of ours\"[fn-77-P7714_2207612:537-nf] should not be regarded as belonging to the God who owns the vessels? Now since God's glory is, that so great a treasure is contained in earthen vessels, and since these earthen vessels are of the Creator's make, it follows that the glory is the Creator's; nay, since these vessels of His smack so much of the excellency of the power of God, that power itself must be His also! Indeed, all these things have been consigned to the said \"earthen vessels\" for the very purpose that His excellence might be manifested forth. Henceforth, then, the rival god will have no claim to the glory, and consequently none to the power. Rather, dishonour and weakness will accrue to him, because the earthen vessels with which he had nothing to do have received all the excellency! Well, then, if it be in these very earthen vessels that he tells us we have to endure so great sufferings,[fn-77-P7715_2208506:538-nf] in which we bear about with us the very dying of God,[fn-77-P7716_2208584:539-nf] (Marcion's) god is really ungrateful and unjust, if he does not mean to restore this same I substance of ours at the resurrection, wherein so much has been endured in loyalty to him, in which Christ's very death is borne about, wherein too the excellency of his power is treasured.[fn-77-P7717_2209030:540-nf] For he gives prominence to the statement, \"That the life also of Christ may be manifested in our body,\"[fn-77-P7718_2209156:541-nf] as a contrast to the preceding, that His death is borne about in our body. Now of what life of Christ does he here speak? Of that which we are now living? Then how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the things which are seen and are temporal, but to those which are not seen and are eternal[fn-77-P7719_2209494:542-nf] -in other words, not to the present, but to the future? But if it be of the future life of Christ that he speaks, intimating that it is to be made manifest in our body,[fn-77-P7720_2209688:543-nf] then he has clearly predicted the resurrection of the flesh.[fn-77-P7721_2209771:544-nf] He says, too, that \"our outward man perishes,\"[fn-77-P7722_2209840:545-nf] not meaning by an eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in reference to which he previously said, \"For which cause we will not faint.\"[fn-77-P7723_2210021:546-nf] Now, when he adds of \"the inward man\" also, that it \"is renewed day by day,\" he demonstrates both issues here-the wasting away of the body by the wear and tear[fn-77-P7724_2210203:547-nf] of its trials, and the renewal of the soul[fn-77-P7725_2210264:548-nf] by its contemplation of the promises.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"7. Augustin replied: If you allow, in consideration of the authority of the Gospel, that Christ said that He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them, you should show the same consideration to the authority of the apostle, when he says, \"All these things were our examples;\" and again of Christ, \"He was not yea and nay, but in Him was yea; for all the promises of God are in Him yea;\"[fn-18-P1826_1029214:9-nf] that is, they are set forth and fulfilled in Him. In this way you will see in the clearest light both what law Christ fulfilled, and how He fulfilled it. It is a vain attempt that you make to escape by your three kinds of law and your three kinds of prophets. It is quite plain, and the New Testament leaves no doubt on the matter, what law and what prophets Christ came not to destroy, but to fulfill. The law given by Moses is that which by Jesus Christ became grace and truth.[fn-18-P1827_1029716:10-nf] The law given by Moses is that of which Christ says, \"He wrote of me.\"[fn-18-P1828_1029804:11-nf] For undoubtedly this is the law which entered that the offence might abound;[fn-18-P1829_1029898:12-nf] words which you often ignorantly quote as a reproach to the law. Read what is there said of this law: \"The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good.\"[fn-18-P1830_1030220:13-nf] The entrance of the law made the offense abound, not because the law required what was wrong, but because the proud and self-confident incurred additional guilt as transgressors after their acquaintance with the holy, and just, and good commandments of the law; so that, being thus humbled, they might learn that only by grace through faith could they be freed from subjection to the law as transgressors, and be reconciled to the law as righteous. So the same apostle says: \"For before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which was afterwards revealed. Therefore the law was our schoolmaster in Christ Jesus; but after faith came, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.\"[fn-18-P1831_1030943:14-nf] That is, we are no longer subject to the penalty of the law, because we are set free by grace. Before we received in humility the grace of the Spirit, the letter was only death to us, for it required obedience which we could not render. Thus Paul also says: \"The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.\"[fn-18-P1832_1031274:15-nf] Again, he says: \"For if a law had been given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law; but the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.\"[fn-18-P1833_1031546:16-nf] And once more: \"What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, that by sin He might condemn sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.\"[fn-18-P1834_1031861:17-nf] Here we see Christ coming not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. As the law brought the proud under the guilt of transgression, increasing their sin by commandments which they could not obey, so the righteousness of the same law is fulfilled by the grace of the Spirit in those who learn from Christ to be meek and lowly in heart; for Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it. Moreover, because even for those who are under grace it is difficult in this mortal life perfectly to keep what is written in the law, Thou shall not covet, Christ, by the sacrifice of His flesh, as our Priest obtains pardon for us. And in this also He fulfills the law; for what we fail in through weakness is supplied by His perfection, who is the Head, while we are His members. Thus John says: \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not; and if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: He is the propitiation for our sins.\"[fn-18-P1835_1032867:18-nf] ","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":23,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"24","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"23.

Indeed in all spiritual delights, which unmarried women enjoy, their holy conversation ought also to be with caution; lest haply, though their life be not evil through haughtiness, their report be evil through negligence. Nor are they to be listened to, whether they be holy men or women, when (upon occasion of their neglect in some matter being blamed, through which it comes to pass that they fall into evil suspicion, from which they know that their life is far removed) they say that it is enough for them their conscience before God, despising what men think of them, not only imprudently[fn-42-P4232_2006650:73-nf] but also cruelly; when they slay the souls of others; whether of such as blaspheme the way of God, who following their suspicion are displeased at what is the chaste life of the Saints, as though, it were shameful, or of such also as make excuse, and imitate, not what they see, but what they think. Wherefore whosoever guards his life from charges of shameful and evil deeds, does good to himself; but whosoever guards his character too, is merciful also towards others. For unto ourselves our ownlife is necessary, unto others our character;and certainly even what we mercifully minister unto others, for their health, abounds also to our own profit. Whence not in vain the Apostle, \"We provide good things,\" saith he, \"not only before God, but also before men;\"[fn-42-P4233_2007462:74-nf] also he saith, \"Please ye all men through all things; even as I also please all men through all things, not seeking what is of profit unto myself, but what unto many, that they may be saved.\"[fn-42-P4234_2007688:75-nf] Also in a certain exhortation he says, \"For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are holy, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are most dear whatsoever things are of good report; if any virtue, if any praise, these things think on, which ye have both learned, and received, arid heard, and seen in me.\"[fn-42-P4235_2008077:76-nf] You see howl among many things, unto which by exhortation he admonished them, he neglected not to set, \"whatsoever things are of good report;\" and in two words included all things, where he saith, \"if any virtue, if any praise.\" For unto virtue pertain the good things of which He made mention above; but good report unto praise. I think that the Apostle took not the praise of men for any great thing, saying in another place, \"But to me it is the least thing, that I be judged of you, or of day of man;\"[fn-42-P4236_2008604:77-nf] and in another place, \"If I were pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ;\"[fn-42-P4237_2008708:78-nf] and again, \"For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience.\"[fn-42-P4238_2008794:79-nf] But of these two, that is, of a good life, and a good report, or as is said more shortly, of virtue and praise, the one for his own sake he most wisely kept, the other for the sake of others he most mercifully provided. But, forasmuch as human caution, how great soever, cannot on every side avoid most malevolent suspicions, when for our good report we shall have done whatever we rightly can, if any, either by falsely pretending evil things of us, or from believing evil of us, endeavor to stain our fair fame, let there be present the solace of conscience, and clearly also the joy, in that our reward is great in Heaven, even when men say many evil things of us,[fn-42-P4239_2009481:80-nf] and we yet live godly and righteously. For that reward is as the pay of such as serve as soldiers, through the arms of righteousness, not only on the right hand, but on the left also; that is to say, through glory and mean estate, through ill report and good report.[fn-42-P4240_2009770:81-nf] ","title":"On the Good of Widowhood","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":8,"source_code":"npnf1_10_npnf1_10_34_homily_xxviii_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF1-10","text":"The tempest therefore being thoroughly excited, and the sea raging, \"They awake Him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish\"[fn-28-P2856_940933:6-nf] But He rebuked them before He rebuked the sea.

However, they must contrive to recall to their mind even now our preceding arguments, in order that the occasion which originally suggested this passage may assist our judgment in arriving at its meaning. The apostle, as I take it, having set forth for the Corinthians the details of their church discipline, had summed up the substance of his own gospel, and of their belief in an exposition of the Lord's death and resurrection, for the purpose of deducing therefrom the rule of our hope, and the groundwork thereof. Accordingly he subjoins this statement: \"Now if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain, because ye are yet in your sins, and they which have fallen asleep in Christ are perished.\"[fn-101-P10163_2835410:340-nf] Now, what is the point which he evidently labours hard to make us believe throughout this passage? The resurrection of the dead, you say, which was denied: he certainly wished it to be believed on the strength of the example which he adduced-the Lord's resurrection. Certainly, you say. Well now, is an example borrowed from different circumstances, or from like ones? From like ones, by all means, is your answer. How then did Christ rise again? In the flesh, or not? No doubt, since you are told that He \"died according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-101-P10164_2835977:341-nf] and \"that He was buried according to the Scriptures,\"[fn-101-P10165_2836046:342-nf] no otherwise than in the flesh, you will also allow that it was in the flesh that He was raised from the dead. For the very same body which fell in death, and which lay in the sepulchre, did also rise again; (and it was) not so much Christ in the flesh, as the flesh in Christ. If, therefore, we are to rise again after the example of Christ, who rose in the flesh, we shall certainly not rise according to that example, unless we also shall ourselves rise again in the flesh. \"For,\" he says, \"since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.\"[fn-101-P10166_2836628:343-nf] (This he says) in order, on the one hand, to distinguish the two authors-Adam of death, Christ of resurrection; and, on the other hand, to make the resurrection operate on the same substance as the death, by comparing the authors themselves under the designation man. For if \"as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive,\"[fn-101-P10167_2836984:344-nf] their vivification in Christ must be in the flesh, since it is in the flesh that arises their death in Adam. \"But every man in his own order,\"[fn-101-P10168_2837149:345-nf] because of course it will be also every man in his own body. For the order will be arranged severally, on account of the individual merits. Now, as the merits must be ascribed to the body, it must needs follow that the order also should be arranged in respect of the bodies, that it may be in relation to their merits. But inasmuch as \"some are also baptized for the dead,\"[fn-101-P10169_2837539:346-nf] we will see whether there be a good reason for this. Now it is certain that they adopted this (practice) with such a presumption as made them suppose that the vicarious baptism (in question) would be beneficial to the flesh of another in anticipation of the resurrection; for unless it were a bodily resurrection, there would be no pledge secured by this process of a corporeal baptism. \"Why are they then baptized for the dead,\"[fn-101-P10170_2837986:347-nf] he asks, unless the bodies rise again which are thus baptized? For it is not the soul which is sanctified by the baptismal bath:[fn-101-P10171_2838131:348-nf] its sanctification comes from the \"answer.\"[fn-101-P10172_2838193:349-nf] \"And why,\" he inquires, \"stand we in jeopardy every hour? \"[fn-101-P10173_2838282:350-nf] -meaning, of course, through the flesh. \"I die daily,\"[fn-101-P10174_2838359:351-nf] (says he); that is, undoubtedly, in the perils of the body, in which \"he even fought with beasts at Ephesus,\"[fn-101-P10175_2838485:352-nf] -even with those beasts which caused him such peril and trouble in Asia, to which he alludes in his second epistle to the same church of Corinth: \"For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed above measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life.\"[fn-101-P10176_2838829:353-nf] Now, if I mistake not, he enumerates all these particulars in order that in his unwillingness to have his conflicts in the flesh supposed to be useless, he may induce an unfaltering belief in the resurrection of the flesh. For useless must that conflict be deemed (which is sustained in a body) for which no resurrection is in prospect. \"But some man will say, How are the dead to be raised? And with what body will they come? \"[fn-101-P10177_2839278:354-nf] Now here he discusses the qualities of bodies, whether it be the very same, or different ones, which men are to resume. Since, however, such a question as this must be regarded as a subsequent one, it will in passing be enough for us that the resurrection is determined to be a bodily one even from this, that it is about the quality of bodies that the inquiry arises.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":1,"verse":22,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":55,"source_paragraph":"174","folder":"ANF-03","text":"What shall we say then?

They seem to themselves to lay down their lives for their brethren. If for the brethren they laid down their lives, they would not separate themselves from the whole brotherhood. Again, how many there are who for the sake of vainglory bestow much, give much, and seek therein but the praise of men and popular glory, which is full of windiness, and possesses no stability! Seeing, then, there are such, where shall be the proof of brotherly charity? Seeing he wished it to be proved, and hath said by way of admonition, \"My little children, let us not love only in word and in tongue; but in deed and in truth;\" we ask, in what work, in what truth? Can there be a more manifest work than to give to the poor? Many do this of vainglory, not of love. Can there be a greater work than to die for the brethren? This also, many would fain be thought to do, who do it of vainglory to get a name, not from bowels of love. It remains, that that man loves his brother, who before God, where God alone seeth, assures his own heart, and questions his. heart whether he does this indeed for love of the brethren; and his witness is that eye which penetrates the heart, where man cannot look. Therefore Paul the Apostle, because he was ready to die for the brethren, and said, \"I will myself be spent for your souls,\"[fn-43-P4354_2357031:7-nf] yet, because God only saw this in his heart, not the mortal men to whom he spake, he saith to them, \"But to me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or at man's bar.\"[fn-43-P4355_2357235:8-nf] And the same apostle shows also in a certain place, that these things are oft done of empty vainglory, not upon the solid ground of love: for speaking of the praises of charity he saith, \"If I distribute all my goods to the poor. and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-43-P4356_2357572:9-nf] Is it possible for a man to do this without charity? It is. For they that have divided unity, are persons that have not charity. Seek there, and ye shall see many giving much to the poor; shallsee others prepared to welcome death, insomuch that where there is no persecutor they cast themselves headlong: these doubtless without charity do this. Let us come back then to conscience, of which the apostle saith: \"For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience.\"[fn-43-P4357_2358064:10-nf] Let us come back to conscience, of which the same saith, \"But let each prove his own work, and then he shall have glorying in himself and not in another.\"[fn-43-P4358_2358238:11-nf] Therefore, let each one of us \"prove his own work,\" whether it flow forth from the vein of charity, whether it be from charity as the root that his good works sprout forth as branches. \"But let each prove his own work, and then he shall have glorying in himself and not in another,\" not when another's tongue bears witness to him, but when his own conscience bears it.","title":"Homily VI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_51_homily_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"31","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"18. This then is the third cause of affliction; and the fourth is, that the saints might not be supposed to serve God from a hope of present prosperity. For many of those who live in debauchery, when blamed as they often are by many, and invited to the labours of virtue; and when they hear the saints commended for their cheerfulness under great hardships,[fn-16-P1602_1279060:36-nf] attack their character on this ground; and not men only, but the devil himself hath taken up this suspicion. For when Job was surrounded with great wealth, and enjoyed much opulence, that wicked demon,[fn-16-P1603_1279349:37-nf] being reproached by God on his account, and having nothing to say; when he could neither answer the accusations against himself, nor impugn the virtue of this just man; took refuge at once in this defence, speaking thus, \"Doth Job fear thee for nought? Hast thou not made an hedge about him on all sides.\"[fn-16-P1604_1279875:38-nf] \"For reward then,\" saith he, \"that man is virtuous, enjoying thereby so much opulence.\" What then did God? Being desirous to show, that it was not for reward that his saints serve Him, He stripped him of all his opulence; gave him over to poverty; and permitted him to fall into grievous disease. Afterwards reproving him,[fn-16-P1605_1280235:39-nf] that he had suspected thus without cause, He saith, \"He let holdeth fast his integrity; to no purpose didst thou move me to destroy his substance.\" For it is a sufficient reward, and compensation to the saints, that they are serving God; since this indeed to the lover is reward enough, to love the object of his love;[fn-16-P1606_1280623:40-nf] and he seeks nothing besides, nor accounts anything greater than this. And if such be the case with regard to a man, much more in relation to God; which therefore that God might demonstrate, He gave more than the devil asked; for the latter said, \"Put forth thine hand, and touch him;\"[fn-16-P1607_1281102:41-nf] but God said not thus, but, \"I deliver him unto thee.\" For just as in the contests[fn-16-P1608_1281206:42-nf] of the outer world, the combatants that are vigorous, and in high condition of body,[fn-16-P1609_1281508:43-nf] are not so well discerned, when they are enwrapt all around with the garment soaked in oil; but when casting this aside, they are brought forward unclothed into the arena; then above all they strike the spectators on every side with astonishment at the proportion of their limbs, there being no longer anything to conceal them; so also was it with Job. When he was enveloped in all that wealth, it was not visible to the many, what a man he was. But when, like the wrestler, that strips off his garment, he threw it aside, and came naked to the conflicts of piety, thus unclothed, he astonished all who saw him;[fn-16-P1610_1282141:44-nf] so that the very theatre of angels shouted at beholding his fortitude of soul, and applauded him as he won his crown! For, as I have already observed, he was not so well seen of men, when clad in all that wealth, as when, casting it away like a garment, he exhibited himself naked as it were in a theatre, in the midst of the world, and all admired his vigor of soul, evidenced as this was not only by his being stripped of all things, but by the conflict, and by his patience in respect of his infirmity. And as I said before, God Himself did not smite him; in order that the devil might not again say, \"Thou hast spared him, and hast not inflicted so great a trial as was necessary:\" but he gave to the adversary the destruction of his cattle, and power over his flesh. \"I am sure,\" saith He, \"of this wrestler; therefore I do not forbid thee to impose on him whatever struggles thou desirest.\" But as those who are well skilled in the sports of the palaestra, and have reason to rely on their art and bodily strength, often do not seize their antagonists upright, nor take an equal advantage, but suffer them to take them by the middle,[fn-16-P1611_1283421:45-nf] that they may make a more splendid conquest; so also God gave to the devil to take this saint by the waist, that when he had overcome, after an attack so greatly to his disadvantage, and stretched his adversary on the ground, his crown might be so much the more glorious!","title":"Homily I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":1,"verse":9,"source_code":"anf_02_anf02_57_book_i","source_chapter":12,"source_paragraph":"130","folder":"ANF-02","text":"This, then, \"the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God,\" and of those who are \"the wise the Lord knoweth their thoughts that they are vain.\"[fn-50-P5062_1514165:119-nf] Let no man therefore glory on account of pre-eminence in human thought.

And these opinions of heretics have sprung up now, when the Name of Christ is already glorified throughout all nations; when Christ, that is, is as it were now walking on the sea.

But when he saith, \"It is I;\" what else doth He say but that there is nothing in Him which does not really exist?

Wherefore also to those capable of perceiving he showed resurrection, that of the life still in the flesh, creeping on its belly. Whence also he applied the name \"brood of vipers\" to the voluptuous, who serve the belly and the pudenda, and cut off one another's heads for the sake of worldly pleasures. \"Little children, let us not love in word, or in tongue,\" says John, teaching them to be perfect, \"but in deed and in truth; hereby shall we know that we are of the truth.\"[fn-68-P6884_2109502:143-nf] And if \"God be love,\" piety also is love: \"there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.\"[fn-68-P6885_2109634:144-nf] \"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.\"[fn-68-P6886_2109718:145-nf] And again, to him who desires to become a Gnostic, it is written, \"But be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in love, in faith, in purity.\"[fn-68-P6887_2109903:146-nf] For perfection in faith differs, I think, from ordinary faith. And the divine apostle furnishes the rule for the Gnostic in these words, writing as follows: \"For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to lack. I can do all things through Him who strengtheneth me.\"[fn-68-P6888_2110362:147-nf] And also when discussing with others in order to put them, to shame, he does not shrink from saying, \"But call to mind the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly, whilst ye were made a gazing-stock, both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took with joy the spoiling of your goods, knowing that you have a better and enduring substance. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after doing the will of God, ye may obtain the promise. For yet a little while, and He that cometh will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: and if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.\"[fn-68-P6889_2111342:148-nf] He then brings forward a swarm of divine examples. For was it not \"by faith,\" he says, this endurance, that they acted nobly who \"had trial of mockeries and scourgings, and, moreover, of bonds and imprisonments? They were stoned, they were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts, in mountains, in dens, and caves of the earth. And all having received a good report, through faith, received not the promise of God\" (what is expressed by a parasiopesis is left to be understood, viz., \"alone \"). He adds accordingly, \"God having provided some better thing for us (for He was good), that they should not without us be made perfect. Wherefore also, having encompassing us such a cloud,\" holy and transparent, \"of witnesses, laying aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, let us run with patience the race set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.\"[fn-68-P6890_2112408:149-nf] Since, then, he specifies one salvation in Christ of the righteous,[fn-68-P6891_2112510:150-nf] and of us he has expressed the former unambiguously, and saying nothing less respecting Moses, adds, \"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect to the recompense of the reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.\"[fn-68-P6892_2112908:151-nf] The divine Wisdom says of the martyrs, \"They seemed in the eyes of the foolish to die, and their departure was reckoned a calamity, and their migration from us an affliction. But they are in peace. For though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope was full of immortality.\"[fn-68-P6893_2113261:152-nf] He then adds, teaching martyrdom to be a glorious purification, \"And being chastened a little, they shall be benefited much; because God proved them,\" that is, suffered them to be tried, to put them to the proof, and to put to shame the author of their trial, \"and found them worthy of Himself,\" plainly to be called sons. \"As gold in the furnace He proved them, and as a whole burned-offering of sacrifice He accepted them.

Augustin answered: I seemed too a little while ago, when we were disputing about the oil of the sinner, to anoint your forehead, in order that you might say, if you dared, whether you yourself were not a sinner. You have had the hardihood to say as much. What a portentous sin! For in that you assert yourself to be a priest, what else have you maintained by quoting this testimony of the prophet, save that you are wholly without sin? For if you have sin, who is there that shall pray for you, according to your understanding of the words? For thus you blazon yourselves among the wretched people, quoting from the prophet: \"If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?[fn-54-P5499_2661755:334-nf] to the intent that they may believe you to be without sin, and entrust the wiping away their sins to your prayers. Truly ye are great men, exalted above your fellows, heavenly, godlike, angels indeed rather than men, who pray for the people, and will not have the people pray for you! Are you more righteous than Paul, more perfect than that great apostle, who was wont to commend himself to the prayers of those whom he taught? \"Continue,\" he says, \"in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds; that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.\"[fn-55-P5500_2662496:335-nf] See how prayer is made for an apostle, which you would have not made for a bishop. Do you perceive of how devilish a nature your pride is? Prayer is made for an apostle, that he may make manifest the mystery of Christ as he ought to speak. Accordingly, if you had a pious people under you, you ought to have exhorted them to pray for you, that you might not give utterance as you ought not. Are you more righteous than the evangelist John, who says, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-55-P5501_2663050:336-nf] Finally, are you more righteous than Daniel, whom you yourself quoted in this very epistle, going so far as to say, \"The most righteous king cast forth Daniel, as he supposed, to be devoured by wild beasts?\"-a thing which he never did suppose, since he said to Daniel himself, in the most friendly spirit, as the context of the lesson shows, \"Thy God, whom thou servest continually, He will deliver thee.\"[fn-55-P5502_2663476:337-nf] But on this subject we have already said much. With regard to the question now before us, viz., that Daniel was most righteous, it is proved not by your testimony, though that might be sufficient for me in the argument which I hold with you, but by the testimony of the Spirit of God, speaking also by the mouth of Ezekiel, where he named three men of most eminent righteousness, Noah, Daniel, and Job, who, he said, were the only men that could be saved from a certain excessive wrath of God, which was hanging over all the rest.[fn-55-P5503_2664027:338-nf] A man, therefore, of the highest righteousness, one of three conspicuous for righteousness, prays, and says, \"While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God.\"[fn-55-P5504_2664306:339-nf] And you say that you are without sin, because forsooth you are a priest; and if the people sin, you pray for them: but if you sin, who shall pray for you? For clearly by the impiety of such arrogance you show yourself to be unworthy of the mediation of that Priest whom the prophet would have to be understood in these words, which you do not understand. For now that no one may ask why this was said, I will explain it so far as by God's grace I shall be able. God was preparing the minds of men, by His prophet, to desire a Priest of such a sort that none should pray for Him. He was Himself prefigured in the times of the first people and the first temple, in which all things were figures for our ensample. Therefore the high priest used to enter alone into the holy of holies, that he might make supplication for the people, which did not enter with the priest into that inner sanctuary;[fn-55-P5505_2665220:340-nf] just as our High Priest is entered into the secret places of the heavens, into that truer holy of holies, whilst we for whom He prays are still placed here.[fn-55-P5506_2665407:341-nf] It is with this reference that the prophet says, \"If the people shall sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin, who will pray for him?\" Seek therefore a priest of such a kind that he cannot sin, nor need that one should pray for him. And for this reason prayer is made for the apostles by the people;[fn-55-P5507_2665762:342-nf] but for that Priest who is the Master and Lord of the apostles is prayer not made. Hear John confessing this, and saying, \"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation for our sins.\"[fn-55-P5508_2666101:343-nf] \"We have,\" he says; and \"for our sins.\" I pray you, learn humility, that you may not fall, or rather, that in time you may arise again.

So that had I been questioned by any other on this subject, I would not even have answered, lest, while I was making my defence, my hearers should for a time have suspended their judgment concerning me.

For I never saw your brother by myself, nor did he ever converse with me in private, but I was always introduced in company with the Bishop of the city where I happened to be, and with others that chanced to be there. We entered the presence together, and together we retired. Fortunatian[fn-41-P4125_1725769:13-nf] , Bishop of Aquileia, can testify this, the father Hosius is able to say the same, as also are Crispinus, Bishop of Padua, Lucillus of a Verona, Dionysius of Lëis, and Vincentius of Campania. And although Maximinus of Treveri, and Protasius of Milan, are dead, yet Eugenius, who was Master of the Palace[fn-41-P4126_1726277:14-nf] , can bear witness for me; for he stood before the veil[fn-41-P4127_1726578:15-nf] , and heard what we requested of the Emperor, and what he vouchsafed to reply to us.","title":"Defence Before Constantius","author":"Athanasius"},{"chapter":1,"verse":24,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_33_part_i_containing_various_sections_of_the_works_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"100","folder":"ANF-06","text":"As to those who are overtaken by an involuntary flux in the night-time, let such follow the testimony of their own conscience, and consider themselves as to whether they are doubtfully minded[fn-16-P1613_454244:163-nf] in this matter or not.

So then if the adversary brought this charge, we ought to fear lest it be brought against us. For with a very slanderous accuser have we to deal. If he seek to invent what is not, how much more will he seek to object what really is. Nevertheless let us rejoice, that ours is such a Judge, as cannot be deceived by our accuser. For if we had a man for our judge, the enemy might invent for him what he would. For none is more subtle in invention than the devil. For he it is who at this time also invents all false accusations against the saints. He knows his accusations can have no avail with God, and so He scatters them among men. Yet what does this profit him,seeing the Apostle says, \"Our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience?\"[fn-49-P4912_2104851:13-nf] Yet think ye that he does not invent these false charges with aught of subtlety? Yes, well he knows what evil he shall work thereby, if the watchfulness of faith resist him not. For for this reason scatters he his evil charges against the good, that the weak may think that there are no good, and so may give themselves up to be hurried along, and made a prey of by their lusts, whilst they say within themselves, \"For who is there that keeps the commandments of God, or who is there that preserves chastity?\" and whilst he thinks that no one does, he himself becomes that no one. This then is the devil's art. But such a man was Job, that he could not invent any such charge against him; for his life was too well known and manifest. But because he had great riches, he brought that against him, which if it had any existence, might lie in the heart, and not appear in the conduct. He worshipped God, he gave alms; and with what heart he did this none knew, no not the Devil himself; but God had known. God giveth His testimony to His own servant; the Devil calumniates the servant of God. He is allowed to be tried, Job is proved, the Devil is confounded. Job is found to worship God for His Own sake, to love Him for His Own sake; not because He gave him ought, but because He did not take away Himself. For he said, \"The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it seemed good to the Lord, so is it done, blessed be the Name of the Lord.\"[fn-49-P4913_2106312:14-nf] The fire of temptation approached him; but it found him gold, not stubble; it cleared away the dross from it, but did not reduce it to ashes.","title":"Sermon XLI.

For who could count up almost all the patriarchs and numberless saints, some of whom for the preservation of life, others out of desire for a blessing, others out of pity, others to conceal some secret, others out of zeal for God, others in searching for the truth, became, so to speak, patrons of lying? And as all cannot be enumerated, so all ought not to be altogether passed over. For piety forced the blessed Joseph to raise a false charge against his brethren even with an oath by the life of the king, saying: \"Ye are spies: to see the nakedness of the land are ye come;\" and below: \"send,\" says he, \"one of you, and bring your brothers hither: but ye shall be kept here until your words are made manifest whether ye speak the truth or no: but if not, by the life of Pharaoh, ye are spies.\"[fn-59-P5968_2112145:37-nf] For if he had not out of pity alarmed them by this lie, he would not have been able to see again his father and his brother, nor to preserve them in their great danger of starvation, nor to free the conscience of his brethren from the guilt of selling him. The act then of striking his brethren with fear by means of a lie was not so reprehensible as was it a holy and laudable act to urge his enemies and seekers to a salutary penitence by means of a feigned danger. Finally when they were weighed down by the odium of the very serious accusation, they were conscience-stricken not at the charge falsely raised against them, but at the thought of their earlier crime, and said to one another: \"We suffer this rightly because we sinned against our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he asked us and we did not hearken to him: wherefore all this trouble hath come upon us.\"[fn-59-P5969_2113059:38-nf] And this confession, we think, expiated by most salutary humility their terrible sin not only against their brother, against whom they had sinned with wicked cruelty, but also against God. What about Solomon, who in his first judgment manifested the gift of wisdom, which he had received of God, only by making use of falsehood? For in order to get at the truth which was hidden by the woman's lie, even he used the help of a lie most cunningly invented, saying: \"Bring me a sword and divide the living child into two parts, and give the one half to the one and the other half to the other.\" And when this pretended cruelty stirred the heart of the true mother, but was received with approval by her who was not the true mother, then at last by this most sagacious discovery of the truth he pronounced the judgment which every one has felt to have been inspired by God, saying: \"Give her the living child and slay it not: she is the mother of it.\"[fn-59-P5970_2114025:39-nf] Further we are more fully taught by other passages of Scripture as well that we neither can nor should carry out everything which we determine either with peace or disturbance of mind, as we often hear that holy men and angels and even Almighty God Himself have changed what they had decided upon. For the blessed David determined and confirmed it by an oath, saying: \"May God do so and add more to the foes of David if I leave of all that belong unto Nabal until the morning a single male.\" And presently when Abigail his wife interceded and intreated for him, he gave up his threats, lightened the sentence, and preferred to be regarded as a breaker of his word rather than to keep his pledged oath by cruelly executing it, saying: \"As the Lord liveth, if thou hadst not quickly come to meet me there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light a single male.\"[fn-59-P5971_2114917:40-nf] And as we do not hold that his readiness to take a rash oath (which resulted from his anger and disturbance of mind) ought to be copied by us, so we do think that the pardon and revision of his determination is to be followed. The \"chosen vessel,\" in writing to the Corinthians, promises unconditionally to return, saying: \"But I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia: for I will pass through Macedonia. But I will stay or even pass the winter with you that you may conduct me whithersoever I shall go. For I do not want only to see you in passing: for I hope to stay with you for some time.\"[fn-59-P5972_2115544:41-nf] And this fact he remembers in the Second Epistle, thus: \"And in this confidence I was minded first to come unto you, that ye might receive a second favour, and by you to pass into Macedonia and again to come to you from Macedonia and by you be conducted to Judaea.\" But a better plan suggested itself and he plainly admits that he is not going to fulfil what he had promised. \"When then,\" says he, \"I purposed this, did I use light-mindedness? or the things that I think, do I think after the flesh, that there should be with me yea, yea, and nay, nay?\" Lastly, he declares even with the affirmation of an oath, why it was that he preferred to put on one side his pledged word rather than by his presence to bring a burden and grief to his disciples: \"But I call God to witness against my soul that it was to spare you that I came not as far as Corinth. For I determined this with myself that I would not come unto you in sorrow.\"[fn-59-P5973_2116498:42-nf] Though when the angels had refused to enter the house of Lot at Sodom, saying to him: \"We will not enter but will remain in the street,\" they were presently forced by his prayers to change their determination, as Scripture subjoins: \"And Lot constrained them, and they turned in to him.\"[fn-59-P5974_2116819:43-nf] And certainly if they knew that they would turn in to him, they refused his request with a sham excuse: but if their excuse was a real one, then they are clearly shown to have changed their mind. And certainly we hold that the Holy Spirit inserted this in the sacred volume for no other reason but to teach us by their examples that we ought not to cling obstinately to our own determinations, but to subject them to our will, and so to keep our judgment free from all the chains of law that it may be ready to follow the call of good counsel in any direction, and may not delay or refuse to pass without any delay to whatever a sound discretion may find to be the better choice. And to rise to still higher instances, when king Hezekiah was lying on his bed and afflicted with grievous sickness the prophet Isaiah addressed him in the person of God, and said: \"Thus saith the Lord: set thine house in order for thou shall die and not live. And Hezekiah,\" it says, \"turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord and said: I beseech thee, O Lord, remember how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and how I have done what was right in Thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.\" After which it was again said to him: \"Go, return, and speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Thus saith the Lord God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: and behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years: and I will deliver thee out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will defend this city for thy sake and for my servant David's sake.\"[fn-59-P5975_2118424:44-nf] What can be clearer than this proof that out of consideration for mercy and goodness the Lord would rather break His word and instead of the pre-arranged limit of death extend the life of him who prayed, for fifteen years, rather than be found inexorable because of His unchangeable decree? In the same way too the Divine sentence says to the men of Nineveh: \"Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown;\"[fn-59-P5976_2118856:45-nf] and presently this stern and abrupt sentence is softened by their penitence and fasting, and is turned to the side of mercy with goodness that is easy to be intreated. But if any one maintains that the Lord had threatened the destruction of their city (while He foreknew that they would be converted) for this reason, that He might incite them to a salutary penitence, it follows that those who are set over their brethren may, if need arises, without any blame for telling lies, threaten those who need improvement with severer treatment than they are reallygoing to inflict. But if one says that God revoked that severe sentence in consideration of their penitence, according to what he says by Ezekiel: \"If I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die: and he becomes penitent for his sin, and doeth judgment and justice, he shall surely live, he shall not die;\"[fn-59-P5977_2119746:46-nf] we are similarly taught that we ought not obstinately to stick to our determination, but that we should with gentle pity soften down the threats which necessity called forth. And that we may not fancy that the Lord granted this specially to the Ninevites, He continually affirms by Jeremiah that He will do the same in general towards all, and promises that without delay He will change His sentence in accordance with our deserts; saying: \"I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom to root out and to pull down and to destroy it. If that nation repent of the evil, which I have spoken against it, I also will repent of the evil which I thought to do to them. And I will suddenly speak of a nation and a kingdom, to build up and to plant it. If it shall do evil in My sight, that it obey not My voice: I will repent of the good that I thought to do to it.\" To Ezekiel also: \"Leave out nota word, if so be they will hearken and be converted every one from his evil way: that I may repent Me of the evil that I thought to do to them for the wickedness of their doings.\"[fn-59-P5978_2120860:47-nf] And by these passages it is declared that we ought not obstinately to stick to our decisions, but to modify them with reason and judgment, and that better courses should always be adopted and preferred, and that we should turn without any delay to that course which is considered the more profitable. For this above all that invaluable sentence teaches us, because though each man's end is known beforehand to Him before his birth, yet somehow He so orders all things by a plan and method for all, and with regard to man's disposition, that He decides on everything not by the mere exercise of His power, nor according to the ineffable knowledge which His Prescience possesses, but according to the present actions of men, and rejects or draws to Himself each one, and daily either grants or withholds His grace. And that this is so the election of Saul also shows us, of whose miserable end the foreknowledge of God certainly could not be ignorant, and yet He chose him out of so many thousands of Israel and anointed him king, rewarding the then existing merits of his life, and not considering the sin of his coming fall, so that after he became reprobate, God complains almost in human terms and, with man's feelings, as if He repented of his choice, saying: \"It repenteth Me that I have appointed Saul king: for he hath forsaken Me, and hath not performed My words;\" and again: \"But Samuel was grieved for Saul because the Lord repented that He had made Saul king over Israel.\"[fn-59-P5979_2122380:48-nf] Finally this that He afterwards executed, that the Lord also declares by the prophet Ezekiel that He will by His daily judgment do with all men, saying: \"Yea, if I shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live, and he trusting in his righteousness commit iniquity: all his righteousness shall be forgotten, and in his iniquity which he hath committed, in the same he shall die. And if I shall say to the wicked: Thou shalt surely die; and if he repent of his sin and do judgment and righteousness, and if that wicked man restore the pledge and render what he hath robbed, and walk in the commandments of life, and do no righteous thing, he shall surely live, he shall not die. None of his sins which he hath committed shall be imputed unto him.\"[fn-59-P5980_2123157:49-nf] Finally, when the Lord would for their speedy fall turn away His merciful countenance from the people, whom He had chosen out of all nations, the giver of the law interposes on their behalf and cries out: \"I beseech Thee, O Lord, this people have sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold; and now if Thou forgivest their sin, forgive it; but if not, blot me out of Thy book which Thou hast written. To whom the Lord answered: If any man hath sinned before Me, I will blot him out of My book.\"[fn-59-P5981_2123698:50-nf] David also, when complaining in prophetic spirit of Judas and the Lord's persecutors, says: \"Let them be blotted out of the book of the living;\" and because they did not deserve to come to saving penitence because of the guilt of their great sin, he subjoins: \"And let them not be written among the righteous.\"[fn-59-P5982_2124034:51-nf] Finally in the case of Judas himself the meaning of the prophetic curse was clearly fulfilled, for when his deadly sin was completed, he killed himself by hanging, that he might not after his name was blotted out be converted and repent and deserve to be once more written among the righteous in heaven. We must therefore not doubt that at the time when he was chosen by Christ and obtained a place in the Apostolate, the name of Judas was written in the book of the living, and that he heard as well as the rest the words: \"Rejoice not because the devils are subject unto you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.\"[fn-59-P5983_2124696:52-nf] But because he was corrupted by the plague of covetousness and had his name struck out from that heavenly list, it is suitably said of him and of men like him by the prophet: \"O Lord, let all those that forsake Thee be confounded. Let them that depart from Thee be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters.\" And elsewhere: \"They shall not be in the counsel of My people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of lsrael.\"[fn-59-P5984_2125247:53-nf] ","title":"XVII.

To whom the Lord answered: If any man hath sinned before Me, I will blot him out of My book.\"[fn-59-P5981_2123698:50-nf] David also, when complaining in prophetic spirit of Judas and the Lord's persecutors, says: \"Let them be blotted out of the book of the living;\" and because they did not deserve to come to saving penitence because of the guilt of their great sin, he subjoins: \"And let them not be written among the righteous.\"[fn-59-P5982_2124034:51-nf] Finally in the case of Judas himself the meaning of the prophetic curse was clearly fulfilled, for when his deadly sin was completed, he killed himself by hanging, that he might not after his name was blotted out be converted and repent and deserve to be once more written among the righteous in heaven. We must therefore not doubt that at the time when he was chosen by Christ and obtained a place in the Apostolate, the name of Judas was written in the book of the living, and that he heard as well as the rest the words: \"Rejoice not because the devils are subject unto you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.\"[fn-59-P5983_2124696:52-nf] But because he was corrupted by the plague of covetousness and had his name struck out from that heavenly list, it is suitably said of him and of men like him by the prophet: \"O Lord, let all those that forsake Thee be confounded. Let them that depart from Thee be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters.\" And elsewhere: \"They shall not be in the counsel of My people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of lsrael.\"[fn-59-P5984_2125247:53-nf] ","title":"XVII.

All things that were spoken to the ancient people Israel in the manifold Scripture of the holy law, what things they did, whether in sacrifices, or in priestly offices, or in feast-days, and, in a word, in what things soever they worshipped God, what things soever were spoken to and given them in precept, were shadows of things to come. Of what things to come? Things which find their fulfillment in Christ. Whence the apostle says, \"For all the promises of God are in Him yea;\"[fn-13-P1366_864491:17-nf] that is, they are fulfilled in Him. Again he says in another place, \"All happened to them in a figure; but they were written for our sakes, upon whom the end of the ages is come.\"[fn-13-P1367_864690:18-nf] And he said elsewhere, \"For Christ is the end of the law;\"[fn-13-P1368_864767:19-nf] likewise in another place, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of a new moon, or of Sabbath-days, which is a shadow of things to come.\"[fn-13-P1369_864960:20-nf] If, therefore, all these things were shadows of things to come, also the feast of tabernacles was a shadow of things to come. Let us examine, then, of what thing to come was this feast-day a shadow. I have explained what this feast of tabernacles was: it was a celebration of tabernacles, because the people, after their deliverance from Egypt, while directing their course through the wilderness to the land of promise, dwelt in tents. Let us observe what it is, and we shall be that thing; we, I say, who are members of Christ, if such we are; but we are, He having made us worthy, not we having earned it for ourselves. Let us then consider ourselves, brethren: we have been led out of Egypt, where we were slaves to the devil as to Pharaoh; where we applied ourselves to works of clay, engaged in earthly desires, and where we toiled exceedingly. And to us, while laboring, as it were, at the bricks, Christ cried aloud, \"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden.\" Thence we were led out by baptism as through the Red Sea.-red because consecrated by the blood of Christ. All our enemies that pursued us being dead, that is, all our sins being blotted out, we have been brought over to the other side. At the present time, then, before we come to the land of promise, namely, the eternal kingdom, we are in the wilderness in tabernacles. They who acknowledge these things are in tabernacles; for it was to be that some would acknowledge this. For that man, who understands that he is a sojourner in this world, is in tabernacles. That man understands that he is travelling in a foreign country, when he sees himself sighing for his native land. But whilst the body of Christ is in tabernacles, Christ is in tabernacles; but at that time He was so, not evidently but secretly. For as yet the shadow obscured the light; when the light came, the shadow was removed. Christ was in secret: He was in the feast of tabernacles, but there hidden. At the present time, when these things are already made manifest, we acknowledge that we are journeying in the wilderness: for if we know it, we are in the wilderness. What is it to be in the wilderness? In the desert waste. Why in the desert waste? Because in this world, where we thirst in a way in which is no water. But yet, let us thirst that we may be filled. For, \"Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.\"[fn-13-P1370_867398:21-nf] And our thirst is quenched from the rock in the wilderness: for \"the Rock was Christ,\" and it was smitten with a rod that the water might flow. But that it might flow, the rock was smitten twice: because there are two beams of the cross.[fn-13-P1371_867653:22-nf] All these things, then, which were done in a figure, are made manifest to us. And it is not without meaning that it was said of the Lord, \"He went up to the feast-day. but not openly, but as it were in secret.\" For Himself in secret was the thing prefigured, because Christ was hid in that same festal-day; for that very festal-day signified Christ's members that were to sojourn in a foreign land.","title":"Tractate XXVIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":1,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf2_04_npnf2_04_60_discourse_iii","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"28","folder":"NPNF2-04","text":"13.
