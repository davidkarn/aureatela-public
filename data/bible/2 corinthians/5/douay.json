{"verses":["For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved,\nthat we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in\nheaven.","For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our\nhabitation that is from heaven.","Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.","For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being\nburthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that\nthat which is mortal may be swallowed up by life.","Now he that maketh us for this very thing is God, who hath given\nus the pledge of the Spirit,","Therefore having always confidence, knowing that while we are in\nthe body we are absent from the Lord.","(For we walk by faith and not by sight.)","But we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather from\nthe body and to be present with the Lord.","And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him.","For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ,\nthat every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as\nhe hath done, whether it be good or evil.","Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men:\nbut to God we are manifest.  And I trust also that in your consciences\nwe are manifest.","We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to\nglory in our behalf:  that you may have somewhat to answer them who\nglory in face, and not in heart.","For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God:  or whether\nwe be sober, it is for you.","For the charity of Christ presseth us:  judging this, that if one\ndied for all, then all were dead.","And Christ died for all:  that they also who live may not now live\nto themselves, but unto him who died for them and rose again.","Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh.  And\nif we have known Christ according to the flesh:  but now we know him so\nno longer.","If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are\npassed away.  Behold all things are made new.","But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by\nChrist and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.","For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself,\nnot imputing to them their sins.  And he hath placed in us the word of\nreconciliation.","For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting\nby us, for Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.","Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us:  that we might be\nmade the justice of God in him."]}
