If herein I am foolish, let him who knows better correct me; to me at least the case seems as I have said.[fn-2-P280_97733:78-nf] For we shall not seek anything else, when we shall have come to the contemplation of Him. But that contemplation is not yet, so long as our joy is in hope. For \"hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?

For the Father will be manifested to us, and that will suffice for us. And this much Philip had well understood, so that he said to the Lord, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\" But he had not yet understood that he himself was able to say this very same thing in this way also: Lord, show Thyself to us, and it sufficeth us. For, that he might understand this, the Lord replied to him, \"Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\" But because He intended him, before he could see this, to live by faith, He went on to say, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?\"[fn-2-P284_99533:82-nf] For \"while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: for we walk by faith, not by sight.\"[fn-2-P285_99661:83-nf] For contemplation is the recompense of faith, for which recompense our hearts are purified by faith; as it is written, \"Purifying their hearts by faith.\"[fn-2-P286_99836:84-nf] And that our hearts are to be purified for this contemplation, is proved above all by this text, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-2-P287_100007:85-nf] And that this is life eternal, God says in the Psalm, \"With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation,\"[fn-2-P288_100142:86-nf] Whether, therefore, we hear, Show us the Son; or whether we hear, Show us the Father; it is even all one, since neither can be manifested without the other.

And here, by the world must be understood not the heavens and the earth, but the men who are in the world or love the world, for the enlightening of whom the apostles were sent.[fn-3-P300_64762:55-nf] \"A city that is set on[fn-3-P301_64993:56-nf] an hill cannot be hid,\" i.e. [a city] founded upon great and distinguished righteousness, which is also the meaning of the mountain itself on which our Lord is discoursing. \"Neither do men light a candle[fn-3-P302_65438:57-nf] and put it under a bushel measure.\"[fn-3-P303_65488:58-nf] What view are we to take? That the expression \"under a bushel measure\" is so used that only the concealment of the candle is to be understood, as if He were saying, No one lights a candle and conceals it? Or does the bushel measure also mean something, so that to place a candle under a bushel is this, to place the comforts of the body higher than the preaching of the truth; so that one does not preach the truth so long as he is afraid of suffering any annoyance in corporeal and temporal things? And it is well said a bushel measure, whether on account of the recompense of measure, for each one receives the things done in his body,-\"that every one,\" says the apostle, \"may there receive[fn-3-P304_66235:59-nf] the things done in his body;\" and it is said in another place, as if of this bushel measure of the body, \"For with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again: \"[fn-3-P305_66539:60-nf] -or because temporal good things, which are carried to completion in the body, are both begun and come to an end in a certain definite number of days, which is perhaps meant by the \"bushel measure;\" while eternal and spiritual things are confined within no such limit, \"for God giveth not the Spirit by measure.\"[fn-3-P306_66871:61-nf] Every one, therefore, who obscures and covers up the light of good doctrine by means of temporal comforts, places his candle under a bushel measure. \"But on a candlestick.\"[fn-3-P307_67173:62-nf] Now it is placed on a candlestick by him who subordinates his body to the service of God, so that the preaching of the truth is the higher, and the serving of the body the lower; yet by means even of the service of the body the doctrine shines more conspicuously, inasmuch as it is insinuated into those who learn by means of bodily functions, i.e. by means of the voice and tongue, and the other movements of the body in good works. The apostle therefore puts his candle on a candlestick, when he says, \"So fight I, not as one that beateth[fn-3-P308_67732:63-nf] the air; but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means, when I preach to others, I myself should be found a castaway.\"[fn-3-P309_67918:64-nf] When He says, however, \"that it may give light to all who are in the house,\" I am of opinion that it is the abode of men which is called a house, i.e. the world itself, on account of what He says before, \"Ye are the light of the world;\" or if any one chooses to understand the house as being the Church, this, too, is not out of place.","title":"Book I.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_07_book_i_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"68","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"31.

For when he had said, on account of the love of God with which he was specially inflamed, \"If I have found grace in thy sight, show me now Thyself plainly, that I may find grace in Thy sight;\" he immediately subjoined, on account of the love also of his neighbor, \"And that I may know that this nation is Thy people.\" It is therefore that \"appearance\" which hurries away every rational soul with the desire of it, and the more ardently the more pure that soul is; and it is the more pure the more it rises to spiritual things; and it rises the more to spiritual things the more it dies to carnal things.

Again he avers that my brother[fn-34-P3484_920818:2526-nf] is the cause of the disagreement which has arisen, a man who is content to stay in a monastic cell and who regards the clerical office as onerous rather than honourable. And although up to this very day he has spoon-fed us with insincere protestations of peace, he has caused commotion in the minds of the western bishops[fn-34-P3485_921197:2527-nf] by telling them that a mere youth, hardly more than a boy, has been ordained[fn-34-P3486_921325:2528-nf] presbyter of Bethlehem in his own diocese. If this is the truth, all the bishops of Palestine must be aware of it. For the monastery of the reverend pope Epiphanius-called the old monastery-where my brother was ordained presbyter is situated in the district of Eleutheropolis[fn-34-P3487_921644:2529-nf] and not in that of Aelia.[fn-34-P3488_921763:2530-nf] Furthermore his age is well known to your Holiness; and as he has now attained to thirty years I apprehend that no blame can attach to him on that score. Indeed this particular age is stamped as full and complete by the mystery of Christ's assumed manhood. Let him call to mind the ancient law, and he will see that after his twenty-fifth year a Levite might be chosen to the priesthood;[fn-34-P3489_922266:2531-nf] or if in this passage he prefers to follow the Hebrew he will find that candidates for the priesthood must be thirty years old. And that he may not venture to say that \"old things are passed away; and, behold, all things are become new,\"[fn-34-P3490_922553:2532-nf] let him hear the apostle's words to Timothy, \"Let no man despise thy youth.\"[fn-34-P3491_922653:2533-nf] Certainly when my opponent was himself ordained bishop, he was not much older than my brother is now. And if he argues that youth is no hindrance to a bishop but that it is to a presbyter because a young elder[fn-34-P3492_922887:2534-nf] is a contradiction in terms, I ask him this question: Why has he himself ordained a presbyter of this age or younger still, and that too to minister in another man's church? But if he cannot be at peace with my brother unless he consents to submit and to renounce the bishop who has ordained him, he shews plainly that his object is not peace but revenge, and that he will not rest satisfied with the quietude of repose and peace unless he is able to inflict to the full every penalty that he now threatens. Had he himself ordained my brother, it would have made no difference to this latter. So dearly does he love seclusion that he would even then have continued to live quietly and would not have exercised his office. And should the bishop have seen fit to rend the church on that score, he would then have owed him nothing save the respect which is due to all who offer sacrifice.[fn-34-P3493_923819:2535-nf] ","title":"The Letters of St. Jerome","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_03_the_letters_of_st_jerome","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"1083","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"1. If all the members of my body were to be converted into tongues, and if each of my limbs were to be gifted with a human voice, I could still do no justice to the virtues of the holy and venerable Paula. Noble in family, she was nobler still in holiness; rich formerly in this world's goods, she is now more distinguished by the poverty that she has embraced for Christ. Of the stock of the Gracchi and descended from the Scipios, the heir and representative of that Paulus whose name she bore, the true and legitimate daughter of that Martia Papyria who was mother to Africanus, she yet preferred Bethlehem to Rome, and left her palace glittering with gold to dwell in a mud cabin.

It is one thing to fail at present in attaining to the fulness of love, and another thing to be swayed by no lust.

(These things being so, it will be sin in the man who lives by faith ever to consent to an unlawful delight,-by committing not only frightful deeds and crimes, but even trifling faults; sinful, if he lend an ear to a word that ought not to be listened to, or a tongue to a phrase which shouldnot be uttered; sinful, if he entertains a thought in his heart in such a way as to wish that an evil pleasure were a lawful one, although known to be unlawful by the commandment,-for this amounts to a consent to sin, which would certainly be carried out in act, unless fear of punishment deterred.)[fn-18-P1845_805025:391-nf] Have such just men, while living by faith, no need to say: \"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors?\"[fn-18-P1846_805344:392-nf] And do they prove this to be wrong which is written, \"In Thy sight shall no man living be justified?\"[fn-18-P1847_805466:393-nf] and this: \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?\"[fn-18-P1848_805581:394-nf] and, \"There is no manthat sinneth not;\"[fn-18-P1849_805641:395-nf] and again, \"There is not on the earth a righteous man, who doeth good and sinneth not\"[fn-18-P1850_805753:396-nf] (for both these statements are expressed in a general future sense,-\"sinneth not,\" \"will not sin,\"-not in the past time, \"has not sinned\")?-and all other places of this purport contained in the Holy Scripture? Since, however, these passages cannot possibly be false, it plainly follows, to my mind, that whatever be the quality or extent of the righteousness which we may definitely ascribe to the present life, there is not a man living in it who is absolutely free from all sin; and that it is necessary for every one to give, that it may be given to him;[fn-18-P1851_806335:397-nf] and to forgive, that it may be forgiven him;[fn-18-P1852_806404:398-nf] and whatever righteousness he has, not to presume that he has it of himself, but from the grace of God, who justifies him, and still to go on hungering and thirsting for righteousness[fn-18-P1853_806607:399-nf] from Him who is the living bread,[fn-18-P1854_806660:400-nf] and with whom is the fountain of life;[fn-18-P1855_806719:401-nf] who works in His saints, whilst labouring amidst temptation in this life, their justification in such manner that He may still have somewhat to impart to them liberally when they ask, and something mercifully to forgive them when they confess.","title":"On the Spirit and the Letter","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_09_npnf1_09_13_letter_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF1-09","text":"For if, even as it is, when we have not this power in ourselves, we make violent efforts, and give ourselves up to shadow painting, and because we cannot in reality produce bodily beauty, cunningly devise imitations by means of paints, and dyes, and dressing of hair, and arrangement of garments, and pencilling of eyebrows, and many other contrivances: what leisure should we have set apart for the soul and serious matters, if we had it in our power to transfigure the body into a really symmetrical shape? For probably, if this were our business, we should not have any other, but should spend all our time upon it: decking the bondmaid with countess decorations, but letting her who is the mistress of this bond-maid lie perpetually in a state of deformity and neglect. For this reason God, having delivered us from this vain occupation, implanted in us the power of working upon the nobler element, and he who cannot turn an ugly body into a comely on, can raise the soul, even when it has been reduced to the extremity of ugliness, to the very acme of grace, and make it so amiable and desirable that not only are good men brought to long after it but even He who is the sovereign and God of all, even as the Psalmist also when discoursing concerning this beauty, said \"And the king shall have desire of thy beauty.\"[fn-6-P669_391705:50-nf] Seest thou not also that in the houses of prostitutes the women who are ugly and shameless would hardly be accepted by prize-fighters, and runaway slaves, and gladiators: but should any comely, well-born and modest woman, owing to some mischance, have been reduced to this necessity, no man, even amongst those who are very illustrious and great, would be ashamed of marriage with her? Now if there is so much pity amongst men, and so much disdain of glory as to release from that bondage the women who have often been disgraced in the brothel, and to place them in the position of wives, much more is this the case with God, and those souls which, owing to the usurpation of the devil, have then from their original noble condition into the harlotry of this present life. And you will find the prophets filled with examples of this kind, when they address Jerusalem; for she fell into fornication, and a novel form of it, even as Ezekiel says: \"To all harlots wages are given, but thou hast given wages to thy lovers, and there hath been perversion in thee beyond all other women,\"[fn-6-P670_392807:51-nf] and again another saith \"Thou didst sit waiting for them like a deserted bird.\"[fn-6-P671_392940:52-nf] This one then who hath committed fornication in this fashion God calls back again. For the captivity which took place was not so much by way of vengeance as for the purpose of conversion and amendment since if God had wished to punish them out-fight He would not again have brought them back to their home. He would not have established their city and their temple in greater splendour than before: \"For the final glory of this house\" He said \"shall exceed the former.\"[fn-6-P672_393429:53-nf] Now if God did not exclude from repentance her who who had many times committed fornication, much more will He embrace My soul, which has now fallen for the first time. For certainly there is no lover of corporeal beauty, even if he be very frantic, who is so inflamed will the love of his mistress as God longs after the salvation of our souls; and this we may perceive both from the divine Scriptures. See at least, both in the introduction of Jeremiah, and many other places of the prophets, when He is despised and contemned, how He again hastens forward and pursues the friendship of those who turn away from him; which also He Himself made dear in the Gospels saying, \"O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not?\"[fn-6-P673_394349:54-nf] And Paul writing to the Corinthians said \"that God was in Christ reconciling the word unto Himself, not reckoning their trespasses unto them, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation. We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ be ye reconciled to God.\"[fn-6-P674_394718:55-nf] Consider that this has now been said to us. For it is not merely want of faith, but also an unclean life which is sufficient to work this abominate enmity. \"For the carnal mind\" we read \"is enmity against God.\"[fn-6-P675_394954:56-nf] Let us then break down the barrier, and hew it in pieces, and destroy it, that we may enjoy the blessed reconciliation, that we may become again the fondly beloved of God.","title":"Letter I.","author":"St. John Chrysostom"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_06_npnf2_06_10_book_i_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"51","folder":"NPNF2-06","text":"37.

By this method I shall succeed in omitting nothing relating to chastity, and shall avoid being tediously long. Amongst other passages, Paul the Apostle writes to the Romans:[fn-64-P6432_1987303:263-nf] \"What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.\" I suppose too that the end of marriage is death. But the compensating fruit of sanctification, fruit belonging either to virginity or to continence, is eternal life. And afterwards:[fn-64-P6433_1987764:264-nf] \"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were holden; so that we serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.\" \"When,\" he says, \"we were in the flesh, and not in the newness of the Spirit but in the oldness of the letter,\" we did those things which pertained to the flesh, and bore fruit unto death. But now because we are dead to the law, through the body of Christ, let us bear fruit to God, that we may belong to Him who rose from the dead. And elsewhere, having previously said,[fn-64-P6434_1988671:265-nf] \"I know that the law is spiritual,\" and having discussed at some length the violence of the flesh which frequently drives us to do what we would not, he at last continues: \"O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" And again, \"So then I myself with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.\" And,[fn-64-P6435_1989121:266-nf] \"There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and death.\" And more clearly in what follows he teaches that Christians do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit:[fn-64-P6436_1989479:267-nf] \"For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the spirit is life and peace: because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be: and they that are in the flesh cannot please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you,\" and so on to where he says,[fn-64-P6437_1990011:268-nf] \"So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.\" If the[fn-64-P6438_1990318:269-nf] wisdom of the flesh is enmity against God, and they who are in the flesh cannot please God, I think that they who perform the functions of marriage love the wisdom of the flesh, and therefore are in the flesh. The Apostle being desirous to withdraw us from the flesh and to join us to the Spirit, says afterwards:[fn-64-P6439_1990653:270-nf] \"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think according to chastity\"[fn-64-P6440_1991185:271-nf] (not soberly as the Latin versions badly render), but \"think,\" he says, \"according to chastity,\" for the Greek words are e0ij to swfronein. Let us consider what the Apostle says: \"Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.\" What he says is something like this-God indeed permits marriage, He permits second marriages, and if necessary, prefers even third marriages to fornication and adultery. But we who ought to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is our reasonable service, should consider, not what God permits, but what He wishes: that we may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. It follows that what He merely permits is neither good, nor acceptable, nor perfect. And he gives his reasons for this advice:[fn-64-P6441_1992056:272-nf] \"Knowing the season, that now it is high time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we first believed. The night is far spent, and the day is at hand.\" And lastly: \"Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.\" God's will is one thing, His indulgence another. Whence, writing to the Corinthians, he says,[fn-64-P6442_1992505:273-nf] \"I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal.\" He who[fn-64-P6443_1992812:274-nf] is in the merely animal state, and does not receive the things pertaining to the Spirit of God (for he is foolish, and cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned), he is not fed with the food of perfect chastity, but with the coarse milk of marriage. As through man came death, so also through man came the resurrection of the dead. As in Adam we all die, so in Christ we shall all be made alive. Under the law we served the old Adam, under the Gospel let us serve the new Adam. For the first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.[fn-64-P6444_1993681:275-nf] \"The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" This is so clear that no explanation can make it clearer: \"Flesh and blood,\" he says, \"cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" If corruption attaches to all intercourse, and incorruption is characteristic of chastity, the rewards of chastity cannot belong to marriage.[fn-64-P6445_1994423:276-nf] \"For we know that if the earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.

Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether in the body, or out of the body, to be well-pleasing unto God.\" And by way of more fully explaining what he did not wish them to be he says elsewhere:[fn-64-P6446_1994969:277-nf] \"I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.\" But if you choose to apply the words to the whole Assembly of believers, and in this betrothal to Christ include both married women, and the twice-married, and widows, and virgins, that also makes for us. For whilst he invites all to chastity and to the reward of virginity, he shows that virginity is more excellent than all these conditions. And again writing to the Galatians he says:[fn-64-P6447_1995465:278-nf] \"Because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.\" Among the works of the law is marriage, and accordingly under it they are cursed who have no children.

This Anastasius preaching one day in the church said, `Let no one call Mary Theotocos:[fn-21-P2195_948622:100-nf] for Mary was but a woman;[fn-21-P2196_948744:101-nf] and it is impossible that God should be born of a woman.' These words created a great sensation, and troubled many both of the clergy and laity; they having been heretofore taught to acknowledge Christ as God, and by no means to separate his humanity from his divinity on account of the economy of incarnation, heeding the voice of the apostle when he said, `Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh; yet now henceforth know we him no more.'[fn-21-P2197_949228:102-nf] And again, `Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on unto perfection.'[fn-21-P2198_949348:103-nf] While great offense was taken in the church, as we have said, at what was thus propounded, Nestorius, eager to establish Anastasius' proposition-for he did not wish to have the man who was esteemed by himself found guilty of blasphemy-delivered several public discourses on the subject, in which he assumed a controversial attitude, and totally rejected the epithet Theotocos. Wherefore the controversy on the subject being taken in one spirit by some and in another by others, the discussion which ensued divided the church, and resembled the struggle of combatants in the dark, all parties uttering the most confused and contradictory assertions. Nestorius thus acquired the reputation among the masses of asserting the blasphemous dogma that the Lord is a mere man, and attempting to foist on the Church the dogmas of Paul of Samosata and Photinus; and so great a clamor was raised by the contention that it was deemed requisite to convene a general council to take cognizance of the matter in dispute. Having myself perused the writings of Nestorius, I have found him an unlearned man and shall candidly express the conviction of my own mind concerning him: and as in entire freedom from personal antipathies, I have already alluded to his faults, I shall in like manner be unbiassed by the criminations of his adversaries, to derogate from his merits. I cannot then concede that he was either a follower of Paul of Samosata or of Photinus, or that he denied the Divinity of Christ: but he seemed scared at the term Theotocos, as though it were some terrible phantom.[fn-21-P2199_950940:104-nf] The fact is, the cause-less alarm he manifested on this subject just exposed his extreme ignorance: for being a man of natural fluency as a speaker, he was considered well educated, but in reality he was disgracefully illiterate. In fact he contemned the drudgery of an accurate examination of the ancient expositors: and, puffed up with his readiness of expression, he did not give his attention to the ancients, but thought himself the greatest of all. Now he was evidently unacquainted with the fact that in the First Catholic epistle of John it was written in the ancient copies,[fn-22-P2200_951572:105-nf] `Every spirit that separates Jesus, is not of God.' The mutilation of this passage[fn-22-P2201_952045:106-nf] is attributable to those who desired to separate the Divine nature from the human economy: or to use the very language of the early interpreters, some persons have corrupted this epistle, aiming at `separating the manhood of Christ from his Deity.'

We, too, indeed have precedents in the self-same antiquity on the side of our opinion,-(precedents) of judgment not merely not waived, but even summarily executed upon fornication. And of course it is a sufficient one, that so vast a number-(the number) of 24, 000-of the People, when they committed fornication with the daughters of Madian, fell in one plague.[fn-13-P1368_378811:69-nf] But, with an eye to the glory of Christ, I prefer to derive (my) discipline from Christ.

It was still, up to that time, accounted as being in Adam, with its own vicious nature, easily indulging concupiscence after whatever it had seen to be \"attractive to the sight,\"[fn-13-P1369_379449:70-nf] and looking back at the lower things, and checking its itching with fig-leaves.[fn-13-P1370_379576:71-nf] Universally inherent was the virus of lust-the dregs which are formed out of milk contain it-(dregs) fitted (for so doing), in that even the waters themselves had not yet been bathed.

And there are diversities of operations, but the same God who worketh all things in all. But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.\" And again:[fn-68-P6822_2165763:205-nf] \"As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.\" But he precludes you from saying that the different members of the one body have the same rank; for he immediately describes the orders of the Church, and says:[fn-68-P6823_2166070:206-nf] \"And God hath set some in the Church, first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And a still more excellent way shew I unto you.\" And after discoursing more in detail of the graces of charity, he added:[fn-68-P6824_2166593:207-nf] \"Whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part: but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.\" And afterwards we read:[fn-68-P6825_2166957:208-nf] \"But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love. Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.\" And again:[fn-68-P6826_2167182:209-nf] \"I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues.\" And again:[fn-68-P6827_2167365:210-nf] \"I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all.\" Where there are different gifts, and one man is greater, another less, and all are called spiritual, they are all certainly sheep, and they stand on the right hand; but there is a difference between one sheep and another. It is humility that leads the Apostle Paul to say:[fn-68-P6828_2167716:211-nf] \"I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain: but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\" But the very fact of his thus humbling himself shows the possibility of there being apostles of higher or lower rank, and God is not unjust that lie will forget tim work of him who is called the chosen vessel of election, and who laboured more abundantly than they all, or assign equal rewards to unequal deserts. Afterwards we read,[fn-68-P6829_2168400:212-nf] \"As in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be now alive. But each in his own order.\" If each is to rise in his own order, it follows that those who rise are of different degrees of merit.[fn-68-P6830_2168616:213-nf] \"All flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead.\" Like a learned commentator, you have explained this passage by saying that the spiritual differ from the carnal. It follows that in heaven there will be both spiritual and carnal persons, and not only will the sheep climb thither, but your goats also. \"One star,\" he says, \"differeth from another star in glory\": this is not the distinction of sheep and goat, but of sheep and sheep, star and star. Lastly, he says, \"there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon.\" But for this, you might maintain that the phrase one star from another star covers the whole human race; but he introduces the sun and moon, and you cannot possibly reckon them among the goats. \"So,\" says he, \"is also the resurrection of the dead\"-the just will shine with the brightness of the sun, and those of the next rank will glow with the splendour of the moon, so that one will be a Lucifer, another an Arcturus, a third an Orion, another Mazzaroth, or some other of the stars whose names are hollowed in the book of Job.[fn-68-P6831_2170121:214-nf] [fn-68-P6832_2170157:215-nf] \"For we all,\" he says, \"must be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\" And you cannot say that the mode of our manifestation before the judgment-seat of Christ is such that the good receive good things, the bad evil things; for he[fn-68-P6833_2170535:216-nf] teaches us in the same epistle that he who soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Surely he who sows more and he who sows less are both on the right side. And although they belong to the same class, that of the sower, yet they differ in respect of measure and number. The same Paul, writing to the Ephesians, says:[fn-68-P6834_2170936:217-nf] \"to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God.\" You observe that it is a varied and manifold wisdom of God which is spoken of as existing in the different ranks of the church. Arid in the same epistle we read,[fn-68-P6835_2171273:218-nf] \"Unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the grace of Christ\": not that Christ's measure varies, but only that so much of His grace is poured out as we can receive.","title":"Book II.","author":false},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_16_on_nature_and_grace_against_pelagius","source_chapter":5,"source_paragraph":"94","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"Man's nature, indeed, was created at first faultless and without any sin; but that nature of man in which every one is born from Adam, now wants the Physician, because it is not sound.

And that our view about this may be made clearer let us thus divide our argument. The inspired apostle on four occasions employs this term, once as here, calling Him, \"first-born of all creation[fn-10-P1069_579579:88-nf] ,\" another time, \"the first-born among many brethren[fn-10-P1070_579649:89-nf] ,\" again, \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1071_579705:90-nf] ,\" and on another occasion he employs the term absolutely, without combining it with other words, saying, \"But when again He bringeth the first-born into the world, He saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him[fn-10-P1072_579955:91-nf] .\" Accordingly whatever view we entertain concerning this title in the other combinations, the same we shall in consistency apply to the phrase \"first-born of all creation.\" For since the title is one and the same it must needs be that the meaning conveyed is also one. In what sense then does He become \"the first-born among many brethren?\" in what sense does He become \"the first-born from the dead?\" Assuredly this is plain, that because we are by birth flesh and blood, as the Scripture saith, \"He Who for our sakes was born among us and was partaker of flesh and blood[fn-10-P1073_580545:92-nf] ,\" purposing to change us from corruption to incorruption by the birth from above, the birth by water and the Spirit, Himself led the way in this birth, drawing down upon the water, by His own baptism, the Holy Spirit; so that in all things He became the first-born of those who are spiritually born again, and gave the name of brethren to those who partook in a birth like to His own by water and the Spirit. But since it was also meet that He should implant in our nature the power of rising again from the dead, He becomes the \"first-fruits of them that slept[fn-10-P1074_581130:93-nf] \" and the \"first-born from the dead[fn-10-P1075_581186:94-nf] ,\" in that He first by His own act loosed the pains of death[fn-10-P1076_581264:95-nf] , so that His new birth from the dead was made a way for us also, since the pains of death, wherein we were held, were loosed by the resurrection of the Lord. Thus, just as by having shared in the washing of regeneration[fn-10-P1077_581533:96-nf] He became \"the first-born among many brethren,\" and again by having made Himself the first-fruits of the resurrection, He obtains the name of the \"first-born from the dead,\" so having in all things the pre-eminence, after that \"all old things,\" as the apostle says, \"have passed away[fn-10-P1078_581877:97-nf] ,\" He becomes the first-born of the new creation of men in Christ by the two-fold regeneration, alike that by Holy Baptism and that which is the consequence of the resurrection from the dead, becoming for us in both alike the Prince of Life[fn-10-P1079_582141:98-nf] , the first-fruits, the first-born. This first-born, then, hath also brethren, concerning whom He speaks to Mary, saying, \"Go and tell My brethren, I go to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God[fn-10-P1080_582374:99-nf] .\" In these words He sums up the whole aim of His dispensation as Man.

Nay, on the contrary every inspired Scripture attests His independent and sovereign power, saying, \"He spake the word and they were made: He commanded and they were created[fn-11-P1162_628418:163-nf] \":-for it is plain that the Psalmist says this concerning Him Who upholds \"all things by the word of His power[fn-11-P1163_628552:164-nf] ,\" Whose authority, by the sole impulse of His will, framed every existence and nature, and all things in the creation apprehended by reason or by sight. Whence, then, was Eunomius moved to ascribe in such manifold wise to the King of the universe the attribute of obedience, speaking of Him as \"obedient with regard to all the work of creation, obedient with regard to every ministration, obedient in words and in acts\"? Yet it is plain to every one, that he alone is obedient to another in acts and words, who has not yet perfectly achieved in himself the condition of accurate working or unexceptionable speech, but keeping his eye ever on his teacher and guide, is trained by his suggestions to exact propriety in deed and word. But to think that Wisdom needs a master and teacher to guide aright. Its attempts at imitation, is the dream of Eunomius' fancy, and of his alone. And concerning the Father he says, that He is faithful in words and faithful in works, while of the Son he does not assert faithfulness in word and deed, but only obedience and not faithfulness, so that his profanity extends impartially through all his statements. But it is perhaps right to pass in silence over the inconsiderate folly of the assertion interposed between those last mentioned, lest some unreflecting persons should laugh at its absurdity when they ought rather to weep over the perdition of their souls, than laugh at the folly of their words. For this wise and wary theologian says that He did not attain to being a Son as the result of His obedience! Mark his penetration! with what cogent force does he lay it down for us that He was not first obedient and afterwards a Son, and that we ought not to think that His obedience was prior to His generation! Now if he had not added this defining clause, who without it would have been sufficiently silly and idiotic to fancy that His generation was bestowed on Him by His Father, as a reward of the obedience of Him Who before His generation had showed due subjection and obedience? But that no one may too readily extract matter for laughter from these remarks, let each consider that even the folly of the words has in it something worthy of tears. For what he intends to establish by these observations is something of this kind, that His obedience is part of His nature, so that not even if He willed it would it be possible for Him not to be obedient.","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_13_book_ii","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"74","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Thus much with regard to his profanity towards the Son. Now let us see what he says about the Holy Spirit. \"After Him, we believe,\" he says, \"on the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth.\" I think it will be plain to all who come across this passage what object he has in view in thus perverting the declaration of the faith delivered to us by the Lord, in his statements concerning the Son and the Father. Though this absurdity has already been exposed, I will nevertheless endeavour, in few words, to make plain the aim of his knavery. As in the former case, he avoided using the name \"Father,\" that so he might not include the Son in the eternity of the Father, so he avoided employing the title Son, that he might not by it suggest His natural affinity to the Father; so here, too, he refrains from saying \"Holy Spirit,\" that he may not by this name acknowledge the majesty of His glory, and His complete union with the Father and the Son. For since the appellation of \"Spirit,\" and that of \"Holy,\" are by the Scriptures equally applied to the Father and the Son (for \"God is a Spirits[fn-12-P1225_665183:210-nf] ,\" and \"the anointed Lord is the Spirit before our face[fn-12-P1226_665262:211-nf] ,\" and \"the Lord our God is Holy[fn-12-P1227_665326:212-nf] ,\" and there is \"one Holy, one Lord Jesus Christ[fn-12-P1228_665395:213-nf] \") lest there should, by the use of these terms, be bred in the minds of his readers some orthodox conception of the Holy Spirit, such as would naturally arise in them from His sharing His glorious appellation with the Father and the Son, for this reason, deluding the ears of the foolish, he changes the words of the Faith as set forth by God in the delivery of this mystery, making a way, so to speak, by this sequence, for the entrance of his impiety against the Holy Spirit. For if he had said, \"We believe in the Holy Spirit,\" and \"God is a Spirit,\" any one instructed in things divine would have interposed the remark, that if we are to believe in the Holy Spirit, while God is called a Spirit, He is assuredly not distinct in nature from that which receives the same titles in a proper sense. For of all those things which are indicated not unreally, nor metaphorically, but properly and absolutely, by the same names, we are necessarily compelled to acknowledge that the nature also, which is signified by this identity of names, is one and the same. For this reason it is that, suppressing the name appointed by the Lord in the formula of the faith, he says, \"We believe in the Comforter.\" But I have been taught that this very name is also applied by the inspired Scripture to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost alike. For the Son gives the name of \"Comforter\" equally to Himself and to the Holy Spirit[fn-12-P1229_666903:214-nf] ; and the Father, where He is said to work comfort, surely claims as His own the name of \"Comforter.\" For assuredly he Who does the work of a Comforter does not disdain the name belonging to the work: for David says to the Father, \"Thou, Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me[fn-12-P1230_667203:215-nf] ,\" and the great Apostle applies to the Father the same language, when he says, \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who comforteth us in all our tribulation[fn-12-P1231_667403:216-nf] \"; and John, in one of his Catholic Epistles, expressly gives to the Son the name of Comforter[fn-12-P1232_667520:217-nf] . Nay, more, the Lord Himself, in saying that another Comforter would be sent us, when speaking of the Spirit, clearly asserted this title of Himself in the first place. But as there are two senses of the parakalein[fn-12-P1233_667807:218-nf] ,-one to beseech, by words and gestures of respect, to induce him to whom we apply for anything, to feel with us in respect of those things for which we apply,-the other to comfort, to take remedial thought for affections of body and soul,-the Holy Scripture affirms the conception of the Paraclete, in either sense alike, to belong to the Divine nature. For at one time Paul sets before us by the word parakalein the healing power of God, as when he says, \"God, Who comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus[fn-12-P1234_668424:219-nf] \"; and at another time he uses this word in its other meaning, when he says, writing to the Corinthians, \"Now we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God[fn-12-P1235_668680:220-nf] .\" Now since these things are so, in whatever way you understand the title \"Paraclete,\" when used of the Spirit, you will not in either of its significations detach Him from His community in it with the Father and the Son. Accordingly, he has not been able, even though he wished it, to belittle the glory of the Spirit by ascribing to Him the very attribute which Holy Scripture refers also to the Father and to the Son. But in styling Him \"the Spirit of Truth,\" Eunomius' own wish, I suppose, was to suggest by this phrase subjection, since Christ is the Truth, and he called Him the Spirit of Truth, as if one should say that He is a possession and chattel of the Truth, without being aware that God is called a God of righteousness[fn-12-P1236_669437:221-nf] ; and we certainly do not understand thereby that God is a possession of righteousness. Wherefore also, when we hear of the \"Spirit of Truth,\" we acquire by that phrase such a conception as befits the Deity, being guided to the loftier interpretation by the words which follow it. For when the Lord said \"The Spirit of Truth,\" He immediately added \"Which proceedeth from the Father[fn-12-P1237_669966:222-nf] ,\" a fact which the voice of the Lord never asserted of any conceivable thing in creation, not of aught visible or invisible, not of thrones, principalities, powers, or dominions, nor of any other name that is named either in this world or in that which is to come. It is plain then that that, from share in which all creation is excluded, is something special and peculiar to uncreated being. But this man bids us believe in \"the Guide of godliness.\" Let a man then believe in Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and all those by whom we have been led into the way of thefaith. For if we are to believe in \"that which guides us to godliness,\" along with the Father and the Son, all the prophets and lawgivers and patriarchs, heralds, evangelists, apostles, pastors,and teachers, have equal honour with the Holy Spirit, as they bare been \"guides to godliness\" to those who came after them. \"Who came into being,\" he goes on, \"by the only God through the Only-begotten.\" In these words he gathers up in one head all his blasphemy. Once more he calls the Father \"only God,\" who employs the Only-begotten as an instrument for the production of the Spirit. What shadow of such a notion did he find in Scripture, that he ventures upon this assertion? by deduction from what premises did he bring his profanity to such a conclusion as this?Which of the Evangelists says it? what apostle? what prophet? Nay, on the contrary every scripture divinely inspired, written by the afflatus of the Spirit, attests the Divinity of the Spirit. For example (for it is better to prove my position from the actual testimonies), those who receive power to become children of God bear witness to the Divinity of the Spirit. Who knows not that utterance of the Lord which tells us that they who are born of the Spirit are the children of God? For thus He expressly ascribes the birth of the children of God to the Spirit, saying, that as that which is born of the flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. But as many as are born of the Spirit are called the children of God[fn-12-P1238_672086:223-nf] . So also when the Lord by breathing upon His disciples had imparted to them the Holy Spirit, John says, \"Of His fulness have all we received[fn-12-P1239_672321:224-nf] .\" And that \"in Him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead[fn-12-P1240_672419:225-nf] ,\" the mighty Paul attests: yea, moreover, through the prophet Isaiah it is attested, as to the manifestation of the Divine appearance vouchsafed to him, when he saw Him that sat \"on the throne high and lifted up[fn-12-P1241_672651:226-nf] ;\" the older tradition, it is true, says that it was the Father Who appeared to him, but the evangelist John refers the prophecy to our Lord, saying, touching those of the Jews who did not believe the words uttered by the prophet concerning the Lord, \"These things said Esaias, when he saw His glory and spoke of Him[fn-12-P1242_672986:227-nf] .\" But the mighty Paul attributes the same passage to the Holy Spirit in his speech made to the Jews at Rome, when he says, \"Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet concerning you, saying, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand[fn-12-P1243_673333:228-nf] ,\" showing, in my opinion, by Holy Scripture itself, that every specially divine vision, every theophany, every word uttered in the Person of God, is to be understood to refer to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hence when David says, \"they provoked God in the wilderness, and grieved Him in the desert[fn-12-P1244_673719:229-nf] ,\" the apostle refers to the Holy Spirit the despite done by the Israelites to God, in these terms: \"Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness; when your fathers tempted me[fn-12-P1245_674004:230-nf] ,\" and goes on to refer all that the prophecy refers to God, to the Person of the Holy Ghost. Those who keep repeating against us the phrase \"three Gods,\" because we hold these views, have perhaps not yet learnt how to count. For if the Father and the Son are not divided into duality, (for they are, according to the Lord's words, One, and not Two[fn-12-P1246_674374:231-nf] ) and if the Holy Ghost is also one, how can one added to one be divided into the number of three Gods? Is it not rather plain that no one can charge us with believing in the number of three Gods, without himself first maintaining in his own doctrine a pair of Gods? For it is by being added to two that the one completes the triad of Gods. But what room is there for the charge of tritheism against those by whom one God is worshipped, the God expressed by the Name ofthe Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost?","title":"Book II","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_21_viii_on_fasting_in_opposition_to_the_psychics_","source_chapter":16,"source_paragraph":"65","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Being, therefore, observers of \"seasons\" for these things, and of \"days, and months, and years,\"[fn-18-P1856_549915:97-nf] we Galaticize.

This is now our righteousness, in which we pass through our course hungering and thirsting after the perfect and full righteousness, in order that we may hereafter be satisfied therewith.

In that real beneficence in which the just man consults his neighbour's welfare, things are sometimes done which are prejudicial, although it was thought that they would be advantageous. Sometimes, too, through infirmity, when the amount of the kindness and trouble which is expended either fails short of the necessities of the objects, or is of little use under the circumstances, then there steals over us a disappointment which tarnishes that \"cheerfulness\" which secures to the \"giver\" the approbation of God.[fn-25-P2510_1011337:57-nf] This trail of sadness,however, is the greater or the less, as each man has made more or less progress in his kindly purposes.

He is the first-born from the dead, Who first by Himself loosed the pains of death[fn-14-P1478_825316:28-nf] , that He might also make that birth of the resurrection a way for all men[fn-14-P1479_825409:29-nf] .

If these passages, then, have been rightly understood, neither will the signification of the \"creation,\" of which He is first-born, be unknown to as. For we recognize a twofold creation of our nature, the first that whereby we were made, the second that whereby we were made anew. But there would have been no need of the second creation had we not made the first unavailing by our disobedience. Accordingly, when the first creation had waxed old and vanished away, it was needful that there should be a new creation in Christ, (as the Apostle says, who asserts that we should no longer see in the second creation any trace of that which has waxed old, saying, \"Having put off the old man with his deeds and his lusts, put on the new man which is created according to God[fn-14-P1481_827405:31-nf] ,\" and \"If any man be in Christ,\" he says, \"he is a new creature: the old things are passed away, behold all things are become new[fn-14-P1482_827575:32-nf] :\") -for the maker of human nature at the first and afterwards is one and the same. Then He took dust from the earth and formed man: again, He took dust from the Virgin, and did not merely form man, but formed man about Himself: then, He created; afterwards, He was created: then, the Word made flesh; afterwards, the Word became flesh, that He might change our flesh to spirit, by being made partaker with us in flesh and blood. Of this new creation therefore in Christ, which He Himself began, He was called the first-born, being the first-fruits of all, both of those begotten into life, and of those quickened by resurrection of the dead, \"that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living[fn-14-P1483_828299:33-nf] ,\" and might sanctify the whole lump[fn-14-P1484_828354:34-nf] by means of its first-fruits in Himself. Now that the character of \"first-born\" does not apply to the Son in respect of His pre-temporal existence the appellation of \"Only-begotten\" testifies. For he who is truly only-begotten has no brethren, for bow could any one be only-begotten if numbered among brethren? but as He is called God and man, Son of God and Son of man,-for He has the form of God and the form of a servant[fn-14-P1485_828800:35-nf] , being some things according to His supreme nature, becoming other things in His dispensation of love to man,-so too, being the Only-begotten God, He becomes the first-born of all creation,-the Only-begotten, He that is in the bosom of the Father, yet, among the e who are saved by the new creation, both becoming and being called the first born of the creation. But if, as heresy will have it, He is called first-born because He was made before the rest of the creation, the name does not agree with what they maintain concerning the Only-begotten God. For they do not say this,-that the Son and the universe were from the Father in like manner,-but they say, that the Only-begotten God was made by the Father, and that all else was made by the Only-begotten. Therefore on the same ground on which, while they hold that the Son was created, they call God the Father of the created Being, on the same ground, while they say that all things were made by the Only-begotten God, they give Him the name not of the \"first-born\" of the things that were made by Him, but more properly of their \"Father,\" as the same relation existing in both cases towards the things created, logically gives rise to the same appellation. For if God, Who is over all, is not properly called the \"First-born,\" but the Father of the Being He Himself created, the Only-begotten God will surely also be called, by the same reasoning, the \"father,\" and not properly the \"first-born\" of His own creatures, so that the appellation of \"first-born\" will be altogether improper and superfluous, having no place in the heretical conception,","title":"Book IV","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_14_book_ii_","source_chapter":10,"source_paragraph":"106","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"74.

The Godhead \"empties\" Itself that It may come within the capacity of the Human Nature, and the Human Nature is renewed by becoming Divine through its commixture[fn-16-P1649_954693:53-nf] with the Divine. For as air is not retained in water when it is dragged down by some weighty body and left in the depth of the water, but rises quickly to its kindred element, while the water is often raised up together with the air in its upward rush, being moulded by the circle of air into a convex shape with a slight and membrane-like surface, so too, when the true Life that underlay the flesh sped up, after the Passion, to Itself, the flesh also was raised up with It, being forced upwards from corruption to incorruptibility by the Divine immortality. And as fire that lies in wood hidden below the surface is often unobserved by the senses of those who see, or even touch it, but is manifest when it blazes up, so too, at His death (which He brought about at His will, Who separated His soul from His Body, Who said to His own Father \"Into Thy hands I commend My Spirit[fn-16-P1650_955589:54-nf] ,\" Who, as He says, \"had power to lay it down and had power to take it again[fn-16-P1651_955690:55-nf] \"), He Who, because He is the Lord of glory, despised that which is shame among men, having concealed, as it were, the flame of His life in His bodily Nature, by the dispensation of His death[fn-16-P1652_955902:56-nf] , kindled and inflamed it once more by the power of His own Godhead, fostering into life that which had been brought to death, having infused with the infinity of His Divine power that humble first-fruits of our nature, made it also to be that which He Himself was-making the servile form to be Lord, and the Man born of Mary to be Christ, and Him Who was crucified through weakness to be Life and power, and making all that is piously conceived to be in God the Word to be also in that which the Word assumed, so that these attributes no longer seem to be in either Nature by way of division, but that the perishable Nature being, by its commixture with the Divine, made anew in conformity with the Nature that overwhelms it, participates in the power of the Godhead, as if one were to say that mixture makes a drop of vinegar mingled in the deep to be sea, by reason that the natural quality of Ibis liquid does not continue in the infinity of that which overwhelms it[fn-16-P1653_957000:57-nf] .

I must now resume the train of his complaints, that we may pass by none of the charges brought against us without an answer. And first I propose that we should examine this point, that he charges us with asserting that an ordinary man has wrought the salvation of the world. For although this point has been to some extent already cleared up by the investigations we have made, we shall yet briefly deal with it once more, that the mind of those who are acting as our judges on this slanderous accusation may be entirely freed from misapprehension. So far are we from referring to an ordinary man the cause of this great and unspeakable grace, that even if any should refer so great a boon to Peter and Paul, or to an angel from heaven, we should say with Paul, \"let him be anathema[fn-16-P1664_959817:2-nf] .\" For Paul was not crucified for us, nor were we baptized into a human name[fn-16-P1665_959923:3-nf] . Surely the doctrine which our adversaries oppose to the truth is not thereby strengthened when we confess that the saving power of Christ is more potent than human nature[fn-16-P1666_960112:4-nf] :-yet it may seem to be so, for their aim is to maintain at all points the difference of the essence of the Son from that of the Father, and they strive to show the dissimilarity of essence not only by the contrast of the Generated with the Ungenerate, but also by the opposition of the passible to the impassible. And while this is more openly maintained in the last part of their argument, it is also clearly shown in their present discourse[fn-16-P1667_961029:5-nf] . For if he finds fault with those who refer the Passion to the Human Nature, his intention is certainly to subject to the Passion the Godhead Itself. For our conception being twofold, and admitting of two developments, accordingly as the Divinity or the Humanity is held to have been in a condition of suffering, an attack on one of these views is clearly a maintaining of the other. Accordingly, if they find fault with those who look upon the Passion as concerning the Man, they will clearly approve those who say that the Godhead of the Son was subject to passion, and the position which these last maintain becomes an argument in favour of their own absurd doctrine. For if, according to their statement, the Godhead of the Son suffers, while that of the Father is preserved in absolute impassibility, then the impassible Nature is essentially different from that which admits passion. Seeing, therefore, that the dictum before us, though, so far as it is limited by number of words, it is a short one, yet affords principles and hypotheses for every kind ofdoctrinal pravity, it would seem right that ourreaders should require in our reply not so much brevity as soundness. We, then, neither attribute our own salvation to a man, nor admit that the incorruptible and Divine Nature is capable of suffering and mortality: but since we must assuredly believe the Divine utterances which declare to us that the Word that was in the beginning was God[fn-16-P1668_962564:6-nf] , and that afterward the Word made flesh was seen upon the earth and conversed with men[fn-16-P1669_962673:7-nf] , we admit in our creed those conceptions which are consonant with the Divine utterance. For when we hear that He is Light, and Power, and Righteousness, and Life, and Truth, and that by Him all things were made, we account all these and such-like statements as things to be believed, referring them to God the Word: but when we hear of pain, of slumber, of need, of trouble, of bonds, of nails, of the spear, of blood, of wounds, of burial, of the sepulchre, and all else of this kind, even if they are somewhat opposed to what has previously been stated, we none the less admit them to be things to be believed, and true, having regard to the flesh; which we receive by faith as conjoined with the Word. For as it is not possible to contemplate the peculiar attributes of the flesh as existing in the Word that was in the beginning, so also on the other hand we may not conceive those which are proper to the Godhead as existing in the nature of the flesh. As, therefore, the teaching of the Gospel concerning our Lord is mingled, partly of lofty and Divine ideas, partly of those which are lowly and human, we assign every particular phrase accordingly to one or other of these Natures which we conceive in the mystery, that which is human to the Humanity, that which is lofty to the Godhead, and say that, as God, the Son is certainly impassible and incapable of corruption: and whatever suffering is asserted concerning Him in the Gospel, He assuredly wrought by means of His Human Nature which admitted of such suffering. For verily the Godhead works the salvation of the world by means of that body which encompassed It, in such wise that the suffering was of the body, but the operation was of God; and even if some wrest to the support of the opposite doctrine the words of the Apostle, \"God spared not His own Sons,[fn-16-P1670_964521:8-nf] ,\" and, \"God sent His own Son[fn-16-P1671_964569:9-nf] ,\" and other similar phrases which seem to refer, in the matter of the Passion, to the Divine Nature, and not to the Humanity, we shall none the less refuse to abandon sound doctrine, seeing that Paul himself declares to us more clearly the mystery of this subject. For he everywhere attributes to the Human element in Christ the dispensation of the Passion, when he says, \"for since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead[fn-16-P1672_965040:10-nf] ,\" and, \"God, sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, condemned sin in the flesh[fn-16-P1673_965154:11-nf] \" (for he says, \"in the flesh,\" not \"in the Godhead\"); and \"He was crucified through weakness\" (where by \"weakness\" he means \"the flesh\"), \"yet liveth by power[fn-16-P1674_965337:12-nf] \" (while he indicates by \"power\" the Divine Nature); and, \"He died unto sin\" (that is, with regard to the body), \"but liveth unto God[fn-16-P1675_965492:13-nf] \" (that is, with regard to the Godhead, so that by these words it is established that, while the Man tasted death, the immortal Nature did not admit the suffering of death); and again; \"He made Him to be sin for us, Who knew no sin[fn-16-P1676_965742:14-nf] ,\" giving once more the name of \"sin\" to the flesh.","title":"Book VI","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_17_book_vi","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"9","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"And although we make these remarks in passing, the parenthetic addition seems, perhaps, not less important than the main question before us.

It is not then in Himself with Himself in that Trinity, in that blessedness, in that His eternal substance, that the Holy Spirit groans; but in us He groans because He makes us to groan. Nor is it a little matter that the Holy Spirit teaches us to groan, for He gives us to know that we are sojourners in a foreign land, and He teaches us to sigh after our native country; and through that very longing do we groan.

These two birds Noah sent forth.[fn-4-P442_165575:3-nf] He had there the raven, and also the dove.

Now of these two, that is, \"giving the vow to him that voweth,\" and \"He hath blessed the years of the just,\" the one is what we do, the other what we receive. But this other is not received from God, the liberal giver, until He, the helper, Himself has enabled us for the former; \"for man is not mighty in strength.\" \"The Lord shall make his adversary weak,\" to wit, him who envies the man that vows, and resists him, lest he should fulfill what he has vowed. Owing to the ambiguity of the Greek, it may also be understood \"his own adversary.\" For when God has begun to possess us, immediately he who had been our adversary becomes His, and is conquered by us; but not by our own strength, \"for man is not mighty in strength.\" Therefore \"the Lord shall make His own adversary weak, the Lord is holy,\" that he may be conquered by the saints, whom the Lord, the Holy of holies, hath made saints. For this reason, \"let not the prudent glory in his prudence, and let not the mighty glory in his might, and let not the rich glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory in this,-to understand and know the Lord, and to do judgment and justice in the midst of the earth,\" He in no small measure understands and knows the Lord who understands and knows that even this, that he can understand and know the Lord, is given to him by the Lord. \"For what hast thou,\" saith the apostle, \"that thou hast not received? But if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?\"[fn-30-P3057_1694242:27-nf] That is, as if thou hadst of thine own self whereof thou mightest glory. Now, he does judgment and justice who lives aright. But he lives aright who yields obedience to God when He commands. \"The end of the commandment,\" that is, to which the commandment has reference, \"is charity out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.\" Moreover, this \"charity,\" as the Apostle John testifies, \"is of God,\"[fn-30-P3058_1694679:28-nf] Therefore to do justice and judgment is of God. But what is \"in the midst of the earth?\" For ought those who dwell in the ends of the earth not to do judgment and justice? Who would say so? Why, then, is it added, \"In the midst of the earth?\" For if this had not been added, and it had only been said, \"To do judgment and justice,\" this commandment would rather have pertained to both kinds of men,-both those dwelling inland and those on the sea-coast. But lest any one should think that, after the end of the life led in this body, there remains. a time for doing judgment and justice which he has not done while he was in the flesh, and that the divine judgment can thus be escaped, \"in the midst of the earth\" appears to me to be said of the time when every one lives in the body; for in this life every one carries about his own earth, which, on a man's dying, the common earth takes back, to be surely returned to him on his rising again. Therefore \"in the midst of the earth,\" that is, while our soul is shut up in this earthly body, judgment and justice are to be done, which shall be profitable for us hereafter, when \"every one shall receive according to that he hath done in the body, whether good or bad.\"[fn-30-P3059_1695916:29-nf] For when the apostle there says \"in the body,\" he means in the time he has lived in the body. Yet if any one blaspheme with malicious mind and impious thought, without any member of his body being employed in it, he shall not therefore be guiltless because he has not done it with bodily motion, for he will have done it in that time which he has spent in the body. In the same way we may suitably understand what we read in the psalm, \"But God, our King before the worlds, hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth;\"[fn-30-P3060_1696460:30-nf] so that the Lord Jesus may be understood to be our God who is before the worlds, because by Him the worlds were made, working our salvation in the midst of the earth, for the Word was made flesh and dwelt in an earthly body.","title":"Book XVII","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf1_06_npnf1_06_110_sermon_xciii_cxliii_ben_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"5","folder":"NPNF1-06","text":"3.

Again the Gospels fill up what is lacking in one another: we learn some things from one, some from another, and so on, because all are the proclamation of the same spirit. Thus John, who especially brings out the working of spiritual causes in the Gospel, preserves this prayer of the Lord for the Apostles, which all the others passed over: how He prayed, namely, Holy Father, keep them in Thy Name . . . . while I was them I kept them in Thy Name: those whom Thou gavest Me I have kept[fn-20-P2064_1336675:69-nf] . That prayer was not for Himself but for His Apostles; nor was He sorrowful for Himself, since He bids them pray that they be not tempted; nor is the angel sent to Him, for He could summon down from Heaven, if He would, twelve thousand angels[fn-20-P2065_1337077:70-nf] ; nor did He fear because of death when He was troubled unto death. Again, He does not pray that the cup may pass over Himself, but that it may pass away from Himself, though before it could pass away He must have drunk it. But, further, `to pass away' does not mean merely `to leave the place,' but `not to exist any more at all:' which is shewn in the language of the Gospels and Epistles: for example, Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My word shall not perish[fn-20-P2066_1337570:71-nf] : also the Apostle says, Behold the old things are passed away; they are become new[fn-20-P2067_1337803:72-nf] . And again, The fashion of this world shall pass away[fn-20-P2068_1337877:73-nf] . The cup, therefore, of which He prays to the Father, cannot pass away unless it be drunk; and when He prays, He prays for those whom He preserved, so long as He was with them, whom He now hands over to the Father to preserve. Now that He is about to accomplish the mystery of death He begs the Father to guard them. The presence of the angel who was sent to Him (if this explanation be true) is not of doubtful significance. Jesus shewed His certainty that the prayer was answered when, at its close, He bade the disciples sleep on. The effect of this prayer and the security which prompted the command, `sleep on,' is noticed by the Evangelist in the course of the Passion, when he says of the Apostles just before they escaped from the hands of the pursuers, That the word might be fulfilled which He had spoken, Of those whom Thou hast given Me I lost not one of them[fn-20-P2069_1338771:74-nf] . He fulfils Himself the petition of His prayer, and they are all safe; but He asks that those whom He has preserved the Father will now preserve in His own Name.

In the next verse he adds: \"Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\" The belief that Jesus was born of the seed of David according to the flesh is of this old transitory kind; whereas the faith which knows no man after the flesh is new and permanent.

But it is only by your insisting on the correctness of the text that we are made to represent Paul as build ins again the things which he destroyed, in spite of his own repudiation of such prevarication.

The context of the passage containing this clause of which our adversaries make such a bad use, brings out its real meaning. \"The love of Christ,\" we read, \"constrains us, because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all died; and He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but to Him who died for them, and rose again. Therefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; and though we have known Christ after the flesh, ret now henceforth know we Him no more.\" The words, \"that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him who died for them, and rose again,\" show plainly that the resurrection of Christ is the ground of the apostle's statement. To live not to themselves, but to Him, must mean to live not after the flesh, in the hope of earthly and perishable goods, but after the spirit, in the hope of resurrection,-a resurrection already accomplished in Christ. Of those, then, for whom Christ died and rose again, and who live henceforth not to themselves, but to Him, the Apostle says that he knows no one after the flesh, on account of the hope of future immortality to which they were looking forward,-a hope which in Christ was already a reality. So, though he has known Christ after the flesh, before His death, now he knows Him no more; for he knows that He has risen, and that death has no more dominion over Him. And because in Christ we all are even now in hope, though not in reality, what Christ is, he adds: \"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself by Christ.\"[fn-13-P1366_727877:23-nf] What the new creature -that is, the people renewed by faith-hopes for regarding itself, it has already in Christ; and the hope will also hereafter be actually realized. And, as regards this hope, old things have passed away, because we are no longer in the times of the Old Testament, expecting a temporal and carnal kingdom of God; and all things are become new, making the promise of the kingdom of heaven, where there shall be no death or corruption, the ground of our confidence. But in the resurrection of the dead it will not be as a matter of hope, but in reality, that old things shall pass away, when the last enemy, death, shall be destroyed; and all things shall become new when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality. This has already taken place in Christ, whom Paul accordingly, in reality, knew no longer after the flesh. But not yet in reality, but only in hope, did he know no one after the flesh of those for whom Christ died and rose again. For, as he says to the Ephesians, we are already saved by grace. The whole passage is to the purpose: \"But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, by whose grace we have been saved.\" The words, \"hath quickened us together with Christ,\" correspond to what he said to the Corinthians, \"that they which live should no longer live to themselves, but to Him that died for them and rose again.\" And in the words,\"by whose grace we have been saved,\" he speaks of the thing hoped for as already accomplished. So, in the passage quoted above, he says explicitly, \"We have been saved by hope.\" And here he proceeds to specify future events as if already accomplished. \"And has raised us up together,\" he says, \"and has made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\" Christ is certainly already seated in heavenly places, but we not yet. But as in an assured hope we already possess the future, he says that we sit in heavenly places, not in ourselves, but in Him. And to show that it is still future, in case it should be thought that what is spoken of as accomplished in hope has been accomplished in reality, he adds, \"that He might show in the ages to come the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.\"[fn-13-P1367_730242:24-nf] So also we must understand the following passage: \"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.\"[fn-13-P1368_730445:25-nf] He says, \"when we were in the flesh,\" as if they were no longer in the flesh. He means to say, when we were in the hope of fleshly things, referring to the time when the law, which can be fulfilled only by spiritual love, was in force, in order that by transgression the offence might abound, that after the revelation of the New Testament, grace and the gift by grace might much more abound. And to the same effect he says elsewhere, \"They which are in the flesh cannot please God;\" and then, to show that he does not mean those not yet dead, he adds, \"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.\"[fn-13-P1369_731066:26-nf] The meaning is, those who are in the hope of fleshly good cannot please God; but you are not in the hope of fleshly things, but in the hope of spiritual things, that is, of the kingdom of heaven, where the body itself, which now is natural, will, by the change in the resurrection, be, according to the capacity of its nature, a spiritual body. For \"it is sown a natural body, it will be raised a spiritual body.\" If, then, the apostle knew no one after the flesh of those who were said to be not in the flesh, because they were not in the hope of fleshly things, although they still were burdened with corruptible and mortal flesh; how much more significantly could he say of Christ that he no longer knew Him after the flesh, seeing that in the body of Christ what they hoped for had already been accomplished! Surely it is better and more reverential to examine the passages of sacred Scripture so as to discover their agreement with one another, than to accept some as true, and condemn others as false, whenever any difficulty occurs beyond the power of our weak intellect to solve. As to the apostle in his childhood understanding as a child, this is said merely as an illustration.[fn-13-P1370_732278:27-nf] And when he was a child he was not a spiritual man, as he was when he produced for the edification of the churches those writings which are not, as other books, merely a profitable study, but which authoritatively claim our belief as part of the ecclesiastical canon.","title":"Book XI.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_25_book_xix","source_chapter":20,"source_paragraph":"77","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"As regards the uncertainty about everything which Varro alleges to be the differentiating characteristic of the New Academy, the city of God thoroughly detests such doubt as madness.

Who in the angel striving with Jacob, on the one hand is constrained to give him a blessing, as the weaker to the stronger, the conquered to the conqueror, and on the other hand puts his thigh-bone out of joint, but He who, when He suffered the people of Israel to prevail against Him, blessed those among them who believed, while the multitude, like Jacob's thigh-bone, halted in their carnality? Who is the stone placed under Jacob's head, but Christ the head of man? And in its anointing the very name of Christ is expressed, for, as all know, Christ means anointed. Christ refers to this in the Gospel, and declares it to be a type of Himself, when He said of Nathanael that he was an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile, and when Nathanael, resting his head, as it were, on this Stone, or on Christ, confessed Him as the Son of God and the King of Israel anointing the Stone by his confession, in which he acknowledged Jesus to be Christ. On this occasion the Lord made appropriate mention of what Jacob saw in his dream \"Verily I say unto you, Ye shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\"[fn-14-P1447_778322:44-nf] This Jacob saw, who in the blessing was called Israel, when he had the stone for a pillow, and had the vision of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, on which the angels of God were ascending and descending.[fn-14-P1448_778555:45-nf] The angels denote the evangelists, or preachers of Christ. They ascend when they rise above the created universe to describe the supreme majesty of the divine nature of Christ as being in the beginning God with God, by whom all things were made. They descend to tell of His being made of a woman, made under the law, that He might redeem them that were under the law. Christ is the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, or from the carnal to the spiritual: for by His assistance the carnal ascend to spirituality; and the spiritual may be said to descend to nourish the carnal with milk when they cannot speak to them as to spiritual, but as to carnal.[fn-14-P1449_779233:46-nf] There is thus both an ascent and a descent upon the Son of man. For the Son of man is above as our head, being Himself the Saviour; and He is below in His body, the Church. He is the ladder, for He says, \"I am the way.\" We ascend to Him to see Him in heavenly places; we descend to Him for the nourishment of His weak members. And the ascent and descent are by Him as well as to Him. Following His example, those who preach Him not only rise to behold Him exalted, but let themselves down to give a plain announcement of the truth. So the apostle ascends, \"Whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God;\" and descends, \"Whether we be sober, it is for your sake.\" And by whom did he ascend and descend? \"For the love of Christ constraineth us: for we thus judge, that if one died for all, then all died; and that He died for all, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto Him that died for them, and rose again.\"[fn-14-P1450_780193:47-nf] ","title":"Book XII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":14,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_26_book_xx","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"50","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"After that He adds the words, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.

It is for the sake of making this distinction that He says, \"The hour is coming, and now is.\" Now this resurrection regards not the body, but the soul. For souls, too, have a death of their own in wickedness and sins, whereby they are the dead of whom the same lips say, \"Suffer the dead to bury their dead,\"[fn-38-P3815_2096496:23-nf] -that is, let those who are dead in soul bury them that are dead in body. It is of these dead, then-the dead in ungodliness and wickedness-that He says, \"The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.\" \"They that hear,\" that is, they who obey, believe, and persevere to the end. Here no difference is made between the good and the bad. For it is good for all men to hear His voice and live, by passing to the life of godliness from the death of ungodliness. Of this death the Apostle Paul says, \"Therefore all are dead, and He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them and rose again.\"[fn-38-P3816_2097243:24-nf] Thus all, without one exception, were dead in sins, whether original or voluntary sins, sins of ignorance, or sins committed against knowledge; and for all the dead there died the one only person who lived, that is, who had no sin whatever, in order that they who live by the remission of their sins should live, not to themselves, but to Him who died for all, for our sins, and rose again for our justification, that we, believing in Him who justifies the ungodly, and being justified from ungodliness or quickened from death, may be able to attain to the first resurrection which now is. For in this first resurrection none have a part save those who shall be eternally blessed; but in the second, of which He goes on to speak, all, as we shall learn, have a part, both the blessed and the wretched.

For to refer this promise to the present time, in which the saints are reigning with their King a thousand years, seems to me excessively barefaced, when it is most distinctly said, \"God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, but there shall be no more pain.\" And who is so absurd, and blinded by contentious opinionativeness, as to be audacious enough to affirm that in the midst of the calamities of this mortal state, God's people, or even one single saint, does live, or has ever lived, or shall ever live, without tears or pain, -the fact being that the holier a man is, and the fuller of holy desire, so much the more abundant is the tearfulness of his supplication?

Moses, then, casts no reproach on the sun and moon when he prohibits their worship. He praises them as heavenly bodies; while he also praises God as the Creator of both heavenly and earthly, and will not allow of His being insulted by giving the worship due to Him to those who are praised only as dependent upon Him. Faustus prides himself on the ingenuity of his objection to the curse pronounced by Moses on the worship of the sun and moon. He says, \"If under a heathen monarch I am forced to worship the sun, and if from fear of this curse I refuse, shall I incur this other curse by suffering the punishment of crucifixion?\" No heathen monarch is forcing you to worship the sun: nor would the sun itself force you, if it were reigning on the earth, as neither does it now wish to be worshipped. As the Creator bears with blasphemers till the judgment, so these celestial bodies bear with their deluded worshippers till the judgment of the Creator. It should be observed that no Christian monarch could enforce the worship of the sun. Faustus instances a heathen monarch, for he knows that their worship of the sun is a heathen custom. Yet, in spite of this opposition to Christianity, the partridge takes the name of Christ, that it may gather what it has not brought forth. The answer to this objection is easy, and the force of truth will soon break the horns of this dilemma. Suppose, then, a Christian threatened by royal authority with being hung on a tree if he will not worship the sun. If I avoid, you say, the curse pronounced by the law on the worshipper of the sun, I incur the curse pronounced by the same law on him that hangs on a tree. So you will be in a difficulty; only that you worship the sun without being forced by anybody. But a true Christian, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, distinguishes the curses, and the reasons of them. He sees that one refers to the mortal body which is hung on the tree, and the other to the mind which worships the sun. For though the body. bows in worship,-which also is a heinous offence,-the belief or imagination of the object worshipped is an act of the mind. The death implied in both curses is in one case the death of the body, and in the other the death of the soul. It is better to have the curse in bodily death,-which will be removed in the resurrection,-than the curse in the death of the soul, condemning it along with the body to eternal fire. The Lord solves this difficulty in the words: \"Fear not them that kill the body, but cannot kill the soul; but fear him who has power to cast both soul and body into hell-fire.\"[fn-15-P1599_876493:11-nf] In other words, fear not the curse of bodily death, which in time is removed; but fear the curse of spiritual death, which leads to the eternal torment of both soul and body. Be assured, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree is no old wife's railing, but a prophetical utterance. Christ, by the curse, takes the curse away, as He takes away death by death, and sin by sin. In the words, \"Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,\" there is no more blasphemy than in the words of the apostle, \"He died,\" or, \"Our old man was crucified along with Him,\"[fn-16-P1600_877069:12-nf] or, \"By sin He condemned sin,\"[fn-16-P1601_877117:13-nf] or, \"He made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin,\"[fn-16-P1602_877188:14-nf] and in many similar passages. Confess, then, that when you exclaim against the curse of Christ, you exclaim against His death. If this is not an old wife's railing on your part, it is devilish delusion, which makes you deny the death of Christ because your own souls are dead. You teach people that Christ's death was feigned, making Christ your leader in the falsehood with which you use the name of Christian to mislead men.","title":"Book XIV.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_30_5_five_books_in_reply_to_marcion_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"673","folder":"ANF-04","text":"340 Thus did he speak of \"flesh.\" In fine, he said[fn-41-P4128_725616:111-nf] ","title":"5.

For if there had been no ministry of John at all-\"the voice,\" as Isaiah calls him, \"of one crying in the wilderness,\" and the preparer of the ways of the Lord by denunciation and recommendation of repentance; if, too, he had not baptized (Christ) Himself[fn-56-P5608_1717844:341-nf] along with others, nobody could have challenged the disciples of Christ, as they ate and drank, to a comparison with the disciples of John, who were constantly fasting and praying; because, if there existed any diversity[fn-56-P5609_1718079:342-nf] between Christ and John, and their followers respectively, no exact comparison would be possible, nor would there be a single point where it could be challenged. For nobody would feel surprise, and nobody would be perplexed, although there should arise rival predictions of a diverse deity, which should also mutually differ about modes of conduct,[fn-56-P5610_1718582:343-nf] having a prior difference about the authorities[fn-56-P5611_1718680:344-nf] upon which they were based. Therefore Christ belonged to John, and John to Christ; while both belonged to the Creator, and both were of the law and the prophets, preachers and masters. Else Christ would have rejected the discipline of John, as of the rival god, and would also have defended the disciples, as very properly pursuing a different walk, because consecrated to the service of another and contrary deity. But as it is, while modestly[fn-56-P5612_1719184:345-nf] giving a reason why \"the children of the bridegroom are unable to fast during the time the bridegroom is with them,\" but promising that \"they should afterwards fast, when the bridegroom was taken away from them,\"[fn-56-P5613_1719416:346-nf] He neither defended the disciples, (but rather excused them, as if they had not been blamed without some reason), nor rejected the discipline of John, but rather allowed[fn-56-P5614_1719609:347-nf] it, referring it to the time of John, although destining it for His own time. Otherwise His purpose would have been to reject it,[fn-56-P5615_1719757:348-nf] and to defend its opponents, if He had not Himself already belonged to it as then in force. I hold also that it is my Christ who is meant by the bridegroom, of whom the psalm says: \"He is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and His return is back to the end of it again.\"[fn-56-P5616_1720111:349-nf] By the mouth of Isaiah He also says exultingly of the Father: \"Let my soul rejoice in the Lord; for He hath clothed me with the garment of salvation and with the tunic of joy, as a bridegroom. He hath put a mitre round about my head, as a bride.\"[fn-56-P5617_1720380:350-nf] To Himself likewise He appropriates[fn-56-P5618_1720437:351-nf] the church, concerning which the same[fn-56-P5619_1720491:352-nf] Spirit says to Him: \"Thou shall clothe Thee with them all, as with a bridal ornament.\"[fn-56-P5620_1720624:353-nf] This spouse Christ invites home to Himself also by Solomon from the call of the Gentiles, because you read: \"Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse.\"[fn-56-P5621_1720794:354-nf] He elegantly makes mention of Lebanon (the mountain, of course) because it stands for the name of frankincense with the Greeks;[fn-56-P5622_1720949:355-nf] for it was from idolatry that He betrothed Himself the church. Deny now, Marcion, your utter madness, (if you can)! Behold, you impugn even the law of your god. He unites not in the nuptial bond, nor, when contracted, does he allow it; no one does he baptize but a cµlebs or a eunuch; until death or divorce does he reserve baptism.[fn-56-P5623_1721531:356-nf] Wherefore, then, do you make his Christ a bridegroom? This is the designation of Him who united man and woman, not of him who separated them. You have erred also in that declaration of Christ, wherein He seems to make a difference between things new and old. You are inflated about the old bottles, and brain-muddled with the new wine; and therefore to the old (that is to say, to the prior) gospel you have sewed on the patch of your new-fangled heresy. I should like to know in what respect the Creator is inconsistent with Himself.[fn-56-P5624_1722155:357-nf] When by Jeremiah He gave this precept, \"Break up for yourselves new pastures,\"[fn-56-P5625_1722248:358-nf] does He not turn away from the old state of things? And when by Isaiah He proclaims how \"old things were passed away; and, behold, all things, which I am making, are new,\"[fn-56-P5626_1722439:359-nf] does He not advert to a new state of things? We have generally been of opinion[fn-56-P5627_1722587:360-nf] that the destination of the former state of things was rather promised by the Creator, and exhibited in reality by Christ, only under the authority of one and the same God, to whom appertain both the old things and the new. For new wine is not put into old bottles, except by one who has the old bottles; nor does anybody put a new piece to an old garment, unless the old garment be forthcoming to him. That person only[fn-56-P5628_1723030:361-nf] does not do a thing when it is not to be done, who has the materials wherewithal to do it if it were to be done. And therefore, since His object in making the comparison was to show that He was separating the new condition[fn-56-P5629_1723266:362-nf] of the gospel from the old state[fn-56-P5630_1723315:363-nf] of the law, He proved that that[fn-56-P5631_1723364:364-nf] from which He was separating His own ought not to have been branded[fn-56-P5632_1723474:365-nf] as a separation[fn-56-P5633_1723507:366-nf] of things which were alien to each other; for nobody ever unites his own things with things that are alien to them,[fn-56-P5634_1723685:367-nf] in order that he may afterwards be able to separate them from the alien things. A separation is possible by help of the conjunction through which it is made. Accordingly, the things which He separated He also proved to have been once one; as they would have remained, were it not for His separation. But still we make this concession, that there is a separation, by reformation, by amplification,[fn-56-P5635_1724126:368-nf] by progress; just as the fruit is separated from the seed, although the fruit comes from the seed. So likewise the gospel is separated from the law, whilst it advances[fn-56-P5636_1724315:369-nf] from the law-a different thing[fn-56-P5637_1724381:370-nf] from it, but not an alien one; diverse, but not contrary. Nor in Christ do we even find any novel form of discourse. Whether He proposes similitudes or refute questions, it comes from the seventy-seventh Psalm. \"I will open,\" says He, \"my mouth in a parable\" (that is, in a similitude); \"I will utter dark problems\" (that is, I will set forth questions).[fn-56-P5638_1724751:371-nf] If you should wish to prove that a man belonged to another race, no doubt you would fetch your proof from the idiom of his language.","title":"Book IV.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_31_book_iv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"70","folder":"ANF-03","text":"The publican who was chosen by the Lord,[fn-55-P5598_1715134:331-nf] he adduces for a proof that he was chosen as a stranger to the law and uninitiated in[fn-55-P5599_1715276:332-nf] Judaism, by one who was an adversary to the law. The case of Peter escaped his memory, who, although he was a man of the law, was not only chosen by the Lord, but also obtained the testimony of possessing knowledge which was given to him by the Father.[fn-56-P5600_1715546:333-nf] He had nowhere read of Christ's being foretold as the light, and hope, and expectation of the Gentiles! He, however, rather spoke of the Jews in a favourable light, when he said, \"The whole needed not a physician, but they that are sick.\"[fn-56-P5601_1715807:334-nf] For since by \"those that are sick\" he meant that the heathens and publicans should be understood, whom he was choosing, he affirmed of the Jews that they were \"whole\" for whom he said that a physician was not necessary. This being the case, he makes a mistake in coming down[fn-56-P5602_1716101:335-nf] to destroy the law, as if for the remedy of a diseased condition. because they who were living under it were \"whole,\" and \"not in want of a physician.\" How, moreover, does it happen that he proposed the similitude of a physician, if he did not verify it? For, just as nobody uses a physician for healthy persons, so will no one do so for strangers, in so far as he is one of Marcion's god-made men,[fn-56-P5603_1716523:336-nf] having to himself both a creator and preserver, and a specially good physician, in his Christ. This much the comparison predetermines, that a physician is more usually furnished by him to whom the sick people belong. Whence, too, does John come upon the scene? Christ, suddenly; and just as suddenly, John![fn-56-P5604_1716859:337-nf] After this fashion occur all things in Marcion's system.

Now that the words addressed to Mary are not applicable to the Godhead of the Only-begotten, one may learn from the intention with which they were uttered. For He Who humbled Himself to a level with human littleness, He it is Who spake the words. And what is the meaning of what He then uttered, they may know in all its fulness who by the Spirit search out the depths of the sacred mystery. But as much as comes within our compass we will set down in few words, following the guidance of the Fathers. He Who is by nature Father of existent things, from Whom all things have their birth, has been proclaimed as one, by the sublime utterance of the Apostle. \"For there is one God,\" he says, \"and Father, of Whom are all things[fn-20-P2094_1268713:8-nf] .\" Accordingly human nature did not enter into the creation from any other source, nor grow spontaneously in the parents of the race, but it too had for the author of its own constitution none other than the Father of all. And the name of Godhead itself, whether it indicates the authority of oversight or of foresight[fn-20-P2095_1269055:9-nf] , imports a certain relation to humanity. For He Who bestowed on all things that are, the power of being, is the God and overseer of what He has Himself produced. But since, by the wiles of him that sowed in us the tares of disobedience, our nature no longer preserved in itself the impress of the Father's image, but was transformed into the foul likeness of sin, for this cause it was engrafted by virtue of similarity of will into the evil family of the father of sin: so that the good and true God and Father was no longer the God and Father of him who had been thus outlawed by his own depravity, but instead of Him Who was by Nature God, those were honoured who, as the Apostle says, \"by nature were no Gods[fn-20-P2096_1269960:10-nf] ,\" and in the place of the Father, he was deemed father who is falsely so called, as the prophet Jeremiah says in his dark saying, \"The partridge called, she gathered together what she hatched not[fn-20-P2097_1270174:11-nf] .\" Since, then, this was the sum of our calamity, that humanity was exiled from the good Father, and was banished from the Divine oversight and care, for this cause He Who is the Shepherd of the whole rational creation, left in the heights of heaven His unsinning and supramundane flock, and, moved by love, went after the sheep which had gone astray, even our human nature[fn-20-P2098_1270575:12-nf] . For human nature, which alone, according to the similitude in the parable, through vice roamed away from the hundred of rational beings, is, if it be compared with the whole, but an insignificant and infinitesimal part. Since then it was impossible that our life, which had been estranged from God, should of itself return to the high and heavenly place, for this cause, as saith the Apostle, He Who knew no sin is made sin for us[fn-20-P2099_1271124:13-nf] , and frees us from the curse by taking on Him our curse as His own[fn-21-P2100_1271215:14-nf] , and having taken up, and, in the language of the Apostle, \"slain\" in Himself \"the enmity[fn-21-P2101_1271328:15-nf] \" which by means of sin had come between us and God,-(in fact sin was \"the enmity\")-and having become what we were, He through Himself again united humanity to God. For having by purity brought into closest relationship with the Father of our nature that new man which is created after God[fn-21-P2102_1271640:16-nf] , in Whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily[fn-21-P2103_1271716:17-nf] , He drew with Him into the same grace all the nature that partakes of His body and is akin to Him. And these glad tidings He proclaims through the woman, not to those disciples only, but also to all who up to the present day become disciples of the Word,-the tidings, namely, that man is no longer outlawed, nor cast out of the kingdom of God, but is once more a son, once more in the station assigned to him by his God, inasmuch as along with the first-fruits of humanity the lump also is hallowed[fn-21-P2104_1272237:18-nf] . \"For behold,\" He says, \"I and the children whom God hath given Me[fn-21-P2105_1272327:19-nf] .\" He Who for our sakes was partaker of flesh and blood has recovered you, and brought you back to the place whence ye strayed away, becoming mere flesh and blood by sin[fn-21-P2106_1272542:20-nf] . And so He from Whom we were formerly alienated by our revolt has become our Father and our God. Accordingly in the passage cited above the Lord brings the glad tidings of this benefit. And the words are not a proof of the degradation of the Son, but the glad tidings of our reconciliation to God. For that which has taken place in Christ's Humanity is a common boon bestowed on mankind generally. For as when we see in Him the weight of the body, which naturally gravitates to earth, ascending through the air into the heavens, we believe according to the words of the Apostle, that we also \"shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air[fn-21-P2107_1273219:21-nf] ,\" even so, when we hear that the true God and Father has become the God and Father of our First-fruits, we no longer doubt that the same God has become our God and Father too, inasmuch as we have learnt hat we shall come to the same place whither Christ has entered for us as our forerunner[fn-21-P2108_1273533:22-nf] . And the fact too that this grace was revealed by means of a woman, itself agrees with the interpretation which we have given For since, as the Apostle tells us, \"the woman, being deceived, was in the transgression[fn-21-P2109_1273771:23-nf] ,\" and was by her disobedience foremost in the revolt from God, for this cause she is the first witness of the resurrection, that she might retrieve by her faith in the resurrection the overthrow caused by her disobedience, and that as, by making herself at the beginning a minister and advocate to her husband of the counsels of the serpent, she brought into human life the beginning of evil, and its train of consequences, so, by ministering[fn-21-P2110_1274235:24-nf] to His disciples the words of Him Who slew the rebel dragon, she might become to men the guide to faith, whereby with good reason the first proclamation of death is annulled. It is likely, indeed, that by more diligent students a more profitable explanation of the text may be discovered. But even though none such should be found, I think that every devout reader will agree that the one advanced by our opponents is futile, after comparing it with that which we have brought forward. For the one has been fabricated to destroy the glory of the Only-begotten, and nothing more: but the other includes in its scope the aim of the dispensation concerning man. For it has been shown that it was not the intangible, immutable, and invisible God, but the moving, visible, and tangible nature which is proper to humanity, that gave command to Mary to minister the word to His disciples.","title":"Book XII","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf1_07_npnf1_07_115_tractate_cx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF1-07","text":"2. But then after saying, \"That they also may be one in us,\" He added, \"That the world may believe that Thou hast sent me.\" What does He mean by this? Is it that the world will then be brought to the faith, when we shall all be one in the Father and Son? Is not such a state the everlasting peace, and the reward of faith, rather than faith itself? For we shall be one not in order to our believing, but because we have believed. But although in this life, because of the common faith itself, all who believe in one are one according to the words of the apostle, \"For ye are all one in Christ Jesus ;\"[fn-35-P3540_1961183:2-nf] even thus we are one, not in order to our believing, but because we do believe. What, then, is meant by the words, \"That they all may be one, that the world may believe\"? This, doubtless, that the \"all\" are themselves the believing world. For those who shall be one are not of one class, and the world that is thereafter to believe on this very ground that these shall be one, of another; since it is perfectly certain that He says, \"That they all may be one,\" of those of whom He had said before, \"Neither pray I for these alone, but for those also who shall believe on me through their word,\" immediately adding as He does, \"That they all may be one.\" And this \"all,\" what is it but the world; not certainly that which is hostile, but that which is believing? For you see here that He who had said, \"I pray not for the world,\" now prayeth for the world that it may believe. For there is a world whereof it is written, \"That we might not be condemned with this world.\"[fn-35-P3541_1962170:3-nf] For that world He prayeth not, for He is fully aware to what it is predestinated. And there is a world whereof it is written, \"For the Son of man came not to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved ;\"[fn-35-P3542_1962414:4-nf] and hence the apostle also says, \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.\"[fn-35-P3543_1962522:5-nf] For this world it is that He prayeth, in saying, \"That the world may believe that Thou hast sent me.\" For through this faith the world is reconciled unto God when it believes in the Christ whom God has sent. How, then, are we to understand Him when He says, \"That they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that Thou hast sent me,\" but just in this way, that He did not assign the cause of the world believing to the fact that those others are one, as if it believed on the ground that it saw them to be one; for the world itself here consisteth of all who by their own believing become one; but in His prayer He said, \"That the world may believe,\" just as in His prayer He also said, \"That they all may be one;\" and still further in the same prayer, \"That they also may be one in us.\" For the words, \"they all may be one,\" are equivalent to \"the world may believe,\" since it is by believing that they become one, perfectly one; that is, those who, although one by nature, had ceased to be so by their mutual dissensions. In fine, if the verb which He uses, \"I pray,\" be understood in the third clause, or rather, to make the whole fuller, be everywhere supplied, the explanation of this sentence will be all the clearer: I pray \"that they all may be one; as Thou, Father, in me, and I in Thee ;\" I pray \"that they also may be one in us ;\" I pray \"that the world may believe that Thou hast sent me.\" And, mark, He added the words \"in us\" in order that we may know that our being made one in that love of unchanging faithfulness is to be attributed to the grace of God, and not to ourselves: just as the apostle, after saying, \"For ye were at one time darkness, but now are ye light,\" that none might attribute the doing of this to themselves, added, \"in the Lord.\"[fn-35-P3544_1964316:6-nf] ","title":"Tractate CX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_24_book_ii_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"135","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"93.

For the abolition of the ancient law we fully admit, and hold that it actually proceeds from the dispensation of the Creator,-a point which we have already often treated in the course of our discussion, when we showed that the innovation was foretold by the prophets of our God.[fn-71-P7191_2083046:46-nf] Now, if the Creator indeed promised that \"the ancient things should pass away,\"[fn-71-P7192_2083190:47-nf] to be superseded by a new course of things which should arise, whilst Christ marks the period of the separation when He says, \"The law and the prophets were until John\"[fn-71-P7193_2083422:48-nf] -thus making the Baptist the limit between the two dispensations of the old things then terminating-and the new things then beginning, the apostle cannot of course do otherwise, (coming as he does) in Christ, who was revealed after John, than invalidate \"the old things\" and confirm \"the new,\" and yet promote thereby the faith of no other god than the Creator, at whose instance[fn-71-P7194_2083821:49-nf] it was foretold that the ancient things should pass away. Therefore both the abrogation of the law and the establishment of the gospel help my argument even in this epistle, wherein they both have reference to the fond assumption of the Galatians, which led them to suppose that faith in Christ (the Creator's Christ, of course) was obligatory, but without annulling the law, because it still appeared to them a thing incredible that the law should be set aside by its own author. Again,[fn-71-P7195_2084325:50-nf] if they had at all heard of any other god from the apostle, would they not have concluded at once, of themselves, that they must give up the law of that God whom they had left, in order to follow another? For what man would be long in learning, that he ought to pursue a new discipline, after he had taken up with a new god? Since, however,[fn-71-P7196_2084678:51-nf] the same God was declared in the gospel which had always been so well known in the law, the only change being in the dispensation,[fn-71-P7197_2084825:52-nf] the sole point of the question to be discussed was, whether the law of the Creator ought by the gospel to be excluded in the Christ of the Creator? Take away this point, and the controversy falls to the ground. Now, since they would all know of themselves,[fn-71-P7198_2085099:53-nf] on the withdrawal of this point, that they must of course renounce all submission to the Creator by reason of their faith in another god, there could have been no call for the apostle to teach them so earnestly that which their own belief must have spontaneously suggested to them. Therefore the entire purport of this epistle is simply to show us that the supersession[fn-71-P7199_2085482:54-nf] of the law comes from the appointment of the Creator-a point, which we shall still have to keep in mind.[fn-72-P7200_2085606:55-nf] Since also he makes mention of no other god (and he could have found no other opportunity of doing so, more suitable than when his purpose was to set forth the reason for the abolition of the law-especially as the prescription of a new god would have afforded a singularly good and most sufficient reason), it is clear enough in what sense he writes, \"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him who hath called you to His grace to another gospel\"[fn-72-P7201_2086082:56-nf] -He means) \"another\" as to the conduct it prescribes, not in respect of its worship; \"another\" as to the discipline it teaches, not in respect of its divinity; because it is the office of[fn-72-P7202_2086289:57-nf] Christ's gospel to call men from the law to grace, not from the Creator to another god. For nobody had induced them to apostatize from[fn-72-P7203_2086438:58-nf] the Creator, that they should seem to \"be removed to another gospel,\" simply when they return again to the Creator. When he adds, too, the words, \"which is not another,\"[fn-72-P7204_2086630:59-nf] he confirms the fact that the gospel which he maintains is the Creator's. For the Creator Himself promises the gospel, when He says by Isaiah: \"Get thee up into the high mountain, thou that bringest to Sion good tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest the gospel to Jerusalem.\"[fn-72-P7205_2086945:60-nf] Also when, with respect to the apostles personally, He says, \"How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, that bring good tidings of good\"[fn-72-P7206_2087139:61-nf] -even proclaiming the gospel to the Gentiles, because He also says, \"In His name shall the Gentiles trust; \"[fn-72-P7207_2087266:62-nf] that is, in the name of Christ, to whom He says, \"I have given thee as a light of the Gentiles.\"[fn-72-P7208_2087764:63-nf] However, you will have it that it is the gospel of a new god which was then set forth by the apostle. So that there are two gospels for[fn-72-P7209_2087919:64-nf] two gods; and the apostle made a great mistake when he said that \"there is not another\" gospel,[fn-72-P7210_2088045:65-nf] since there is (on the hypothesis)[fn-72-P7211_2088096:66-nf] another; and so he might have made a better defence of his gospel, by rather demonstrating this, than by insisting on its being but one. But perhaps, to avoid this difficulty, you will say that he therefore added just afterwards, \"Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel, let him be accursed,\"[fn-72-P7212_2088416:67-nf] because he was aware that the Creator was going to introduce a gospel! But you thus entangle yourself still more. For this is now the mesh in which you are caught. To affirm that there are two gospels, is not the part of a man who has already denied that there is another. His meaning, however, is clear, for he has mentioned himself first (in the anathema): \"But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel.\"[fn-72-P7213_2088856:68-nf] It is by way of an example that he has expressed himself. If even he himself might not preach any other gospel, then neither might an angel. He said \"angel\" in this way, that he might show how much more men ought not to be believed, when neither an angel nor an apostle ought to be; not that he meant to apply[fn-72-P7214_2089182:69-nf] an angel to the gospel of the Creator. He then cursorily touches on his own conversion from a persecutor to an apostle-confirming thereby the Acts of the Apostles,[fn-72-P7215_2089361:70-nf] in which book may be found the very subject[fn-72-P7216_2089477:71-nf] of this epistle, how that certain persons interposed, and said that men ought to be circumcised, and that the law of Moses was to be observed; and how the apostles, when consulted, determined, by the authority of the Holy Ghost, that \"a yoke should not be put upon men's necks which their fathers even had not been able to bear.\"[fn-72-P7217_2089826:72-nf] Now, since the Acts of the Apostles thus agree with Paul, it becomes apparent why you reject them. It is because they declare no other God than the Creator, and prove Christ to belong to no other God than the Creator; whilst the promise of the Holy Ghost is shown to have been fulfilled in no other document than the Acts of the Apostles. Now, it is not very likely that these[fn-72-P7218_2090256:73-nf] should be found in agreement with the apostle, on the one hand, when they described his career in accordance with his own statement; but should, on the other hand, be at variance with him when they announce the (attribute of) divinity in the Creator's Christ-as if Paul did not follow[fn-72-P7219_2090615:74-nf] the preaching of the apostles when he received from them the prescription[fn-72-P7220_2090714:75-nf] of not teaching the Law.[fn-72-P7221_2090752:76-nf] ","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":14,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"ANF-03","text":"As to the house of this our earthly dwelling-place, when he says that \"we have an eternal home in heaven, not made with hands,\"[fn-77-P7729_2210885:549-nf] he by no means would imply that, because it was built by the Creator's hand, it must perish in a perpetual dissolution after death.[fn-77-P7730_2211037:550-nf] He treats of this subject in order to offer consolation against the fear of death and the dread of this very dissolution, as is even more manifest from what follows, when he adds, that \"in this tabernacle of our earthly body we do groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with the vesture which is from heaven,[fn-77-P7731_2211394:551-nf] if so be, that having been unclothed,[fn-77-P7732_2211455:552-nf] we shall not be found naked; \"in other words, shall regain that of which we have been divested, even our body.

It was accordingly not without good reason that he described them as \"not wishing indeed to be unclothed,\" but (rather as wanting) \"to be clothed upon; \"[fn-77-P7743_2213338:563-nf] in other words, as wishing not to undergo death, but to be surprised into life,[fn-77-P7744_2213438:564-nf] \"that this moral (body) might be swallowed up of life,\"[fn-77-P7745_2213518:565-nf] by being rescued from death in the supervesture of its changed state. This is why he shows us how much better it is for us not to be sorry, if we should be surprised by death, and tells us that we even hold of God \"the earnest of His Spirit\"[fn-77-P7746_2213835:566-nf] (pledged as it were thereby to have \"the clothing upon,\" which is the object of our hope), and that \"so long as we are in the flesh, we are absent from the Lord; \"[fn-77-P7747_2214019:567-nf] moreover, that we ought on this account to prefer[fn-77-P7748_2214089:568-nf] \"rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord,\"[fn-77-P7749_2214178:569-nf] and so to be ready to meet even death with joy. In this view it is that he informs us how \"we must all appear before the judgement-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according as he hath done either good or bad.\"[fn-77-P7750_2214449:570-nf] Since, however, there is then to be a retribution according to men's merits, how will any be able to reckon with[fn-77-P7751_2214583:571-nf] God? But by mentioning both the judgment-seat and the distinction between works good and bad, he sets before us a Judge who is to award both sentences,[fn-77-P7752_2214756:572-nf] and has thereby affirmed that all will have to be present at the tribunal in their bodies. For it will be impossible to pass sentence except on the body, for what has been done in the body. God would be unjust, if any one were not punished or else rewarded in that very condition,[fn-77-P7753_2215058:573-nf] wherein the merit was itself achieved. \"If therefore any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old; things are passed away; behold, all things are become new; \"[fn-77-P7754_2215260:574-nf] and so is accomplished the prophecy of Isaiah.[fn-77-P7755_2215328:575-nf] When also he (in a later passage) enjoins us \"to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and blood\"[fn-77-P7756_2215458:576-nf] (since this substance enters not the kingdom of Gods[fn-77-P7757_2215548:577-nf] ); when, again, he \"espouses the church as a chaste virgin to Christ,\"[fn-77-P7758_2215641:578-nf] a spouse to a spouse in very deed,[fn-77-P7759_2215697:579-nf] an image cannot be combined and compared with what is opposed to the real nature the thing (with which it is compared). when he designates \"false apostles, deceitful workers transforming themselves\" into likenesses of himself,[fn-77-P7760_2215957:580-nf] of course by their hypocrisy, he charges them with the guilt of disorderly conversation, rather than of false doctrine.[fn-77-P7761_2216099:581-nf] The contrariety, therefore, was one of conduct, not of gods.[fn-77-P7762_2216195:582-nf] If \"Satan himself, too, is transformed into an angel of light,\"[fn-77-P7763_2216412:583-nf] such an assertion must not be used to the prejudice of the Creator. The Creator is not an angel, but God.

Now, if it is our gospel which has spread everywhere, rather than any heretical gospel, much less Marcion's, which only dates from the reign of Antoninus,[fn-80-P8068_2292902:867-nf] then ours will be the gospel of the apostles. But should Marcion's gospel succeed in filling the whole world, it would not even in that case be entitled to the character of apostolic. For this quality, it will be evident, can only belong to that gospel which was the first to fill the world; in other words, to the gospel of that God who of old declared this of its promulgation: \"Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"[fn-80-P8069_2293434:868-nf] He calls Christ \"the image of the invisible God.\"[fn-80-P8070_2293503:869-nf] We in like manner say that the Father of Christ is invisible, for we know that it was the Son who was seen in ancient times (whenever any appearance was vouchsafed to men in the name of God) as the image of (the Father) Himself. He must not be regarded, however, as making any difference between a visible and an invisible God; because long before he wrote this we find a description of our God to this effect: \"No man can see the Lord, and live.\"[fn-80-P8071_2293970:870-nf] If Christ is not \"the first-begotten before every creature,\"[fn-80-P8072_2294054:871-nf] as that \"Word of God by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made; \"[fn-80-P8073_2294295:872-nf] if \"all things were\" not \"in Him created, whether in heaven or on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities, or powers; \"if \"all things were\" not \"created by Him and for Him\" (for these truths Marcion ought not to allow concerning Him), then the apostle could not have so positively laid it down, that \"He is before all.\"[fn-80-P8074_2294679:873-nf] For how is He before all, if He is not before all things?[fn-80-P8075_2294756:874-nf] How, again, is He before all things, if He is not \"the first-born of every creature\"-if He is not the Word of the Creator?[fn-80-P8076_2294898:875-nf] Now how will he be proved to have been before all things, who appeared after all things? Who can tell whether he had a prior existence, when he has found no proof that he had any existence at all? In what way also could it have \"pleased (the Father) that in Him should all fulness dwell? \"[fn-80-P8077_2295227:876-nf] For, to begin with, what fulness is that which is not comprised of the constituents which Marcion has removed from it,-even those that were \"created in Christ, whether in heaven or on earth,\" whether angels or men? which is not made of the things that are visible and invisible? which consists not of thrones and dominions and principalities and powers? If, on the other hand,[fn-80-P8078_2295623:877-nf] our false apostles and Judaizing gospellers[fn-80-P8079_2295682:878-nf] have introduced all these things out of their own stores, and Martian has applied them to constitute the fulness of his own god, (this hypothesis, absurd though it be, alone would justify him; ) for how, on any other supposition,[fn-80-P8080_2295937:879-nf] could the rival and the destroyer of the Creator have been willing that His fulness should dwell in his Christ? To whom, again, does He \"reconcile all things by Himself, making peace by the blood of His cross,\"[fn-80-P8081_2296170:880-nf] but to Him whom those very things had altogether[fn-80-P8082_2296238:881-nf] offended, against whom they had rebelled by transgression, (but) to whom they had at last returned?[fn-80-P8083_2296397:882-nf] Conciliated they might have been to a strange god; but reconciled they could not possibly have been to any other than their own God. Accordingly, ourselves \"who were sometime alienated and enemies in our mind by wicked works\"[fn-80-P8084_2296655:883-nf] does He reconcile to the Creator, against whom we had committed offence-worshipping the creature to the prejudice of the Creator. As, however, he says elsewhere,[fn-80-P8085_2296836:884-nf] that the Church is the body of Christ, so here also (the apostle) declares that he \"fills up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in his flesh for His body's sake, which is the Church.\"[fn-80-P8086_2297054:885-nf] But you must not on this account suppose that on every mention of His body the term is only a metaphor, instead of meaning real flesh. For he says above that we are \"reconciled in His body through death; \"[fn-80-P8087_2297279:886-nf] meaning, of course, that He died in that body wherein death was possible through the flesh: (therefore he adds, ) not through the Church[fn-80-P8088_2297435:887-nf] (per ecclesiam), but expressly for the sake of the Church (proper ecclesiam), exchanging body for body-one of flesh for a spiritual one. When, again, he warns them to \"beware of subtle words and philosophy,\" as being \"a vain deceit,\" such as is \"after the rudiments of the world\" (not understanding thereby the mundane fabric of sky and earth, but worldly learning, and \"the tradition of men,\" subtle in their speech and their philosophy),[fn-80-P8089_2297958:888-nf] it would be tedious, and the proper subject of a separate work, to show how in this sentence (of the apostle's) all heresies are condemned, on the ground of their consisting of the resources of subtle speech and the rules of philosophy. But (once for all) let Marcion know that the principle term of his creed comes from the school of Epicurus, implying that the Lord is stupid and indifferent;[fn-80-P8090_2298372:889-nf] wherefore he refuses to say that He is an object to be feared. Moreover, from the porch of the Stoics he brings out matter, and places it on a par with the Divine Creator.[fn-80-P8091_2299157:890-nf] He also denies the resurrection of the flesh,-a truth which none of the schools of philosophy agreed together to hold.[fn-80-P8092_2299442:891-nf] But how remote is our (Catholic) verity from the artifices of this heretic, when it dreads to arouse the anger of God, and firmly believes that He produced all things out of nothing, and promises to us a restoration from the grave of the same flesh (that died) and holds without a blush that Christ was born of the virgin's womb! At this, philosophers, and heretics, and the very heathen, laugh and jeer. For \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise\"[fn-80-P8093_2300031:892-nf] -that God, no doubt, who in reference to this very dispensation of His threatened long before that He would \"destroy the wisdom of the wise.\"[fn-80-P8094_2300194:893-nf] Thanks to this simplicity of truth, so opposed to the subtlety and vain deceit of philosophy, we cannot possibly have any relish for such perverse opinions. Then, if God \"quickens us together with Christ, forgiving us our trespasses,\"[fn-80-P8095_2300510:894-nf] we cannot suppose that sins are forgiven by Him against whom, as having been all along unknown, they could not have been committed. Now tell me, Marcion, what is your opinion of the apostle's language, when he says, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath, which is a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ? \"[fn-80-P8096_2300924:895-nf] We do not now treat of the law, further than (to remark) that the apostle here teaches clearly how it has been abolished, even by passing from shadow to substance-that is, from figurative types to the reality, which is Christ. The shadow, therefore, is His to whom belongs the body also; in other words, the law is His, and so is Christ. If you separate the law and Christ, assigning one to one god and the other to another, it is the same as if you were to attempt to separate the shadow from the body of which it is the shadow. Manifestly Christ has relation to the law, if the body has to its shadow. But when he blames those who alleged visions of angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats-\"you must not touch, you must not taste\"-in a voluntary humility, (at the same time) \"vainly puffed up in the fleshly mind, and not holding the Head,\"[fn-80-P8097_2301822:896-nf] (the apostle) does not in these terms attack the law or Moses, as if it was at the suggestion of superstitious angels that he had enacted his prohibition of sundry aliments. For Moses had evidently received the law from God. When, therefore, he speaks of their \"following the commandments and doctrines of men,\"[fn-80-P8098_2302162:897-nf] he refers to the conduct of those persons who \"held not the Head,\" even Him in whom all things are gathered together;[fn-80-P8099_2302300:898-nf] for they are all recalled to Christ, and concentrated in Him as their initiating principle[fn-81-P8100_2302423:899-nf] -even the meats and drinks which were indifferent in their nature. All the rest of his precepts,[fn-81-P8101_2302536:900-nf] as we have shown sufficiently, when treating of them as they occurred in another epistle,[fn-81-P8102_2302664:901-nf] emanated from the Creator, who, while predicting that \"old things were to pass away,\" and that He would \"make all things new,\"[fn-81-P8103_2302902:902-nf] commanded men \"to break up fresh ground for themselves,\"[fn-81-P8104_2303013:903-nf] and thereby taught them even then to put off the old man and put on the new.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_35_book_v_","source_chapter":21,"source_paragraph":"66","folder":"ANF-03","text":"I am accustomed in my prescription against all heresies, to fix my compendious criterion[fn-80-P8066_2292235:865-nf] (of truth) in the testimony of time; claiming priority therein as our rule, and alleging lateness to be the characteristic of every heresy.

For he says above that we are \"reconciled in His body through death; \"[fn-80-P8087_2297279:886-nf] meaning, of course, that He died in that body wherein death was possible through the flesh: (therefore he adds, ) not through the Church[fn-80-P8088_2297435:887-nf] (per ecclesiam), but expressly for the sake of the Church (proper ecclesiam), exchanging body for body-one of flesh for a spiritual one. When, again, he warns them to \"beware of subtle words and philosophy,\" as being \"a vain deceit,\" such as is \"after the rudiments of the world\" (not understanding thereby the mundane fabric of sky and earth, but worldly learning, and \"the tradition of men,\" subtle in their speech and their philosophy),[fn-80-P8089_2297958:888-nf] it would be tedious, and the proper subject of a separate work, to show how in this sentence (of the apostle's) all heresies are condemned, on the ground of their consisting of the resources of subtle speech and the rules of philosophy. But (once for all) let Marcion know that the principle term of his creed comes from the school of Epicurus, implying that the Lord is stupid and indifferent;[fn-80-P8090_2298372:889-nf] wherefore he refuses to say that He is an object to be feared. Moreover, from the porch of the Stoics he brings out matter, and places it on a par with the Divine Creator.[fn-80-P8091_2299157:890-nf] He also denies the resurrection of the flesh,-a truth which none of the schools of philosophy agreed together to hold.[fn-80-P8092_2299442:891-nf] But how remote is our (Catholic) verity from the artifices of this heretic, when it dreads to arouse the anger of God, and firmly believes that He produced all things out of nothing, and promises to us a restoration from the grave of the same flesh (that died) and holds without a blush that Christ was born of the virgin's womb! At this, philosophers, and heretics, and the very heathen, laugh and jeer. For \"God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise\"[fn-80-P8093_2300031:892-nf] -that God, no doubt, who in reference to this very dispensation of His threatened long before that He would \"destroy the wisdom of the wise.\"[fn-80-P8094_2300194:893-nf] Thanks to this simplicity of truth, so opposed to the subtlety and vain deceit of philosophy, we cannot possibly have any relish for such perverse opinions. Then, if God \"quickens us together with Christ, forgiving us our trespasses,\"[fn-80-P8095_2300510:894-nf] we cannot suppose that sins are forgiven by Him against whom, as having been all along unknown, they could not have been committed. Now tell me, Marcion, what is your opinion of the apostle's language, when he says, \"Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath, which is a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ? \"[fn-80-P8096_2300924:895-nf] We do not now treat of the law, further than (to remark) that the apostle here teaches clearly how it has been abolished, even by passing from shadow to substance-that is, from figurative types to the reality, which is Christ. The shadow, therefore, is His to whom belongs the body also; in other words, the law is His, and so is Christ. If you separate the law and Christ, assigning one to one god and the other to another, it is the same as if you were to attempt to separate the shadow from the body of which it is the shadow. Manifestly Christ has relation to the law, if the body has to its shadow. But when he blames those who alleged visions of angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats-\"you must not touch, you must not taste\"-in a voluntary humility, (at the same time) \"vainly puffed up in the fleshly mind, and not holding the Head,\"[fn-80-P8097_2301822:896-nf] (the apostle) does not in these terms attack the law or Moses, as if it was at the suggestion of superstitious angels that he had enacted his prohibition of sundry aliments. For Moses had evidently received the law from God. When, therefore, he speaks of their \"following the commandments and doctrines of men,\"[fn-80-P8098_2302162:897-nf] he refers to the conduct of those persons who \"held not the Head,\" even Him in whom all things are gathered together;[fn-80-P8099_2302300:898-nf] for they are all recalled to Christ, and concentrated in Him as their initiating principle[fn-81-P8100_2302423:899-nf] -even the meats and drinks which were indifferent in their nature. All the rest of his precepts,[fn-81-P8101_2302536:900-nf] as we have shown sufficiently, when treating of them as they occurred in another epistle,[fn-81-P8102_2302664:901-nf] emanated from the Creator, who, while predicting that \"old things were to pass away,\" and that He would \"make all things new,\"[fn-81-P8103_2302902:902-nf] commanded men \"to break up fresh ground for themselves,\"[fn-81-P8104_2303013:903-nf] and thereby taught them even then to put off the old man and put on the new.","title":"Book V.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf1_04_npnf1_04_32_book_xix_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"12","folder":"NPNF1-04","text":"10. When you ask why a Christian does not observe the distinction in food as enjoined in the law, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that a Christian does not observe this distinction precisely because what was thus prefigured is now fulfilled in Christ, who admits into His body, which in His saints He has predestined to eternal life, nothing which in human conduct corresponds to the characteristics of the forbidden animals. When you ask, again, why a Christian does not offer sacrifices to God of the flesh and blood of slain animals, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that it would be improper for a Christian to offer such sacrifices, now that what was thus prefigured has been fulfilled in Christ's offering of His own body and blood.

When you ask why a Christian does not keep the feasts of the new moon appointed in the law, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that he does not keep them precisely because what was thus prefigured is fulfilled in Christ. For the feast of the new moon prefigured the new creature, of which the apostle says: \"If therefore there is any new creature in Christ Jesus, the old things have passed away; behold, all things are become new.\"[fn-18-P1845_1038552:25-nf] When you ask why a Christian does not observe the baptisms for various kinds of uncleanness according to the law, if Christ came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it, I reply, that he does not observe them precisely because they were figures of things to come, which Christ has fulfilled. For He came to bury us with Himself by baptism into death, that as Christ rose again from the dead, so we also should walk in newness of life.[fn-18-P1846_1039008:26-nf] When you ask why Christians do not keep the feast of tabernacles, if the law is not destroyed, but fulfilled by Christ, I reply that believers are God's tabernacle, in whom, as they are united and built together in love, God condescends to dwell, so that Christians do not keep this feast precisely because what was thus prefigured is now fulfilled by Christ in His Church.","title":"Book XIX.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":7,"source_code":"npnf1_02_npnf1_02_33_book_ii","source_chapter":9,"source_paragraph":"63","folder":"NPNF1-02","text":"11.

And this circumstance would assist rather than hinder the understanding of Scripture, if only readers were not careless. For the examination of a number of texts has often thrown light upon some of the more obscure passages; for example, in that passage of the prophet Isaiah,[fn-48-P4872_2636056:17-nf] one translator reads: \"And do not despise the domestics of thy seed;\"[fn-48-P4873_2636209:18-nf] another reads: \"And do not despise thine own flesh.\"[fn-48-P4874_2636308:19-nf] Each of these in turn confirms the other. For the one is explained by the other; because \"flesh\" may be taken in its literal sense, so that a man may understand that he is admonished not to despise his own body; and \"the domestics of thy seed\" may be understood figuratively of Christians, because they are spiritually born of the same seed as ourselves, namely, the Word. When now the meaning of the two translators is compared, a more likely sense of the words suggests itself, viz., that the command is not to despise our kinsmen, because when one brings the expression \"domestics of thy seed\" into relation with \"flesh,\" kinsmen most naturally occur to one's mind. Whence, I think, that expression of the apostle, when he says, \"If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them;\"[fn-48-P4875_2637175:20-nf] that is, that through emulation of those who had believed, some of them might believe too. And he calls the Jews his \"flesh,\" on account of the relationship of blood. Again, that passage from the same prophet Isaiah:[fn-48-P4876_2637410:21-nf] \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand,\"[fn-48-P4877_2637550:22-nf] another has translated: \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not abide.\"[fn-48-P4878_2637663:23-nf] Now which of these is the literal translation cannot be ascertained without reference to the text in the original tongue. And yet to those who read with knowledge, a great truth is to be found in each. For it is difficult for interpreters to differ so widely as not to touch at some point. Accordingly here, as understanding consists in sight, and is abiding, but faith feeds us as babes, upon milk, in the cradles of temporal things (for now we walk by faith, not by sight);[fn-48-P4879_2638182:24-nf] as, moreover, unless we walk by faith, we shall not attain to sight, which does not pass away, but abides, our understanding being purified by holding to the truth;-for these reasons one says,\" If ye will not believe, ye shall not understand;\" but the other, \"If ye will not believe, ye shall not abide.\"","title":"Book II","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_05_anf05_122_treatise_xii_three_books_of_testimonies_against_the_jews_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"175","folder":"ANF-05","text":"In Malachi: \"Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, burning as an oven; and all the aliens and all the wicked shall be as stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord.\"[fn-83-P8380_2758048:301-nf] Also in the forty-ninth (or fiftieth) Psalm: \"God the Lord of gods hath spoken, and called the earth.

Therefore, says the holy Methodius, by this earthly house must metaphorically[fn-58-P5889_1788868:89-nf] be understood our short-lived existence here, and not this tabernacle; for if you decide to consider the body as being the earthly house which is dissolved, tell us what is the tabernacle whose house is dissolved? For the tabernacle is one thing, and the house of the tabernacle another, and still another we who have the tabernacle. \"For,\" he says, \"if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved\"-by which he points out that the souls are ourselves, that the body is a tabernacle, and that the house of the tabernacle figuratively represents the enjoyment of the flesh in the present life. If, then, this present life of the body be dissolved like a house, we shall have that which is not made with hands in the heavens. \"Not made with hands,\" he says, to point out the difference; because this life may be said to be made with hands, seeing that all the employments and pursuits of life are carried on by the hands of men. For the body, being the workmanship of God, is not said to be made with hands, inasmuch as it is not formed by the arts of men. But if they shall say that it is made with hands, because it was the workmanship of God, then our souls also, and the angels, and the spiritual clothing in the heavens, are made with hands; for all these things, also, are the workmanship of God. What, then, is the house which is made with hands? It is, as I have said, the short-lived existence which is sustained by human hands. For God said, \"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread; \"[fn-58-P5890_1790511:90-nf] and when that life is dissolved, we have the life which is not made with hands. As also the Lord showed, when He said: \"Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.\"[fn-58-P5891_1790783:91-nf] For what the Lord then called \"habitations,\"[fn-58-P5892_1790846:92-nf] the apostle here calls \"clothing.\"[fn-58-P5893_1790895:93-nf] And what He there calls \"friends\" \"of unrighteousness,\" the apostle here calls \"houses\" \"dissolved.\" As then, when the days of our present life shall fail, those good deeds of beneficence to which we have attained in this unrighteous life, and in this \"world\" which \"lieth in wickedness,\"[fn-58-P5894_1791221:94-nf] will receive our souls; so when this perishable life shall be dissolved, we shall have the habitation which is before the resurrection-that is, our souls shall he with God, until we shall receive the new house which is prepared for us, and which shall never fall. Whence also \"we groan,\" \"not for that we would be unclothed,\" as to the body, \"but clothed upon\"[fn-58-P5895_1791601:95-nf] by it in the other life. For the \"house in heaven,\" with which we desire to be \"clothed,\" is immortality; with which, when we are clothed, every weakness and mortality will be entirely \"swallowed up\" in it, being consumed by endless life. \"For we walk by faith, not by sight; \"[fn-58-P5896_1791897:96-nf] that is, for we still go forward by faith, viewing the things which are beyond with a darkened understanding, and not clearly, so that we may see these things, and enjoy them, and be in them. \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\"[fn-58-P5897_1792237:97-nf] By flesh, he did not mean flesh itself, but the irrational impulse towards the lascivious pleasures of the soul. And therefore when he says, \"Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,\" he adds the explanation, \"Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" Now corruption is not the thing which is corrupted, but the thing which corrupts. For when death prevails the body sinks into corruption; but when life still remains in it, it stands uncorrupted. Therefore, since the flesh is the boundary between corruption and incorruption, not being either corruption or incorruption, it was vanquished by corruption on account of pleasure, although it was the work and the possession of incorruption. Therefore it became subject to corruption. When, then, it had been overcome by corruption, and was given over to death for chastisement, He did not leave it to be vanquished and given over as an inheritance to corruption; but again conquering death by the resurrection, He restored it to incorruption, that corruption might not inherit incorruption, but incorruption that which is corruptible. And therefore the apostle answers, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality.\"[fn-58-P5898_1793465:98-nf] But the corruptible and mortal putting on incorruption and immortality, what else is this, but that which is sown in corruption rising in incorruption?[fn-58-P5899_1793637:99-nf] For, \"as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.\"[fn-59-P5900_1793754:100-nf] For the \"image of the earthly\" which we have borne refers to the saying, \"Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.\"[fn-59-P5901_1793899:101-nf] And the \"image of the heavenly is the resurrection from the dead and incorruption.\"","title":"From the Discourse on the Resurrection.","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":5,"verse":2,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_122_from_the_discourse_on_the_resurrection_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"ANF-06","text":"V.

As also the Lord showed, when He said: \"Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.\"[fn-58-P5891_1790783:91-nf] For what the Lord then called \"habitations,\"[fn-58-P5892_1790846:92-nf] the apostle here calls \"clothing.\"[fn-58-P5893_1790895:93-nf] And what He there calls \"friends\" \"of unrighteousness,\" the apostle here calls \"houses\" \"dissolved.\" As then, when the days of our present life shall fail, those good deeds of beneficence to which we have attained in this unrighteous life, and in this \"world\" which \"lieth in wickedness,\"[fn-58-P5894_1791221:94-nf] will receive our souls; so when this perishable life shall be dissolved, we shall have the habitation which is before the resurrection-that is, our souls shall he with God, until we shall receive the new house which is prepared for us, and which shall never fall.

For the \"house in heaven,\" with which we desire to be \"clothed,\" is immortality; with which, when we are clothed, every weakness and mortality will be entirely \"swallowed up\" in it, being consumed by endless life. \"For we walk by faith, not by sight; \"[fn-58-P5896_1791897:96-nf] that is, for we still go forward by faith, viewing the things which are beyond with a darkened understanding, and not clearly, so that we may see these things, and enjoy them, and be in them. \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\"[fn-58-P5897_1792237:97-nf] By flesh, he did not mean flesh itself, but the irrational impulse towards the lascivious pleasures of the soul.

Already on a former occasion I have spoken of these ascending and descending angels; but lest you should have forgotten, I shall speak of the latter briefly by way of recalling it to your recollection. I should use more words if I were introducing, not recalling the subject. Jacob saw a ladder in a dream; and on a ladder he saw angels ascending and descending: and he anointed the stone which he had placed at his head.[fn-5-P552_247696:31-nf] You have heard that the Messias is Christ; you have heard that Christ is the Anointed. For Jacob did not place the stone, the anointed stone, that he might come and adore it: otherwise that would have been idolatry, not a pointing out of Christ. What was done was a pointing out of Christ, so far as it behoved such a pointing out to be made, and it was Christ that was pointed out. A stone was anointed, but not for an idol. A stone anointed; why a stone? \"Behold, I lay in Zion a stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on Him shall not be confounded.\"[fn-5-P553_248283:32-nf] Why anointed? Because Christus comes from chrisma. But what saw he then on the ladder? Ascending and descending angels. So it is the Church, brethren: the angels of God are good preachers, preaching Christ; this is the meaning of, \"they ascend and descend upon the Son of man.\" How do they ascend, and how do they descend? In one case we have an example; listen to the Apostle Paul. What we find in him, let us believe regarding the other preachers of the truth. Behold Paul ascending: \"I know a man in Christ fourteen years ago was caught up into the third heaven (whether in the body, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth), and that he heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.\"[fn-5-P554_249044:33-nf] You have heard him ascending, hear him descending: \"I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal; as babes in Christ I have fed you with milk, not with meat.\"[fn-5-P555_249246:34-nf] Behold he descended who had ascended. Ask whether he ascended to the third heaven. Ask whether he descended to give milk to babes. Hear that he descended: \"I became a babe in the midst of you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children.\"[fn-5-P556_249505:35-nf] For we see both nurses and mothers descend to babes, and although they be able to speak Latin, they shorten the words, shake their tongues in a certain manner, in order to frame childish endearments from a methodical language; because if they speak according to rule, the infant does not understand nor profit. And if there be a father well skilled in speaking, and such an orator that the forum resounds with his eloquence, and the judgment-seats shake, if he have a little son, on his return home he puts aside the forensic eloquence to which he had ascended, and in child's language descends to his little one. Hear in one place the apostle himself ascending and descending inthe same sentence: \"For whether,\" says he,\"we be beside ourselves, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. \"[fn-5-P557_250335:36-nf] What is \"we are beside ourselves \"? Thatwe see those things which it is not lawful for a man to speak. What is \"we are sober for your cause?

Thus Jacob has two free wives; for both are daughters of the remission of sins, or of whitening, that is, of Laban. One is loved, the other is borne. But she that is borne is the most and the soonest fruitful, that she may be loved, if not for herself, at least for her children. For the toil of the righteous is specially fruitful in those whom they beget for the kingdom of God, by preaching the gospel amid many trials and temptations; and they call those their joy and crown[fn-21-P2161_1293596:89-nf] for whom they are in labors more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often,[fn-21-P2162_1293702:90-nf] -for whom they have fightings without and fears within.[fn-21-P2163_1293778:91-nf] Such births result most easily and plentifully from the word of faith, the preaching of Christ crucified, which speaks also of His human nature as far as it can be easily understood, so as not to hurt the weak eyes of Leah. Rachel, again, with clear eye, is beside herself to God,[fn-21-P2164_1294079:92-nf] and sees in the beginning the Word of God with God, and wishes to bring forth, but cannot; for who shall declare His generation? So the life devoted to contemplation, in order to see with no feeble mental eye things invisible to flesh, but understood by the things that are made, and to discern the ineffable manifestation of the eternal power and divinity of God, seeks leisure from all occupation, and is therefore barren. In this habit of retirement, where the fire of meditation burns bright, there is a want of sympathy with human weakness, and with the need men have of our help in their calamities. This life also burns with the desire for children (for it wishes to teach what it knows, and not to go with the corruption of envy[fn-21-P2165_1294835:93-nf] ), and sees its sister-life fully occupied with work and with bringing forth; and it grieves that men run after that virtue which cares for their wants and weaknesses, instead of that which has a divine imperishable lesson to impart. This is what is meant when it is said, \"Rachel envied her sister.\"[fn-21-P2166_1295155:94-nf] Moreover, as the pure intellectual perception of that which is not matter, and so is not the object of the bodliy sense, cannot be expressed in words which spring from the flesh, the doctrine of wisdom prefers to get some lodging for divine truth in the mind by whatever material figures and illustrations occur, rather than to give up teaching these things; and thus Rachel preferred that her husband should have children by her handmaid, rather than that she should be without any children. Bilhah, the name of her handmaid, is said to mean old; and so, even when we speak of the spiritual and unchangeable nature of God, ideas are suggested relating to the old life of the bodily senses.","title":"Book XXII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":5,"source_code":"npnf2_10_npnf2_10_29_the_book_concerning_the_mysteries_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"67","folder":"NPNF2-10","text":"42.

These four are, as it were, the elements of the faith of the Church, out of which elements the whole world which is reconciled to God in Christ is put together; as Paul says,[fn-61-P6133_937094:23-nf] \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself; \"of which world Jesus bore the sin; for it is of the world of the Church that the word is written,[fn-61-P6134_937266:24-nf] \"Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.\" The Gospels then being four, I deem the first fruits of the Gospels to be that which you[fn-61-P6135_937437:25-nf] have enjoined me to search into according to my powers, the Gospel of John, that which speaks of him whose genealogy had already been set forth, but which begins to speak of him at a point before he had any genealogy. For Matthew, writing for the Hebrews who looked for Him who was to come of the line of Abraham and of David, says:[fn-61-P6136_937786:26-nf] \"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.\" And Mark, knowing what he writes, narrates the beginning of the Gospel; we may perhaps find what he aims at in John; in the beginning the Word, God the Word. But Luke, though he says at the beginning of Acts, \"The former treatise did I make about all that Jesus began to do and to teach,\" yet leaves to him who lay on Jesus' breast the greatest and completest discourses about Jesus. For none of these plainly declared His Godhead, as John does when he makes Him say, \"I am the light of the world,\" \"I am the way and the truth and the life,\" \"I am the resurrection, \"I am the door,\" \"I am the good shepherd; \"and in the Apocalypse, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.\" We may therefore make bold to say that the Gospels are the first fruits of all the Scriptures, but that of the Gospels that of John is the first fruits. No one can apprehend the meaning of it except he have lain on Jesus' breast and received from Jesus Mary to be his mother also. Such an one must he become who is to be another John, and to have shown to him, like John, by Jesus Himself Jesus as He is. For if Mary, as those declare who with sound mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and yet Jesus says to His mother, \"Woman, behold thy son,\"[fn-61-P6137_939156:27-nf] and not \"Behold you have this son also,\" then He virtually said to her, \"Lo, this is Jesus, whom thou didst bear.\" Is it not the case that every one who is perfect lives himself no longer,[fn-61-P6138_939364:28-nf] but Christ lives in him; and if Christ lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary, \"Behold thy son Christ.\" What a mind, then, must we have to enable us to interpret in a worthy manner this work, though it be committed to the earthly treasure-house of common speech, of writing which any passer-by can read, and which can be heard when read aloud by any one who lends to it his bodily ears? What shall we say of this work? He who is accurately to apprehend what it contains should be able to say with truth,[fn-61-P6139_939891:29-nf] \"We have the mind of Christ, that we may know those things which are bestowed on us by God.\" It is possible to quote one of Paul's sayings in support of the contention that the whole of the New Testament is Gospel. He writes in a certain place:[fn-61-P6140_940160:30-nf] \"According to my Gospel.\" Now we have no written work of Paul which is commonly called a Gospel. But all that he preached and said was the Gospel; and what he preached and said he was also in the habit of writing, and what he wrote was therefore Gospel. But if what Paul wrote was Gospel, it follows that what Peter wrote was also Gospel, and in a word all that was said or written to perpetuate the knowledge of Christ's sojourn on earth, and to prepare for His second coming, or to bring it about as a present reality in those souls which were willing to receive the Word of God as He stood at the door and knocked and sought to come into them.","title":"Book I","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"anf_06_anf06_125_oration_concerning_simeon_and_anna","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"ANF-06","text":"I.

Come, therefore, Isaiah, most solemn of preachers and greatest of prophets, wisely unfold to the Church the mysteries of the congregation in glory, and incite our excellent guests abundantly, to satiate themselves with enduring dainties, in order that, placing the reality which we possess over against that mirror of thine, truthful prophet as thou art, thou mayest joyfully clap thine hands at the issue of thy predictions. It came to pass, he says, \"in the year in which king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the house was full of His glory. And the seraphim stood round about him: each one had six wings. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of His glory. And the posts of the door were moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said, Woe is me! I am pricked to the heart, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. And one of the seraphim was sent unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. And he touched my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is purged. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I strict, and who will go unto this people? Then said I, Here am I; send me. And He said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, bat understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.\"[fn-60-P6020_1838511:13-nf] These are the proclamations made beforehand by the prophet through the Spirit.

So shalt thou understand the issue of these sacramental[fn-60-P6021_1838763:14-nf] symbols, and know both what and how great this assembling together of ourselves is. And since the prophet has before spoken of this miracle, come thou, and with the greatest ardour and exultation, and alacrity of heart, together with the keenest sagacity of thine intelligence, and therewith approach Bethlehem the renowned, and place before thy mind an image clear and distinct, comparing the prophecy with the actual issue of events. Thou wilt not stand in need of many words to come to a knowledge of the matter; only fix thine eyes on the things which are taking place there. \"All things truly are plain to them that understand, and right to them that find knowledge.\"[fn-60-P6022_1839519:15-nf] For, behold, as a throne high and lifted up by the glory of Him that fashioned it, the virgin-mother is there made ready, and that most evidently for the King, the Lord of hosts. Upon this, consider the Lord now coming unto thee in sinful flesh. Upon this virginal throne, I say, worship Him who now comes to thee by this new and ever-adorable way. Look around thee with the eye of faith, and thou wilt find around Him, as by the ordinance of their courses,[fn-60-P6023_1839997:16-nf] the royal and priestly company of the seraphim. These, as His bodyguard, are ever wont to attend the presence of their king. Whence also in this place they are not only said to hymn with their praises the divine substance of the divine unity, but also the glory to be adored by all of that one of the sacred Trinity, which now, by the appearance of God in the flesh, hath even lighted upon earth. They say: \"The whole earth is full of His glory.\" For we believe that, together with the Son, who was made man for oar sakes, according to the good pleasure of His will,[fn-60-P6024_1840810:17-nf] was also present the Father, who is inseparable from Him as to His divine nature, anal also the Spirit, who is of one and the same essence with Him.[fn-60-P6025_1841170:18-nf] For, as says Paul, the interpreter of the divine oracle,[fn-60-P6026_1841317:19-nf] \"Cod was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.\"[fn-60-P6027_1841636:20-nf] He thus shows that the Father was in the Son, because that one and the same will worked in them.","title":"Oration Concerning Simeon and Anna","author":"Methodius"},{"chapter":5,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"32","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Deep indeed will be the thought necessary to understand the surpassing excellence of this grace. It is comprehended in the idea of the Father incorrupt; and here at the outset is a paradox, viz. that virginity is found in Him, Who has a Son and yet without passion has begotten Him. It is included too in the nature of this Only-begotten God, Who struck the first note of all this moral innocence; it shines forth equally in His pure and passionless generation. Again a paradox; that the Son should be known to us by virginity. It is seen, too, in the inherent and incorruptible purity of the Holy Spirit; for when you have named the pure and incorruptible you have named virginity. It accompanies the whole supramundane existence; because of its passionlessness it is always present with the powers above; never separated from aught that is Divine, it never touches the opposite of this. All whose instinct and will have found their level in virtue are beautified with this perfect purity of the uncorrupted state; all who are ranked in the opposite class of character are what they are, and are called so, by reason of their fall from purity. What force of expression, then, will be adequate to such a grace? How can there be no cause to fear lest the greatness of its intrinsic value should be impaired by the efforts of any one's eloquence? The estimate of it which he will create will be less than that which his hearers had before. It will be well, then, to omit all laudation in this case; we cannot lift words to the height of our theme. On the contrary, it is possible to be ever mindful of this gift of God; and our lips may always speak of this blessing; that, though it is the property of spiritual existence and of such singular excellence, yet by the love of God it has been bestowed on those who have received their life from the will of the flesh and from blood; that, when human nature has been based by passionate inclinations, it stretches out its offer of purity like a hand to raise it up again and make it look above. This, I think, was the reason why our Master, Jesus Christ Himself, the Fountain of all innocence, did not come into the world by wedlock. It was, to divulge by the manner of His Incarnation this great secret; that purity is the only complete indication[fn-26-P2656_1807171:5-nf] of the presence of God and of His coming, and that no one can in reality secure this for himself, unless he has altogether estranged himself from the passions of the flesh. What happened in the stainless Mary when the fulness of the Godhead which was in Christ shone out through her, that happens in every soul that leads by rule the virgin life. No longer indeed does the Master come with bodily presence; \"we know Christ no longer according to the flesh[fn-26-P2657_1807753:6-nf] \"; but, spiritually, He dwells in us and brings His Father with Him, as the Gospel somewhere[fn-26-P2658_1807863:7-nf] tells. Seeing, then, that virginity means so much as this, that while it remains in Heaven with the Father of spirits, and moves in the dance of the celestial powers, it nevertheless stretches out hands for man's salvation; that while it is the channel which draws down the Deity to share man's estate, it keeps wings for man's desires to rise to heavenly things, and is a bond of union between the Divine and human, by its mediation bringing into harmony these existences so widely divided-what words could be discovered powerful enough to reach this wondrous height? But still, it is monstrous to seem like creatures without expression and without feeling; and we must choose (if we are silent) one of two things; either to appear never to have felt the special beauty of virginity, or to exhibit ourselves as obstinately blind to all beauty: we have consented therefore to speak briefly about this virtue, according to the wish of him who has assigned us this task, and whom in all things we must obey. But let no one expect from us any display of style; even if we wished it, perhaps we could not produce it, for we are quite unversed in that kind of writing. Even if we possessed such power, we would not prefer the favour of the few to the edification of the many. A writer of sense should have, I take it, for his chiefest object not to be admired above all other writers, but to profit both himself and them, the many.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_31_on_virginity","source_chapter":6,"source_paragraph":"38","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"But we need no lodger show in this narrow way the drawback of this life, as if the number of its ills was limited to adulteries, dissensions, and plots. I think we should take the higher and truer view, and say at once that none of that evil in life, which is visible in all its business and in all its pursuits, can have any hold over a man, if he will not put himself in the fetters of this course. The truth of what we say will be clear thus. A man who, seeing through the illusion with the eye of his spirit purged, lifts himself above the struggling world, and, to use the words of the Apostle, slights it all as but dung, in a way exiling himself altogether from human life by his abstinence from marriage,-that man has no fellowship whatever with the sins of mankind, such as avarice, envy, anger, hatred, and everything of the kind. He has an exemption from all this, and is in every way free and at peace; there is nothing in him to provoke his neighbours' envy, because he clutches none of those objects round which envy in this life gathers. He has raised his own life above the world, and prizing virtue as his only precious possession he will pass his days in painless peace and quiet. For virtue is a possession which, though all according to their capacity should share it, yet will be always in abundance for those who thirst after it; unlike the occupation of the lands on this earth, which men divide into sections, and the more they add to the one the more they take from the other, so that the one person's gain is his fellow's loss; whence arise the fights for the lion's share, from men's hatred of being cheated. But the larger owner of this possession is never envied; he who snatches the lion's share does no damage to him who claims equal participation; as each is capable each has this noble longing satisfied, while the wealth of virtues in those who are already occupiers[fn-26-P2676_1829327:17-nf] is not exhausted. The man, then, who, with his eyes only on such a life, makes virtue, which has no limit that man can devise, his only treasure, will surely never brook to bend his soul to any of those low courses which multitudes tread. He will not admire earthly riches, or human power, or any of those things which folly seeks. If, indeed, his mind is still pitched so low, he is outside our band of novices, and our words do not apply to him. But if his thoughts are above, walking as it were with God, he will be lifted out of the maze of all these errors; for the predisposing cause of them all, marriage, has not touched him. Now the wish to be before others is the deadly sin of pride, and one would not be far wrong in saying that this is the seed-root of all the thorns of sin; but it is from reasons connected with marriage that this pride mostly begins. To show what I mean, we generally find the grasping man throwing the blame on his nearest kin; the man mad after notoriety and ambition generally makes his family responsible for this sin: \"he must not be thought inferior to his forefathers; he must be deemed a great man by the generation to come by leaving his children historic records of himself\": so also the other maladies of the soul, envy, spite, hatred and such-like, are connected with this cause; they are to be found amongst those who are eager about the things of this life. He who has fled from it gazes as from some high watch-tower on the prospect of humanity, and pities these slaves of vanity for their blindness in setting such a value on bodily well-being. He sees some distinguished person giving himself airs because of his public honours, and wealth, and power, and only laughs at the folly of being so puffed up. He gives to the years of human life the longest number, according to the Psalmist's computation, and then compares this atom-interval with the endless ages, and pities the vain glory of those who excite themselves for such low and petty and perishable things. What, indeed, amongst the things here is there enviable in that which so many strive for,-honour? What is gained by those who win it? The mortal remains mortal whether he is honoured or not. What good does the possessor of many acres gain in the end? Except that the foolish man thinks his own that which never belongs to him, ignorant seemingly in his greed that \"the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof[fn-26-P2677_1831903:18-nf] ,\" for \"God is king of all the earth[fn-26-P2678_1831972:19-nf] .\" It is the passion of having which gives men a false title of lordship over that which can never belong to them. \"The earth,\" says the wise Preacher, \"abideth for ever[fn-26-P2679_1832174:20-nf] ,\" ministering to every generation, first one, then another, that is born upon it; but men, though they are so little even their own masters, that they are brought into life without knowing it by their Maker's will, and before they wish are withdrawn from it, nevertheless in their excessive vanity think that they are her lords; that they, now born, now dying, rule that which remains continually. One who reflecting on this holds cheaply all that mankind prizes, whose only love is the divine life, because \"all flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass[fn-26-P2680_1832771:21-nf] ,\" can never care for this grass which \"to-day is and to-morrow is not\"; studying the divine ways, he knows not only that human life has no fixity, but that the entire universe will not keep on its quiet course for ever; he neglects his existence here as an alien and a passing thing; for the Saviour said, \"Heaven and earth shall pass away[fn-26-P2681_1833131:22-nf] ,\" the whole of necessity awaits its refashioning. As long as he is \"in this tabernacle[fn-26-P2682_1833243:23-nf] .\" exhibiting mortality, weighed down with this existence, he laments the lengthening of his sojourn in it; as the Psalmist-poet says in his heavenly songs. Truly, they live in darkness who sojourn in these living tabernacles; wherefore that preacher, groaning at the continuance of this sojourn, says, \"Woe is me that my sojourn is prolonged[fn-26-P2683_1833604:24-nf] ,\" and he attributes the cause of his dejection to \"darkness\"; for we know that darkness is called in the Hebrew language \"kedar.\" It is indeed a darkness as of the night which envelops mankind, and prevents them seeing this deceit and knowing that all which is most prized by the living, and moreover all which is the reverse, exists only in the conception of the unreflecting, and is in itself nothing; there is no such reality anywhere as obscurity of birth, or illustrious birth, or glory, or splendour, or ancient renown, or present elevation, or power over others, or subjection. Wealth and comfort, poverty and distress, and all the other inequalities of life, seem to the ignorant, applying the test of pleasure, vastly different from each other. But to the higher understanding they are all alike; one is not of greater value than the other; because life runs on to the finish with the same speed through all these opposites, and in the lots of either class there remains the same power of choice to live well or ill, \"through armour on the right hand and on the left, through evil report and good report[fn-26-P2684_1834749:25-nf] .\" Therefore the clearseeing mind which measures reality will journey on its path without turning, accomplishing its appointed time from its birth to its exit; it is neither softened by the pleasures nor beaten down by the hardships; but, as is the way with travellers, it keeps advancing always, and takes but little notice of the views presented. It is the travellers way to press on to their journey's end, no matter whether they are passing through meadows and cultivated farms, or through wilder and more rugged spots; a smiling landscape does not detain them; nor a gloomy one check their speed. So, too, that lofty mind will press straight on to its self-imposed end, not turning aside to see anything on the way. It passes through life, but its gaze is fixed on heaven; it is the good steersman directing the bark to some landmark there. But the grosser mind looks down; it bends its energies to bodily pleasures as surely as the sheep stoop to their pasture; it lives for gorging and still lower pleasures[fn-26-P2685_1835784:26-nf] ; it is alienated from the life of God[fn-26-P2686_1836001:27-nf] , and a stranger to the promise of the Covenants; it recognizes no good but the gratification of the body. It is a mind such as this that \"walks in darkness[fn-26-P2687_1836188:28-nf] ,\" and invents all the evil in this life of ours; avarice, passions unchecked, unbounded luxury, lust of power, vain-glory, the whole mob of moral diseases that invade men's homes. In these vices, one somehow holds closely to another; where one has entered all the rest seem to follow, dragging each other in a natural order, just as in a chain, when you have jerked the first link, the others cannot rest, and even the link at the other end feels the motion of the first, which passes thence by virtue of their contiguity through the intervening links; so firmly are men's vices linked together by their very nature; when one of them has gained the mastery of a soul, the rest of the train follow. If you want a graphic picture of this accursed chain, suppose a man who because of some special pleasure it gives him is a victim to his thirst for fame; then a desire to increase his fortune follows close upon this thirst for fame; he becomes grasping; but only because the first vice leads him on to this. Then this grasping after money and superiority engenders either anger with his kith and kin, or pride towards his inferiors, or envy of those above him; then hypocrisy comes in after this envy; a soured temper after that; a misanthropical spirit after that; and behind them all a state of condemnation which ends in the dark fires of hell. You see the chain; how all follows from one cherished passion. Seeing, then, that this inseparable train of moral diseases has entered once for all into the world, one single way of escape is pointed out to us in the exhortations of the inspired writings; and that is to separate ourselves from the life which involves this sequence of sufferings. If we haunt Sodom, we cannot escape the rain of fire; nor if one who has fled out of her looks back upon her desolation, can he fail to become a pillar of salt rooted to the spot. We cannot be rid of the Egyptian bondage, unless we leave Egypt, that is, this life that lies under water[fn-26-P2688_1838191:29-nf] , and pass, not that Red Sea, but this black and gloomy Sea of life. But suppose we remain in this evil bondage, and, to use the Master's words, \"the truth shall not have made us free,\" how can one who seeks a lie and wanders in the maze of this world ever come to the truth? How can one who has surrendered his existence to be chained by nature run away from this captivity? An illustration will make our meaning clearer. A winter torrent[fn-26-P2689_1838684:30-nf] , which, impetuous in itself, becomes swollen and carries down beneath its stream trees and boulders and anything that comes in its way, is death and danger to those alone who live along its course; for those who have got well out of its way it rages in vain. Just so, only the man who lives in the turmoil of life has to feel its force; only he has to receive those sufferings which nature's stream, descending in a flood of troubles, must, to be true to its kind, bring to those who journey on its banks. But if a man leaves this torrent, and these \"proud waters[fn-26-P2690_1839268:31-nf] ,\" he will escape from being \"a prey to the teeth\" of this life, as the Psalm goes on to say, and, as \"a bird from the snare,\" on virtue's wings. This simile, then, of the torrent holds; human life is a tossing and tumultuous stream sweeping down to find its natural level; none of the objects sought for in it last till the seekers are satisfied; all that is carried to them by this stream comes near, just touches them, and passes on; so that the present moment in this impetuous flow eludes enjoyment, for the after-current snatches it from their view. It would be our interest therefore to keep far away from such a stream, lest, engaged on temporal things, we should neglect eternity. How can a man keep for ever anything here, be his love for it never so passionate? Which of life's most cherished objects endures always? What flower of prime? What gift of strength and beauty? What wealth, or fame, or power? They all have their transient bloom, and then melt away into their opposites. Who can continue in life's prime? Whose strength lasts for ever? Has not Nature made the bloom of beauty even more shortlived than the shows of spring? For they blossom in their season, and after withering for a while again revive; after another shedding they are again in leaf, and retain their beauty of to-day to a late prime. But Nature exhibits the human bloom only in the spring of early life; then she kills it; it is vanished in the frosts of age. All other delights also deceive the bodily eye for a time, and then pass behind the veil of oblivion. Nature's inevitable changes are many; they agonize him whose love is passionate. One way of escape is open: it is, to be attached to none of these things, and to get as far away as possible from the society of this emotional and sensual world; or rather, for a man to go outside the feelings which his own body gives rise to. Then, as he does not live for the flesh, he will not be subject to the troubles of the flesh. But this amounts to living for the spirit only, and imitating all we can the employment of the world of spirits. There they neither marry, nor are given in marriage. Their work and their excellence is to contemplate the Father of all purity, and to beautify the lines of their own character from the Source of all beauty, so far as imitation of It is possible.","title":"On Virginity","author":"Gregory of Nyssa"},{"chapter":5,"verse":21,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_36_book_i_","source_chapter":25,"source_paragraph":"90","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"For when he says also, \"Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\"[fn-51-P5151_2023518:57-nf] who can deny that when the apostle said this he was still in the body of this death? And certainly the wicked are not delivered from this, to whom the same bodies are returned for eternal torment. Therefore, to be delivered from the body of this death is to be healed of all the weakness of fleshly lust, and to receive the body, not for penalty, but for glory. With this passage also those words are sufficiently in harmony: \"Ourselves also, which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption, of our body.\" For surely we groan with that groaning wherein we say, \"O wretched man that I am I who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\" That also where he says, \"For what I do, I know not;\" what else is it than: \"I will not, I do not approve, I do not consent, I do not do\"?

Whosoever then wish their good works to be so seen of men, that He may be glorified from whom they have received those things which are seen in them, and that thereby those very persons who see them, may through the dutifulness[fn-32-P3252_1424592:16-nf] of faith be provoked to imitate the good, their light shines truly before men, because there beams forth from them the light of charity; theirs is no mere empty fume of pride; and in the very act they take precautions, that they do not their righteousness before men to be seen of them, in that they do not reckon that righteousness as their own, nor do they therefore do it that they may be seen; but that He may be made known, who is praised in them that are justified, that so He may bring to pass in him that praises that which is praised in others, that is, that He may make him that praises to be himself the object of praise. Observe the Apostle too, how that when he had said, \"Please all men in all things, as I also please all men in all things;\"[fn-32-P3253_1425363:17-nf] he did not stop there, as if he had placed in that, namely, the pleasing men, the end of his intention; for else he would have said falsely, \"If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ;\" but he subjoined immediately why it was that he pleased men; \"Not seeking,\" saith he, \"mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.\"[fn-32-P3254_1425740:18-nf] So he at once did not please men for his own profit, lest he should not be \"the servant of Christ;\" and he did please men for their salvation's sake, that he might be a faithful Minister of Christ; because for him his own conscience in the sight of God was enough, and from him there shined forth in the sight of men something which they might imitate.","title":"Sermon IV.

Could it not be said of Him also that \"He is light, and that there is no darkness in Him\"? The difference between the two cases has been partly set forth above. We will now, however, go a step further than we did before, and add, that if God made Christ who knew no sin to be sin for us,[fn-65-P6562_1125652:77-nf] then it could not be said of Him that there was no darkness in Him. For if Jesus was in the likeness[fn-65-P6563_1125772:78-nf] of the flesh of sin and for sin, and condemned sin by taking ripen Him the likeness of the flesh of sin, then it cannot be said of Him, absolutely and directly, that there was no darkness in Him. We may add that \"He[fn-65-P6564_1126007:79-nf] took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses,\" both infirmities of the soul and sicknesses of the hidden man of our heart. On account of these infirmities and sicknesses which He bore away from us, He declares His soul to be sorrowful and sore troubled,[fn-65-P6565_1126282:80-nf] and He is said in Zechariah to have put on filthy garments,[fn-65-P6566_1126363:81-nf] which, when He was about to take them off, are said to be sins. \"Behold, it is said, I have taken away thy sins.\" Because He had taken on Himself the sins of the people of those who believed in Him, he uses many such expressions as these: \"Far from my salvation are the words of my transgressions,\"[fn-65-P6567_1126681:82-nf] and \"Thou knowest my foolishness, and my sins were not hid from Thee.\"[fn-65-P6568_1126770:83-nf] And let no one suppose that we say this from any lack of piety towards the Christ of God; for as the Father alone has immortality and our Lord took upon Himself. for His love to men, the death He died for us, so to the Father alone the words apply, \"In Him is no darkness,\" since Christ took upon Himself, for His goodwill towards men, our darknesses. This He did, that by His power He might destroy our death and remove the darkness which is in our soul, so that the saying in Isaiah might be fulfilled,[fn-65-P6569_1127293:84-nf] \"The people that sat in darkness saw a great light.\" This light, which came into being in the Logos, and is also life, shines in the darkness of our souls, and it has come where the rulers of this darkness carry on their struggle with the race of men and strive to subdue to darkness those who do not stand firm with all their power; that they might be enlightened the light has come so far, and that they might be called sons of light.

For when he adds, \"This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality,\"[fn-100-P10080_2806047:275-nf] this will assuredly be that house from heaven, with which we so earnestly desire to be clothed upon, whilst groaning in this our present body,-meaning, of course, over this flesh in which we shall be surprised at last; because he says that we are burdened whilst in this tabernacle, which we do not wish indeed to be stripped of, but rather to be in it clothed over, in such a way that mortality may be swallowed up of life, that is, by putting on over us whilst we are transformed that vestiture which is from heaven. For who is there that will not desire, while he is in the flesh, to put on immortality, and to continue his life by a happy escape from death, through the transformation which must be experienced instead of it, without encountering too that Hades which will exact the very last farthing?[fn-100-P10081_2806879:276-nf] Notwithstanding, he who has already traversed Hades is destined also to obtain the change after the resurrection. For from this circumstance it is that we definitively declare that the flesh will by all means rise again, and, from the change that is to come over it, will assume the condition of angels. Now, if it were merely in the case of those who shall be found in the flesh that the change must be undergone, in order that mortality may be swallowed up of life-in other words, that the flesh (be covered) with the heavenly and eternal raiment-it would either follow that those who shall be found in death would not obtain life, deprived as they would then be of the material and so to say the aliment of life, that is, the flesh; or else, these also must needs undergo the change, that in them too mortality may be swallowed up of life, since it is appointed that they too should obtain life. But, you say, in the case of the dead, mortality is already swallowed up of life. No, not in all cases, certainly. For how many will most probably be found of men who had just died-so recently put into their graves, that nothing in them would seem to be decayed? For you do not of course deem a thing to be decayed unless it be cut off, abolished, and withdrawn from our perception, as having in every possible way ceased to be apparent. There are the carcases of the giants of old time; it will be obvious enough that they are not absolutely decayed, for their bony frames are still extant. We have already spoken of this elsewhere.[fn-100-P10082_2808514:277-nf] For instance,[fn-100-P10083_2808551:278-nf] even lately in this very city,[fn-100-P10084_2808610:279-nf] when they were sacrilegiously laying the foundations of the Odeum on a good many ancient graves, people were horror-stricken to discover, after some five hundred years, bones, which still retained their moisture, and hair which had not lost its perfume. It is certain not only that bones remain indurated, but also that teeth continue undecayed for ages-both of them the lasting germs of that body which is to sprout into life again in the resurrection. Lastly, even if everything that is mortal in all the dead shall then be found decayed-at any rate consumed by death, by time, and through age,-is there nothing which will be \"swallowed up of life,\"[fn-100-P10085_2809279:280-nf] nor by being covered over and arrayed in the vesture of immortality? Now, he who says that mortality is going to be swallowed up of life has already admitted that what is dead is not destroyed by those other before-mentioned devourers. And verily it will be extremely fit that all shall be consummated and brought about by the operations of God, and not by the laws of nature. Therefore, inasmuch as what is mortal has to be swallowed up of life, it must needs be brought out to view in order to be so swallowed up; (needful) also to be swallowed up, in order to undergo the ultimate transformation. If you were to say that a fire is to be lighted, you could not possibly allege that what is to kindle it is sometimes necessary and sometimes not. In like manner, when he inserts the words \"If so be that being unclothed[fn-100-P10086_2810155:281-nf] we be not found naked.\"[fn-100-P10087_2810299:282-nf] -referring, of course, to those who shall not be found in the day of the Lord alive and in the flesh-he did not say that they whom he had just described as unclothed or stripped, were naked in any other sense than meaning that they should be understood to be reinvested with the very same substance they had been divested of. For although they shall be found naked when their flesh has been laid aside, or to some extent sundered or worn away (and this condition may well be called nakedness, ) they shall afterwards recover it again, in order that, being reinvested with the flesh, they may be able also to have put over that the supervestment of immortality; for it will be impossible for the outside garment to fit except over one who is already dressed.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":45,"source_paragraph":"153","folder":"ANF-03","text":"In the same way, when he says, \"Therefore we are always confident, and fully aware, that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord; for we walk by faith, not be sight,\"[fn-100-P10091_2811395:283-nf] it is manifest that in this statement there is no design of disparaging the flesh, as if it separated us from the Lord.

For as \"He has given to us the earnest of the Spirit, \"[fn-102-P10215_2850512:383-nf] so has He received from us the earnest of the flesh, and has carried it with Him into heaven as a pledge of that complete entirety which is one day to be restored to it. Be not disquieted, O flesh and blood, with any care; in Christ you have acquired both heaven and the kingdom of God. Otherwise, if they say that you are not in Christ, let them also say that Christ is not in heaven, since they have denied you heaven. Likewise \"neither shall corruption,\" says he, \"inherit incorruption.[fn-102-P10216_2851022:384-nf] This he says, not that you may take flesh and blood to be corruption, for they are themselves rather the subjects of corruption,-I mean through death, since death does not so much corrupt, as actually consume, our flesh and blood. But inasmuch as he had plainly said that the works of the flesh and blood could not obtain the kingdom of God, with the view of stating this with accumulated stress, he deprived corruption itself-that is, death, which profits so largely by the works of the flesh and blood-from all inheritance of incorruption. For a little afterwards, he has described what is, as it were, the death of death itself: \"Death,\" says he, \"is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin \"-here is the corruption; \"and the strength of sin is the law\"[fn-102-P10217_2851872:385-nf] -that other law, no doubt, which he has described \"in his members as warring against the law of his mind,\"[fn-102-P10218_2852004:386-nf] -meaning, of course, the actual power of sinning against his will. Now he says in a previous passage (of our Epistle to the Corinthians), that \"the last enemy to be destroyed is death.\"[fn-102-P10219_2852211:387-nf] In this way, then, it is that corruption shall not inherit incorruption; in other words, death shall not continue. When and how shall it cease? In that \"moment, that twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, when the dead shall rise incorruptible.\"[fn-102-P10220_2852480:388-nf] But what are these, if not they who were corruptible before-that is, our bodies; in other words, our flesh and blood? And we undergo the change. But in what condition, if not in that wherein we shall be found? \"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.\"[fn-102-P10221_2852796:389-nf] What mortal is this but the flesh? what corruptible but the blood. Moreover, that you may not suppose the apostle to have any other meaning, in his care to teach you, and that you may understand him seriously to apply his statement to the flesh, when he says \"this corruptible\" and \"this mortal,\" he utters the words while touching the surface of his own body.[fn-102-P10222_2853174:390-nf] He certainly could not have pronounced these phrases except in reference to an object which was palpable and apparent. The expression indicates a bodily exhibition. Moreover, a corruptible body is one thing, and corruption is another; so a mortal body is one thing, and mortality is another. For that which suffers is one thing, and that which causes it to suffer is another.

But how is it swallowed up of life, (in the sense of destroyed by it) when it is actually received, and restored, and included in it? For the rest, it is only just and right that death should be swallowed up in utter destruction, since it does itself devour with this same intent. Death, says the apostle, has devoured by exercising its strength, and therefore has been itself devoured in the struggle \"swallowed up in victory.\"[fn-102-P10262_2870308:420-nf] \"O death, where is thy sting? O death, where is thy victory? \"[fn-102-P10263_2870387:421-nf] Therefore life, too, as the great antagonist of death, will in the struggle swallow up for salvation what death, in its struggle, had swallowed up for destruction.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_03_anf03_41_on_the_resurrection_of_the_flesh_","source_chapter":62,"source_paragraph":"188","folder":"ANF-03","text":"But behold how persistently they still accumulate their cavils against the flesh, especially against its identity, deriving their arguments even from the functions of our limbs; on the one hand saying that these ought to continue permanently pursuing their labours and enjoyments, as appendages to the same corporeal frame; and on the other hand contending that, inasmuch as the functions of the limbs shall one day come to an end, the bodily frame itself must be destroyed, its permanence without its limbs being deemed to be as inconceivable, as that of the limbs themselves without their functions! What, they ask, will then be the use of the cavity of our mouth, and its rows of teeth, and the passage of the throat, and the branch-way of the stomach, and the gulf of the belly, and the entangled tissue of the bowels, when there shall no longer be room for eating and drinking? What more will there be for these members to take in, masticate, swallow, secrete, digest, eject?

In reply to all this, we have then already settled the principle that the dispensation of the future state ought not to be compared with that of the present world, and that in the interval between them a change will take place; and we now add the remark, that these functions of our bodily limbs will continue to supply the needs of this life up to the moment when life itself shall pass away from time to eternity, as the natural body gives place to the spiritual, until \"this mortal puts on immorality, and this corruptible puts on incorruption: \"[fn-103-P10324_2890912:464-nf] so that when life shall itself become freed from all wants, our limbs shall then be freed also from their services, and therefore will be no longer wanted.

Entire, however, he cannot be without his limbs, of the substance of which, not the functions, he consists; unless, forsooth, you will be bold enough to maintain that a ship is perfect without her keel, or her bow, or her stern, and without the solidity of her entire t frame. And yet how often have we seen the same ship, after being shattered with the storm and broken by decay, with all her timbers repaired and restored, gallantly riding on the wave in all the beauty of a renewed fabric! Do we then disquiet ourselves with doubt about God's skill, and will, and rights? Besides, if a wealthy shipowner, who does not grudge money merely for his amusement or show, thoroughly repairs his ship, and then chooses that she should make no further voyages, will you contend that the old form and finish is still not necessary to the vessel, although she is no longer meant for actual service, when the mere safety of a ship requires such completeness irrespective of service? The sole question, therefore, which is enough for us to consider here, is whether the Lord, when He ordains salvation for man, intends it for his flesh; whether it is His will that the selfsame flesh shall be renewed. If so, it will be improper for you to rule, from the in utility of its limbs in the future state, that the flesh will be incapable of renovation. For a thing may be renewed, and yet be useless from having nothing to do; but it cannot be said to be useless if it has no existence. If, indeed, it has existence, it will be quite possible for it also not to be useless; it may possibly have something to do; for in the presence of God there will be no idleness.","title":"On the Resurrection of the Flesh.","author":"Tertullian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":20,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_38_book_iii_","source_chapter":18,"source_paragraph":"60","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"They have not a righteous advocate, who are (even if that were the only difference) distinguished absolutely and widely from the righteous.

For there are whom these things aid nothing at all, namely, when\nthey are done either for persons whose merits are so evil, that neither by such things are they\nworthy to be aided; or for persons whose merits are so good, that of such things they have no need as\naids. Of the kind of life, therefore, which each hath led by the body, doth it come, that these\nthings profit or profit not, whatever are piously done on his behalf when he has left the body. For\ntouching merit whereby these things profit, if none have been gotten in this life, it is in vain\nsought after this life. So it comes to pass as well that not unmeaningly[fn-48-P4846_2378469:6-nf] doth the Church, or care of friends, bestow upon\nthe departed whatever of religion it shall be able; as also that, nevertheless, each receiveth\n\"according to the things which he hath done by the body, whether it be good or bad,\" the Lord\nrendering unto each according to his works. For, that this which is bestowed should be capable of\nprofiting him after the body, this was acquired in that life which he hath led in the body.","title":"On Care to Be Had for the Dead.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"npnf1_05_npnf1_05_39_book_iv_","source_chapter":4,"source_paragraph":"52","folder":"NPNF1-05","text":"In the praise of the saints they conceal themselves, saying \"that baptism perfectly renews men, inasmuch as the apostle is a witness whotestifies that, by the washing of water, the Church is made out of the heathen holy and spotless;[fn-55-P5574_2191802:3-nf] that the Holy Spirit also assisted pious souls in ancient times, even as the prophet says to God, 'Thy good Spirit shall lead me into the right way;'[fn-55-P5575_2191967:4-nf] that all the prophets, moreover, and apostles or saints, as well of the New as of the Old Testament, to whom God gives witness, were righteous, not in comparison with the wicked, but by the rule of virtue; and that in future time there is a reward as well of good works as of evil.

But \"the Son of man shall come in the glory of His own Father\" not alone, but \"with His own angels.\" And if you can conceive of all those who are fellow-helpers in the glory of the Word, and in the revelation of the Wisdom which is Christ, coming along with Him, you will see in what way the Son of man comes in the glory of His own Father with His own angels. And consider whether you cad in this connection say that the prophets who formerly suffered in virtue of their word having \"no form or beauty\" had an analogous position to the Word who had \"no form or beauty.\" And, as the Son of man comes in the glory of His own Father, so the angels, who are the words in the prophets, are present with Him preserving the measure of their own glory. But when the Word comes in such form with His own angels, He will give to each a part of His own glory and of the brightness of His own angels, according to the action of each.

For we know not what may happen on the coming day; nor must any one be despaired of before the end of this life; nor can God be contradicted, that He may not look down and give repentance, and receive the sacrifice of a troubled spirit and a contrite heart, and absolve from the guilt of condemnation, however just, and so Himself not condemn the condemned person. Yet the necessity of the pastoral office requires, in order that the terrible contagion may not creep through the many, that the diseased sheep should be separated from the sound ones; perchance, by that very separation, to be healed by Him to whom nothing is impossible. For as we know not who belongs to the number of the predestinated, we ought in such wise to be influenced by the affection of love as to will all men to be saved. For this is the case when we endeavour to lead every individual to that point where they may meet with those agencies by which we may prevail, to the accomplishment of the result, that being justified by faith they may have peace with God,[fn-66-P6623_2527116:165-nf] - which peace, moreover, the apostle announced when he said, \"Therefore, we discharge an embassage for Christ, as though God were exhorting by us, we pray you in Christ's stead to be reconciled to God.\"[fn-66-P6624_2527337:166-nf] For what is \"to be reconciled\" to Him but to have peace with Him?

For it was not said, Upon whomsoever your peace shall rest, he shall become a son of peace; but Christ says, \"If the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon that house.\" Already, therefore, and before the announcement of that peace to him, the son of peace was there, as he had been known and foreknown, by-not the evangelist, but-God. For we need not fear lest we should lose it, if in our ignorance he to whom we preach is not a son of peace, for it will return to us again-that is, that preaching will profit us, and not him; but if the peace proclaimed shall rest upon him, it will profit both us and him.","title":"Treatise on Rebuke and Grace","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":4,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_37_on_the_soul_and_the_resurrection","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"138","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"\"It is sown,\" he says, \"in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.\" The grain of wheat, after its dissolution in the soil, leaves behind the slightness of its bulk and the peculiar quality of its shape, and yet it has not left and lost itself, but, still self-centred, grows into the ear, though in many points it has made an advance upon itself, viz. in size, in splendour, in complexity, in form. In the same fashion the human being deposits in death all those peculiar surroundings which it has acquired from passionate propensities; dishonour, I mean, and corruption and weakness and characteristics of age; and yet the human being does not lose itself. It changes into an ear of corn as it were; into incorruption, that is, and glory and honour and power and absolute perfection; into a condition in which its life is no longer carried on in the ways peculiar to mere nature, but has passed into a spiritual and passionless existence. For it is the peculiarity of the natural body to be always moving on a stream, to be always altering from its state for the moment and changing into something else; but none of these processes, which we observe not in man only but also in plants and brutes will be found remaining in the life that shall be then. Further, it seems to me that the words of the Apostle in every respect harmonize with our own conception of what the Resurrection is. They indicate the very same thing that we have embodied in our own definition of it, wherein we said that the Resurrection is no other thing than \"the re-constitution of our nature in its original form.\" For, whereas we learn from Scripture in the account of the first Creation[fn-37-P3782_2480864:178-nf] , that first the earth brought forth \"the green herb\" (as the narrative says), and that then from this plant seed was yielded, from which, when it was shed on the ground, the same form of the original plant again sprang up, the Apostle, it is to be observed, declares that this very same thing happens in the Resurrection also; and so we learn from him the fact, not only[fn-37-P3783_2481496:179-nf] that our humanity will be then changed into something nobler, but also that what we have therein to expect is nothing else than that which was at the beginning. In the beginning, we see, it was not an ear rising from a grain, but a grain coming from an ear, and, after that, the ear grows round the grain: and so the order indicated in this similitude[fn-37-P3784_2481922:180-nf] clearly shows that all that blessed state, which arises for us by means of the Resurrection is only a return to our pristine state of grace. We too, in fact, were once in a fashion a full ear[fn-37-P3785_2482161:181-nf] ; but the burning heat of sin withered us up, and then on our dissolution by death the earth received us: but in the spring of the Resurrection she will reproduce this naked grain[fn-37-P3786_2482423:182-nf] of our body in the form of an ear, tall, well-proportioned, and erect, reaching to the heights of heaven, and, for blade and beard, resplendent in incorruption, and with all the other godlike marks. For \"this corruptible must put on incorruption\"; and this incorruption and glory and honour and power are those distinct and acknowledged marks of Deity which once belonged to him who was created in God's image, and which we hope for hereafter. The first man Adam, that is, was the first ear; but with the arrival of evil human nature was diminished into a mere multitude[fn-37-P3787_2485432:183-nf] ; and, as happens to the grain[fn-37-P3788_2485769:184-nf] on the ear, each individual man was denuded of the beauty of that primal ear, and mouldered in the soil: but in the Resurrection we are born again in our original splendour; only instead of that single primitive ear we become the countless myriads of ears in the cornfields. The virtuous life as contrasted with that of vice is distinguished thus: those who while living have by virtuous conduct exercised husbandry on themselves are at once revealed in all the qualities of a perfect ear, while those whose bare grain (that is the forces of their natural soul) has become through evil habits degenerate, as it were, and hardened by the weather (as the so-called \"hornstruck\" seeds[fn-37-P3789_2486568:185-nf] , according to the experts in such things, grow up), will, though they live again in the Resurrection, experience very great severity from their Judge, because they do not possess the strength to shoot up into the full proportions of an ear, and thereby become that which we were before our earthly fall[fn-37-P3790_2487708:186-nf] . The remedy offered by the Overseer of the produce is to collect together the tares and the thorns, which have grown up with the good seed, and into whose bastard life all the secret forces that once nourished its root have passed, so that it not only has had to remain without its nutriment, but has been choked and so rendered unproductive by this unnatural growth. When from the nutritive part within them everything that is the reverse or the counterfeit of it has been picked out, and has been committed to the fire that consumes everything unnatural, and so has disappeared, then in this class also their humanity will thrive and will ripen into fruit-bearing, owing to such husbandry, and some day after long courses of ages will get back again that universal form which God stamped upon us at the beginning. Blessed are they, indeed, in whom the full beauty of those ears shall be developed directly they are born in the Resurrection. Yet we say this without implying that any merely bodily distinctions will be manifest between those who have lived virtuously and those who have lived viciously in this life, as if we ought to think that one will be imperfect as regards his material frame, while another will win perfection as regards it. The prisoner and the free, here in this present world, are just alike as regards the constitutions of their two bodies; though as regards enjoyment and suffering the gulf is wide between them. In this way, I take it, should we reckon the difference between the good and the bad in that intervening time[fn-37-P3791_2489680:187-nf] . For the perfection of bodies that rise from that sowing of death is, as the Apostle tells us, to consist in incorruption and glory and honour and power; but any diminution in such excellences does not denote a corresponding bodily mutilation of him who has risen again, but a withdrawal and estrangement from each one of those things which are conceived of as belonging to the good. Seeing, then, that one or the other of these two diametrically opposed ideas, I mean good and evil, must any way attach to us, it is clear that to say a man is not included in the good is a necessary demonstration that he is included in the evil. But then, in connection with evil, we find no honour, no glory, no incorruption, no power; and so we are forced to dismiss all doubt that a man who has nothing to do with these last-mentioned things must be connected with their opposites, viz. with weakness, with dishonour, with corruption, with everything of that nature, such as we spoke of in the previous parts of the discussion, when we said how many were the passions, sprung from evil, which are so hard for the soul to get rid of, when they have infused themselves into the very substance of its entire nature and become one with it. When such, then, have been purged from it and utterly removed by the healing processes worked out by the Fire, then every one of the things which make up our conception of the good will come to take their place; incorruption, that is, and life, and honour, and grace, and glory, and everything else that we conjecture is to be seen in God, and in His Image, man as he was made.

In the beginning, we see, it was not an ear rising from a grain, but a grain coming from an ear, and, after that, the ear grows round the grain: and so the order indicated in this similitude[fn-37-P3784_2481922:180-nf] clearly shows that all that blessed state, which arises for us by means of the Resurrection is only a return to our pristine state of grace. We too, in fact, were once in a fashion a full ear[fn-37-P3785_2482161:181-nf] ; but the burning heat of sin withered us up, and then on our dissolution by death the earth received us: but in the spring of the Resurrection she will reproduce this naked grain[fn-37-P3786_2482423:182-nf] of our body in the form of an ear, tall, well-proportioned, and erect, reaching to the heights of heaven, and, for blade and beard, resplendent in incorruption, and with all the other godlike marks. For \"this corruptible must put on incorruption\"; and this incorruption and glory and honour and power are those distinct and acknowledged marks of Deity which once belonged to him who was created in God's image, and which we hope for hereafter. The first man Adam, that is, was the first ear; but with the arrival of evil human nature was diminished into a mere multitude[fn-37-P3787_2485432:183-nf] ; and, as happens to the grain[fn-37-P3788_2485769:184-nf] on the ear, each individual man was denuded of the beauty of that primal ear, and mouldered in the soil: but in the Resurrection we are born again in our original splendour; only instead of that single primitive ear we become the countless myriads of ears in the cornfields. The virtuous life as contrasted with that of vice is distinguished thus: those who while living have by virtuous conduct exercised husbandry on themselves are at once revealed in all the qualities of a perfect ear, while those whose bare grain (that is the forces of their natural soul) has become through evil habits degenerate, as it were, and hardened by the weather (as the so-called \"hornstruck\" seeds[fn-37-P3789_2486568:185-nf] , according to the experts in such things, grow up), will, though they live again in the Resurrection, experience very great severity from their Judge, because they do not possess the strength to shoot up into the full proportions of an ear, and thereby become that which we were before our earthly fall[fn-37-P3790_2487708:186-nf] . The remedy offered by the Overseer of the produce is to collect together the tares and the thorns, which have grown up with the good seed, and into whose bastard life all the secret forces that once nourished its root have passed, so that it not only has had to remain without its nutriment, but has been choked and so rendered unproductive by this unnatural growth. When from the nutritive part within them everything that is the reverse or the counterfeit of it has been picked out, and has been committed to the fire that consumes everything unnatural, and so has disappeared, then in this class also their humanity will thrive and will ripen into fruit-bearing, owing to such husbandry, and some day after long courses of ages will get back again that universal form which God stamped upon us at the beginning. Blessed are they, indeed, in whom the full beauty of those ears shall be developed directly they are born in the Resurrection. Yet we say this without implying that any merely bodily distinctions will be manifest between those who have lived virtuously and those who have lived viciously in this life, as if we ought to think that one will be imperfect as regards his material frame, while another will win perfection as regards it. The prisoner and the free, here in this present world, are just alike as regards the constitutions of their two bodies; though as regards enjoyment and suffering the gulf is wide between them. In this way, I take it, should we reckon the difference between the good and the bad in that intervening time[fn-37-P3791_2489680:187-nf] . For the perfection of bodies that rise from that sowing of death is, as the Apostle tells us, to consist in incorruption and glory and honour and power; but any diminution in such excellences does not denote a corresponding bodily mutilation of him who has risen again, but a withdrawal and estrangement from each one of those things which are conceived of as belonging to the good. Seeing, then, that one or the other of these two diametrically opposed ideas, I mean good and evil, must any way attach to us, it is clear that to say a man is not included in the good is a necessary demonstration that he is included in the evil.

But first the Lord asks what He knew, and that not once, but a second and a third time, whether Peter loved Him; and just as often He has the same answer, that He is loved, while just as often He gives Peter the same charge to feed His sheep. To the threefold denial there is now appended a threefold confession, that his tongue may not yield a feebler service to love than to fear, and imminent death may not appear to have elicited more from the lips than present life. Let it be the office of love to feed the Lord's flock, if it was the signal of fear to deny the Shepherd. Those who have this purpose in feeding the flock of Christ, that they may have them as their own, and not as Christ's, are convicted of loving themselves, and not Christ, from the desire either of boasting, or wielding power, or acquiring gain, and not from the love of obeying, serving, and pleasing God. Against such, therefore, there stands as a wakeful sentinel this thrice inculcated utterance of Christ, of whom the apostle complains that they seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ's.[fn-38-P3881_2138354:4-nf] For what else mean the words, \"Lovest thou me? Feed my sheep,\" than if it were said, If thou lovest me, think not of feeding thyself, but feed my sheep as mine, and not as thine own; seek my glory in them, and not thine own; my dominion, and not thine; my gain, and not thine; lest thou be found in the fellowship of those who belong to the perilous times, lovers of their own selves, and all else that is joined on to this beginning of evils? For the apostle, after saying, \"For men shall be lovers of their own selves,\" proceeded to add, \"Lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, wicked, irreligious, without affection, false accusers, incontinent, implacable, without kindness, traitors, heady, blinded;[fn-38-P3882_2139121:5-nf] lovers of pleasures more than of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.\"[fn-38-P3883_2139231:6-nf] All these evils flow from that as their fountain which he stated first, \"lovers of their own selves.\" With great propriety, therefore, is Peter addressed, \"Lovest thou me?\" and found replying, \"I love Thee:\" and the command applied to him, \"Feed my lambs,\" and this a second and a third time We have it also demonstrated here that love and liking are one and the same thing; for the Lord also in the last question said not Diligis me? but, Amas me? Let us, then, love not ourselves, but Him; and in feeding His sheep, let us be seeking the things which are His, not the things which are our own. For in some inexplicable way, I know not what, every one that loveth himself, and not God, loveth not himself; and whoever loveth God, and not himself, he it is that loveth himself. For he that cannot live by himself will certainly die by loving himself; he therefore loveth not himself who loves himself to his own loss of life. But when He is loved by whom life is preserved, a man by not loving himself only loveth the more, when it is for this reason that he loveth not himself [namely] that he may love Him by whom he lives. Let not those, then, who feed Christ's sheep be \"lovers of their own selves,\" test they feed them as if they were their own, and not His, and wish to make their own gain of them, as \"lovers of money;\" or to domineer over them, as \"boastful;\" or to glory in the honors which they receive at their hands, as \"proud;\" or to go the length even of originating heresies, as \"blasphemers;\" and not to give place to the holy fathers, as those who are \"disobedient to parents;\" and to render evil for good to those who wish to correct them, because unwilling to let them perish, as \"unthankful;\" to slay their own souls and those of others, as \"wicked;\" to outrage the motherly bowels of the Church, as \"irreligious;\" to have no sympathy with the weak, as those who are \"without affection;\" to attempt to traduce the character of the saints, as \"false accusers;\" to give loose reins to the basest lusts, as \"incontinent;\" to make lawsuits their practice, as \"implacable;\" to know nothing of loving service, as those who are \"without kindness;\" to make known to the enemies of the godly what they are well aware ought to be kept secret, as \"traitors;\" to disturb human modesty by shameless discussions, as \"heady;\" to understand neither what they say nor whereof they affirm,[fn-38-P3884_2141643:7-nf] as \"blinded;\" and to prefer carnal delights to spiritual joys, as those who are \"lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.\" For these and such like vices, whether all of them meet in a single individual, or whether some dominate in one and others in another, spring up in some form or another from this one root, when men are \"lovers of their own selves.\" A vice which is specially to be guarded against by those who feed Christ's sheep, lest they be seeking their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ's, and be turning those to the use of their own lusts for whom the blood of Christ was shed. Whose love ought, in one who feedeth His sheep, to grow up unto so great a spiritual fervor as to overcome even the natural fear of death, that makes us unwilling to die even when we wish to live with Christ. For the Apostle Paul also says that he had a desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ,[fn-38-P3885_2142563:8-nf] and yet he groans, being burdened, and wishes not to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality may be swallowed up of life.[fn-38-P3886_2142708:9-nf] And so to His present lover the Lord said, \"When thou shall be old, thou shall stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. For this He said to him, signifying by what death he should glorify God.\" \"Thou shall stretch forth thy hands,\" He said; in other words, thou shall be crucified. But that thou mayest come to this, \"another shall gird thee, and carry thee,\" not whither thou wouldest, but \"whither thou wouldest not.\" He told him first what would happen, and then how it should come to pass. For it was not after being crucified, but when actually about to be crucified, that he was carried whither he would not; for after being crucified he went his way, not whither he would not, but rather whither he would. And though when set free from the body he wished to be with Christ, yet, were it only possible, he had a desire for eternal life apart from the grievousness of death, to which grievous experience he was unwillingly carried, but from it [when all was over] he was willingly carried away; unwillingly he came to it, but willingly he conquered it, and left this feeling of infirmity behind that makes every one unwilling to die,-a feeling so permanently natural, that even old age itself was unable to set the blessed Peter free from its influence, even as it was said unto him, \"When thou shalt be old,\" thou shall be led \"whither thou wouldest not.\" For our consolation the Saviour Himself transfigured also the same feeling in His own person when He said, \"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;\"[fn-38-P3887_2144306:10-nf] and He certainly had come to die without having any necessity, but only the willingness to die, with power to lay down His life, and with power to take it again. But however great be the grievousness of death, it ought to be overcome by the power of that love which is felt to Him who, being our life, was willing to endure even death in our behalf. For if there were no grievousness, even of the smallest kind, in death, the glory of the martyrs would not be so great. But if the good Shepherd, who laid down His own life for His sheep,[fn-38-P3888_2144865:11-nf] has raised up so many martyrs for Himself out of the very sheep, how much more ought those to contend to death for the truth, and even to blood against sin, who are entrusted by Him with the feeding, that is, with the teaching and governing of these very sheep? And on this account, along with the preceding example of His own passion, who can fail to see that the shepherds ought all the more to set themselves closely to imitate the Shepherd, if He was so imitated even by many of the sheep under whom, as the one Shepherd and in the one flock, the shepherds themselves are likewise sheep? For He made all those His sheep for [all of] whom He died, because He Himself also became a sheep that He might suffer for all.","title":"Tractate CXXIII.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_123_letter_cxxiv_to_the_monks_of_palestine_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"17","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"As these iniquitous lies were once rejected by the catholic Faith, and such men's blasphemies condemned by the unanimous votes of the blessed Fathers throughout the world, whoever these are that are so blinded and strange to the light of truth as to deny the presence of human, that is our, nature in the Word of God from the time of the Incarnation, they must show on what ground they claim the name of Christian, and in what way they harmonize with the true Gospel, if the child-bearing of the blessed Virgin produced either the flesh without the Godhead or the Godhead without the flesh.

I think, indeed, that Jeremiah the prophet, also, understanding what was the nature of the wisdom of God in him, which was the same also which he had assumed for the salvation of the world, said, \"The breath of our countenance is Christ the Lord, to whom we said, that under His shadow we shall live among the nations.\"[fn-66-P6606_1327626:97-nf] And inasmuch as the shadow of our body is inseparable from the body, and unavoidably performs and repeats its movements and gestures, I think that he, wishing to point out the work of Christ's soul, and the movements inseparably belonging to it, and which accomplished everything according to His movements and will, called this the shadow of Christ the Lord, under which shadow we were to live among the nations. For in the mystery of this assumption the nations live, who, imitating it through faith, come to salvation. David also, when saying, \"Be mindful of my reproach, O Lord, with which they reproached me in exchange for Thy Christ,\"[fn-66-P6607_1328286:98-nf] seems to me to indicate the same. And what else does Paul mean when he says, \"Your life is hid with Christ in God; \"[fn-66-P6608_1328428:99-nf] and again in another passage, \"Do you seek a proof of Christ, who speaketh in me? \"[fn-66-P6609_1328531:100-nf] And now he says that Christ was hid in God. The meaning of which expression, unless it be shown to be something such as we have pointed out above as intended by the prophet in the words \"shadow of Christ,\" exceeds, perhaps, the apprehension of the human mind. But we see also very many other statements in holy Scripture respecting the meaning of the word \"shadow,\" as that well-known one in the Gospel according to Luke, where Gabriel says to Mary, \"The Spirit of the Lord shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.\"[fn-66-P6610_1329103:101-nf] And the apostle says with reference to the law, that they who have circumcision in the flesh, \"serve for the similitude and shadow of heavenly things.\"[fn-66-P6611_1329274:102-nf] And elsewhere, \"Is not our life upon the earth a shadow? \"[fn-66-P6612_1329354:103-nf] If, then, not only the law which is upon the earth is a shadow, but also all our life which is upon the earth is the same, and we live among the nations under the shadow of Christ, we must see whether the truth of all these shadows may not come to be known in that revelation, when no longer through a glass, and darkly, but face to face, all the saints shall deserve to behold the glory of God, and the causes and truth of things.

But why is it said that a man is to be judged according to those things which he has done by means of the body, when many things are done by the mind alone, and not by the body, nor by any member of the body; and for the most part things of such importance, that a most righteous punishment would be due to such thought, such as,-to say nothing of others,-that \"The fool hath said in his heart there is no God\"?[fn-68-P6817_2597710:91-nf] What, then, is the meaning of, \"According to those things that he hath done by means of the body,\" except according to those things which he has done during that time in which he was in the body, so that we may understand \"by means of the body\" as meaning \"throughout the season of bodily life \"? But after the body, no one will be in the body except at the last resurrection,-not for the purpose of establishing any claims of merit, but for the sake of receiving recompenses for good merits, and enduring punishments for evil merits. But in this intermediate period between the putting off and the taking again of the body, the souls are either tormented or they are in repose, according to those things which they have done during the period of the bodily life. And to this period of the bodily life moreover pertains, what the Pelagians deny, but Christ's Church confesses, original sin; and according to whether this is by God's grace loosed, or by God's judgment not loosed, when infants die, they pass, on the one hand, by the merit of regeneration from evil to good, or on the other, by the merit of their origin from evil to evil. The catholic faith acknowledges this, and even some heretics, without any contradiction, agree to this. But in the height of wonder and astonishment I am unable to discover whence men, whose intelligence your letters show to be by no means contemptible, could entertain the opinion that any one should be judged not according to the merits that he had as long as he was in the body, but according to the merits which he would have had if he had lived longer in the body; and I should not dare to believe that there were such men, if I could venture to disbelieve you. But I hope that God will interpose, so that when they are admonished they may at once perceive, that if those sins which, as is said, would have been, can rightly be punished by God's judgment in those who are not baptized, they may alo be rightly remitted by God's grace in those who are baptized. For whoever says that future sins can only be punished by God's judgment, but cannot be pardoned by God's mercy, ought to consider how great a wrong he is doing to God and His grace; as if future sin could be foreknown, and could not be foregone.[fn-68-P6818_2599981:92-nf] And if this is absurd, it is the greater reason that help should be afforded to those who would be sinners if they lived longer, when they die in early life, by means of that laver wherein sins are washed away.","title":"The First Book.","author":"Augustine"},{"chapter":5,"verse":17,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_38_oration_xvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"6","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"2.

But with respect to the declaration of the apostle, \"Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth. Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth He yet find fault? For who hath resisted His will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? \"[fn-70-P7050_1533553:219-nf] Some one will perhaps say, that as the potter out of the same lump makes some vessels to honour, and others to dishonour, so God creates some men for perdition, and others for salvation; and that it is not therefore in our own power either to be saved or to perish; by which reasoning we appear not to be possessed of free-will. We must answer those who are of this opinion with the question, Whether it is possible for the apostle to contradict himself? And if this cannot be imagined of an apostle, how shall he appear, according to them, to be just in blaming those who committed fornication in Corinth, or those who sinned, and did not repent of their unchastity, and fornication, and uncleanness, which they had committed? How, also, does he greatly praise those who acted rightly, like the house of Onesiphorus, saying, \"The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: but, when he had come to Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day.\"[fn-70-P7051_1534662:220-nf] Now it is not consistent with apostolic gravity to blame him who is worthy of blame, i.e., who has sinned, and greatly to praise him who is deserving of praise for his good works; and again, as if it were in no one's power to do any good or evil, to say that it was the Creator's doing that every one should act virtuously or wickedly, seeing He makes one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour. And how can he add that statement, \"We must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one of us may receive in his body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad? \"[fn-70-P7052_1535283:221-nf] For what reward of good will be conferred on him who could not commit evil, being formed by the Creator to that very end? or what punishment will deservedly be inflicted on him who was unable to do good in consequence of the creative act of his Maker?[fn-70-P7053_1535557:222-nf] Then, again, how is not this opposed to that other declaration elsewhere, that \"in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the Master's use, prepared unto every good work.\"[fn-70-P7054_1535966:223-nf] He, accordingly, who purges himself, is made a vessel unto honour, while he who has disdained to cleanse himself from his impurity is made a vessel unto dishonour. From such declarations, in my opinion, the cause of our actions can in no degree be referred to the Creator. For God the Creator makes a certain vessel unto honour, and other vessels to dishonour; but that vessel which has cleansed itself from all impurity He makes a vessel unto honour, while that which has stained itself with the filth of vice He makes a vessel unto dishonour. The conclusion from which, accordingly, is this, that the cause of each one's actions is a pre-existing one; and then every one, according to his deserts, is made by God either a vessel unto honour or dishonour. Therefore every individual vessel has furnished to its Creator out of itself the causes and occasions of its being formed by Him to be either a vessel unto honour or one unto dishonour. And if the assertion appear correct, as it certainly is, and in harmony with all piety, that it is due to previous causes that every vessel be prepared by God either to honour or to dishonour, it does not appear absurd that, in discussing remoter causes in the same order, and in the same method, we should come to the same conclusion respecting the nature of souls, and (believe) that this was the reason why Jacob was beloved before he was born into this world, and Esau hated, while he still was contained in the womb of his mother.","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":10,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":3,"source_paragraph":"55","folder":"ANF-04","text":"20.

Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth He yet find fault? For who hath resisted His will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?

Now we must ask him who deals so with these passages, whether it is possible to conceive of the apostle as contradicting himself. I presume, however, that no one will venture to say so. If, then, the apostle does not utter contradictions, how can he, according to him who so understands him, reasonably find fault, censuring the individual at Corinth who had committed fornication, or those who had fallen away, and had not repented of the licentiousness and impurity of which they had been guilty? And how can he bless those whom he praises as having done well, as he does the house of Onesiphorus in these words: \"The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: but, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day.\"[fn-70-P7057_1539219:225-nf] It is not consistent for the same apostle[fn-70-P7058_1539285:226-nf] to blame the sinner as worthy of censure, and to praise him who had done well as deserving of approval; and again, on the other hand, to say, as if nothing depended on ourselves, that the cause was in the Creator[fn-70-P7059_1539542:227-nf] why the one vessel was formed to honour, and the other to dishonour. And how is this statement correct:[fn-70-P7060_1539685:228-nf] \"For we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,\"[fn-70-P7061_1539875:229-nf] since they who have done evil have advanced to this pitch of wickedness[fn-70-P7062_1539968:230-nf] because they were created vessels unto dishonour, while they that have lived virtuously have done good because they were created from the beginning for this purpose, and became vessels unto honour? And again, how does not the statement made elsewhere conflict with the view which these persons draw from the words which we have quoted (that it is the fault of the Creator that one vessel is in honour and another in dishonour), viz., \"that in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. If a man therefore purge himself, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the Master's use, and prepared unto every good work; \"[fn-70-P7063_1540720:231-nf] for if he who purges himself becomes a vessel unto honour, and he who allows himself to remain unpurged[fn-70-P7064_1540850:232-nf] becomes a vessel unto dishonour, then, so far as these words are concerned, the Creator is not at all to blame. For the Creator makes vessels of honour and vessels of dishonour, not from the beginning according to His foreknowledge,[fn-70-P7065_1541121:233-nf] since He does not condemn or justify beforehand[fn-70-P7066_1541187:234-nf] according to it; but (He makes) those into vessels of honour who purged themselves, and those into vessels of dishonour who allowed themselves to remain unpurged: so that it results from older causes[fn-70-P7067_1541423:235-nf] (which operated) in the formation of the vessels unto honour and dishonour, that one was created for the former condition, and another for the latter. But if we once admit that there were certain older causes (at work) in the forming of a vessel unto honour, and of one unto dishonour, what absurdity is there in going back to the subject of the soul, and (in supposing) that a more ancient cause for Jacob being loved and for Esau being hated existed with respect to Jacob before his assumption of a body, and with regard to Esau before he was conceived in the womb of Rebecca?","title":"Book III.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_47_book_iii_","source_chapter":8,"source_paragraph":"99","folder":"ANF-04","text":"4.

So far, then, as our understanding can grasp it, we consider a spiritual body to be of such a nature as ought to be inhabited not only by all holy and perfect souls, but also by all those creatures which will be liberated from the slavery of corruption. Respecting the body also, the apostle has said, \"We have a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,\"[fn-73-P7301_1656010:411-nf] i.e., in the mansions of the blessed. And from this statement we may form a conjecture, how pure, how refined, and how glorious are the qualities of that body, if we compare it with those which, although they are celestial bodies, and of most brilliant splendour, were nevertheless made with hands, and are visible to our sight. But of that body it is said, that it is a house not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens. Since, then, those things \"which are seen are temporal, but those things which are not seen are eternal,\"[fn-73-P7302_1656562:412-nf] all those bodies which we see either on earth or in heaven, and which are capable of being seen, and have been made with hands, but are not eternal, are far excelled in glory by that which is not visible, nor made with hands, but is eternal. From which comparison it may be conceived how great are the comeliness, and splendour, and brilliancy of a spiritual body; and how true it is, that \"eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, what God hath prepared for them that love Him.\"[fn-73-P7303_1657112:413-nf] We ought not, however, to doubt that the nature of this present body of ours may, by the will of God, who made it what it is, be raised to those qualities of refinement, and purity, and splendour (which characterize the body referred to), according as the condition of things requires, and the deserts of our rational nature shall demand. Finally, when the world required variety and diversity, matter yielded itself with all docility throughout the diverse appearances and species of things to the Creator, as to its Lord and Maker, that He might educe from it the various forms of celestial and terrestrial beings.

And if thou shouldest say that Christ has not yet come, I will grant this also to thy\ncontentiousness. For it is written that when He shall come, the Gentiles shall expect\nHim.[fn-44-P4480_1496968:27-nf] Lo! I, one of the Gentiles, have\nheard that Christ is to come. And when as yet He had not come, I beforehand have believed on Him; and\nthrough Him I worship the God of Israel. When He comes, will He then blame me because before His\ncoming I beforehand believed on Him? But, thou fool, the prophets suffer thee not to say that Christ\nhas not yet come; for Daniel confutes thee,[fn-44-P4481_1497406:28-nf] saying:-After sixty-two weeks shall Messiah\ncome and shall be slain. And in His coming shall the Holy City be laid waste, and her end shall be\nwith a flood. And until the accomplishment of the things that are determined, shall she continue in\ndesolation. Thou expectest and hopest that, at the coming of Christ, Israel shall be gathered\ntogether from all regions, and Jerusalem shall be built up and inhabited. But Daniel testifies that,\nwhen Christ comes and is slain, Jerusalem shall be destroyed, and shall continue in desolation until\nthe accomplishment of the things which are determined, forever. And concerning the suffering of\nChrist, David said:-They pierced my hands and my feet, and all my bones cried out. They gazed and\nlooked upon me, and divided my garments amongst them, and upon my vesture did they cast the\nlot.[fn-44-P4482_1498258:29-nf] And Isaiah said:-Lo! My\nservant shall be known and shall be revealed and shall be lifted up, so that many shall be astonished\nat Him. As for this man, His visage shall be marred more than that of man, and His aspect more than\nthat of the sons of men.[fn-44-P4483_1498530:30-nf] And he\nsaid:-He will purify many nations, and kings shall be amazed at Him.[fn-44-P4484_1498627:31-nf] And he said in that passage:-He came up as a\nlittle child before Him, and as a root from the dry ground.[fn-44-P4485_1498751:32-nf] And in the end of the passage he said:-He\nshall be slain for our sins; He shall be humiliated for our iniquity; the chastisement of our peace\nis upon Him, and by His bruises shall we be healed.[fn-44-P4486_1498964:33-nf] By what wounds were men healed? David was not\nslain; for he died in a good old age, and was buried in Bethlehem. And if they should say that it is\nspoken of Saul, for Saul was killed in the mountains of Gilboa in the battle with the Philistines,\nand if they should say that they pierced his hands and his feet, when they fastened up his\nbody on the wall of Bethshan; yet it does not fitly apply to Saul. When the limbs of Saul were\npierced, his bones were not conscious of suffering, because he was dead. It was after Saul died, that\nthey hanged his body and those of his sons on the wall of Bethshan. But when David said, They\npierced my hands and my feet, and all my bones cried out, he said in the next verse:-O God,\nabide for my help, and deliver my soul from the sword.[fn-44-P4487_1499757:34-nf] Now Christ was delivered from the sword, and\nascended from out of Sheol, and revived and rose the third day, and so God abode for His help.\nBut Saul called upon the Lord and He did not answer him; and he asked through the Prophets, but no\nanswer was given to him. And he disguised himself and inquired by soothsayers, and learned from\nthence. He was worsted before the Philistines, and he slew himself with his own sword, when he saw\nthat the battle had overcome him. Moreover in this passage David said:-I will declare Thy name\nunto my brethren, and in the midst of the congregation will I glorify Thee.[fn-44-P4488_1500385:35-nf] How can these things apply to Saul? And again\nDavid said:-Thou didst not give Thy holy one to see corruption.[fn-44-P4489_1500514:36-nf] But all these things fitly apply to Christ. When\nHe came to them, they did not receive Him; but wickedly judged Him by false witness. And He was hung\nupon the tree by His hands, and they pierced His hands and His feet with the nails which they\nfastened in him; and all His bones cried out. And on that day a great prodigy happened. namely, that\nthe light became dark in the middle of the day, as Zechariah prophesied, saying:-The day shall be\nknown unto the Lord. It shall not be daytime, and it shall not be night; and at the evening time\nthere shall be light.[fn-44-P4490_1501095:37-nf] Now what is the\nday that was distinguished by the prodigy, that it was neither daytime nor night, and that at the\nevening time there was light? Evidently the day on which they crucified Him, for in the midst of that\nday there came darkness, and at the evening time there was light. And again he said:-That day\nthere shall be cold and frost.[fn-44-P4491_1501455:38-nf] -As\nthou knowest, on that day on which they crucified Him, it was cold, and they had made them a fire to\nwarm themselves when Simon came and stood with them. And again he said:-The spear shall arise\nagainst the shepherd, and against the man, My friend;[fn-44-P4492_1501795:39-nf] and it shall smite the shepherd, and the sheep\nof his flock shall be scattered; and I will turn back My hand upon the pastor.[fn-44-P4493_1502014:40-nf] And furthermore David said concerning His\nPassion:-For My meat they gave gall, and for My thirst did they give Me vinegar to\ndrink.[fn-44-P4494_1502205:41-nf] -Again he said in that\npassage:-They have persecuted Him Whom Thou hast smitten; and have added to the affliction of Him\nthat was slain. For they added many(afflictions) to Him, much that was not written concerning\nHim, cursings and revilings, such as the Scripture could not reveal, for their revilings were\nhateful. But, however, the Lord was pleased to humiliate Him and afflict Him.[fn-44-P4495_1502616:42-nf] And He was slain for our iniquity,[fn-44-P4496_1502670:43-nf] and was humiliated for our sins, and\nwas made sin in His own person.[fn-44-P4497_1502757:44-nf]\n","title":"Letter of an Inquirer.","author":"Aphrahat"},{"chapter":5,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_05_npnf2_05_41_funeral_oration_on_meletius","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"4","folder":"NPNF2-05","text":"Our Bridegroom has not been taken from us.

Now let us shew briefly, if you will, that these things were foretold by the Prophets. You will yourself, since you are so minded, gather together more from the ample range of the Scriptures. The Prophet Malachi says, \"Behold the Lord Almighty shall come, and who shall abide the day of His coming, or who shall abide the sight of Him? For He doth come as the fire of a furnace and as fuller's soap: and He shall sit, refining and purifying as it were gold and silver.\"[fn-98-P9832_2762094:136-nf] But that thou mayest know more certainly Who this Lord is of Whom these things are said, hear what the Prophet Daniel also foretells: \"I saw,\" saith he, \"in the vision of the night, and, behold, One like the Son of Man coming with the clouds of heaven, and He came nigh to the Ancient of days, and was brought near before Him; and there was given to Him dominion, and honour, and a kingdom. And all peoples, tribes, and languages shall serve Him. And His dominion is an eternal dominion which shall not pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed.\"[fn-98-P9833_2762672:137-nf] By these words we are taught not only of His coming and judgment, but of His dominion and kingdom, that His dominion is eternal, and His kingdom indestructible, without end; as it is said in the Creed,[fn-98-P9834_2762909:138-nf] \"and of His kingdom there shall be no end.\" So that one who says that Christ's kingdom shall one day have an end is very far from the faith. Yet it behoves us to know that the enemy is wont to counterfeit this salutary advent of Christ with cunningfraud in order to deceive the faithful, and in the place of the Son of Man, Who is looked for as coming in the majesty of His Father, to prepare the Son of Perdition with prodigies and lying signs, that instead of Christ he may introduce Antichrist into the world; of whom the Lord Himself warned the Jews beforehand in the Gospels, \"Because I am come in My Father's Name, and ye received Me not, another will come in his own name, and him ye will receive.\"[fn-98-P9835_2763858:139-nf] And again, \"When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, standing in the holy place, let him that readeth understand.\"[fn-98-P9836_2764033:140-nf] Daniel, therefore, in his visions speaks very fully and amply of the coming of that delusion: but it is not worth while to cite instances, for we have enlarged enough already; we therefore refer any one who may wish to know more concerning these matters to the visions themselves. The Apostle also himself says, \"Let no than deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the Son of Perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above everything that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as though himself were God.\"[fn-98-P9837_2764710:141-nf] And soon afterwards, \"Then shall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders.\"[fn-98-P9838_2765013:142-nf] And again, shortly afterwards, \"And therefore the Lord shall send unto them strong delusion, that they may believe a lie, that all may be judged who have not believed the truth.\"[fn-98-P9839_2765232:143-nf] For this reason, therefore, is this \"delusion\" foretold unto us by the words of Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles, lest any one should mistake the coming of Antichrist for the coming of Christ. But as the Lord Himself says, \"When they shall say unto you, lo, here is Christ, or lo, He is there, believe it not. For many false Christs and false prophets shall come and shall seduce many.\" But let us see how He hath pointed out the judgment of the true Christ: \"As the lightning shineth from the east unto the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be.\"[fn-98-P9840_2765813:144-nf] When, therefore, the true Lord Jesus Christ shall come, He will sit and set up his throne of judgment. As also He says in the Gospel, \"He shall separate the sheep from the goats,\"[fn-98-P9841_2766032:145-nf] that is, the righteous from the unrighteous; as the Apostle writes, \"We must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every man may receive the awards due to the body, according as he hath done, whether they be good or evil.\"[fn-98-P9842_2766290:146-nf] Moreover, the judgment will be not only for deeds, but for thoughts also, as the same Apostle saith, \"Their thoughts mutually accusing or else excusing One another, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men.\"[fn-98-P9843_2766529:147-nf] But on these points let this suffice.

This, then, is our reply to those who would puzzle us; not given willingly indeed (for light talk and contradictions of words are not agreeable to the faith fill, and one Adversary is enough for us), but of necessity, for the sake of our assailants (for medicines exist because of diseases), that they may be led to see that they are not all-wise nor invincible in those superfluous arguments which make void the Gospel. For when we leave off believing, and protect ourselves by mere strength of argument, and destroy the claim which the Spirit has upon our faith by questionings, and then our argument is not strong enough for the importance of the subject (and this must necessarily be the case, since it is put in motion by an organ of so little power as is our mind), what is the result? The weakness of the argument appears to belong to the mystery, and thus elegance of language makes void the Cross, as Paul also thought.[fn-44-P4473_1409638:86-nf] For faith is that which completes our argument. But may He who proclaimeth unions and looseth those that are bound, and who putteth into our minds to solve the knots of their unnatural dogmas, if it may be, change these men and make them faithful instead of rhetoricians, Christians instead of that which they now are called.

But when all things shall be subdued unto Him on the one hand by acknowledgment of Him, and on the other by a reformation, then He Himself also will have fulfilled His submission, bringing me whom He has saved to God. For this, according to my view, is the subjection of Christ; namely, the fulfilling of the Father's Will. But as the Son subjects all to the Father, so does the Father to the Son; the One by His Work, the Other by His good pleasure, as we have already said. And thus He Who subjects presents to God that which he has subjected, making our condition His own. Of the same kind, it appears to me, is the expression, \"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\"[fn-45-P4509_1419855:24-nf] It was not He who was forsaken either by the Father, or by His own Godhead, as some have thought, as if It were afraid of the Passion, and therefore withdrew Itself from Him in His Sufferings (for who compelled Him either to be born on earth at all, or to be lifted up on the Cross?) But as I said, He was in His own Person representing us. For we were the forsaken and despised before, but now by the Sufferings of Him Who could not suffer, we were taken up and saved. Similarly, He makes His own our folly and our transgressions; and says what follows in the Psalm, for it is very evident that the Twenty-first[fn-45-P4510_1420486:25-nf] Psalm refers to Christ.","title":"Oration XXX.","author":"Gregory Nazianzen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":16,"source_code":"npnf2_07_npnf2_07_45_oration_xxx_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"18","folder":"NPNF2-07","text":"XIV.

He is not the God of the dead but of the living: for all do live unto Him.\"[fn-35-P3560_1327951:32-nf] Of whom also the Apostle says: \"wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for He hath prepared for them a city.\"[fn-35-P3561_1328103:33-nf] For that they are not idle after the separation from this body, and are not incapable of feeling, the parable in the gospel shows, which tells us of the beggar Lazarus and Dives clothed in purple, one of whom obtained a position of bliss, i.e., Abraham's bosom, the other is consumed with the dreadful heat of eternal fire.[fn-35-P3562_1328445:34-nf] But if you care too to understand the words spoken to the thief \"To-day thou shalt be with Me in Paradise,\"[fn-35-P3563_1328582:35-nf] what do they clearly show but that not only does their former intelligence continue with the souls, but also that in their changed condition they partake of some state which corresponds to their actions and deserts? For the Lord would certainly never have promised him this, if He had known that his soul after being separated from the flesh would either have been deprived of perception or have been resolved into nothing. For it was not his flesh but his soul which was to enter Paradise with Christ. At least we must avoid, and shunwith the utmost horror, that wicked punctuation of the heretics, who, as they do not believe that Christ could be found in Paradise on the same day on which He descended into hell, thus punctuate \"Verily, I say unto you to-day,\" and making a stop apply \"thou shall be with. Me in Paradise, in such a way that they imagine that this promise was not fulfilled at once after he departed from this life, but that it will be fulfilled after the resurrection,[fn-35-P3564_1329596:36-nf] as they do not understand what before the time of His resurrection He declared to the Jews, who fancied that He was hampered by human difficulties and weakness of the flesh as they were: \"No man hath ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven:\"[fn-35-P3565_1330070:37-nf] by which He clearly shows that the souls of the departed are not only not deprived of their reason, but that they are not even without such feelings as hope and sorrow, joy and fear, and that they already are beginning to taste beforehand something of what is reserved for them at the last judgment, and that they are not as some unbelievers hold resolved into nothing after their departure from this life:[fn-35-P3566_1330499:38-nf] but that they live a more real life, and are still more earnest in waiting on the praises of God. And indeed to put aside for a little Scripture proofs, and to discuss, as far as our ability permits us, a little about the nature of the soul itself, is it not beyond the bounds of I will not say the folly, but the madness of all stupidity, even to have the slightest suspicion that the nobler part of man, in which as the blessed Apostle shows, the image and likeness of God consists,[fn-35-P3567_1331546:39-nf] will, when the burden of the body with which it is oppressed in this world is laid aside, become insensible, when, as it contains in itself all the power of reason, it makes the dumb and senseless material flesh sensible, by participation with it: especially when it follows, and the order of reason itself demands that when the mind has put off the grossness of the flesh with which it is now weighed down, it will restore its intellectual powers better than ever, and receive them in a purer and finer condition than it lost them. But so far did the blessed Apostle recognize that what we say is true, that he actually wished to depart from this flesh; that by separation from it, he might be able to be joined more earnestly to the Lord; saying: \"I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is far better, for while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord:\" and therefore \"we are bold and have our desire always to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. Wherefore also we strive, whether absent or present, to be pleasing to Him;\"[fn-35-P3568_1332647:40-nf] and he declares indeed that the continuance of the soul which is in the flesh is distance from the Lord, and absence from Christ, and trusts with entire faith that its separation and departure from this flesh involves presence with Christ. And again still more clearly the same Apostle speaks of this state of the souls as one that is very full of life: \"But ye are come to Mount Sion, and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, and the church of the first born, who are written in heaven, and the spirits of just men made perfect.\"[fn-35-P3569_1333265:41-nf] Of which spirits he speaks in another passage, \"Furthermore we have had instructors of our flesh, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?\"[fn-35-P3570_1333480:42-nf] ","title":"I.

For no man even though he were to call himself a Christian a thousand times over, or a monk, confesses God when he is sinning: no man who allows those things which the Lord hates, remembereth God, nor calls himself with any truth the servant of Him, whose commands he scorns with obstinate rashness: in which death the blessed Apostle declares that the widow is involved, who gives herself to pleasure, saying \"a widow who giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth.\"[fn-35-P3556_1327115:28-nf] There are then many who while still living in this body are dead, and lying in the grave cannot praise God; and on the contrary there are many who though they are dead in the body yet bless God in the spirit, and praise Him, according to this: \"O ye spirits and souls of the righteous, bless ye the Lord:\"[fn-35-P3557_1327439:29-nf] and \"every spirit shall praise the Lord.\"[fn-35-P3558_1327506:30-nf] And in the Apocalypse the souls of them that are slain are not only said to praise God but to address Him also.[fn-35-P3559_1327634:31-nf] In the gospel too the Lord says with still greater clearness to the Sadducees: \"Have ye not read that which was spoken by God, when He said to you: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. He is not the God of the dead but of the living: for all do live unto Him.\"[fn-35-P3560_1327951:32-nf] Of whom also the Apostle says: \"wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for He hath prepared for them a city.\"[fn-35-P3561_1328103:33-nf] For that they are not idle after the separation from this body, and are not incapable of feeling, the parable in the gospel shows, which tells us of the beggar Lazarus and Dives clothed in purple, one of whom obtained a position of bliss, i.e., Abraham's bosom, the other is consumed with the dreadful heat of eternal fire.[fn-35-P3562_1328445:34-nf] But if you care too to understand the words spoken to the thief \"To-day thou shalt be with Me in Paradise,\"[fn-35-P3563_1328582:35-nf] what do they clearly show but that not only does their former intelligence continue with the souls, but also that in their changed condition they partake of some state which corresponds to their actions and deserts? For the Lord would certainly never have promised him this, if He had known that his soul after being separated from the flesh would either have been deprived of perception or have been resolved into nothing. For it was not his flesh but his soul which was to enter Paradise with Christ. At least we must avoid, and shunwith the utmost horror, that wicked punctuation of the heretics, who, as they do not believe that Christ could be found in Paradise on the same day on which He descended into hell, thus punctuate \"Verily, I say unto you to-day,\" and making a stop apply \"thou shall be with. Me in Paradise, in such a way that they imagine that this promise was not fulfilled at once after he departed from this life, but that it will be fulfilled after the resurrection,[fn-35-P3564_1329596:36-nf] as they do not understand what before the time of His resurrection He declared to the Jews, who fancied that He was hampered by human difficulties and weakness of the flesh as they were: \"No man hath ascended into heaven, but He who came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven:\"[fn-35-P3565_1330070:37-nf] by which He clearly shows that the souls of the departed are not only not deprived of their reason, but that they are not even without such feelings as hope and sorrow, joy and fear, and that they already are beginning to taste beforehand something of what is reserved for them at the last judgment, and that they are not as some unbelievers hold resolved into nothing after their departure from this life:[fn-35-P3566_1330499:38-nf] but that they live a more real life, and are still more earnest in waiting on the praises of God. And indeed to put aside for a little Scripture proofs, and to discuss, as far as our ability permits us, a little about the nature of the soul itself, is it not beyond the bounds of I will not say the folly, but the madness of all stupidity, even to have the slightest suspicion that the nobler part of man, in which as the blessed Apostle shows, the image and likeness of God consists,[fn-35-P3567_1331546:39-nf] will, when the burden of the body with which it is oppressed in this world is laid aside, become insensible, when, as it contains in itself all the power of reason, it makes the dumb and senseless material flesh sensible, by participation with it: especially when it follows, and the order of reason itself demands that when the mind has put off the grossness of the flesh with which it is now weighed down, it will restore its intellectual powers better than ever, and receive them in a purer and finer condition than it lost them. But so far did the blessed Apostle recognize that what we say is true, that he actually wished to depart from this flesh; that by separation from it, he might be able to be joined more earnestly to the Lord; saying: \"I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, which is far better, for while we are in the body we are absent from the Lord:\" and therefore \"we are bold and have our desire always to be absent from the body, and present with the Lord. Wherefore also we strive, whether absent or present, to be pleasing to Him;\"[fn-35-P3568_1332647:40-nf] and he declares indeed that the continuance of the soul which is in the flesh is distance from the Lord, and absence from Christ, and trusts with entire faith that its separation and departure from this flesh involves presence with Christ. And again still more clearly the same Apostle speaks of this state of the souls as one that is very full of life: \"But ye are come to Mount Sion, and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, and the church of the first born, who are written in heaven, and the spirits of just men made perfect.\"[fn-35-P3569_1333265:41-nf] Of which spirits he speaks in another passage, \"Furthermore we have had instructors of our flesh, and we reverenced them: shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?\"[fn-35-P3570_1333480:42-nf] ","title":"I.

And so when we have succeeded in this, we shall be able to arrive at the third as well, in which we go forth from the house of our former parent, (who, as we know well, was our father from our Very birth, after the old man, when we were \"by nature children of wrath, as others also,\"[fn-38-P3832_1428347:14-nf] ) and fix our whole mental gaze on things celestial. And of this father Scripture says to Jerusalem which had despised God the true Father, \"Thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother a Hittite;\"[fn-38-P3833_1428559:15-nf] and in the gospel we read \"Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye love to do.\"[fn-38-P3834_1428682:16-nf] And when we have left him, as we pass from things visible to things unseen we shall be able to say with the Apostle: \"But we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved we have a habitation from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,\"[fn-38-P3835_1428978:17-nf] and this also, which we quoted a little while ago: \"But our conversation is in heaven, whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who will reform the body of our low estate made like to the body of His glory,\"[fn-38-P3836_1429216:18-nf] and this of the blessed David: \"For I am a sojourner upon the earth,\" and \"a stranger as all my fathers were;\"[fn-38-P3837_1429351:19-nf] so that we may in accordance with the Lord's word be made like those of whom the Lord speaks to His Father in the gospel as follows: \"They are not of the world, as I am not of the world,\"[fn-38-P3838_1429594:20-nf] and again to the Apostles themselves: \"If ye were of this world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of this world, therefore the world hateth you.\"[fn-38-P3839_1429783:21-nf] Of this third renunciation then we shall succeed in reaching the perfection, whenever our soul is sullied by no stain of carnal coarseness, but, all such having been carefully eliminated, it has been freed from every earthly quality and desire, and by constant meditation on things Divine, and spiritual contemplation has so far passed on to things unseen, that in its earnest seeking after things above and things spiritual it no longer feels that it is prisoned in this fragile flesh, and bodily form, but is caught up into such an ecstasy as not only to hear no words with the outward ear, or to busy itself with gazing on the forms of things present, but not even to see things close at hand, or large objects straight before the very eyes. And of this no one can understand the truth and force, except one who has made trial of what has been said, under the teaching of experience; viz., one, the eyes of whose soul the Lord has turned away from all things present, so that he no longer considers them as things that will soon pass away, but as things that are already done with, and sees them vanish into nothing, like misty smoke; and like Enoch, \"walking with God,\" and \"translated\" from human life and fashions, not \"be found\" amid the vanities of this life: And that this actually happened corporeally in the case of Enoch the book of Genesis thus tells us. \"And Enoch walked with God, and was not found, for God translated him.\" And the Apostle also says: \"By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death,\" the death namely of which the Lord says in the gospel: \"He that liveth and believeth in me shall not die eternally.\"[fn-38-P3840_1431450:22-nf] Wherefore, if we are anxious to attain true perfection, we ought to look to it that as we have outwardly with the body made light of parents, home, the riches and pleasures of the world, we may also inwardly with the heart forsake all these things and never be drawn back by any desires to those things which we have forsaken, as those who were led up by Moses, though they did not literally go back, are yet said to have returned in heart to Egypt; viz., by forsaking God who had led them forth with such mighty signs, and by worshipping the idols of Egypt of which they had thought scorn, as Scripture says: \"And in their hearts they turned back into Egypt, saying to Aaron: Make us gods to go before us,\"[fn-38-P3841_1432211:23-nf] for we should fall into like condemnation with those who, while dwelling in the wilderness, after they had tasted manna from heaven, lusted after the filthy food of sins, and of mean baseness, and should seem together with them to murmur in the same way: \"It was well with us in Egypt, when we sat over the flesh pots and ate the onions, and garlic, and cucumbers, and melons:\"[fn-38-P3842_1432612:24-nf] A form of speech, which, although it referred primarily to that people, we yet see fulfilled today in our own case and mode of life: for everyone who after renouncing this world turns back to his old desires, and reverts to his former likings asserts in heart and act the very same thing that they did, and says \"It was well with me in Egypt,\" and I am afraid that the number of these will be as large as that of the multitudes of backsliders of whom we read under Moses, for though they were reckoned as six hundred and three thousand armed men who came out of Egypt, of this number not more than two entered the land of promise. Wherefore we should be careful to take examples of goodness from those who are few and far between, because according to that figure of which we have spoken in the gospel \"Many are called but few\" are said to be \"chosen.\"[fn-38-P3843_1433511:25-nf] A renunciation then in body alone, and a mere change of place from Egypt will not do us any good, if we do not succeed in achieving that renunciation in heart, which is far higher and more valuable. For of that mere bodily renunciation of which we have spoken the apostle declares as follows: \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"[fn-38-P3844_1433955:26-nf] And the blessed Apostle would never have said this had it not been that he foresaw by the spirit that some who had given all their goods to feed the poor would not be able to attain to evangelical perfection and the lofty heights of charity, because while pride or impatience ruled over their hearts they were not careful to purify themselves from their former sins, and unrestrained habits, and on that account could never attain to that love of God which never faileth, and these, as they fall short in this second stage of renunciation, can still less reach that third stage which is most certainly far higher. But consider too in your minds with great care the fact that he did not simply say \"If I bestow my goods.\" For it might perhaps be thought that he spoke of one who had not fulfilled the command of the gospel, but had kept back something for himself, as some half-hearted persons do. But he says \"Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,\" i.e., even if my renunciation of those earthly riches be perfect. And to this renunciation he adds something still greater: \"And though I give my body to be burned, but have not charity, I am nothing:\" As if he had said in other words, though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor in accordance with that command in the gospel, where we are told \"If thou wilt be perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven,\"[fn-38-P3845_1435398:27-nf] renouncing them so as to keep back nothing at all for myself, and though to this distribution (of my goods) I should by the burning of my flesh add martyrdom so as to give up my body for Christ, and yet be impatient, or passionate or envious or proud, or excited by wrongs done by others, or seek what is mine, or indulge in evil thoughts, or not be ready and patient in bearing all that can be inflicted on me, this renunciation and the burning of the outer man will profit me nothing, while the inner man is still involved in the former sins, because, while in the fervour of the early days of my conversion I made light of the mere worldly substance, which is said to be not good or evil in itself but indifferent, I took no care to cast out in like manner the injurious powers of a bad heart, or to attain to that love of the Lord which is patient, which is \"kind, which envieth not, is not puffed up, is not soon angry, dealeth not perversely, seeketh not her own, thinketh no evil,\" which \"beareth all things, endureth all things,\"[fn-38-P3846_1436459:28-nf] and which lastly never suffers him who follows after it to fall by the deceitfulness of sin.","title":"III.

Still further did He also make it manifest, that we ought, after our calling, to be also adorned with works of righteousness, so that the Spirit of God may rest upon us; for this is the wedding garment, of which also the apostle speaks, \"Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up by immortality.\"[fn-87-P8791_2499115:580-nf] But those who have indeed been called to God's supper, yet have not received the Holy Spirit, because of their wicked conduct \"shall be,\" He declares, \"cast into outer darkness.\"[fn-87-P8792_2499314:581-nf] He thus clearly shows that the very same King who gathered from all quarters the faithful to the marriage of His Son, and who grants them the incorruptible banquet, [also] orders that man to be cast into outer darkness who has not on a wedding garment, that is, one who despises it. For as in the former covenant, \"with many of them was He not well pleased; \"[fn-87-P8793_2499697:582-nf] so also is it the case here, that \"many are called, but few chosen.\"[fn-87-P8794_2499786:583-nf] It is not, then, one God who judges, and another Father who calls us together to salvation; nor one, forsooth, who confers eternal light, but another who orders those who have not on the wedding garment to be sent into outer darkness. But it is one and the same God, the Father of our Lord, from whom also the prophets had their mission, who does indeed, through His infinite kindness, call the unworthy; but He examines those who are called, [to ascertain] if they have on the garment fit and proper for the marriage of His Son, because nothing unbecoming or evil pleases Him. This is in accordance with what the Lord said to the man who had been healed: \"Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.\"[fn-87-P8795_2500544:584-nf] For he who is good, and righteous, and pure, and spotless, will endure nothing evil, nor unjust, nor detestable in His wedding chamber. This is the Father of our Lord, by whose providence all things consist, and all are administered by His command; and He confers His free gifts upon those who should [receive them]; but the most righteous Retributor metes out [punishment] according to their deserts, most deservedly, to the ungrateful and to those that are insensible of His kindness; and therefore does He say, \"He sent His armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.\"[fn-87-P8796_2501156:585-nf] He says here, \"His armies,\" because all men are the property of God. For \"the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all that dwell therein.\"[fn-87-P8797_2501342:586-nf] Wherefore also the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the Romans, \"For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive unto themselves condemnation. For rulers are not for a terror to a good work, but to an evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same; for he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, the avenger for wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. For this cause pay ye tribute also; for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.\"[fn-87-P8798_2502210:587-nf] Both the Lord, then, and the apostles announce as the one only God the Father, Him who gave the law, who sent the prophets, who made all things; and therefore does, He say, \"He sent His armies,\" because every man, inasmuch as he is a man, is His workmanship, although he may be ignorant of his God.

For if the earnest, gathering man into itself, does even now cause him to cry, \"Abba, Father,\" what shall the complete grace of the Spirit effect, which shall be given to men by God? It will render us like unto Him, and accomplish the will[fn-89-P8989_2586853:51-nf] of the Father; for it shall make man after the image and likeness of God.

For immediately following, in the same Epistle, he says conclusively, speaking thus in reference to the flesh: \"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So, when this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O death, where is thy victory? \"[fn-90-P9069_2619910:101-nf] Now these words shall be appropriately said at the time when this mortal and corruptible flesh, which is subject to death, which also is pressed down by a certain dominion of death, rising up into life, shall put on incorruption and immortality. For then, indeed, shall death be truly vanquished, when that flesh which is held down by it shall go forth from under its dominion. And again, to the Philippians he says: \"But our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, who shall transfigure the body of our humiliation conformable to the body of His glory, even as He is able (ita ut possit) according to the working of His own power.\"[fn-90-P9070_2620610:102-nf] What, then, is this \"body of humiliation\" which the Lord shall transfigure, [so as to be] conformed to \"the body of His glory? \"Plainly it is this body composed of flesh, which is indeed humbled when it falls into the earth. Now its transformation [takes place thus], that while it is mortal and corruptible, it becomes immortal and incorruptible, not after its own proper substance, but after the mighty working of the Lord, who is able to invest the mortal with immortality, and the corruptible with incorruption. And therefore he says,[fn-90-P9071_2621176:103-nf] \"that mortality may be swallowed up of life.He who has perfected us for this very thing is God, who also has given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.\"[fn-90-P9072_2621624:104-nf] He uses these words most manifestly in reference to the flesh; for the soul is not mortal, neither is the spirit. Now, what is mortal shall be swallowed up of life, when the flesh is dead no longer, but remains living and incorruptible, hymning the praises of God, who has perfected us for this very thing. In order, therefore, that we may be perfected for this, aptly does he say to the Corinthians, \"Glorify God in your body.\"[fn-90-P9073_2622073:105-nf] Now God is He who gives rise to immortality.","title":"Book V.","author":"Irenaeus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":1,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_62_book_vii_","source_chapter":33,"source_paragraph":"137","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Celsus next assails the doctrine of the resurrection, which is a high and difficult doctrine, and one which more than others requires a high and advanced degree of wisdom to set forth how worthy it is of God; and how sublime a truth it is which teaches us that there is a seminal principle lodged in that which Scripture speaks of as the \"tabernacle\" of the soul, in which the righteous \"do groan, being burdened, not for that they would be unclothed, but clothed upon.\"[fn-110-P11007_2962427:67-nf] Celsus ridicules this doctrine because he does not understand it, and because he has learnt it from ignorant persons, who were unable to support it on any reasonable grounds.

But instead of instructing us as he ought, he abuses us; and while he should have shown his goodwill to those whom he addresses at the outset of his discourse, he stigmatizes as \"a cowardly race\" men who would rather die than abjure Christianity even by a word, and who are ready to suffer every form of torture, or any kind of death.

All true Christians therefore have the eye of the mind sharpened, and the eye of sense closed; so that each one, according to the degree in which his better eye is quickened, and the eye of sense darkened, sees and knows the Supreme God, and His Son, who is the Word, Wisdom, and so forth.","title":"Book VII.","author":"Origen"},{"chapter":5,"verse":6,"source_code":"anf_04_anf04_62_book_vii_","source_chapter":51,"source_paragraph":"173","folder":"ANF-04","text":"Celsus has not explained how error accompanies the \"becoming,\" or product of generation; nor has he expressed himself with sufficient clearness to enable us to compare his ideas with ours, and to pass judgment on them.

But the Fathers, perceiving their craft and the cunning of their irreligion, were forced to express more distinctly the sense of the words `from God.' Accordingly, they wrote `from the essence of God[fn-33-P3372_1330601:141-nf] ,' in order that `from God' might not be considered common and equal in the Son and in things originate, but that all others might be acknowledged as creatures, and the Word alone as from the Father.

For neither are other things as the Son, nor is the Word one among others, for He is Lord and Framer of all; and on this account did the Holy Council declare expressly that He was of the essence[fn-33-P3376_1335123:145-nf] of the Father, that we might believe the Word to be other than the nature of things originate, being alone truly from God; and that no subterfuge should be left open to the irreligious.

Neither has the full display of leaves taken away the room for the fruit, nor the full display of the fruit driven off the abundance of leaves. It is full of both; but the one the wind searcheth out, the other the husbandman gathereth in.

And when this man could not be brought back to the way of the right faith by many exhortations of the holy presbyter Paphnutius, because this view seemed to him a novelty, and one that was not ever known to or handed down by his predecessors, it chanced that a certain deacon, a man of very great learning, named Photinus, arrived from the region of Cappadocia with the desire of visiting the brethren living in the same desert: whom the blessed Paphnutius received with the warmest welcome, and in order to confirm the faith which had been stated in the letters of the aforesaid Bishop, placed him in the midst and asked him before all the brethren how the Catholic Churches throughout the East interpreted the passage in Genesis where it says \"Let us make man after our image and likeness.\"[fn-50-P5031_1810016:5-nf] And when he explained that the image and likeness of God was taken by all the leaders of the churches not according to the base sound of the letters, but spiritually, and supported this very fully and by many passages of Scripture, and showed that nothing of this sort could happen to that infinite and incomprehensible and invisible glory, so that it could be comprised in a human form and likeness, since its nature is incorporeal and uncompounded and simple, and what can neither be apprehended by the eyes nor conceived by the mind, at length the old man was shaken by the numerous and very weighty assertions of this most learned man, and was drawn to the faith of the Catholic tradition. And when both Abbot Paphnutius and all of us were filled with intense delight at his adhesion, for this reason; viz., that the Lord had not permitted a man of such age and crowned with such virtues, and one who erred only from ignorance and rustic simplicity, to wander from the path of the right faith up to the very last, and when we arose to give thanks, and were all together offering up our prayers to the Lord, the old man was so bewildered in mind during his prayer because he felt that the Anthropomorphic image of the Godhead which he used to set before himself in prayer, was banished from his heart, that on a sudden he burst into a flood of bitter tears and continual sobs, and cast himself down on the ground and exclaimed with strong groanings: \"Alas! wretched man that I am! they have taken away my God from me, and I have now none to lay hold of; and whom to worship and address I know not.\" By which scene we were terribly disturbed, and moreover with the effect of the former Conference still remaining in our hearts, we returned to Abbot Isaac, whom when we saw close at hand, we addressed with these words.","title":"X.

Again, what eyes did He look for when He spake to those who saw indeed, but who saw only with the eyes of the flesh? For when Philip said to Him, \"Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us;\"[fn-46-P4681_2004302:8-nf] he understood indeed that if the Father were shown him, it might well suffice him; but how would the Father suffice him whom He that was equal to the Father sufficed not? And why did He not suffice? Because He was not seen. And why was He not seen? Because the eye whereby He might be seen was not yet whole. For this, namely, that the Lord was seen in the flesh with the outward eyes, not only the disciples who honoured Him saw, but also the Jews who crucified Him. He then who wished to be seen in another way, sought for other eyes. And therefore it was that to him who said, \"Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us;\" He answered, \"Have I been so long time with you; and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? He who hath seen Me, hath seen the Father also.\"[fn-46-P4682_2005080:9-nf] And that He might in the mean while heal the eyes of faith, he has first of all instructions given him regarding faith, that so he might attain to sight. And lest Philip should think that he was to conceive of God under the same form in which he then saw the Lord Jesus Christ in the body, he immediately subjoined; \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me?\"[fn-46-P4683_2005481:10-nf] He had already said, \"He who hath seen Me, hath seen the Father also.\" But Philip's eye was not yet sound enough to see the Father, nor consequently to see the Son who is Himself Coequal with the Father. And so Jesus Christ took in hand to cure, and with the medicines and salve of faith to strengthen the eyes of his mind, which as yet were weak and unable to behold so great a light, and He said, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me?\" Let not him then who cannot yet see what the Lord will one day show him, seek first to see what he is to believe; but let him first believe that the eye by which he is to see may be healed. For it was only the form of the servant which was exhibited to the eyes of servants; because if \"He who thought it not robbery to be equal with God,\"[fn-46-P4684_2006307:11-nf] could have been now seen as equal with God by those whom He wished to be healed, He would not have needed to \"empty Himself, and to take the form of a servant.\" But because there was no way whereby God could be seen, but whereby man could be seen, there was; therefore He who was God was made man, that that which was seen might heal that whereby He was not seen. For He saith Himself in another place, \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\"[fn-46-P4685_2006785:12-nf] Philip might of course have answered and said, \"Lord, lo, I see Thee; is the Father such as I see Thee to be? forasmuch as Thou hast said, `He who hath seen Me, hath seen the Father also'?\" But before Philip answered thus, or perhaps before he so much as thought it, when the Lord had said, \"He who hath seen Me, hath seen the Father also;\" He immediately added, \"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me?\" For with that eye he could, not yet see either the Father, or the Son who isequal with the Father; but that his eye might be healed for seeing, he was to be anointed unto believing. So then before thou seest what thou canst not now see, believe what as yet thou seest not. \"Walk by faith,\" that thou mayest attain to sight.

It changeth not, is not shaken, doth not depart away. For He did not so come to us, as to depart from the Father; nor did He so ascend as to change His place.

For it is an impossibility for an impure mind to gain the gift of spiritual knowledge. And therefore with every possible care avoid this, lest through your zeal for reading there arise in you not the light of knowledge nor the lasting glory which is promised through the light that comes from learning but only the instruments of your destruction from vain arrogance. Next you must by all means strive to get rid of all anxiety and worldly thoughts, and give yourself over assiduously or rather continuously, to sacred reading, until continual meditation fills your heart, and fashions you so to speak after its own likeness, making of it, in a way, an ark of the testimony,[fn-55-P5506_1972330:28-nf] which has within it two tables of stone, i.e., the constant assurance of the two testaments;[fn-55-P5507_1972447:29-nf] and a golden pot, i.e., a pure and undefiled memory which preserves by a constant tenacity the manna stored up in it, i.e., the enduring and heavenly sweetness of the spiritual sense and the bread of angels; moreover also the rod of Aaron, i.e., the saving standard of Jesus Christ our true High Priest, that ever buds with the freshness of immortal memory. For this is the rod which after it had been cut from the root of Jesse, died and flourished again with a more vigorous life. But all these are guarded by two Cherubim, i.e., the fulness of historical and spiritual knowledge. For the Cherubim mean a multitude of knowledge: and these continually protect the mercy seat of God, i.e., the peace of your heart, and overshadow it from all the assaults of spiritual wickedness. And so your soul will be carried forward not only to the ark of the Divine Covenant, but also to the priestly kingdom, and owing to its unbroken love of purity being as it were engrossed in spiritual studies, will fulfil the command given to the priests, enjoined as follows by the giver of the Law: \"And he shall not go forth from the sanctuary, lest he pollute the Sanctuary of God,\"[fn-55-P5508_1973853:30-nf] i.e., his heart, in which the Lord promised that he would ever dwell, saying: \"I will dwell in them and will walk among them.\"[fn-55-P5509_1973999:31-nf] Wherefore the whole series of the Holy Scriptures should be diligently committed to memory and ceaselessly repeated.

So that when we are at rest, and as it were plunged in the stupor of sleep, there is revealed to us the understanding of the most secret meanings, of which in our waking hours we had not the remotest conception.","title":"XIV.

This is not written. The Master of the house saw him, the Master of the house discovered, the Master of the house inspected, the Master of the house separated him out. It was not right to pass over this. But I have undertaken to establish another point, how that that one signifies many. \"The Master of the house\" then \"came in to see the guests, and He found there a man which had not on a wedding garment. And He saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.\"[fn-48-P4845_2077206:15-nf] For He who questioned him was One, to whom he could give no feigned reply. The garment that was looked for is in the heart, not on the body; for had it been put on externally, it could not have been concealed even from the servants. Where that wedding garment must be put on, hear in the words, \"Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness.\"[fn-48-P4846_2077571:16-nf] Of that garment the Apostle speaks,[fn-48-P4847_2077627:17-nf] \"If so be that we shall be found clothed, and not naked.\"[fn-48-P4848_2077736:18-nf] Therefore was he discovered by the Lord, who escaped the notice of the servants. Being questioned, he is speechless: he is bound, cast out, and condemned one by many. I have said, Lord, that Thou teachest us that in this Thou dost give warning to all. Recollect then with me, my Brethren, the words which ye have heard, and ye will at once discover, at once determine, that that one was many. True it was one man whom the Lord questioned, to one He said, \"Friend, how camest thou in hither?\" It was one who was speechless, and of that same one was it said, \"Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\"[fn-48-P4849_2078417:19-nf] Why? \"For many are called, but few chosen.\"[fn-48-P4850_2078482:20-nf] How can any one gainsay this manifestation of the truth? \"Cast him,\" He saith, \"into outer darkness.\" \"Him,\" that one man assuredly, of whom the Lord saith, \"for many are called, but few chosen.\" So then it is the few who are not cast out. He was it is true but one man \"who had not the wedding garment. Cast him out.\" But why is he cast out? \"For many are called, but few chosen.\" Leave alone the few, cast out the many. It is true, that man was but one. Yet undoubtedly that one not only was many, but those many in numbers far surpassed the number of the good. For the good are many also; but in comparison of the bad, they are few. In the crop there is much wheat; compare it with the chaff, and the grains of corn are few. The same persons considered in themselves are many, in comparison with the bad are few. How do we prove that in themselves they are many? \"Many shall come from the East and from the West.\" Whither shall they come? To that feast, into which both good and bad enter. But speaking of another feast, He subjoined, \"and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.\"[fn-48-P4851_2079623:21-nf] That is the feast to which the bad shall not approach. Be that feast which now is, received worthily, that we may attain to the other. The same then are many, who are also few; in themselves many; in comparison with the bad few. Therefore what saith the Lord? He found one, and said, \"Let the many be cast out, the few remain.\" For to say, \"many are called, but few chosen,\" is nothing else than to show plainly who in this present feast are accounted to be such, as to be brought to that other feast, where no bad men shall come.","title":"Sermon XL.

To provide against this also, He sends His own Son, and He becomes Son of Man, by taking created flesh; that, since all were under sentence of death, He, being other than them all, might Himself for all offer to death His own body; and that henceforth, as if all land died through Him, the word of that sentence might be accomplished (for `all died[fn-63-P6366_2537229:472-nf] ' in Christ), and all through Him might thereupon become free from sin and from the curse which came upon it, and might truly abide[fn-63-P6367_2537382:473-nf] for ever, risen from the dead and clothed in immortality and incorruption. For the Word being clothed in the flesh, as has many times been explained, every bite of the serpent began to be utterly staunched from out it; and whatever evil sprung from the motions of the flesh, to be cut away, and with these death also was abolished, the companion of sin, as the Lord Himself says[fn-63-P6368_2537829:474-nf] , `The prince of this world cometh, and findeth nothing in Me;' and `For this end was He manifested,' as John has written, `that He might destroy the works of the devil[fn-63-P6369_2538052:475-nf] .'

Nor is this Form[fn-65-P6550_2598625:50-nf] of the Godhead partial merely, but the fulness of the Father's Godhead is the Being of the Son, and the Son is whole God. Therefore also, being equal to God, He `thought it not a prize to be equal to God;' and again since the Godhead and the Form of the Son is none other's than the Father's[fn-65-P6551_2598950:51-nf] , this is what He says, `I in the Father.' Thus `God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself[fn-65-P6552_2599442:52-nf] ;' for the propriety of the Father's Essence is that Son, in whom the creation was then reconciled with God. Thus what things the Son then wrought are the Father's works, for the Son is the Form of that Godhead of the Father, which wrought the works. And thus he who looks at the Son, sees the Father; for in the Father's Godhead is and is contemplated the Son; and the Father's Form which is in Him shews in Him the Father; and thus the Father is in the Son. And that propriety and Godhead which is from the Father in the Son, shews the Son in the Father, and His inseparability from Him; and whoso hears and beholds that what is said of the Father is also said of the Son, not as accruing to His Essence by grace or participation, but because the very Being of the Son is the proper Offspring of the Father's Essence, will fitly understand the words, as I said before, `I in the Father, and the Father in Me;' and `I and the Father are One[fn-65-P6553_2600403:53-nf] .' For the Son is such as the Father is, because He has all that is the Father's. Wherefore also is He implied together with the Father. For, a son not being, one cannot say father; whereas when we call God a Maker, we do not of necessity intimate the things which have come to be; for a maker is before his works[fn-65-P6554_2600748:54-nf] . But when we call God Father, at once with the Father we signify the Son's existence. Therefore also he who believes in the Son, believes also in the Father: for he believes in what is proper to the Father's Essence; and thus the faith is one in one God. And he who worships and honours the Son, in the Son worships and honours the Father; for one is the Godhead; and therefore one[fn-65-P6555_2601405:55-nf] the honour and one the worship which is paid to the Father in and through the Son. And he who thus worships, worships one God; for there is one God and none other than He. Accordingly when the Father is called the only God, and we read that there is one God[fn-65-P6556_2601781:56-nf] , and `I am,' and `beside Me there is no God,' and `I the first and I the last[fn-65-P6557_2601879:57-nf] ,' this has a fit meaning.

And He too is the First, as the Fulness of the Godhead of the First and Only, being whole and full God[fn-65-P6559_2602312:59-nf] .

Simply in this, as he himself says, that they might recognize a Divine Christ born according to the flesh, of their own flesh.

He did not conceal his belief, he made no delay. He did not any longer protract his erroneous ideas by deliberating and disbelieving, but as soon as he heard from heaven the name of Jesus his Lord, he replied in a voice, subdued like that of a servant, tremulous like that of one scourged, and full of fervour like that of one converted, \"What shall I do, Lord?\" And so at once for his ready and earnest faith, it was granted to him that He should never be without His presence whom he had faithfully believed: and that He, to whom he had passed in heart, should Himself pass into his heart: as the Apostle himself says of himself: \"Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me?\"[fn-70-P7010_2540304:13-nf] ","title":"Book III.","author":"John Cassian"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_11_npnf2_11_82_book_iv_","source_chapter":13,"source_paragraph":"47","folder":"NPNF2-11","text":"\"The labour,\" says he, \"of Egypt, and the merchandize of Ethiopia, and the Sabaeans, men of stature shall come over to thee.\" No one can doubt that in these names of different nations is signified the coming of the nations who were to believe.

But there can be no doubt that where there is single-minded love of the Lord, there is also single-minded delight in chains worn for the Lord's sake: as it is written: \"But the multitude of the believers was of one heart and one soul.\"[fn-71-P7148_2606299:33-nf] \"And they shall worship thee,\" he says, \"and shall make supplication to thee: for in thee is God, and there is no God beside thee.\" The Apostle clearly explains the prophet's words, when he says that \"God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself.\"[fn-71-P7149_2606573:34-nf] \"In Thee then,\" he says, \"is God and there is no God beside thee.\" When the prophet says \"In Thee is God,\" most admirably does he point not merely to Him who was visible, but to Him who was in what was visible, distinguishing the indweller from Him in whom He dwelt, by pointing out the two natures, not by denying the unity(of Person).

From this bondage, then, we are set free by the Lord alone. He who had it not, Himself delivers us from it; for He alone came without sin in the flesh. For the little ones whom you see carried in their mothers' hands cannot yet walk, and are already in fetters; for they have received from Adam what they are loosened from by Christ. To them also, when baptized, pertains that grace which is promised by the Lord; for He only can deliver from sin who came without sin, and was made a sacrifice for sin. For you heard when the apostle was read: \"We are ambassadors,\" he says, \"for Christ, as though God were exhorting you by us; we beseech you in Christ's stead,\"-that is, as if Christ were beseeching you, and for what? -\"to be reconciled unto God.\" If the apostle exhorts and beseeches us to be reconciled unto God, then were we enemies to God. For no one is reconciled unless from a state of enmity. And we have become enemies not by nature, but by sin. From the same source are we the servants of sin, that we are the enemies of God. God has no enemies in a state of freedom. They must be slaves; and slaves will they remain unless delivered by Him to whom they wished by their sins to be enemies. Therefore, says be, \"We beseech you in Christ's stead to be reconciled unto God.\" But how are we reconciled, save by the removal of that which separates between us and Himself? For He says by the prophet, \"He hath not made the ear heavy that it should not hear; but your iniquities have separated between you and your God.\"[fn-17-P1739_1105187:11-nf] And so, then, we are not reconciled, unless that which is in the midst is taken away, and something else is put in its place.

The separating medium is sin, the reconciling Mediator is the Lord Jesus Christ: \"For there is one God and Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.\"[fn-17-P1740_1105585:12-nf] To take then away the separating wall, which is sin, that Mediator has come, and the priest has Himself become the sacrifice.

And they wished to set down in writing the acknowledged language of Scripture, namely that the Word is of God by nature Only-begotten, Power, Wisdom of the Father, Very God, as John says, and as Paul wrote, brightness of the Father's glory and express image of His person[fn-78-P7861_3148329:22-nf] .

But the Bishops, beholding their craftiness, and the cunning of their impiety, expressed more plainly the sense of the words `of God,' by writing that the Son is of the Essence of God, so that whereas the Creatures, since they do not exist of themselves without a cause, but have a beginning of their existence, are said to be `of God,' the Son alone might be deemed proper to the Essence of the Father. For this is peculiar to one who is Only-begotten and true Word in relation to a Father, and this was the reason why the words `of the essence' were adopted. Again[fn-78-P7865_3149446:26-nf] , upon the bishops asking the dissembling minority if they agreed that the Son was not a Creature, but the Power and only Wisdom of the Father, and the Eternal Image, in all respects exact, of the Father, and true God, Eusebius and his fellows were observed exchanging nods with one another, as much as to say `this applies to us men also, for we too are called \"the image and glory of God[fn-78-P7866_3149869:27-nf] ,\" and of us it is said, \"For we which live are alway[fn-78-P7867_3149942:28-nf] ,\" and there are many Powers, and \"all the power[fn-78-P7868_3150046:29-nf] of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt,\" while the caterpillar and the locust are called His \"great power[fn-78-P7869_3150182:30-nf] .\" And \"the Lord of powers[fn-78-P7870_3150227:31-nf] is with us, the God of Jacob is our help.\" For we hold that we are proper[fn-78-P7871_3150329:32-nf] to God, and not merely so, but insomuch that He has even called us brethren.

For to me it seems but pious to say that the Son of God stood in need of nothing whatsoever in the way of making good His advent upon earth; and that He in no sense required either the dove, or baptism, or mother, or brethren, or even mayhap a father,-which father, however, according to your view, was Joseph; but that He descended altogether by Himself alone, and transformed Himself, according to His own good pleasure, into the semblance of a man, in accordance with that word of Paul which tells us that \"He was found in fashion as a man.\"[fn-39-P3905_1112474:615-nf] Show me, therefore, what thing He could possibly need who was able to transform Himself into all manner of appearances. For when He chose to do so, He again transformed this human fashion[fn-39-P3906_1112682:616-nf] and mien into the likeness of the sun.But if you gainsay me once more, and decline to acknowledge that I state the faith correctly, listen to my definition of the position in which you stand. For if you say that He was only man as born of Mary,[fn-39-P3907_1112943:617-nf] and that He received the Spirit at His baptism, it will follow that He will be made out to be Son by increase[fn-39-P3908_1113093:618-nf] and not by nature. If, however, I grant you to say that He is Son according to increase,[fn-39-P3909_1113216:619-nf] and that He was made as a man, your opinion is that He is really a man, that is to say, one who is flesh and blood.[fn-39-P3910_1113370:620-nf] But then it will necessarily follow that the Spirit also who appeared like a dove was nothing else than a natural dove. For the two expressions are the same,-namely, \"as a man\" and \"like[fn-39-P3911_1113735:621-nf] a dove; \"and consequently whatever may be the view you take of the one passage which uses the phrase \"as a man,\" you ought to hold that same view[fn-39-P3912_1113896:622-nf] also of this other passage in which the expression \"like a dove\" is used. It is a clear matter of necessity to take these things in the same way, for only thus can we find out the real sense of what is written concerning Him in the Scriptures. Archelaus said: As you cannot do so much for yourself, like a thorough master of your art, so neither should I care to put this question right and with all patience to make it clear, and to give the evident solution of the difficulty,[fn-39-P3913_1114476:623-nf] were it not for the sake of those who are present with us, and who listen to us. For this reason, therefore, I shall also explain the answer that ought to be given to this question as it may be done most appropriately. It does not seem to you, then, to be a pious thing to say that Jesus had a mother in Mary; and you hold a similar view on certain other positions which you have now been discussing in terms which I, for my part, altogether shrink from repeating.[fn-39-P3914_1115143:624-nf] Now, sometimes a master of any art happens to be compelled by the ignorance of an opponent both to say and to do things which time would make him decline;[fn-39-P3915_1115621:625-nf] and accordingly, because the necessity is laid upon me, by consideration for the multitude present, I may give a brief answer to those statements which have been made so erroneously by you. Let us suppose, now, your allegation to be that if we understand Jesus to be a man made of Mary after the course of nature, and regard him consequently as having flesh and blood, it will be necessary also to hold that the Holy Spirit was a real dove, and not a spirit. Well, then, how can a real dove enter into a real man, and abide in him? For flesh cannot enter into flesh. Nay rather, it is only when we acknowledge Jesus to be a true man, and also hold him who is there said to be like a dove to be the Holy Spirit, that we shall give the correct account according to reason on both sides. For, according to right reason, it may be said that the Spirit dwells in a man, and descends upon him, and abides in him; and these, indeed, are things which have happened already in all due competence, and the occurrence of which is always possible still, as even you yourself admit, inasmuch as you did aforetime profess to be the Paraclete of God, you flint,[fn-39-P3916_1116868:626-nf] as I may call you, and no man, so often forgetful of the very things which you assert. For you declared that the Spirit whom Jesus promised to send has come upon you; and whence can He come but by descending from Heaven? And if the Spirit descends thus on the man worthy of Him, then verily must we fancy that real doves descended upon you? Then truly should we rather discover in you the thieving dove-merchant,[fn-39-P3917_1117557:627-nf] who lays snares and lines for the birds. For surely you well deserve to be made a jest of with words of ridicule. However, I spare you, lest perchance I appear to offend the auditors by such expressions, and also most especially because it is beside my purpose to throw out against you all that you deserve to hear said about you. But let me return to the proper subject. For I am mindful of that transformation of thine,[fn-39-P3918_1118005:628-nf] in virtue of which you say that God has transformed Himself into the fashion of a man or into that of the sun, by which position you think to prove that our Jesus was made man only in fashion and in appearance; which assertion may God save: any of the faithful from making. Now, for the rest, that opinion of yours would reduce the whole matter to a dream, so far as we are concerned, and to mere figures; and not that only,[fn-39-P3919_1118480:629-nf] but the very name of an advent would be done away: for He might have done what He desired to do, though still seated in heaven, if He is, as you say, a spirit, and not a true man. But it is not thus that \"He humbled Himself, and took the form of a servant; \"[fn-39-P3920_1118899:630-nf] and I say this of Him who was made man of Mary. For what? Might not we, too, have set forth things like those with which you have been dealing, and that, too, all the more easily and the more broadly? But far be it from us to swerve one jot or one tittle from the truth. For He who was born of Mary is the Son, who chose of His own accord to sustain this[fn-39-P3921_1119274:631-nf] mighty conflict,-namely, Jesus. This is the Christ of God, who descended upon him who is of Mary. If, however, you refuse to believe even the voice that was heard from heaven, all that you can bring forward in place of the same is but some rashness of your own; and though you were to declare yourself on that, no one would believe you. For forthwith Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil; and as the devil had no correct knowledge of Him, he said to Him, \"If thou be the Son of God.\"[fn-39-P3922_1119877:632-nf] Besides, he did not understand the reason of this bearing of the Son of God by Mary, who preached the kingdom of heaven, whose was also indeed a great tabernacle,[fn-39-P3923_1120060:633-nf] and one that could not have been prepared by any other:[fn-39-P3924_1120182:634-nf] whence, too, He who was nailed to the cross, on rising again from the dead, was taken up thither where Christ the Son of God reigned; so that when He begins to conduct His judgment, those who have been ignorant of Him shall look on Him whom they pierced.[fn-39-P3925_1120791:635-nf] But in order to secure your credence, I propose this question to you: Why was it, that although His disciples sojourned a whole year with Him, not one of them fell prostrate on his face before Him, as you were saying a little ago, save only in that one hour when His countenance shone like the sun? Was it not by reason of that tabernacle which had been made for Him of Mary? For just as no other had the capacity sufficient for sustaining the burden of the Paraclete except only the disciples and the blessed Paul, so also no other was able to bear the Spirit who descended from heaven, and through whom that voice of the Father gave its testimony in these terms, \"This is my beloved Son,\"[fn-39-P3926_1121503:636-nf] save only He who was born of Mary, and who is above all the saints,-namely, Jesus. But now give us your answer to those matters which I bring forward against you. If you hold that He is than only in mien and form, how could He have been laid hold of and dragged off to judgment by those who were born of man and woman-to wit, the Pharisees-seeing that a spiritual body cannot be grasped by bodies of grosser capacities? But if you, who as yet have made no reply to the arguments brought before you, have now any kind of answer to offer to the word and proposition I have adduced, proceed, I pray you, and fetch me at least a handful or some fair modicum of your sunlight.[fn-39-P3927_1122197:637-nf] But that very sun, indeed, inasmuch as it is possessed of a more subtle body, is capable of covering and enveloping you; while you, on the other hand, can do it no injury, even although you were to trample it under foot. My Lord Jesus, however, if He was laid hold of, was laid hold of as a man by men. If He is not a man, neither was He laid hold of. If He was not laid hold of, neither did He suffer, nor was He baptized. If He was not baptized, neither is any of us baptized. But if there is no baptism, neither will there be any remission of sins, but every man will die in his own sins. Manes said: Is baptism, then, given on account of the remission of sins? Archelaus said: Certainly. Manes said: Does it not follow, then, that Christ has sinned, seeing that He has been baptized? Archelaus said: God forbid! Nay, rather, He was made sin for us, taking on Him our sins.[fn-39-P3928_1123133:638-nf] For this reason He was born of a woman, and for this reason also He approached the rite of baptism, in order that He might receive the purification of this part,[fn-39-P3929_1123316:639-nf] and that thus the body which He had taken to Himself might be capable of bearing the Spirit, who had descended in the form of a dove.","title":"The Acts of the Disputation with the Heresiarch Manes.","author":"Archelaus"},{"chapter":5,"verse":19,"source_code":"npnf2_12_npnf2_12_204_sermon_lxiii_on_the_passion_xii_preached_on_wednesday_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"10","folder":"NPNF2-12","text":"The glory, dearly-beloved, of the Lord's Passion, on which we promised to speak again to-day, is chiefly wonderful for its mystery of humility, which has both ransomed and instructed us all, that He, Who paid the price, might also impart His righteousness to us.

And then He adds, \"Nevertheless I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you:\" as if He had said, It is expedient for you that this form of a servant be taken away from you; as the Word made indeed flesh I dwell among you; but I would not that ye should continue to love me carnally, and, content with such milk, desire to remain infants always. \"It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you.\" If I withdraw not the tender nutriment wherewith I have nourished you, ye will acquire no keen relish of solid food; if ye adhere in a carnal way to the flesh, ye will not have room for the Spirit.

If we ought to advance our argument yet further, and turn our inspection to higher themes, let us contemplate the divine nature of the Holy Spirit specially flora the following point of view. In Scripture we find mention of three creations. The first is the evolution from non-being into being.[fn-27-P2734_922103:72-nf] The second is change from the worse to the better. The third is the resurrection of the dead. In these you will find the Holy Ghost cooperating with the Father and the Son. There is a bringing into existence of the heavens; and what says David? \"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.\"[fn-27-P2735_922884:73-nf] Again, man is created through baptism, for \"if any man be in Christ he is a new creature.\"[fn-27-P2736_923038:74-nf] And why does the Saviour say to the disciples, \"Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost\"? Here too you see the Holy Ghost present with the Father and the Son. And what would you say also as to the resurrection of the dead when we shall have failed and returned to our dust? Dust we are and unto dust we shall return.[fn-27-P2737_923451:75-nf] And He will send the Holy Ghost and create us and renew the face of the earth.[fn-27-P2738_923553:76-nf] For what the holy Paul calls resurrection David describes as renewal. Let us hear, once more, him who was caught into the third heaven. What does he say? \"You are the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you.\"[fn-27-P2739_923786:77-nf] Now every temple[fn-27-P2740_923823:78-nf] is a temple of God, and if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost, then the Holy Ghost is God. It is also called Solomon's temple, but this is in the sense of his being its builder. And if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost in this sense, then the Holy Ghost is God, for \"He that built all things is God.\"[fn-27-P2741_924303:79-nf] If we are a temple of one who is worshipped, and who dwells in us, let us confess Him to be God, for thou shale worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shall thou serve.[fn-27-P2742_924490:80-nf] Supposing them to object to the word \"God,\" let them learn what this word means. God is called Qeo\\j either because He placed (teqeike/nai) all things or because He beholds (Qea=sqai) all things. If He is called Qeo\\j because He \"placed\" or \"beholds\" all things, and the Spirit knoweth all the things of God, as the Spirit in us knoweth our things, then the Holy Ghost is God.[fn-27-P2743_924902:81-nf] Again, if the sword of the spirit is the word of God,[fn-27-P2744_925167:82-nf] then the Holy Ghost is God, inasmuch as the sword belongs to Him of whom it is also called the word. Is He named the right hand of the Father? For \"the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass;\"[fn-27-P2745_925393:83-nf] and \"thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.\"[fn-27-P2746_925532:84-nf] But the Holy Ghost is the finger of God, as it is said \"if I by the finger of God cast out devils,\"[fn-27-P2747_925648:85-nf] of which the version in another Gospel is \"if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils.\"[fn-27-P2748_925753:86-nf] So the Holy Ghost is of the same nature as the Father and the Son.","title":"Letter VIII","author":"St. Basil"},{"chapter":5,"verse":1,"source_code":"npnf2_08_npnf2_08_274_letter_cclvi_","source_chapter":1,"source_paragraph":"3","folder":"NPNF2-08","text":"News has reached me of the severe persecution carried on against you, and how directly after Easter the men who fast for strife and debate[fn-58-P5803_1820620:3-nf] attacked your homes, and gave your labours to the flames, preparing for you indeed a house in the heavens, not made with hands.[fn-58-P5804_1820765:4-nf] but for themselves laying up in store the fire which they had used to your hurt. I no sooner heard of this than I groaned over what had happened; pitying not you, my brethren, (God forbid!) but the men who are so sunk in wickedness as to carry their evil deeds to such an extent. I expected you all to hurry at once to the refuge prepared for you in my humble self; and I hoped that the Lord would give me refreshment in the midst of my continual troubles in embracing you, and in receiving on this inactive body of mine the noble sweat which you are dropping for the truth's sake, and so having some share in the prizes laid tip for you by the Judge of truth. But this did not enter into year minds, and you did not even expect any relief at my hands. I was therefore at least anxious to find frequent opportunities of writing to you, to the end that like those who cheer on combatants in the arena, I might myself by letter give you some encouragement in your good fight. For two reasons, however, I have not found this easy. In the first place, I did not know where you were residing. And, secondly, but few of our people travel in your direction. Now the Lord has brought us the very well beloved and reverend brother Sanctissimus, the presbyter. By him I am able to salute you, and I beseech you to pray for me, rejoicing and exulting that your reward is great in heaven,[fn-58-P5805_1822158:5-nf] and that you have freedom with the Lord to cease not day and night calling on Him to put an end to this storm of the Churches; to grant the shepherds to their flocks, and that the Church may return to her proper dignity. I am persuaded that if a voice be found to move our good God, He will not make His mercy afar off, but will now \"with the temptation make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.\"[fn-58-P5806_1822584:6-nf] Salute all the brethren in Christ in any name.","title":"Letter CCLVI.","author":"St. Basil"}]
