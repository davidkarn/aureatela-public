{"verses":["In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that the word of\nthe Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred\nup the spirit of Cyrus king of the Persians:  and he made a proclamation\nthroughout all his kingdom, and in writing also, saying:","Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians:  The Lord the God of heaven\nhath given to me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he hath charged me\nto build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judea.","Who is there among you of all his people?  His God be with him.  Let\nhim go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judea, and build the house of the\nLord the God of Israel:  he is the God that is in Jerusalem.","And let all the rest in all places wheresoever they dwell, help\nhim every man from his place, with silver and gold, and goods, and\ncattle, besides that which they offer freely to the temple of God,\nwhich is in Jerusalem.","Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Juda and Benjamin, and\nthe priests, and Levites, and every one whose spirit God had raised up,\nto go up to build the temple of the Lord, which was in Jerusalem.","And all they that were round about, helped their hands with\nvessels of silver, and gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with\nfurniture, besides what they had offered on their own accord.","And king Cyrus brought forth vessels of the temple of the Lord,\nwhich Nabuchodonosor had taken from Jerusalem, and had put them in the\ntemple of his god.","Now Cyrus king of Persia brought them forth by the hand of\nMithridates the son of Gazabar, and numbered them to Sassabasar the\nprince of Juda.","And this is the number of them:  thirty bowls of gold, a thousand\nbowls of silver, nine and twenty knives, thirty cups of gold,","Silver cups of a second sort, four hundred and ten:  other vessels\na thousand.","All the vessels of gold and silver, five thousand four hundred:\nall these Sassabasar brought with them that came up from the captivity\nof Babylon to Jerusalem."]}
