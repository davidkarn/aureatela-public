{"verses":["And after these things were accomplished, the princes came to me,\nsaying:  The people of Israel, and the priests and Levites have not\nseparated themselves from the people of the lands, and from their\nabominations, namely, of the Chanaanites, and the Hethites, and the\nPherezites, and the Jebusites, and the Ammonites, and the Moabites, and\nthe Egyptians, and the Amorrhites.","For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for\ntheir sons, and they have mingled the holy seed with the people of the\nlands.  And the hand of the princes and magistrates hath been first in\nthis transgression.","And when I had heard this word, I rent my mantle and my coat, and\nplucked off the hairs of my head and my beard, and I sat down mourning.","And there were assembled to me all that feared the God of Israel,\nbecause of the transgression of those that were come from the\ncaptivity, and I sat sorrowful, until the evening sacrifice.","And at the evening sacrifice I rose up from my affliction, and\nhaving rent my mantle and my garment, I fell upon my knees, and spread\nout my hands to the Lord my God,","And said:  My God I am confounded and ashamed to lift up my face to\nthee:  for our iniquities are multiplied over our heads, and our sins\nare grown up even unto heaven,","From the days of our fathers:  and we ourselves also have sinned\ngrievously unto this day, and for our iniquities we and our kings, and\nour priests have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the\nlands, and to the sword, and to captivity, and to spoil, and to\nconfusion of face, as it is at this day.","And now as a little, and for a moment has our prayer been made\nbefore the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant, and give us a pin in\nhis holy place, and that our God would enlighten our eyes, and would\ngive us a little life in our bondage.","For we are bondmen, and in our bondage our God hath not forsaken\nus, but hath extended mercy upon us before the king of the Persians, to\ngive us life, and to set up the house of our God, and to rebuild the\ndesolations thereof, and to give us a fence in Juda and Jerusalem.","And now, O our God, what shall we say after this?  for we have\nforsaken thy commandments,","Which thou hast commanded by the hand of thy servants the\nprophets, saying:  The land which you go to possess, is an unclean land,\naccording to the uncleanness of the people, and of other lands, with\ntheir abominations, who have filled it from mouth to mouth with their\nfilth.","Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, and take not\ntheir daughters for your sons, and seek not their peace, nor their\nprosperity for ever:  that you may be strengthened, and may eat the good\nthings of the land, and may have your children your heirs for ever.","And after all that is come upon us, for our most wicked deeds,\nand our great sin, seeing that thou our God hast saved us from our\niniquity, and hast given us a deliverance as at this day,","That we should not turn away, nor break thy commandments, nor\njoin in marriage with the people of these abominations.  Art thou angry\nwith us unto utter destruction, not to leave us a remnant to be saved?","O Lord God of Israel, thou art just:  for we remain yet to be\nsaved as at this day.  Behold we are before thee in our sin, for there\ncan be no standing before thee in this matter."]}
