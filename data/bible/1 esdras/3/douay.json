{"verses":["And now the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel\nwere in their cities:  and the people gathered themselves together as\none man to Jerusalem.","And Josue the son of Josedec rose up, and his brethren the\npriests, and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and his brethren, and they\nbuilt the altar of the God of Israel that they might offer holocausts\nupon it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.","And they set the altar of God upon its bases, while the people of\nthe lands round about put them in fear, and they offered upon it a\nholocaust to the Lord morning and evening.","And they kept the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and\noffered the holocaust every day orderly according to the commandment,\nthe duty of the day in its day.","And afterwards the continual holocaust, both on the new moons, and\non all the solemnities of the Lord, that were consecrated, and on all\nin which a freewill offering was made to the Lord.","From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer\nholocausts to the Lord:  but the temple of God was not yet founded.","And they gave money to hewers of stones and to masons:  and meat\nand drink, and oil to the Sidonians and Tyrians, to bring cedar trees\nfrom Libanus to the sea of Joppe, according to the orders which Cyrus\nking of the Persians had given them.","And in the second year of their coming to the temple of God in\nJerusalem, the second month, Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue\nthe son of Josedec, and the rest of their brethren the priests, and the\nLevites, and all that were come from the captivity to Jerusalem began,\nand they appointed Levites from twenty years old and upward, to hasten\nforward the work of the Lord.","Then Josue and his sons and his brethren, Cedmihel, and his sons,\nand the children of Juda, as one man, stood to hasten them that did the\nwork in the temple of God:  the sons of Henadad, and their sons, and\ntheir brethren the Levites.","And when the masons laid the foundations of the temple of the\n\nLord, the priests stood in their ornaments with trumpets:  and the\n\nLevites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise God by the hands of\n\nDavid king of Israel.\n","And they sung together hymns, and praise to the Lord:  because he\nis good, for his mercy endureth for ever towards Israel.  And all the\npeople shouted with a great shout, praising the Lord, because the\nfoundations of the temple of the Lord were laid.","But many of the priests and the Levites, and the chief of the\nfathers and the ancients that had seen the former temple; when they had\nthe foundation of this temple before their eyes, wept with a loud\nvoice:  and many shouting for joy, lifted up their voice.","So that one could not distinguish the voice of the shout of joy,\nfrom the noise of the weeping of the people:  for one with another the\npeople shouted with a loud shout, and the voice was heard afar off."]}
