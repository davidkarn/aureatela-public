{"verses":["And the Lord spoke to Josue, saying:  Speak to children of Israel\nand say to them:","Appoint cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by the hand of\nMoses:","That whosoever shall kill a person unawares may flee to them, and\nmay escape the wrath of the kinsman, who is the avenger of blood.","And when he shall flee to one of these cities:  he shall stand\nbefore the gate of the city, and shall speak to the ancients of that\ncity, such things as prove him innocent:  and so shall they receive him,\nand give him a place to dwell in.","And when the avenger of blood shall pursue him, they shall not\ndeliver him into his hands, because he slew his neighbour unawares, and\nis not proved to have been his enemy two or three days before,","And he shall dwell in that city, till he stand before judgment to\ngive an account of his fact, and till the death of the high priest, who\nshall be at that time:  then shall the manslayer return, and go into his\nown city and house from whence he fled.","And they appointed Cedes in Galilee of mount Nephtali, and Sichem\nin mount Ephraim, and Cariath-Arbe, the same is Hebron in the mountain\nof Juda.","And beyond the Jordan to the east of Jericho, they appointed\nBosor, which is upon the plain of the wilderness of the tribe of Ruben,\nand Ramoth in Galaad of the tribe of Gad, and Gaulon in Basan of the\ntribe of Manasses.","These cities were appointed for all the children of Israel, and\nfor the strangers, that dwelt among them, that whosoever had killed a\nperson unawares might flee to them, and not die by the hand of the\nkinsman, coveting to revenge the blood that was shed, until he should\nstand before the people to lay open his cause."]}
