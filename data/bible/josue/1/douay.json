{"verses":["Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of the\nLord, that the Lord spoke to Josue, the son of Nun, the minister of\nMoses, and said to him:","Moses my servant is dead:  arise, and pass over this Jordan, thou\nand thy people with thee, into the land which I will give to the\nchildren of Israel.","I will deliver to you every place that the sole of your foot shall\ntread upon, as I have said to Moses.","From the desert, and from Libanus unto the great river Euphrates,\nall the land of the Hethites, unto the great sea toward the going down\nof the sun, shall be your border.","No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life:  as I\nhave been with Moses, so will I be with thee:  I will not leave thee,\nnor forsake thee.","Take courage, and be strong:  for thou shalt divide by lot to this\npeople the land for which I swore to their fathers, that I would\ndeliver it to them.","Take courage therefore, and be very valiant:  that thou mayst\nobserve and do all the law, which Moses my servant hath commanded thee:\nturn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayst\nunderstand all things which thou dost.","Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth:  but thou shalt\nmeditate on it day and night, that thou mayst observe and do all things\nthat are written in it:  then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand\nit.","Behold I command thee, take courage, and be strong.  Fear not, and\nbe not dismayed:  because the Lord thy God is with thee in all things\nwhatsoever thou shalt go to.","And Josue commanded the princes of the people, saying:  Pass\nthrough the midst of the camp, and command the people, and say:","Prepare your victuals:  for after the third day you shall pass\nover the Jordan, and shall go in to possess the land, which the Lord\nyour God will give you.","And he said to the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe\nof Manasses:","Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded\nyou, saying:  The Lord your God hath given you rest, and all this land.","Your wives, and children; and cattle, shall remain in the land\nwhich Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan:  but pass you over\narmed before your brethren all of you that are strong of hand, and\nfight for them,","Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given you,\nand they also possess the land which the Lord your God will give them:\nand so you shall return into the land of your possession, and you shall\ndwell in it, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you beyond the\nJordan, toward the rising of the sun.","And they made answer to Josue, and said:  All that thou hast\ncommanded us, we will do:  and whither soever thou shalt send us, we\nwill go.","As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee also:  only\nbe the Lord thy God with thee, as he was with Moses.","He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all thy words, that\nthou shalt command him, let him die:  only take thou courage, and do\nmanfully."]}
